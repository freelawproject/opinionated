Appellant argues that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to standing at the inception of the action because the endorsement on the note attached to the complaint was different than the endorsements on the original note filed with the court. We agree that a genuine issue of material fact existed and therefore we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BAC Home Loans Servicing\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a complaint for mortgage foreclosure against appellant. A copy of the note attached to the complaint contained an undated endorsement in blank by Q Lending, the lender named in the note. A copy of the note attached to the amended complaint contained an undated specific endorsement by Q Lending to Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corp. as well as an undated endorsement in blank by Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellant filed an answer and affirmative defenses, raising lack of standing and pointing out the discrepancy in the endorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Carrington Mortgage Services, LLC, was substituted as party plaintiff and moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, Carrington submitted an affidavit from Bank of America's assistant vice president stating that Bank of America had physical possession of the note endorsed in blank by Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker as of May 19, 2010, the date the foreclosure action was filed. A screenshot accompanying the affidavit showed that Bank of America received the note on September 26, 2009. A second screenshot purported to show that the version of the note with two endorsements was scanned into Bank of America's system on December 18, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court granted summary judgment and entered a final judgment in favor of Carrington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Whether a party has standing to bring an action is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

The copy of the note attached to the original complaint contained an undated endorsement in blank by Q Landing. However, the copy of the note attached to the amended complaint, as well as the original note, contained an undated specific endorsement by Q Lending to Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker who, in turn, executed an endorsement in blank. Because only the holder of a note may convert a blank endorsement to a special endorsement, this suggests that Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker-and not BAC-possessed the original note at the time BAC filed the complaint and that Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker executed a special endorsement as the holder of the note after BAC filed the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 678.3041, Fla. Stat. (2016) (\"A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, the affidavit was insufficient to establish BAC's standing.\n   <em>\n    Floyd v. Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795272\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/1071/\">\n    194 So.3d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 5th DCA 2016), is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth District found that the bank's affidavit was insufficient to establish standing because it did not resolve all the material issues in the case. The affidavit in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   did not offer any explanation of why a blank endorsement appeared on the note filed at the hearing but not on the copy filed with the complaint. Therefore, a material issue remained as to when the note was endorsed and how the bank obtained standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Similarly, the affidavit in the instant case did not resolve the inconsistency between the copy of the note attached to the original complaint and the note attached to the amended complaint and filed with the court in support of summary judgment. The affidavit did not offer any explanation as to why a blank endorsement by Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corp. appeared on the note filed in support of summary judgment but a blank endorsement by Q Lending appeared on the copy of the note filed with the original complaint. Like in\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   , a material issue remained as to when the note was endorsed and how BAC obtained standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether BAC had standing when it filed the complaint. As such, we reverse the entry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Forst and Kuntz, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    BAC later merged into Bank of America, N.A.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
