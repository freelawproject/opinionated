R.S. 32:667, particularly paragraphs La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(1)(a). Plaintiff, David T. Carver, alleged these paragraphs violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following the District Court's finding that the paragraphs violated the Due Process Clauses, the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Office of Motor Vehicles (the State) directly appealed that finding to this Court. For the reasons that follow, we find that the applicable paragraphs do not violate the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. Thus, we reverse the District Court's judgment of unconstitutionality and remand the matter for proceedings consistent with this holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2009, Plaintiff was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) pursuant to La. R.S. 14:98. Plaintiff refused to submit to a chemical test for intoxication and his license was suspended for 180 days. The arrest did not result in a conviction, as Plaintiff participated in a pre-trial diversion program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff was again arrested for DWI and charged with a violation of La. R.S. 14:98. At the time of the arrest, Plaintiff again refused to submit to a chemical test for intoxication. Plaintiff later pled guilty to the DWI charge. The District Court deferred Plaintiff's sentence and placed him on one-year probation. After more than one year, the District Court dismissed the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of the arrest and refusal to take the chemical test for intoxication, the State again suspended Plaintiff's driver's license, this time for one year. Plaintiff presented the District Court dismissal to the State in an attempt to reinstate his driver's license privileges. The State denied unrestricted reinstatement based on La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3), which prohibits reinstatement of driving privileges if the person refused to submit to an approved chemical test upon a second or subsequent arrest, and upon the facts that Plaintiff was twice arrested for DWI and twice refused to submit to a chemical test for intoxication. The State then required Plaintiff to install an ignition interlock device on his vehicle as a condition to reinstatement pursuant to La. R.S. 32:667(I)(1)(a) on the basis he had refused to submit to the chemical test for intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed a written request for an administrative hearing to review the State's suspension of his driving privileges with the Division of Administration (DOA). After the hearing, the administrative law judge affirmed the State's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a petition for judicial review of the State's ruling suspending his driver's license. The petition alleged that the DOA ruling violated constitutional and statutory provisions, exceeded the DOA's authority, and constituted an arbitrary and capricious exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a motion for declaratory judgment, seeking to have La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(1)(a) declared unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the hearing, the District Court informed the parties that any constitutional challenge would be preserved until after a ruling on the merits of the case, and only if necessary. After a hearing, the District Court affirmed the administrative judge's decision to suspend Plaintiff's driving privileges, ordered Plaintiff's driver's license suspended for 730 days pursuant to La. R.S. 32:667, ordered Plaintiff was eligible for a hardship driver's license, and required Plaintiff to have an interlock ignition device for the duration of the suspension period. The District Court also declined to declare La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) unconstitutional and refused to declare La. R.S. 32:667(I)(1)(a) unconstitutional as an\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff then filed a motion for consideration of the constitutional challenge, re-urging his constitutional challenge of La. R.S. 32:667(I)(1)(a) based on the District Court's decision to defer a ruling on the issues of due process and double jeopardy until after a ruling on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 19, 2017, the District Court declared La. R.S. 32:667(I)(1)(a) unconstitutional on the ground it violated due process. On May 25, 2017, the District Court amended its judgment to hold that both\n   <em>\n    La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(1)(a)\n   </em>\n   were unconstitutional, as violating the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions, as these provisions \"mandate punitive duplicitous measures based entirely on a previous arrest, rather than on previous illegal conduct proven by any recognized burden.\" The District Court expressly declined to address the issue of whether La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(1)(a) violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State directly appealed the District Court's ruling to this Court as allowed by Article V, \u00a7 5, Paragraph D of the Louisiana Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff contended at the District Court that various aspects of La. R.S. 32:667 are unconstitutional, namely La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(a). Louisiana R.S. 32:667 provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (H). (1.) When any person's driver's license has been seized, suspended, or revoked, and the seizure, suspension, or revocation is connected to a charge or charges of violation of a criminal law, and the charge or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   charges do not result in a conviction, plea of guilty, or bond forfeiture, the person charged shall have his license immediately reinstated and shall not be required to pay any reinstatement fee if at the time for reinstatement of driver's license, it can be shown that the criminal charges have been dismissed or that there has been a permanent refusal to charge a crime by the appropriate prosecutor or there has been an acquittal. If, however, at the time for reinstatement, the licensee has pending against him criminal charges arising from the arrest which led to his suspension or revocation of driver's license, the reinstatement fee shall be collected. Upon subsequent proof of final dismissal or acquittal, other than under Article 893 or 894 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the licensee shall be entitled to a reimbursement of the reinstatement fee previously paid. In no event shall exemption from this reinstatement fee or reimbursement of a reinstatement fee affect the validity of the underlying suspension or revocation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3). Paragraph (1) of this Subsection shall not apply to a person who refuses to submit to an approved chemical test upon a second or subsequent arrest for R.S. 14:98 or 98.1, or a parish or municipal ordinance that prohibits driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. However, this Paragraph shall not apply if the second or subsequent arrest occurs more than ten years after the prior arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (I). (1)(a). Any person who has refused to submit to an approved chemical test for intoxication, after being requested to do so, for a second arrest of R.S. 14:98 or 98.1 or a parish or municipal ordinance that prohibits operating a vehicle while intoxicated and whose driver's license has been suspended in accordance with law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations stem from his plea of guilty to driving while intoxicated on\n   November 17, 2014. His charge was dismissed on January 8, 2016. He applied to have his driving privileges reinstated by the Office of Motor Vehicles. The Office of Motor Vehicles denied his reinstatement because he had a prior arrest for driving while intoxicated in 2009. Following a hearing, the District Court held that La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(l)(a) violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Questions of law, such as the proper interpretation of a statute, are reviewed by this Court under the de novo standard of review, and this Court is not required to give deference to the lower court in interpreting the constitutionality of a statute.\n   <em>\n    La.

Louisiana R.S. 32:667(A)(2) provides that an arrestee has thirty days from the date of arrest to make a written request for an administrative hearing. At this hearing, in order to prove that license suspension is appropriate, the State must prove (among other things): (1) whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe the arrestee had been driving, or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the state; (2) whether the arrestee was placed under arrest; (3) whether the arrestee was advised by the officer of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and that his driving privileges could be suspended for refusing to submit to the chemical test; and (4) whether he refused to submit to the test upon the request of the officer. La. R.S. 32:668(A). If the administrative hearing officer upholds the suspension, the arrestee then has the right to appeal the decision of the administrative hearing to a judicial court. La.

In\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   , which dealt with the refusal to give permission to secure a sample of blood by venipuncture for the performance of blood alcohol determination, this Court noted that the implied consent law provides that any person who operates a motor vehicle upon the public highways of Louisiana shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test to measure his blood alcohol content.\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5571946,11307437\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/254/362/\">\n    223 So.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given this implied consent, the legislature, again, clearly has a rational basis for penalizing the refusal of an arrestee for declining to consent to a chemical test by either charging an enhanced administrative fee for license reinstatement, or by withholding reinstatement altogether. Further, charging an administrative fee, or withholding reinstatement,\n   to those suspected of driving while intoxicated is, likewise, clearly within the police power of the state, and thus does not violate substantive due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons given, we find that La. R.S. 32:667(H)(3) and (I)(1)(a) are constitutional, and the judgment of the District Court is reversed. The matter is remanded to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   WEIMER, Justice, concurs in the result and assigns reasons.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-53\">\n   WEIMER, J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I concur in the result and write separately to point out that the district court focused on the defendant's arrest in holding the statute unconstitutional. While the arrest is a prerequisite to offering the test for alcohol consumption to one charged with driving while intoxicated, and the defendant is innocent until proven guilty, the defendant's refusal to consent to the test should be the focal point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Of course, as recognized by the majority,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   driving is a privilege and not a right.\n   <strong>\n    State v.

The state can impose reasonable requirements on a driver to exercise that privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Under the statutory provisions in question, after the arrest, the defendant is faced with a choice-to take or to refuse the test. A difficult choice is still a choice. Ultimately, the consequences imposed result from the refusal to take the test in this matter, not from the arrest itself. Therefore, the statutory provisions in question satisfy the due process requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully concur in the result in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     Carver v.
