After a trial, the Board rendered judgment granting in part and denying in part the petition, setting\n   forth the amount of tax owed by Plaintiff to Defendant and awarding Defendant interest, penalties, and attorney fees.

(Duncan) specializes in oil and gas exploration and development. It owned three active and producing wells in Calcasieu Parish during the time relevant to this matter. On March 6, 2015, the Calcasieu Parish School Board (CPSB) assessed Duncan with $59,894.44 in sales and/or use tax, interest, penalties, and audit costs covering December 2010 through December 2013 (the Taxable Period). Soon afterward, Duncan petitioned the Board for a redetermination of the assessment against it, arguing that the CPSB had improperly classified non-taxable cleaning services as taxable repair services; improperly classified non-taxable charges as taxable gross proceeds in conjunction with a lease or rental; improperly classified other non-taxable services and charges as taxable services. Trial took place in June 2015, following which the Board took the matter under advisement. The Board issued a seven-page Order With Written Reasons on July 14, 2016, denying in part and granting in part Duncan's petition for redetermination, dismissing Duncan's claim and upholding the tax assessment subject to the modifications noted therein, awarding the CPSB audit costs and all applicable interest and penalties, along with attorney fees of ten percent of the amount due. Judgment was signed on August 30, 2016, in accordance with the previously issued written reasons, providing, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   V.

The Collector states that the service provided to Taxpayer in this case, the removal of paraffin from the pipe, is a taxable repair since hydrocarbons cannot flow through\n   the pipe without the paraffin removal. The Collector argues that the cleaning in [\n   <em>\n    Intracoastal Pipe\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Pipe\n   </em>\n   was aesthetically helpful but was not functionally required. In contrast, without the paraffin removal pipe will be unusable for the purpose for which it was intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   There was very limited evidence introduced in this case due to the parties\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   '\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   stipulation that the case be tried merely on documentary evidence. The Board finds that under the record evidence of this particular case, this paraffin removal is a repair as contemplated by R.S. 47:301(14)(g) and is therefore [ ] taxable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is evident from the Board's comprehensive reasons for judgment that it had a firm grasp of the law. The arguments that Duncan makes on appeal are essentially the same as those which it made before the Board. Given the lack of evidence presented by Duncan at the trial court level, the Board's stated rationale for ruling the way that it did, and Duncan's failure to give anything other than a conclusory assertion of why the Board's ruling was erroneous, we cannot say that the Board committed manifest error in upholding the tax assessed by the CPSB with regards to the invoices for paraffin removal. Duncan's first assigned error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Rentals\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Duncan next argues that the Board erred in finding that services rendered in conjunction with rentals were taxable under La.R.S. 47:302(B). Relying on the supreme court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Pot-O-Gold Rentals, L.L.C. v.

Taxpayer contends that the exhibits represent non-taxable services in conjunction with rentals. The Collector argues that the entire amount of the invoices are gross proceeds of rentals, and that the services in connection with the rentals cannot be separated from the rentals and are therefore properly taxed as part of the rentals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   La. R.S. 47:302 B. states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"B. There is hereby levied a tax on the lease or rental ...of each item of tangible personal property...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) at the rate of... on the\n   <em>\n    gross proceeds\n   </em>\n   derived from the lease or rental of the tangible personal...\".

City of Baton Rouge\n   </em>\n   , 14-C-2154 (La. 1/16/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6891835\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/511/#p512\">\n    155 So.3d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case the \"lessee\" had the choice of three options: (1) lease the toilet with the cleaning charges; (2) lease the toilet without the cleaning charges, and (3) contract for only the cleaning services on a toilet that was not leased\n   from Pot-o-Gold. However, in the current case it was not shown that the lessee had the option to decline the services at issue and procure them from another source.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   It was not shown that these services were severable. Therefore, the \"gross proceeds\" include the items that are in dispute here, and are subject to sales tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Taxpayer objects to the taxability of certain invoices contained in Collector's exhibit H, namely Duncan exhibits 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Taxpayer claims that no sales tax is due on an invoice from Roho Valves, Ex. Duncan 8. Taxpayer claims that the invoice represents a charge for a Disassembly and Assembly. There was no\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   testimony or other clarifying evidence offered in connection with this invoice. It appears from the invoice that there was a charge for replacing or doing some work on a Christmas Tree on a well. It is the ruling of the Board that the charge of $1,800 is taxable, but the charge of $602 for mileage is non-taxable transportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Taxpayer claims that no sales tax is due on invoices from Pioneer Well, Ex. Duncan 9, because the charges are for down-hole well service for maintenance and for operated rentals. Collector contends that the services are for repair services. There was no testimony or other evidence offered in regard to sufficiently detail the nature of the transaction. The taxpayer bears the burden of proof in challenging an assessment. The invoice alone does not show the Board that the charges are for something other than taxable repair services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Taxpayer claims that no sales tax is due on an invoice from Precision Tool, Ex. Duncan 10, because the charges are to uninstall and install a pump and are not a repair. Collector contends that the services are for repair services.

Duncan 14, because the charges are for \"Filtration Services under maintained and operated rentals. Not a bare Rental.\" There was no testimony or clarifying evidence in regard to this invoice.

Duncan 15, because the charges are for \"Various charges for damaged items-indemnification-not a sale\". There was no testimony in regard to these invoices, and no clarifying evidence on how the charge came about other than its tie to the rental contracts. The Board rules that under the limited record evidence that the taxpayer has not met its burden, and these charges are taxable as part of the gross proceeds of the rental.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Taxpayer claims that no sales tax is due on an invoice from EMS USA, Ex. Duncan 16, because the charges are for \"Pipeline tie-in; assembly charges. Not taxable; immovable.\" It appears that Taxpayer contends that the charges are not taxable because they were services performed on immovable property. It appears to the Board from the context of the documents available that the services were for the original work on an immovable and are therefore not subject to tax. Taxpayer claims the isolated and occasional sale exemption should apply to the transactions referenced in Duncan 17 from Grottson Construction and Duncan 18 from Kaiser-Francis Management. Both invoices indicate that they were for the sale of tangible personal property. The invoice from Grottson Construction purports to charge both local and state sales tax. La. [sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   La. R.S. 47:301(10)(c)(ii)(bb) excludes from the definition of \"sale at retail\" an isolated or occasional sale by a person not engaged in such business. There was no evidence presented to the Board to show how these sales qualified for the provisions of R.S. 47:301(10). However, the Collector obtained independent verification that Grottson qualified as an isolated sale. The Board rules in favor of the Taxpayer on that issue, and in favor of the Collector on the Kaiser-Francis Management sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Taxpayer claims that no sales tax is due on an invoice from Champions Pipe and Supply, Ex. Duncan 19, because the charges are for \"Trucking expense\". The invoice has a separately stated charge for trucking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The Board notes that a regulation of the Secretary of the Department of Revenue that attempted to impose a tax on separately-stated transportation charges, LAC 61:4301:\n   <em>\n    Sales price (a)(1)(c)\n   </em>\n   , was declared invalid by the courts of this state in\n   <em>\n    Pensacola Construction Company v.

Therefore, the Board rules there is no sales tax due on this item.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Duncan again fails to provide this court with anything other than a non-specific and conclusory assertion of why the Board's ruling was erroneous. It is obvious from the Board's reasons that it carefully considered whether the CPSB had imposed unwarranted taxes on Duncan. The Board did not give a blanket approval of the taxes assessed against Duncan, and it found that taxes were not due in four instances. Thus, in light of the record evidence, we cannot say that the Board committed manifest error concerning the taxability of services rendered in conjunction with rentals. Duncan's second assignment of error is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Penalties, Attorney Fees, and Audit Costs\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In its final assigned error, Duncan submits that because its petition for redetermination\n   had a \"reasonable basis in law and fact,\" equity weighs against the imposition of penalties and attorney fees against it. It contends that it acted in good faith in challenging the taxes assessed against it and that the jurisprudence of this state recognizes a good-faith exception to the imposition of penalties and attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Duncan next submits that it did not file any \"grossly incorrect reports or false of fraudulent reports\" so as to subject it to application of La.R.S. 47:337.75. Finally, Duncan submits that because that statute requires an understatement of taxes in an amount of greater than \"$10,000.00 per taxable period\" and each month is a separate taxable period, the Board erroneously assessed audit costs against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Board's written reasons provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   La.
