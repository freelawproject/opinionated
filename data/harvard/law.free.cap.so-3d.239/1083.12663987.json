After review, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 21, 2012, Michael Jones rear-ended the plaintiff, Carlos Russell, while both drivers were waiting to unload their dump trucks in Belle Chasse, Louisiana. That day, Michael Jones was in the course and scope of his employment with Riley &amp; Carroll Properties (\"R &amp; C\"), which is owned by Ernest Riley. After the accident, State National Insurance Company (\"SNIC\") paid Carlos Russell a total of $8,738.52 for property damage to his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 12, 2013, plaintiff and his wife filed a claim for personal injury against Jones, R &amp; C, and their liability insurer, SNIC. On July 21, 2014, plaintiffs filed a first supplemental and amending petition to name, as a defendant, his own uninsured/under-insured motorist coverage carrier, Progressive Paloverde Insurance Company. On January 8, 2015, plaintiffs filed a second supplemental and amending petition to name Ernest Riley, the owner of the trucking company, as a defendant. On or about June 11, 2015, plaintiffs confirmed a default judgment against Michael Jones, Ernest Riley, and R &amp; C, jointly, severally, and in solido, for $154,255.72 plus interest from the date of the demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the intervening time, counsel for SNIC reported to counsel for plaintiffs that SNIC had discovered that, at the time of the accident in question, Scottsdale Insurance Company carried general liability insurance coverage for Jones, Riley, and R &amp; C. Based on this newly discovered information, plaintiffs, on March 7, 2017, sought and received leave to file a third supplemental and amending petition for damages to assert a claim against Scottsdale Insurance Company, as insurer for defendants, Jones, R &amp; C, and Riley, on the date of the accident in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 2017, Scottsdale filed a peremptory exception of prescription, arguing\n   that the claim against it had prescribed because the petition naming it was filed more than one year after the default judgment against its insureds had been confirmed. To its exception, Scottsdale attached the petition and supplemental petitions and the default judgment of June 11, 2015. The plaintiffs opposed the exception on the basis that the two liability insurers were solidarily liable for the damages caused by their insureds. To their opposition, the plaintiffs attached a \"Loss Run\" document indicating that Scottsdale insured the defendants. Finally, Scottsdale filed a reply to the plaintiffs' opposition, to which it attached its \"File Notes\" regarding the July 21, 2012 incident in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a hearing on July 26, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the trial court granted Scottsdale's exception finding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The evidence admitted to this Court with regard to this matter does contain claim notes from a Scottsdale representative or adjustor that appears to this Court to show that the plaintiff did in fact have actual knowledge as[\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Scottsdale as an insurance company within days or at least a month of the date of this accident. Furthermore, a default judgment was taken against the tortfeasor and more than a year passed between that default judgment and the filing of suit against Scottsdale in March of 2017 for an action that occurred [in] 2012. Again, the Court is going to sustain the exception of prescription based on those reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs are appealing that judgment. On appeal, plaintiffs have assigned four assignments of error: first, the trial court erred in failing to conclude that prescription was interrupted against Scottsdale because Scottsdale was solidarily liable with SNIC; second, the trial court erred in failing to conclude that plaintiffs' third amending petition related back to the original petition; third, the trial court erred in sustaining the exception of prescription based on the finding that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of Scottsdale within one year of the accident; and fourth, the trial court erred in concluding that the default judgment against some defendants more than a year before the filing of the third amending petition was a factor which mandated sustaining the exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This issue now before us is whether the plaintiffs' timely filed suit against SNIC served to interrupt prescription against Scottsdale, on the basis that the two insurance companies are solidarily liable for damages caused by their insureds. Scottsdale conversely argues that it is not solidarily liable with another insurer for the damaged caused by the insureds. For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial judge's ruling on Scottsdale's exception of prescription was premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Liberative prescription is a mode of barring actions as a result of inaction for a period of time. La. C.C. art. 3447. The fundamental purpose of prescription statutes is to afford a defendant economic and psychological security if no claim is made timely and to protect the defendant from stale claims and from the loss or non-preservation of relevant proof.\n   <em>\n    Giroir v. South Louisiana Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625158\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/475/1040/\">\n    475 So.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Delictual actions are subject to a liberative prescriptive period of one year, which commences to run from the day injury or damage is sustained. La. C.C. art. 3492. Prescription is interrupted by the filing of suit in a court of competent jurisdiction and venue. La. C.C. art. 3462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   An interruption of prescription resulting from the filing of suit continues as long as the suit is pending. LSA-C.C. art. 3463. The effect of interruption of prescription, as contrasted with suspension of prescription, is that the time that has run prior to the interruption is not counted; prescription commences to run anew from the last day of the interruption. La. C.C. art. 3466.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When prescription is interrupted against a solidary obligor, the interruption is effective against all solidary obligors and their successors. La. C.C. art. 3503. While the allegation of solidary liability is pending, the exception of prescription remains premature.\n   <em>\n    Etienne v. Nat'l Auto. Ins.
