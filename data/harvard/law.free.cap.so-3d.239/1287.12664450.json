On the same date, the Court ordered Richardson to show cause why he should not be prohibited from filing further pro se appeals, petitions, motions, or other pleadings in this Court relating to lower tribunal case F75-11762.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon consideration of Richardson's response to the order to show cause and the successive, duplicative, pro se petitions and appeals brought by Richardson, we conclude that good cause has not been shown. Richardson has engaged in the filing of meritless, frivolous, and successive claims, continuing to seek relief from this Court\n   notwithstanding prior adverse determinations on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with\n   <em>\n    State v.

We direct the Clerk of the Third District Court of Appeal to refuse to accept any such papers relating to the circuit court case number unless they have been reviewed and signed by an attorney who is a duly licensed member of The Florida Bar in good standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whipple v.

Stat. (2017).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Richardson failed to provide any response that would justify such filings; see the trial court's orders in the circuit court case entered October 13, 2017, June 24, 2016, September 24, 2015, and April 12, 2013, as well as this Court's opinions and orders in Case Nos. 3D17-2051, 3D16-2162, 3D16-1825, 3D15-1936, 3D15-530, and 3D13-2045.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
