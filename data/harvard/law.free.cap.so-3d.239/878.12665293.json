We must also decide whether Employer improperly suspended Employee's medical and indemnity benefits, and if so, whether Employee is entitled to penalties, attorney fees, and legal interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Employee alleges that she suffered injuries to her head, neck, right shoulder, right arm and hand, and back as the result of a work-related accident. Following the accident, Employer initially paid Employee indemnity and medical benefits. However, Employee's medical benefits were suspended when she refused to submit to a neuropsychological evaluation. Likewise, Employee's indemnity benefits were suspended when an independent medical examiner's report indicated that Employee had reached maximum medical improvement and Employee was able to return to work. As a result, Employee filed a disputed claim form, seeking medical and indemnity benefits, penalties, attorney fees, expenses, and legal interest. Following a hearing, the workers' compensation judge found in Employer's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Employee now appeals the workers' compensation judge's ruling. Her argument is that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to rule as to the proper amount of weekly wage and workers' compensation rate, and in failing to award penalties, attorney fees, expenses, and legal interest for the alleged improper suspension of her medical and indemnity benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Chelsea Jackson (\"Employee\") was injured in the course of scope of her employment with Aramark Healthcare Services (\"Employer\") when she fell down a small flight of steps, hit her head on the wall, and fell on her right side. At the time of her work accident, Employee was employed as a full-time pod server and runner. Her job duties included fixing orders and delivering food to patients' rooms. Employee worked six days a week, occasionally worked overtime, and due to a recent promotion and pay raise was allegedly earning $10.00 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to her work accident, Employee allegedly had no physical problems performing her job duties and did not miss any time from work for any physical injury or pain. However, Employee suffered from numerous pre-existing conditions, including a low back injury in 2005, which caused her to quit her job in 2006, a subsequent motor vehicle accident in which Employee suffered from \"whiplash\" to her neck and back, and a light stroke in 2008. In addition,\n   Employee has a history of a heart murmur, bipolar disorder, and depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following her work accident, Employee received indemnity benefits, albeit allegedly at an incorrect rate, as Employer allegedly failed to factor in Employee's recent promotion and pay raise and occasional overtime hours in calculating her average weekly wage to determine her compensation rate. In addition, Employee's medical benefits were suspended in November 2014, when she refused to submit to a neuropsychological examination. In response, Employee filed multiple motions, seeking authorization for a one-time evaluation with an orthopedic surgeon of her choice, and an order lifting the suspension of her medical benefits. Ultimately, Employee's request was granted, and the medical suspension was lifted. At that time, Employee was also ordered to attend a neuropsychological evaluation, which she did. Next, at Employer's request, Employee presented to a second orthopedic surgeon for a second medical opinion in response to that of Employee's chosen orthopedic surgeon. Finally, Employer requested the appointment of an independent medical examiner to provide a third, independent medical opinion as to the nature and extent of Employee's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Employee's indemnity benefits were suspended when the independent medical examiner's report indicated that Employee had reached maximum medical improvement and was able to return to work. At that time, Employee filed suit. Consequently, Employer filed an exception of prematurity and answer, alleging that Employee's suit was premature, that she was not disabled as a result of her work accident, and that Employee's medical and indemnity benefits were properly suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After oral arguments, the workers' compensation judge rendered judgment finding that some, but not all, of Employee's injuries were causally related to her work accident; that Employee was not disabled as of February 1, 2016; that Employee is not entitled to payment of non-emergency care for which pre-approval was not obtained; and that Employee is not entitled to penalties and attorney fees. Employee timely filed a motion for devolutive appeal. Pursuant to that motion, Employee is presently before this court alleging six assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1.

Explaining that adverse presumption, the Fourth Circuit recently noted \" '[w]hen a defendant in a civil case can by his own testimony throw light upon matters at issue, necessary to his defense and particularly within his own knowledge, and fails to go upon the witness stand, the presumption is raised and will be given effect, that the facts, as he would have them do not exist.' \" This adverse presumption is referred to as the \"uncalled witness\" rule and applies \"when 'a party has the power to produce witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction or occurrence' and fails to call such witnesses.\" Despite the advent of modern, liberal discovery rules, this rule remains vital, especially in cases, such as this one, in which a witness with peculiar knowledge of the material facts is not called to testify at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Employee subpoenaed Employer to testify concerning the hours she worked and her rate of pay during the requisite time. Inasmuch as Employer failed to produce any witness, and the testimony of Employee that she received an increase to $10.00 per hour, we hold that Employee was a full-time, hourly employee earning $10.00 per hour, plus overtime. Therefore, pursuant to statute, her compensation is determined by taking sixty-six and two thirds\n   percent (66 2/3%) of her average weekly wage from the average actual hours worked in the four full weeks preceding the accident, or forty hours, whichever is greater. Accordingly, we use the following computation to determine her compensation rate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. April 5, 2014 to April 11, 2014 = 40 regular hours; 3.12 overtime\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   2.

April 26, 2014 to May 2, 2014 = 40 regular hours; 1.42 overtime\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Using these figures, Employee's average weekly wage is calculated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Total regular hours/four full weeks = 160 \u00f7 4 = 40 hours per week\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Regular pay: 40 hours \u00d7 $10.00 = $400.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Total overtime hours/four full weeks = 6.82 \u00f7 4 = 1.72 hours per week\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Overtime pay: 1.72 hours \u00d7 $15.00 = $25.65\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   $400.00 + $25.65 = $425.65 average weekly wage\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   $425.65 \u00d7 66 2/3% = $283.77 workers' compensation rate\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We note that the final judgment fails to address the issue of La.R.S. 23:1021(13)(a)(i) calculation of Employee's weekly compensation rate, although Employee's attorney indicated that it was an issue for trial.

The workers' compensation judge's failure to address the issue of the Employee's correct compensation rate in the final written judgment is, therefore, considered a denial of Employee's request for the difference in what she should have been paid versus what she was paid. The record supports a finding, however, that Employer failed to properly calculate Employee's average weekly wage and to properly pay Employee's workers' compensation rate. Accordingly, we reverse the Office of Workers' Compensation judgment on this issue, as Employee's workers' compensation rate is $283.77 per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In her second assignment of error, Employee contends that the workers' compensation judge committed legal error in failing to award any indemnity benefits when Employee had a compensable work accident and was disabled after her accident.

During her last tenure with Employer-the period in which she was injured-Employee worked as a pod server and runner at Lafayette General Medical Center, where her job duties included pushing and/or pulling four foot and six foot carts filled with food trays to deliver them to patients' rooms. Her work was fast-paced, and she did a lot of standing, bending, and walking. However, Employee suffered from numerous pre-existing conditions, including a lower back injury in 2005, which caused her to quit her job in 2006, a subsequent motor vehicle accident in which Employee suffered from \"whiplash\" to her neck and back, and a light stroke in 2008.

McManus, M.D. (\"Dr. McManus\"), to whom she reported injuries to her neck and shoulder. Employee was discharged with a diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome, in combination with an underlying psychiatric disorder. Upon discharge, Employee was advised to follow-up with a neurologist of her choice, and psychiatrist Scott Mayers.

She also complained of bruising on both thighs, pain in\n   her shoulders and low back, vision difficulty, and headaches. Dr. Karim diagnosed Employee with a concussion, chronic headaches, neck pain, right arm pain and numbness, insomnia, dizziness, and short-term memory loss. He prescribed Topamax 25 mg., and Mobic at that time, and recommended an electroencephalogram (\"EEG\"). Dr. Karim also made a notation to consider an electromyography (\"EMG\") and a Nerve Conduction Study (\"NCS\") for her alleged right arm pain, and a neuropsychiatric evaluation. The EEG was abnormal due to the presence of two episodes of intermittent slowing, which is a non-specific sign, but can be found in intericatal event. Next, Dr. Karim recommended a magnetic resonance image (\"MRI\") of the cervical spine, which was performed at Laborde Diagnostics. That test result was negative for herniations, protrusions or disc bulges, with the exception of a minimal central tissue disc bulge at C3-4.

After examining Employee and reviewing her medical records, Dr. Domingue opined that it is likely that Employee has right shoulder pathology and recommended that she consult with an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation. Dr. Domingue further opined that his neurological examination contained so many inconsistencies and suggestions of exaggeration that it was difficult to discern which of Employee's responses were real, and, as such, recommended a neuropsychological battery examination on November 18, 2014, with neuropsychologist, Dr. Lynn Aurich; however, Employee refused to attend. As a result, Employer suspended Employee's medical benefits. At that time, Employee filed motions seeking authorization to treat with an orthopedic surgeon of her choice. The motions were set for hearing on January 13, 2015, at which time Employee was awarded a one-time evaluation with John Sledge, III, M.D. In addition, Employee was compelled to attend a neuropsychiatric evaluation, and Employer was compelled to lift the suspension of Employee's medical benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Angela Traylor, M.D. (Psychiatrist)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On February 7, 2015, Employee presented to psychiatrist Angela Traylor (\"Dr. Traylor\") with complaints of \"mood instability\".

In his reports dated February 25, 2015, April 8, 2015, and October 7, 2015, as well as in his correspondence dated November 11, 2015, Dr. Sledge noted that Employee is unable to work pending treatment. In his deposition taken on January 8, 2016, Dr. Sledge testified that without having a Functional Capacity Evaluation (\"FCE\"), any release of Employee would be light-duty, and would be on a trial basis. In that correspondence, Dr. Sledge also noted that he would want to see a job description of any jobs offered to review prior to his approval of Employee to do the job. Dr. Sledge\n   also indicated that he would have restrictions from overhead activities, limiting bending, twisting, rotational activities, and that Employee would need to be able to sit or stand as well. No functional capacity evaluation (\"FCE\") was ever performed, no job or vocational rehabilitation was ever offered to Employee in accordance with the restrictions of Dr. Sledge, and Dr. Sledge never approved Employee for any jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Douglas A.

Dr. Bernard also opined that Employee had reached maximum medical improvement. Dr. Bernard further opined that Employee had mental issues that needed to be evaluated, and recommended that she undergo a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation. Furthermore, Dr. Bernard agreed with Dr. Domingue, that there were obvious signs of exaggeration and symptom magnification with regards to Employee's complaints of right arm/shoulder, neck, and lower back pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    John Budden, M.D.-Independent Medical Examiner\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On August 26, 2015, Employee presented to John R. Budden, M.D. (\"Dr. Budden\") for a court ordered independent medical examination (\"IME\"). Dr. Budden issued a report stating that Employee had reached maximum medical improvement and was able to return to work. Dr. Budden later testified that there was no indication of any diagnostic testing or treatment needed, and he alluded to Employee's pre-existing psychological condition(s) as an explanation for Employee's ongoing complaints of pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the instant case, our review of the record reveals that at the time of trial, Employee had been in the workers' compensation system for nearly two years, and according to her testimony, which was contrary to the objective medical findings, she remained unable to return to work due to her injuries. During the course of her treatment, both Dr. Karim and Dr. Sledge had taken Employee off of work. And although Dr. Domingue opined that Employee should not work pending the results of a neuropsychological evaluation, he also opined that it was hard to determine whether Employee was exaggerating her symptoms. Contrary to those medical opinions, Dr. Bernard and Dr. Budden found that Employee was able to work. Significantly, Dr. Domingue, Dr. Bernard, Dr. Traylor, and Dr. Budden all concluded that Employee had an underlying psychiatric disorder. Moreover, Dr. Bernard and Dr. Budden concluded that Employee's alleged inability to work was likely due to her pre-existing psychological condition, and not her physical injuries. Applying the legal presumption and giving greater weight to Employee's treating physicians over the IME physician, any disability Employee might have had was likely due to her pre-existing psychological condition, and not her physical injuries. Accordingly, the workers' compensation judge did not err in failing to award indemnity benefits, as Employee's indemnity benefits were properly terminated when the IME report indicated that she had reached maximum medical improvement and was able to return to work, the Employee failed to prove that she is disabled due to her work-related injuries, and the objective medical findings confirmed the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER THREE\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In her third assignment of error, Employee contends that the workers' compensation judge erred in concluding that\n   her right arm and low back complaints are not causally related to her work accident, and in not addressing her right shoulder and hand injury.

We find merit to Ms. Jackson's first assignment of error that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to make a finding as to Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and correct workers' compensation rate, as Aramark failed to properly calculate Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and failed to properly pay her the correct workers' compensation rate. Accordingly, we reverse the Office of Workers' Compensation judgment on this issue, as Employee is entitled to the payment of benefits at the correct workers' compensation benefits rate. We do not find merit to Ms. Jackson's second assignment of error, that the worker's compensation judge erred in failing to award indemnity benefits, as Ms. Jackson's indemnity benefits were suspended when a court appointed IME issued a report that indicated that she had reached maximum medical improvement and was able to return to work, and Ms. Jackson's continued subjective complaints of pain are contrary to the objective medical findings. We do not find merit to Ms. Jackson's third assignment of error, that the workers' compensation judge erred in finding that her right arm and low back complaints are not causally related to her work accident of May 5, 2014, and in not addressing her right shoulder and hand injury, as Ms. Jackson had a multitude of pre-existing injuries, was reasonably deemed not to be credible at trial, and her continued subjective complaints of pain are contrary to the objective medical findings. We do not find merit to Ms. Jackson's fourth assignment of error, that the workers' compensation judge erred in allowing into evidence and in relying upon the IME report of Dr. Budden, as workers' compensation judges are not strictly bound by the technical rules of evidence and have the discretion to determine the admissibility of the evidence in a workers' compensation proceeding, the evidence was relevant, and all relevant evidence is admissible. We do not find merit to Ms. Jackson's fifth assignment of error, that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to award penalties, attorney fees, and expenses relative to the suspension of Ms. Jackson's medical benefits, as those benefits were properly suspended when Ms. Jackson failed to present for a neuropsychological examination. Further, Ms. Jackson's indemnity benefits were properly suspended when the IME report indicated that she had reached maximum medical improvement and was able to return to work. Moreover, we do not find that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to award penalties, attorney fees, and expenses relative to the alleged improper payment of Ms. Jackson's medicals and the alleged underpayment of mileage, as the record does not support a finding that outstanding medicals and mileage are owed. However, we find that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to award penalties and attorney fees for Aramark's failure to properly calculate Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and to properly pay her workers' compensation\n   rate when it was within Aramark's control to do so. Accordingly, we render an award of penalties in the sum of $2,000.00, for Aramark's failure to properly calculate Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and to properly pay her correct workers' compensation rate. We render an award of attorney fees in sum of $6,000.00, as Ms. Jackson's attorney expended time arguing this matter at trial and in preparing a brief for this appeal. We find merit to Ms. Jackson's sixth assignment of error that the workers' compensation judge erred in failing to award legal interest relative only to Aramark's failure to properly calculate Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and to properly pay her workers' compensation rate when it was within its control to do so. Accordingly, we render an award of legal interest for Aramark's failure to properly calculate Ms. Jackson's average weekly wage and to properly pay her workers' compensation rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Costs of these proceedings are assessed to Aramark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART; AND RENDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
