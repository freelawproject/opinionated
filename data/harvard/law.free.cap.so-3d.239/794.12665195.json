While the trial court orally stated that it found M.C. to have violated his probation by committing criminal mischief, no written order of revocation appears in the record. Based on the State's proper confession of error, we remand to the trial court to enter a written order of revocation noting the specific conditions of probation that M.C. violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.
