Bagley's touchstone of materiality is a reasonable probability of a different result, and the adjective is important. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the Government's evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial. Bagley,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p682\">\n    473 U.S., at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p682\">\n    105 S.Ct., at 3381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The second aspect of Bagley materiality bearing emphasis here is that it is not a sufficiency of evidence test. A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict. The possibility of an acquittal on a criminal charge does not imply an insufficient evidentiary basis to convict. One does not show a Brady violation by demonstrating that some of the inculpatory evidence should have been excluded, but by showing that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After reviewing the evidence, hearing argument, and testimony, the defendant's Brady claims do not show that there would have been a reasonable probability of a different result. As such, the trial verdict in this case stands with confidence. The defendant's Post-Conviction Relief Application is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, this ____ day of _________, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Judge Darryl A.
