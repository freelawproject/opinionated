The defendant appeals from his convictions, asserting that (1) the trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to give a special jury instruction on the credibility of a child witness; (2) the judge erroneously admitted in evidence the testimony of a fresh complaint witness concerning details not testified to by the-alleged victim; (3) the judge incorrectly refused to give a requested missing witness jury instruction; and (4) the judge refused to give defense counsel access to Department of Social Services records and other documents concerning the alleged victim. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the convictions, but we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>remand the case to the Superior Court to allow defense counsel to review the contested records and documents in accordance with such rules and orders as the trial judge (or another Superior Court judge) may issue for the purpose of minimizing breaches of confidentiality and the alleged victim\u2019s privacy. If such a review yields arguably significant exculpatory evidence, the defendant may move in the Superior Court for a new trial, which motion shall be heard in camera and shall otherwise be governed by the usual principles that apply to new trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The relevant evidence may be summarized as follows. The alleged victim, whom we shall call Sarah, in lieu of her real name, was a moderately retarded twenty-one year old woman at the time of the alleged crimes. She lived with her mother in Newton and had attended Newton public schools since she was four and one-half years old. Sarah was in her final year of a special needs program at Newton South High School at the time of the alleged criminal incidents. That program included both classroom work and on-the-job training. Sarah was picked up at her home in the morning by a van owned and operated by a private company. She and her classmates were taken to their morning jobs. They were brought to Newton South High School at noon, and they would be picked up again between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. and driven home. Sarah generally got home around 4 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendant, known as \u201cTed,\u201d drove the van that took Sarah home at least three times a week and occasionally drove the van in the morning. Sarah was the last passenger to be dropped off in the afternoon. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the events for which the defendant was being tried took place when Sarah was a front-seat passenger in the van and, on one occasion, in Sarah\u2019s home when no one but Sarah and the defendant were there. Defense witnesses, including the defendant, testified that Sarah never sat in the front seat of the van. There was also conflicting evidence about whether Sarah ever returned home to an empty house, and the defendant denied ever having touched Sarah or having been in her house. In addition, a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>witness, a nonretarded student who also rode in the van, testified that Sarah had told her \u201csome really weird stories,\u201d including that she had met \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and had gone flying with \u201cSuperman.\u201d In connection with these stories, according to the witness, Sarah \u201cwas serious; she really believed it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">With the aid of anatomically correct dolls, Sarah testified in some detail to having been sexually assaulted by Ted several times in the van and once in her home. She did not identify the defendant at the trial although she testified over objection that she had seen \u201cTed\u201d in the same courtroom one week earlier and it was the same \u201cTed\u201d who had assaulted her. The evidence showed that no other bus driver named Ted transported Sarah. There also was evidence that the defendant had changed his appearance before trial by cutting his hair and shaving his beard. During her testimony, Sarah named five other retarded students who were in the van when the defendant allegedly assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The prosecution introduced fresh complaint testimony by five witnesses. That testimony need not be repeated except for one statement made by Sarah\u2019s sister, Jennifer, which, the defendant argues here for the first time, was inadmissible. Jennifer testified, without objection, that, in describing the assaults, Sarah had told her that other students in the van \u201cwould tell him to stop and leave her alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">1. <em>The Defendant\u2019s Request for a \u201cChild Witness\u201d Instruction to the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The defendant requested the following jury instruction: \u201cA child is not disqualified as a witness simply by reason of his age. There is no precise age which determines the competency of a child to testify. This depends on the capacity and intelligence of the child, his understanding of the difference between truth and falsehood, his appreciation of the duty to tell the truth, and in a general way, belief that failure to tell the truth will result in punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">\u201cChildren are likely to be more susceptible than adults. Moreover, children may not have a full understanding of the serious consequences of the charges they make. Therefore, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>evaluating the testimony of a child witness, you should consider not only the child\u2019s capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood, but also his ability to appreciate the seriousness of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u201cAs with other witnesses, you are the sole judges of the credibility of a child who testifies. In weighing his testimony, you may consider a number of factors in addition to his age. These factors include his demeanor on the stand, the manner of testifying, the capacity to observe and remember facts; the ability to understand the questions asked and to answer those questions intelligently; whether the child impressed you as being a truth-telling individual; and any other facts and circumstances which impress you as significant in determining his credibility. On the basis of your consideration you may give the testimony of the child such weight as you feel it is fairly entitled to receive.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 140-141 n.2 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The defendant argues that, because there was compelling evidence that the alleged victim witness had the mental age of a child, and because, due to her cognitive limitations, her testimony was unreliable and cross-examination was difficult, and also because there were no other eyewitnesses who testified to the alleged assaults, the judge was required to give the requested instruction. We disagree. The judge advised the jury that, as the sole assessors of credibility, they could take into account the demeanor of the witness, whether the witness was trying to be candid or was attempting to \u201ccloud the issues,\u201d the accuracy of the witness\u2019s recollection, the degree of intelligence shown by the witness, the witness\u2019s motive in testifying, and the probability and reasonableness of the witness\u2019s testimony. The judge further instructed the jury that they \u201cmay also consider the intelligence of the particular witnesses who have testified and their ability or capacity to relate to you the matters to which they testify in court.\u201d In view of those instructions, and in light of the fact that Sarah\u2019s credibility as a witness \u201cwas highlighted and vigorously explored throughout the trial, and could not have failed to attract and engage the active consideration of the jury,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 125 (1985), we conclude that the judge properly exercised his discretion in declining to give the particularized instruction requested by the defendant and thereby avoiding the risk of intrusion on the jury\u2019s role as arbiter of the facts by singling out a particular witness\u2019s testimony for special scrutiny. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, supra </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">2. <em>The Fresh Complaint Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 418 (1990), when the judge admitted in evidence without objection the testimony of Sarah\u2019s sister, Jennifer, that Sarah had told her that, when the sexual molestation took place in the van, other students \u201cwould tell him tp stop and leave her alone.\u201d That testimony did not constitute fresh complaint evidence. It was not an account of a complaint by Sarah concerning the defendant\u2019s offensive sexual conduct or anything the defendant said. Rather, as an account of the reaction of third persons to the defendant\u2019s conduct, it was mere hearsay that would not have been admissible under the Commonwealth\u2019s fresh complaint rule even if, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, it did not substantially exceed the scope of Sarah\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The evidence was inadmissible. However, its admission did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and therefore the error in admitting it was not reversible. The case turned on the credibility of Sarah. Surely, evidence of her out-of-court statements that others in the van \u201cwould tell [the defendant] to stop and leave her alone,\u201d added little or nothing to Sarah\u2019s credibility with respect to her in-court account of the defendant\u2019s conduct as buttressed by the concededly admissible fresh complaint evidence. Jennifer\u2019s testimony was not \u201cused as hearsay to fill gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 670 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">3. <em>The Missing Witness Instruction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s denial of his request for a missing witness instruction in reference to the other stu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>dents who Sarah had testified were in the van during the alleged incidents, but who did not testify. \u201cWhere a party has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forward, who is friendly to, or at least not hostilely disposed toward, the party, and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case, the party would naturally offer that person as a witness. If, then, without explanation, he does not do so, the jury may, if they think reasonable in the circumstances, infer that person, had he been called, would have given testimony unfavorable to the party. . . . Because the inference, when it is made, can have a seriously adverse effect on the noncalling party \u2014 suggesting, as it does, that the party has wilfully attempted to withhold or conceal significant evidence \u2014 it should be invited only in clear cases, and with caution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schatvet, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 134 (1986). There was no evidence in this case that the other students could have been located and brought forward by the prosecution, or that, in light of their retardation, they could have been expected to give important testimony. Thus, no inference favorable to the defendant would have been permissible from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce those witnesses. Furthermore, \u201c[m]any of our decisions have indicated that, where a witness is equally available to both sides of a dispute, no inference should be drawn against either side for failing to call the witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>397 Mass. 105, 108 (1986). There was no evidence here that the students were any more available to the Commonwealth than to the defendant. On the contrary, the record shows.that, before the trial, the prosecutor furnished the names and addresses of at least four of the five students to the defendant. Finally, and conclusively, although in some circumstances a judge in his or her discretion may give a missing witness jury instruction, \u201ca party who wishes the instruction cannot require it of right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 283 (1991), citing 2 C.A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 489 (2d ed. 1982). There was no error in the judge\u2019s refusal to give a missing witness instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>4. <em>Access to the Alleged Victim\u2019s Records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Before the trial, the defendant moved that the Department of Social Services (DSS) be required to provide the defendant with all reports and records containing relevant evidence concerning Sarah and her family, including reports alleging child abuse filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7\u00a7 51A and 51B. The judge denied that motion \u201cwithout prejudice to renew at trial on a proper showing of need.\u201d The judge ordered that the requested records be subpoenaed and impounded by the court for future use if appropriate. The record does not show whether there were any DSS records or whether such records were ultimately received by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The defendant also moved that the court order the Department of Mental Health (the motion was subsequently amended to refer to the Department of Mental Retardation [DMR]) to provide defense counsel with all its records concerning Sarah, including records of psychiatric or psychological evaluations or examinations. The judge ordered that DMR records from 1985 until March 30, 1988, the date of the order, be delivered to the court \u201cfor an in camera inspection by a Judge of the Superior Court.\u201d After reviewing the three pages of records delivered pursuant to that order, the judge ruled that they were privileged and not discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Lastly, the defendant moved that the judge order the Commonwealth to provide for the purpose of discovery \u201c[a] 11 records concerning the mental condition of [Sarah], including but not limited to all [St. 1972, c.] 766 reports and evaluations, records [of] psychiatric and psychological testing, and teachers notes.\u201d The judge ordered that any records concerning Sarah kept by the Newton school department, the Charles River Workshop, Children\u2019s Hospital, and Kennedy Memorial Hospital for Children, for the period from 1985 through March 30, 1988, be delivered to the court for an in camera inspection by a judge. The judge reviewed the Newton public schools and Charles River Workshop records and released parts of them to the defendant and withheld other parts as privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>On May 1, 1991, after the trial of the instant case, this court decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867 (1991). In <em>Stockhammer, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions of rape and assault with intent to commit rape on the ground that the judge had incorrectly limited the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the complainant. <em>Id. </em>at 875-880. Also, for purposes of the anticipated retrial, we discussed the question whether the defendant would be entitled to have his counsel examine the records of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, at which the alleged victim had received treatment approximately ten months after the alleged sexual assaults, and of a Greenwich, Connecticut, social worker who had counseled the alleged victim following that hospital treatment. We concluded that \u201cunder art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, counsel for the defendant [was] entitled to review the records of the complainant\u2019s treatment at the New York Hospital and with the Greenwich, Connecticut, social worker to search for evidence of bias, prejudice, or motive to lie. On remand, the judge shall determine the circumstances under which counsel for the defendant and the Commonwealth shall review the records. The judge then shall conduct an in camera hearing concerning the admissibility of any information in the records that counsel may wish to use at trial. In his discretion, the judge also shall enter any orders that are deemed appropriate to ensure that the information contained in the records will not be disclosed beyond the defendant\u2019s need to prepare and present his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">If the <em>Stockhammer </em>principle concerning defense counsel\u2019s access to privileged records concerning an alleged victim of sexual crimes applies retroactively to the present case, two results follow: (1) defense counsel, not just the judge, must have access to the numerous records involved here to determine whether they contain information that may be useful to the defense, including evidence not just of bias, prejudice, or a motive to lie on the part of the complaining witness, but also evidence related to her mental impairment, and (2) since this is a sexual assault case in which the credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>alleged victim is critical, such review must be made available to counsel without any prior showing by the defendant of special circumstances demonstrating a particularized need for access to the communications. With respect to the latter requirement, <em>Stockhammer </em>represents a departure from the earlier rule set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 269 (1986) (\u201cBefore any in camera inspection of the privileged material can be justified, the defendant must show a legitimate need for access to the communications. It is not sufficient that, as is apt to be the case where [G. L. c. 233,] \u00a7 20J applies, the very circumstances of the communications indicate that they are likely to be relevant and material to the case. Likewise, the unavailability of the information from another source will not be sufficient to establish a legitimate need\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">We agree with the defendant that the rule announced in <em>Stockhammer, supra </em>at 884, that allows counsel to review the alleged victim\u2019s confidential records in sexual assault cases should apply retroactively to this case. \u201cRetroactive application of a rule of criminal law is indicated if (1) a case is on direct appeal or as to which time for direct appeal has not expired when the new rule is announced, and (2) the issue was preserved at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, </em>405 Mass. 634, 645 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>391 Mass. 511, 515 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pidge, </em>400 Mass. 350, 354 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296, 298-299 (1990), which discusses the sharp distinction made by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 322-323 (1987), between the retroactive application of new criminal rules to cases either on direct review or in which the conviction was not yet final, and cases on collateral review. In <em>Bray, supra </em>at 299, the court quoted the Supreme Court in <em>Griffith, supra </em>at 323, saying \u201c \u2018selective application of new rules,\u2019 the <em>[Griffith] </em>Court concluded, \u2018violates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same.\u2019 \u201d Because this case was on direct appeal at the time the <em>Stockhammer </em>decision was issued and the record indicates that this issue was preserved at trial, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the rule announced in <em>Stockhammer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We also agree that, where one of the charges is indecent assault and battery on a mentally retarded person, defense counsel must be entitled to review the records concerning the complaining witness\u2019s condition of retardation, to possibly cast doubt on the charge itself. Moreover, where the complaining witness is suffering from mental impairment, defense counsel must also be allowed to search the records for evidence of how that impairment might affect her capacity to perceive, remember and articulate the alleged events. This, type of evidence, like evidence of bias, prejudice, or a motive to lie, can be used to impeach the credibility of the complaining witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 369 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Our discussion concerning access to records applies to those records, and parts of records, that are privileged pursuant to the psychotherapist-patient privilege provided in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1990 ed.), the social worker-client privilege under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135A (1990 ed.), the special education records privilege under G. L. c. 71B, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.), and the privilege with respect to DMR records provided by G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 17 (1990 ed.). In addition to being entitled to review Sarah\u2019s confidential records under the <em>Stockhammer </em>rule, the defendant is entitled to access to reports and records generated by DSS when conducting investigations under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (1990 ed.), for another reason. Those records and reports are subject to an exception to the social worker-client privilege contained in c. 112, \u00a7 135A <em>if) </em>(the privilege applies except \u201cwhere the social worker has acquired the information while conducting an investigation pursuant to section fifty-one B of chapter one hundred and nineteen\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>404 Mass. 339, 341 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We affirm the convictions. However,.we remand this case to the Superior Court where, subject to appropriate orders to ensure that there is no unnecessary disclosure of confidential information, defense counsel and the prosecutor may review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the various records at issue here. After such a review, the defendant may seek a new trial in the usual manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
