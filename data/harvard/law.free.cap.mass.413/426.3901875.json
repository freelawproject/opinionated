L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1990 ed.), the defendant, Stanley Byfield, filed a motion to suppress evidence seized during the execution of a search warrant. The defendant argued that the affidavit filed in support of the application for the warrant did not establish probable cause and, thus, that the search violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the Federal Constitution and under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion on November 16, 1989.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 10, 1990, following trial, the defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of cocaine. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34 (1990 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appealed from his conviction, challenging the judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The Appeals Court agreed that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant did not furnish probable cause, and it reversed the judgment. 32 Mass. App. Ct. 912 (1992). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 12, 1989, a clerk-magistrate of the Dorchester District Court issued a search warrant in response to an application filed by Detective Donald S. Gosselin of the Boston police department\u2019s drug control unit. In an affidavit accompanying the application, Detective Gosselin stated that he had received a tip from a confidential informant who had provided information in the past leading to the arrest of three individuals and to the arrest and conviction of a fourth individual, all on drug-related charges. According to the affidavit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the informant and a friend had visited the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>floor apartment at 19 Dakota Street in the Dorchester section of Boston within the previous four days and were greeted at the door by a woman. Once inside the apartment, the friend asked the woman for a \u201cforty\u201d and gave her $40. The woman went into another room momentarily and returned with a paper packet, which she gave to the friend. The affidavit did not indicate whether the informant was aware of the contents of the packet. The informant and the friend then left the apartment. Detective Gosselin further stated in his affidavit that he had made observations of the building and that he had seen several young males entering the building, staying a moment, exiting the building, and leaving the area. The magistrate issued a search warrant for cocaine and related paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">2. <em>Probable cause. </em>Both art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights and the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution require a magistrate to determine that probable cause exists before issuing a search warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the more stringent standards of art. 14, an application for a search warrant that relies on information provided by a confidential informant must, as an initial matter, comply with the principles developed in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), in order to establish probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cUnder the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, if an affidavit is based on information from an unknown informant, the magistrate must \u2018be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), arid (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable\u201d (the veracity test). ... If the informant\u2019s tip does not satisfy each aspect of [this] test, other allegations in the affidavit that corroborate the information could support a finding of probable cause. . . .\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 374-375.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Detective Gosselin\u2019s affidavit satisfied the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. The informant provided information that the purchase and sale of a \u201cforty\u201d \u2014 that is, the exchange of $40 for a paper packet \u2014 took place at the apartment in question. Because the basis of this knowledge was personal observation by the informant, the first prong of the test was satisfied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 300 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65, 70 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Despite its use of the unexplained term \u201cforty\u201d and its failure to refer explicitly to cocaine, Detective Gosselin\u2019s affidavit did furnish the clerk-magistrate with probable cause to conclude that the term referred to contraband. We have held repeatedly that a magistrate should rely on \u201c[reasonable inferences and common knowledge ... in determining probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>cause.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alessio, </em>377 Mass. 76, 82 (1979).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the case before us, it was only realistic for the magistrate to conclude that the transaction witnessed by the informant involved illegal drugs. The common parlance of the drug trade (i.e., a \u201cforty\u201d is a $40 packet of contraband drugs) is within the common knowledge of the community. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labelle, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 179 (1983) (magistrate may exercise common knowledge in drawing conclusions). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reid, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 537, 538-539 (1990) ($40 may indicate drug transaction, but evidence failed to show the defendant to be a seller and not a buyer). Additionally, it is not without significance that all four prior instances of information obtained from the same informant resulted in seizure of cocaine. In these circumstances, making such a commonsense inference did not require the clerk magistrate to employ any specialized knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taglieri, </em>378 Mass. 196, 198-199, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 937 (1979) (affiant must explain inferences that do not follow from common sense; \u201cissuance of a warrant. . . should not turn on who the magistrate is or how much special knowledge he may have\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the Appeals Court that the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tion witnessed by the informant was susceptible of other interpretations, 32 Mass. App. Ct. at 913, but we note that the affidavit must only establish probable cause, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Truax, </em>397 Mass. 174, 178 (1986), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Detective Gosselin\u2019s affidavit further stated that the informant previously had furnished information leading to the arrest and conviction of a. named individual for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. This statement satisfied the veracity prong of the test. See <em>Montanez, supra. </em>The affidavit also indicated that the informant had provided information leading to the arrest of three named individuals for possession of cocaine and marihuana, and that \u201c[s]eized in these arrests were a quantity of cocaine and marijuana.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez-Baez, </em>410 Mass. 43, 46 (1991) (informant\u2019s veracity established when tip led to seizure of contraband). We conclude that Detective Gosselin\u2019s affidavit furnished the magistrate with probable cause to issue a search warrant for the apartment in question. The search satisfied the requirements of art. 14, and thus also of the Fourth Amendment. We affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-5\"> The defendant also argued that the police failed to \u201cknock and announce\u201d their identity prior to entering the apartment to be searched under the warrant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goggin, </em>412 Mass. 200 (1992). The motion judge found to the contrary, and the defendant does not pursue the point on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\"> On January 11, 1990, the defendant was sentenced to a one-year term, suspended, at the Suffolk County house of correction, and to two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> The affidavit reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">\u201c \u2018IT\u2019 [the informant] now directs my attention to 19 Dakota St., Dorchester MA, which \u2018IT\u2019 describes as a light green, wooden, multiple-apartment structure on the corner of Claiborne St. \u2018IT\u2019 tells me that within the past four days that \u2018IT\u2019 and a friend went to the first floor apartment of this address and were greeted at the door by a West Indian black female. (\u2018IT\u2019 further describes this B/F as dark-skinned, 5\u20192, 130 lbs., with short, straightened black hair). Once allowed inside the apartment, the friend asked for a \u2018forty\u2019 and gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the female forty dollars in currency. The female went into another room for a moment and returned with a paper packet, which she handed to the friend. \u2018IT\u2019 and the friend left the apartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\"> Article 14 provides: \u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure; and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities prescribed by the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u201cWe have equated the word \u2018cause\u2019 in art. 14 with the words \u2018probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 370 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">The Fourth Amendment provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983), the Supreme Court rejected the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test for \u201cprobable cause determinations\u201d under the Fourth Amendment and instead adopted a less stringent \u201ctotality-of-the-circumstances\u201d approach. Thus, \u201cart. 14 provides more substantive protection to criminal defendants than does the Fourth Amendment in the determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>Upton, supra </em>at 373 (unknown informant\u2019s reliability). We review the contested search in light of the more stringent standards of art. 14, with the understanding that, if these standards are met, so too are those of the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>405 Mass. 316, 322 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\"> We adopt a commonsense approach in reviewing searches under the Fourth Amendment as well as under art. 14. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, supra </em>at 238 (\u201cThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\"> We note that the affidavit in this case is not a model for the future. Certainly it would have been preferable had the affiant stated that, based on his experience, he was making the inference that a \u201cforty\u201d referred to a quantity of cocaine. We reiterate that, \u201cif a seemingly minor fact has particular significance to an expert, not apparent from common knowledge and experience, because of the method by which criminal operations are conducted, the affidavit should disclose its significance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taglieri, </em>378 Mass. 196, 199, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 937 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In addition, the affiant\u2019s observation of several young men visiting the building for short periods of time did not contribute to a finding of probable cause. There was no evidence that these individuals visited the particular apartment for which the search warrant was issued. While the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>was true in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65, 71 &amp; n.4 (1988), the visitors in that case were known drug users. No such allegation appeared in Detective Gosselin\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
