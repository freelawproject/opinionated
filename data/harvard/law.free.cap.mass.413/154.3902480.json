The Commonwealth sought leave to appeal from a single justice of this court. The single justice concluded that the order of the Superior Court judge was the equivalent of the allowance of a motion to suppress and, hence, allowed the Commonwealth leave to appeal to the full court. G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1990 ed.). See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 842 (1978). We affirm the order of the judge of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ABy\">I. <em>Facts.The </em>parties do not dispute the basic facts underlying both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"ARb\">A. <em>Thomas Lanigan. </em>In January, 1989, defendant Thomas J. Lanigan, a Caucasian, was indicted for rape of a child, and indecent assault and battery upon three minors. Pursuant to a court order, the Commonwealth obtained a blood sample from Lanigan and submitted it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for DNA testing and comparison with DNA extracted from semen on the clothing of the rape complainant. Through a process known as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis (RFLP analysis),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the FBI used four genetic probes to develop \u201cprofiles\u201d of DNA from both the blood and semen samples. On the basis of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>DNA profiles, the FBI concluded that Lanigan\u2019s DNA \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA from the semen in certain areas specifically identified by the four genetic probes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 229-230 (1991) (describing the use of genetic probes to identify specific areas on the DNA molecule).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In order to determine the frequency with which Lanigan\u2019s DNA profile occurs in the general Caucasian population, the FBI compared Lanigan\u2019s alleles against allele frequency estimates it had developed from population databases of 200 and 700 Caucasians.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The FBI estimated that, when considered against the data base of 200 Caucasians, the probability was four million to one that the DNA of an individual selected at random from the general Caucasian population would \u201cmatch\u201d the DNA found on the complainant\u2019s clothing. When considered against the data base of 700 Caucasians, the probability of a random \u201cmatch\u201d dropped to 2.4 million to one.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">B. <em>Leo Breadmore, Sr., and Leo Breadmore, Jr. </em>In July, 1989, defendants Leo Breadmore, Sr., and Leo Breadmore, Jr., each were indicted for rape of a child, assault with intent to rape a child, indecent assault and battery upon a child, incest, and attempt to intimidate and threaten a witness. All of the alleged victims of the sexual offenses are granddaughters of Leo Breadmore, Sr., and nieces of Leo Breadmore, Jr. One of the alleged victims became pregnant and had a child. This alleged victim testified before the grand jury that the only individuals with whom she had intercourse prior to the birth of her child were Leo Breadmore, Sr., and Leo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Breadmore, Jr. She also testified that she had intercourse with both of the Breadmores near the time of the conception of her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The Commonwealth obtained blood samples from Leo Breadmore, Sr., Leo Breadmore, Jr., the alleged victim, and her child, all of whom are Caucasian. The blood samples were submitted to Cellmark Diagnostics laboratory (Cellmark) for RFLP analysis to determine whether the DNA of the child \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA of one of the defendants. Cellmark used five genetic probes in its RFLP analysis, developing an autorad<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for each genetic probe, as well as an autorad of a \u201ccocktail\u201d of several probes mixed together.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Autorads of the first four individual probes revealed that, according to Cellmark\u2019s \u201cmatching rules,\u201d see <em>id. </em>at 230, the DNA profiles of both Leo Breadmore, Sr., and Leo Breadmore, Jr., \u201cmatched\u201d the DNA profile of the child. These four autorads, however, provided no significant differentiation between the DNA profiles of the Breadmore defendants. Accordingly, Cellmark could not yet exclude either of them as the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The autorad of the fifth probe, referred to by Cellmark as G-3, was also inconclusive, but offered the possibility for an exclusion of Leo Breadmore, Jr.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To account for the possibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ity that the first G-3 probe had run off the gel during electrophoresis, Cellmark prepared a second G-3 autorad by using a shorter period for gel electrophoresis. On the basis of the second G-3 autorad, Cellmark excluded Leo Breadmore, Jr., as the father of the child. On the basis of all five autorads, Cellmark concluded that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Leo Breadmore, Sr., was the father of the child. At the consolidated hearing, the Commonwealth provided an expert witness who testified that, on the basis of allele frequencies estimates developed by Cellmark,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it was 2,500 times more likely that the DNA profile presented by the five autorads would occur in Leo Breadmore, Sr., if he were the father of the child than if he were not the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">C. <em>The hearing. </em>The defendants filed motions in limine to prevent the Commonwealth from introducing any evidence regarding the DNA tests. The defendants argued that DNA test evidence would be unduly prejudicial and speculative. The defendants also argued that the Commonwealth had failed to establish: (1) that the \u201cscientific community generally accepts the theory that DNA tests produce reliable results; (2) [that] techniques currently exist in DNA testing that are generally accepted by the scientific community and that are capable of producing reliable results; and (3) whether the laboratory that performed the tests used these techniques in analyzing the samples in the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The motion judge held a consolidated hearing to determine whether \u201cthe community of scientists involved generally accepts the theory or process\u201d involved in the DNA testing of the defendants. The Commonwealth presented four expert witnesses at the hearing: (1) Dr. Harold Deadman, a supervisory special agent and chemist for the FBI\u2019s DNA Analysis Unit; (2) Dr. David Housman, a molecular biologist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who conducts research regarding DNA and its role in human disease; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(3) Dr. Robin Cotton, a molecular biologist and deputy director of Cellmark\u2019s laboratory; and (4) Dr. Neil Risch, a population geneticist and professor at Yale University. The defendants presented a transcript of the testimony of Dr. Laurence Mueller, a population geneticist, given in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">After hearing the testimony of the four expert witnesses, the judge ruled that \u201cthe scientific theory underlying DNA testing is generally accepted in the scientific community and satisfies the <em>Frye </em>standard.\u201d See <em>Cumin, supra </em>at 220 (parties did not dispute that \u201cthe underlying theory and at least the general processes\u201d of DNA testing are accepted in the scientific community). See also <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923). The judge ruled, however, that the results of the particular DNA tests in the instant cases were inadmissible. The apparent basis of this ruling was the judge\u2019s finding that there was \u201cdisagreement within the scientific community regarding the validity of the [Cellmark and FBI] data base[s].\u201d Accordingly, the judge ruled that the statistical probability estimates in both cases were inadmissible. In addition, the judge found that Cellmark\u2019s conclusions as to paternity were unreliable, and thus inadmissible, because Cellmark had excluded Leo Breadmore, Jr., solely on the basis of the second G-3 probe, thereby violating an internal Cellmark procedure of excluding only on the basis of two probes.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">II. <em>Admissibility of DNA testing evidence. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, </em>we stated that \u201c[w]e have usually applied the <em>Frye </em>test in deciding whether evidence produced by scientific theory or process is admissible, that is, whether the community of scientists involved generally accepts the theory or process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. With regard to DNA testing, we stated that \u201cwe would not permit the admission of test results showing a DNA match (a positive result) without telling the jury anything about the likelihood of that match occurring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222 n.7. By way of contrast, \u201cevidence of the absence of a match (a negative result) could properly be admitted without any need for a showing of the likelihood of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>match occurring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, we shall consider the admissibility of both the DNA \u201cmatches\u201d of all of the defendants, followed by consideration of the DNA exclusion of Leo Breadmore, Jr. And, as in any case in which we consider the general acceptability of novel scientific evidence, we make our \u201cown determination without regard to the conclusions of the trial or motion judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. In reaching this determination, we \u201cmay properly consider not only the evidence in the record but also the reasoning and conclusions of other courts and the writings of experts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">A. <em>DNA \u201cmatches.\u201d </em>Because evidence regarding a DNA \u201cmatch\u201d cannot be admitted without appropriate statistical support, we must consider the general scientific acceptance at this time of the method by which Cellmark and the FBI calculate DNA profile frequencies. The statistical validity of standard DNA profile frequency estimates depends on the accuracy of the assumption that large population groups such as the Caucasian and Black populations \u201crandomly mate\u201d with regard to the alleles that are targeted by genetic probes. W. Thompson &amp; S. Ford, DNA Typing: Acceptance and Weight of the New Genetic Identification Tests, 75 Va. L. Rev. 45, 82, 85-87 (1989). In the context of RFLP analysis, random mating means that an individual does not choose his or her mate based on the presence or absence of particular alleles which might occur in a DNA profile. <em>Id. </em>In a random mating population, alleles are distributed proportionately across the population and the likelihood of receiving a particular allele is not affected by the presence or absence of other alleles.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The competing theory of population substructure, however, states that there are significant genetic subgroups within larger heterogeneous populations such as the Caucasian or Black population. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yee, </em>134 F.R.D. 161, 181-183 (N.D. Ohio 1991). These subgroups most likely occur along racial and ethnic lines and present significant pock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ets of genetic variation within the larger population group. <em>Id. </em>Population substructure, therefore, presents the possibility that using allele frequencies of larger population groups might produce an inaccurate frequency estimate for members of substructure groups. Both Cellmark and the FBI calculate allele frequencies within three large population groups only;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> both appear to proceed on the assumption that population substructure, if present at all, does not affect their frequency calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Many population geneticists have joined in the dispute over the extent of population substructure and the consequences that it might hold for the determination of allele frequencies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At the consolidated hearing, Dr. Risch testified that his research and the research of others demonstrates that, even if population substructure exists in a larger group such as the Caucasian population, it does not produce any significant deviation in the frequency of the alleles that usually are targeted by genetic probes. Doctor Risch also testified that both Cellmark and the FBI utilize certain estimation methods, known as \u201cbin\u201d procedures, that produce inherently conservative estimates of allele frequency. In opposition, the defendants presented a transcript of the testimony of Dr. Laurence Mueller given in <em>Cumin </em>that certain studies demonstrate that population substructure does exist among population groups and could have significant consequences for determining the frequencies of alleles. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, supra </em>at 225 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">This dispute has been heard in other court systems as well. For example, in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yee, supra, </em>a Federal magistrate heard more than six weeks of expert testimony regarding DNA testing, with much of the discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>centering on the debate regarding the extent and the effect of population substructure. Although the magistrate ultimately concluded that DNA test evidence should be admitted, he described his choice as \u201cthe most difficult single decision in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204. \u201cScientists of indisputable national and international repute and stature, aided and confronted by lawyers of unusual skill and understanding of the issues, took diametrically opposed views on the issue of general acceptability, and those views reflected the division of opinion on the merits of the underlying scientific disagreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206. The magistrate\u2019s report contains a particularly careful and comprehensive description of the conflicting positions that certain population geneticists have taken with regard to population substructure. <em>Id. </em>at 180-187, 204-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Most recently, the National Research Council has spoken out on the issue of population substructure. In April, 1992, the Council\u2019s Committee on DNA Technology in Forensic Science released a report entitled \u201cDNA Technology in Forensic Science.\u201d The report, which addresses all aspects of forensic DNA testing and provides specific recommendations for improvement, states that the question \u201cwhether actual populations have significant substructure for the [alleles] used for forensic typing . . . has provoked considerable debate among population geneticists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3-6. In addition, although the report states that recent studies indicate that substructure does not have a significant effect in the calculation of allele frequencies, it proceeds on the assumption that population substructure may exist. <em>Id. </em>at 3-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Commonwealth is correct that it need not demonstrate absolute unanimity in the scientific world in order to demonstrate general acceptance of Cellmark\u2019s and the FBI\u2019s processes of estimating DNA profiles. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>367 Mass. 191, 198 (1975), we stated that \u201cneither infallibility nor unanimous acceptance of the principle need be proved to justify its admission in evidence.\u201d However, the lively, and still very current, dispute described above regarding the role of population substructure constitutes something much more than a lack of unanimity. We cannot say that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>processes by which Cellmark and the FBI estimated the frequency of the defendants\u2019 DNA profiles has found \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d in the field of population genetics. Accordingly, evidence of the estimated frequencies of the defendants\u2019 DNA profiles is not admissible. Because the frequency estimates are inadmissible, evidence of a match between profiles is also inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, supra </em>at 222 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It bears noting that the National Research Council\u2019s report provides several specific recommendations for DNA testing which would, apparently, account for the possibility of any excessively large frequency estimates caused by population substructure. First, the report recommends immediate studies to sample ethnic groups directly, and to compare observed allele frequencies in order to quantify the extent of population substructure. <em>Id. </em>at 3-8 \u2014 3-10. Second, and more importantly for the purposes of the judicial system, the report recommends the use of a \u201cceiling frequency\u201d for all DNA frequency calculations. <em>Id. </em>at 3-10 \u2014 3-14. The use of a ceiling frequency, which would represent the greatest observed frequency of particular alleles within a given number of randomly selected population groups, automatically would provide for the greatest, and therefore most conservative, estimate of the frequency of a DNA profile. One of the principles behind the recommendation of a ceiling frequency is the notion that any error in calculating profile frequencies that is caused by population substructure should accrue to the benefit of the individual against whom the DNA testing is being used. <em>Id. </em>at 3-13. This principle is entirely in keeping with the hope that we expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, supra </em>at 227, that the scientific community would \u201cgenerally agree on a means of arriving at a conservative estimate of the probability of another person having the same alleles and thus resolve all uncertainties and variables in favor of the defense.\u201d The national call for considered, conservative approaches to DNA testing, such as the use of ceiling frequencies, and the absence of such an approach in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>cases, underscore the wisdom of the motion judge in excluding the test evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">B. <em>Cellmark\u2019s exclusion of Leo Breadmore, Jr. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cumin, supra, </em>we stated that in appropriate circumstances evidence of a non-match, or exclusion, could be admitted without frequency estimates. Accordingly, we must now consider whether evidence of Cellmark\u2019s exclusion of Leo Breadmore, Jr., would be admissible. The Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s finding that Cellmark\u2019s determination of paternity is unreliable is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the DNA testing process. In its brief to this court, the Commonwealth states that \u201c[t]he motion judge was flatly wrong to state that \u2018problems . . . necessitated a rerun of [the] G-3 probe,\u2019 and constituted a \u2018violation of Cellmark\u2019s internal procedure.\u2019 \u201d The Commonwealth points to expert testimony that Cellmark has a standard procedure of running the G-3 probe twice, and that the second G-3 probe was conducted not because of any \u201cproblems\u201d but in order to obtain additional information. Accordingly, the Commonwealth argues, the judge\u2019s findings that Cellmark violated its internal procedures and that the test results are unreliable are erroneous and should be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">While it may be that the expert testimony supports the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the second G-3 probe was run in order to gain additional information, and not due to any problems with the first G-3 probe, it is patently clear from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision that the Commonwealth has inaccurately paraphrased the judge\u2019s finding. The motion judge did not find that Cellmark violated any of its internal procedures regarding the running of the G-3 probe; instead, the judge specifically found that Cellmark violated its internal procedure in excluding Leo Breadmore, Jr., solely on the basis of the results of the second G-3 probe. The hearing testimony amply supports the judge\u2019s finding. The deputy director of Cellmark\u2019s laboratory, Dr. Cotton, testified that it was not only Cellmark\u2019s procedure, but the procedure of \u201cevery paternity testing laboratory I know\u201d to exclude on the basis of two probes. Dr. Cotton testified that two probes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>recommended by the American Association of Blood Banks to avoid an artificial exclusion due to gene mutation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Commonwealth, however, argues that Cellmark was justified in excluding Leo Breadmore, Jr., on the basis of one probe because \u201cthis was not a normal paternity case, but an incestual mating, where the potential fathers not only were both related to the child\u2019s mother but also were father and son, making the ability to exclude quite different than in a \u2018normal\u2019 case.\u201d We note that the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the \u201cincestual mating\u201d between one of the defendants and the alleged victim assumes the truth of the charge of incest that is sought to be proven through the DNA tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Even without regard for this reference, however, we conclude that we are not persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses testified that an exclusion in a paternity case involving relatives is \u201cmore difficult\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d than it would be in a \u201cnormal\u201d paternity case because relatives share more of the same gene types than do unrelated individuals, thereby making \u201cmatches\u201d by individual genetic probes more likely. The Commonwealth has not offered any scientific justification for allowing exclusions in these \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d cases to be judged on the basis of a less restrictive standard, one probe, than is allowed in a \u201cnormal\u201d paternity case. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Risch, testified that in a paternity case involving relatives \u201c[i]t may be difficult to distinguish between [relatives] unless you use a large number of [genetic probes]\u201d. This statement suggests that reliability in these cases is not served by making exclusion decisions on the basis of fewer, rather than more, genetic probes.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cumin, <em>supra </em>at 222 n.7, we suggested that challenges to the admissibility of DNA testing evidence \u201cshould focus on the soundness and general acceptance of the particular testing process for forensic use, and; if raised, on the proper implementation of that process in the given case.\u201d In the absence of any scientific justification for Cellmark\u2019s deviation from its two-probe exclusion standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>we agree with the motion judge\u2019s finding that the exclusion of Leo Breadmore, Jr., is unreliable and therefore inadmissible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">III. <em>Conclusion. </em>The ruling of the motion judge is affirmed.
