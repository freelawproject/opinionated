The motion judge decided that the costs of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>should be shared equally. We conclude that judgment should be entered placing the entire cost of defense on Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Mohawk discharged an employee in April, 1983, based on accusations that she had stolen money from the school. The employee sued the school committee and certain school employees, alleging slander, breach of contract, interference with contract, malicious procurement of discharge, malicious infliction of emotional distress, and denial of due process of law. Continental had issued a board of education liability insurance policy covering Mohawk. That policy provided for reimbursement of Mohawk for losses paid, including defense costs, due to certain wrongful acts committed by an insured. Aetna, in turn, had issued Mohawk a special multi-peril policy with a general liability coverage section which included a duty to defend the insured for covered claims. The Aetna liability limit was $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Aetna agreed to defend all counts alleged in the former employee\u2019s action, but, contrary to its usual practice and apparently without objection from Mohawk, did not pay Mohawk\u2019s legal expenses as they were incurred. The employee\u2019s action was settled. Continental paid $15,000; Aetna paid $5,000. Mohawk had incurred legal fees and expenses amounting to approximately $50,000. Aetna paid Mohawk one-half of its defense costs. Continental made an offer to pay only $4,000 toward those expenses. Mohawk then commenced this action against each insurer, seeking reimbursement of the remaining, unpaid costs of defense. Each insurer alleged a cross claim in this action against the other. Aetna settled with Mohawk, which assigned to Aetna its claims against Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The issue of the insurers\u2019 respective liabilities for the costs of defense was presented on cross-motions for summary judgment on an agreed record that presented only a question of law. The ultimate question presented was whether Aetna alone was liable or whether each insurer was liable in some proportionate amount for the cost of Mohawk\u2019s defense. Aetna agreed in the Superior Court that, under its policy, it had a clear duty to defend the slander count alleged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Mohawk. Aetna made no claim that its duty under its policy did not extend to the defense of all counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Continental argued that it was not obliged to pay anything toward Mohawk\u2019s defense costs, asserting that its policy required it to reimburse Mohawk only for any loss, including defense costs, that Mohawk \u201cshall become legally obligated to pay,\u201d and that there was no such legal obligation because Aetna had a duty to pay all defense costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Where there are two policies of insurance, each of which would provide complete coverage of defense costs in the absence of the other policy, the issue of liability for those costs is to be resolved by considering the provisions of the respective policies. See <em>Mission Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 492, 495-497 (1988). The motion judge concluded that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in the respective policies were mutually repugnant and allocated the burden of Mohawk\u2019s defense costs equally. Continental alone appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The provisions of each policy concerning other insurance can be reconciled readily. The Continental policy had what is known as an \u201cescape\u201d clause. It provided, as an exclusion, that Continental \u201cshall not be liable to make any payment for loss in connection with any claim against the Assureds: (1) which is insured by another valid policy\u201d (with an exception not relevant on the question before us). The Aetna policy was such \u201canother valid policy\u201d because it did not disclaim or limit its coverage if there were other insurance coverage involved. It stated that \u201c[t]he insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except [when otherwise stated].\u201d It continued: \u201cWhen this insurance is primary and the insured has other insurance which is stated to be applicable to the loss on an excess or contingent basis, the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>of the Company\u2019s liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance.\u201d The Continental coverage of defense costs was contingent on the absence of other coverage of those costs. There was other coverage, and the Aetna policy clearly pronounces that it will stand by its insured to the amount of its liability stated in its policy despite other coverage that is stated to be excess or contingent. We shall give effect to the \u201cescape\u201d clause of Continental\u2019s policy. See <em>Transamerica Ins. Group </em>v. <em>Turner Constr. Co., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 451 (1992); 8A J.A. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4910, at 458 (2d ed. 1981 &amp; 1992 Cum. Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recently was presented with a similar issue, involving Massachusetts law and policy language that is identical to that involved here. See <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Universal Ins. Co., </em>924 F.2d 370, 375-376 (1st Cir. 1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That court correctly anticipated principles that we apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In this appeal, Aetna has totally abandoned the argument that it made successfully below (the same one that we have just rejected). It no longer argues that a repugnancy between the two coinsurance clauses requires that each insurer contribute toward Mohawk\u2019s defense costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, Aetna now argues a theory that it did not press in the Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>one that repudiates its previous position. Aetna now contends that it had no duty to defend Mohawk because the complaint against Mohawk alleged no claim falling within the coverage of the Aetna policy. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). Although Aetna has not appealed, it asks us to order judgment against Continental alone for all of Mohawk\u2019s costs of defense because, Aetna now claims, Continental\u2019s policy was the only one providing coverage within the scope of the allegations of the complaint filed against Mohawk. Aetna argues that, under its new theory, all costs of defense should be placed on Continental.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">We reject Aetna\u2019s belated argument. Because Aetna has not appealed, we decline to order entry of a judgment that is more favorable to it than that entered in the Superior Court. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 43 n.5 (1977). This is not that rare case in which a court should entertain such an argument,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, as will be seen, if we did, it would make no substantive difference. Aetna\u2019s attempt to impose the entire cost of Mohawk\u2019s defense on Continental, therefore, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Aetna\u2019s new argument that, because it provided no coverage to Mohawk as to the underlying claim, it should be relieved of the burden of paying one-half of Mohawk\u2019s defense costs comes too late. We have accepted arguments that a trial judge reached the right result but for a reason different from that which the judge gave. See <em>Greeley </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>350 Mass. 549, 551 (1966) (\u201cA correct decision will be sustained even though the ground stated for it may be unsound,\u201d quoting <em>Weidman </em>v. <em>Weidman, 21A </em>Mass. 118, 125 [1931]), and cases cited. A prevailing party is, therefore, entitled to argue on appeal that the judge was right for the wrong reason, even relying on a prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ciple of law not argued below. If, however, the new argument depends on facts not established in the record, we cannot accept the new argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Aetna\u2019s contention that it covered no claim alleged against Mohawk involves the consideration of asserted facts that are not shown on the record and which Continental should have been given the opportunity in the trial court to investigate and disprove. One example to establish this point will suffice. Aetna provided coverage for slander generally but excluded any slander \u201cmade by . . . the insured with knowledge of the falsity thereof.\u201d In the underlying action, the school employee alleged that the defendants knew the statements were false when made. The allegation of knowledge of the falsity was not essential to proof of slander in the circumstances of that case because a defamatory statement intentionally made can be the basis of liability for slander without proof that the declarant knew that the statement was false. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 515-516 (1984) (employer\u2019s recklessness, short of actual knowledge of falsehood, warrants loss of conditional privilege in defamation action). Whether the insureds knew of the falsity is an important fact bearing on coverage, and it is not established on this record. Hence Aetna\u2019s argument that it covered no claim alleged in the school employee\u2019s complaint is made too late for us to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The case is remanded for entry of a judgment in favor of Continental by a declaration that Continental had no obligation in the circumstances to contribute to the costs of defense in the action brought against the Mohawk Trail Regional School District Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> Although Massachusetts law does not yet provide an answer, the weight of authority places the duty to defend all counts on an insurer which has a duty to defend at least one count of a complaint, barring a contrary agreement with the insured. See 7C J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law, and Practice \u00a7 4684.01, at 102 (rev. ed. 1979 &amp; 1991 Supp.); A. Windt, Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 4.12 (2d ed. 1988 &amp; 1992 Cum. Supp.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> Continental was involved in that case in the same status as here and the significant language of its policies there and in this case is the same. The policy of the Canadian Universal Insurance Company, which stood in that case in the same position as Aetna in this case, had language identical to the other insurance provision of the Aetna policy quoted above. See <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Universal Ins. Co., supra </em>at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">It is true that the case in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit involved the insurers\u2019 respective obligations as to amounts paid to claimants against the insured and not, as here, the costs of defense. Barring policy language (or a separate agreement) calling for different treatment, if an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause includes defense costs within \u201cother insurance,\u201d we should distribute defense costs in the same way that we would distribute the obligation to pay losses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\"> The judge\u2019s findings and rulings in this case were entered over a year before the 1991 opinion in <em>Continental Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Universal Ins. Co., supra, </em>was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> This is a rule of practice and not jurisdiction. See <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>410 Mass. 279, 287-288 (1991). Special circumstances have existed in those cases in which courts have made exceptions to the rule of practice. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>City Manager of Medford, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 615, 617-619 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
