The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the transfer violates arts. 48, 63, and 78 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A single justice reserved and reported this action to the full court on a statement of agreed facts. We conclude that the transfer was authorized by statute, and is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\"><em>Background. </em>Article 78 mandates that certain revenues, principally automotive registration fees and gasoline taxes, be expended only for specified transportation purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In FY91, $776,879,980 in revenues were subject to restrictions on expenditures imposed by art. 78. Nearly all of these art. 78 revenues were credited to the Highway Fund, one of the three principal operating funds of the Commonwealth. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ing the same fiscal year, $371,843,989 from the General Fund, another of the Commonwealth\u2019s principal operating funds, were expended for transportation-related purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In December, 1991, the comptroller determined that, as of the end of FY91, the \u201cundesignated component\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the balance of the Highway Fund reflected a surplus of $267,967,701, which included $117,329,963 allocated to a \u201csubfund\u201d known as the Infrastructure Fund. The comptroller also determined that the \u201cundesignated component\u201d of the General Fund reflected a deficit of $234,828,463 at the end of FY91. The comptroller therefore transferred the funds at issue from the Highway Fund to the General Fund to offset the deficit in the latter, pursuant to St. 1991, c. 145, \u00a7 5, the final supplemental appropriation act for FY91.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The monies comprising the General Fund and the Highway Fund are pooled together for banking and investment purposes. Expenditures charged to either fund are made from these pooled accounts without regard to the original source of cash in any particular account. The transfer of $234,828,463 from the Highway Fund to the General Fund was completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>on the books of the Commonwealth by charging that amount to the Highway Fund and crediting that amount to the General Fund. The transfer was retroactive to June 30, 1991. The transfer was not accompanied by any transfer between any of the bank or investment accounts in which Highway Fund and General Fund revenues are maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 5 violates art. 78, because it allegedly directs the transfer of money from the Highway Fund to defray expenditures made from the General Fund for purposes not permitted by art. 78.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Nothing in art. 78 addresses the transfer of money between statutory \u201cfunds,\u201d such as the General Fund and the Highway Fund, located within the treasury. Article 78 requires only that art. 78 revenues be expended for certain transportation-related purposes, and contains a broad delegation of power to the Legislature to \u201cdirect\u201d the \u201cmanner\u201d in which this goal shall be attained. As long as, in any given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>fiscal year, expenditures for art. 78 purposes at least equal revenue received from art. 78 sources, it is of no constitutional significance to and from which funds these amounts were credited and spent. In FY91 the Legislature appropriated more money for art. 78 purposes than it received from art. 78 sources; the transfer, therefore, was consistent with art. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that \u00a7 5 modified the previously enacted mass transit appropriation \u201cfund splits\u201d in the FY91 General Appropriation Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This modification, argue the plaintiffs, altered the legislative purpose, and therefore constituted an unconstitutional exercise of legislative authority on the part of the comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Assuming, without deciding, that \u00a7 .5 may be properly construed as an amendment to a prior appropriation act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[t]here is no constitutional limitation on the general power of the Legislature to amend a prior enactment making appropriations.\u201d <em>Answer of the Justices, </em>406 Mass. 1220, 1225 (1989). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>373 Mass. 911, 913-914 (1977); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>294 Mass. 616, 621-622 (1936); G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 15 (1990 ed.). Further, \u201c[t]he Legislature may delegate to a[n] ... officer the working out of the details of a policy adopted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>348 Mass. 538, 544 (1965). Here, the authority delegated to the comptroller to transfer funds is expressly limited by \u00a7 5, as well as the two statutes cited therein, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 5C.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The plaintiffs alternatively argue that, even if we were to hold that the transfer is proper because General Fund expenditures on transportation-related purposes exceed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>amount of money transferred from the Highway Fund, the transfer is nevertheless improper \u2014 at least as to the money transferred from the Infrastructure Fund. General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 20 (1990 ed.), which establishes the Infrastructure Fund, provides in part that \u201c[e]xpenditures from the Infrastructure Fund shall, subject to appropriation, be made . . . (z'z'z) for direct expenditures [on transportation purposes, excluding the MBTA] . . . and (zv) for capital projects and capital assistance funds for regional transit authorities.\u201d The transfer of money from the Infrastructure Fund was improper, argue the plaintiffs, because \u201cvirtually all of those [transportation-related] expenditures [from the General Fund] were made on the MBTA, despite the fact that [\u00a7 20] specifically excludes expenditures on the MBTA from Infrastructure Fund revenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Under \u00a7 5, the comptroller was required to calculate the \u201cundesignated component of fund balance\u201d in the operating funds, and to transfer only \u201cundesignated\u201d amounts. The parties\u2019 dispute on this issue centers around the meaning of \u201cundesignated\u201d amounts. There is no statutory or regulatory definition of the term \u201cundesignated component of fund balance.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the money in the Infrastructure Fund was not \u201cundesignated\u201d because \u00a7 20 \u201cdetails the limited and defined purposes on which \u2018special receipts\u2019 may be expended.\u201d However, the Highway Fund and the Local Aid Fund, too, receive specific revenues, to be used, subject to appropriation, for specific purposes, see G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2D (1990 ed.); G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34 (1990 ed.); yet other statutes recognize that the Highway Fund and the Local Aid Fund may contain \u201cundesignated\u201d balances that may be transferred to other funds. See G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201c[consolidated net surplus in the operating funds\u201d as \u201cthe sum of the undesignated fund balances in the General Fund, the Local Aid Fund, and the Highway Fund\u201d); G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 5C (directing transfers of amounts contributing to the \u201cconsolidated net surplus in the operating funds,\u201d including amounts \u201cfrom the Local Aid Fund\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>If the plaintiffs were correct that a fund cannot be \u201cundesignated\u201d if it receives specific revenues to be used, subject to appropriation, for specific purposes, then not only \u00a7 5, but also G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 1, and G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 5C, would be rendered partially or wholly ineffective, because the Highway Fund and the Local Aid Fund could never contain any \u201cundesignated\u201d fund balances. \u201cAn intention to enact a barren and ineffective provision is not lightly to be imputed to the Legislature.\u201d <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>Lowell Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>402 Mass. 511, 514 (1988), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neiman, </em>396 Mass. 754, 758 (1986). See <em>Ben Elfman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Home Indem. Co., </em>411 Mass. 13, 18 (1991) (\u201cConstruing a statute in a way that nullifies one of its provisions is inappropriate if there is a reasonable alternative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We agree with the comptroller\u2019s classification of money as \u201cdesignated\u201d only if it is \u201cset aside by legislative mandate and is not subject to further appropriation.\u201d Only if public monies have been specifically appropriated, as opposed to being \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d is \u201cthe decision how to spend them [removed] from the control of the Legislature,\u201d <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, ante </em>1, 6 (1992). See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 580 (1937) (where money has been specifically appropriated Legislature is \u201cpowerless to appropriate any revenue from that source to any other public use\u201d). There is nothing in the language of either \u00a7 5 or \u00a7 20 that exempts the Infrastructure Fund from the transfer provisions applicable to the Highway Fund as a whole, and \u00a7 20 expressly states that the money in the Infrastructure Fund is \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d; accordingly, it was undesignated and could be transferred to the General Fund pursuant to \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Last, the plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 5 is an unconstitutional \u201coutside section\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of an appropriation act because it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>pends \u201cgeneral legislation\u201d to a \u201cgeneral appropriation act,\u201d in violation of arts. 48 and 63. Appending \u00a7 5 to an appropriation bill improperly insulates it from referendum petition, argue the plaintiffs, because art. 48, The Referendum, Part III, \u00a7 2, expressly excludes from referendum any law \u201cthat appropriates money for the current or ordinary expenses of the commonwealth or for any of its departments, boards, commissions or institutions,\u201d and \u201ca law is not subject to referendum if any significant part relates to an excluded matter.\u201d <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Cole-Hersee Co., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 532, 535 (1988). The plaintiffs further argue that, because \u00a7 5 is a \u201cgeneral provision [ ] of law,\u201d appending it to the appropriation bill violates art. 63 because \u201c[t]he plain language, history, and purposes of [art.] 63 compel the conclusion that only appropriations, and conditions and restrictions thereon, may be included in an appropriation bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">We have declined to decide the constitutional question whether nonappropriation matters may be included in an appropriation bill where the \u201coutside section\u201d is \u201csufficiently related to the subject of the appropriation of funds.\u201d <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>407 Mass. 377, 382, 384 (1990). So, too, in this case, because \u00a7 5 relates to the appropriation of funds, we do not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges. General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 1, defines an \u201c[appropriation\u201d as an \u201cauthorization ... of the expenditure of state revenues from a specified fund.\u201d Sections 2 and 4 of art. 63 require that appropriation bills specify the \u201cmeans\u201d by which expenditures shall be \u201cdefrayed.\u201d The transfer of money from one fund to another, in order to ensure that the receiving fund will contain enough money to \u201cdefray\u201d appropriations already made from that fund, is closely related to an appropriation or \u201cdirectly concerns\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>We remand this case to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County for the entry of a declaration that the transfer was proper and constitutional.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-10\"> The plaintiffs also seek permanent injunctive relief ordering the defendants to retransfer all or part of the funds involved to the Highway Fund.

The plaintiffs, individuals and organizations who stand to benefit from increased expenditures on road and bridge construction, argue that they have been injured because the balance in the Highway Fund was significantly decreased as a result of the transfer, and, were the money to remain in the Highway Fund, it could only lawfully be spent on road, bridge or Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) items.
