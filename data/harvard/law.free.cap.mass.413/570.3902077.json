The defendant is charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. A Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>trict Court judge reported two questions to the Appeals Court before trial, and we transferred the case here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The facts presented to us do not instruct us sufficiently on the reason for asking the first question. As a general proposition, relevant evidence given by medical personnel concerning the treatment of a patient is admissible, and no question of confidentiality is raised \u201cpursuant to G.L. c. 233 s. 79.\u201d The defendant\u2019s brief explicitly acknowledges that the only question of significance before this court is the issue of the admission of the challenged portion of the hospital record.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The parties agreed to these significant facts. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on June 28, 1990, the defendant was involved in a single motor vehicle accident on West Street in Gardner. Because he was injured, the defendant was taken by ambulance to a hospital for medical treatment. The police officers who came to the accident scene concluded that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. At the hospital, on direction of a physician, \u201cas a routine medical procedure,\u201d and solely because the procedure was good medical practice, hospital personnel drew blood from the defendant. The blood serum was tested for its ethanol content, and the result recorded in the hospital record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>The Commonwealth intends to introduce the hospital record at the defendant\u2019s trial to show the results of the blood test. The defendant moved before trial that the Commonwealth be precluded from introducing the blood test results. In support of his motion, he alleged rights to confidentiality under the hospital records statute (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 [1990 ed.]), the right of privacy stated in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B (1990 ed.), and confidentiality granted by the so-called patient\u2019s bill of rights (G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 70E <em>[b], </em>[1990 ed.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The defendant grants before us that the hospital records statute expresses no right to confidentiality but argues that the admission in evidence of the blood test results will violate (1) his \u201cright against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy\u201d (G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B) and (2) his right as a patient of a hospital facility \u201cto confidentiality of all records and communications to the extent provided by law\u201d (G. L, c. 111, \u00a7 70E [6]). Neither of these statutes helps the defendant. The admission in evidence of the results of a lawfully administered blood test presents no interference with the defendant\u2019s statutorily protected privacy right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The confidentiality of hospital records provided by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 70E (b), only applies \u201cto the extent provided by law.\u201d If, as we shall conclude, the hospital records statute permits the admission of the blood test results, \u00a7 70E <em>(b) </em>provides no confidentiality for those records, and the defendant\u2019s argument based on the so-called patient\u2019s bill of rights must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The defendant argues, although only briefly, that the hospital records statute should not be read to permit the introduction of the blood test results. Section 79 of G. L. c. 233 permits the admission in evidence, in the judge\u2019s discretion, of certified hospital records \u201cso far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history\u201d with the proviso that \u201cnothing therein contained shall be admissible as evidence which has reference to the question of liability.\u201d Massachusetts opinions have assumed without discussion that the proviso\u2019s reference to \u201cliability\u201d encompasses criminal \u201cculpability.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gogan, </em>389 Mass. 255, 263 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>362 Mass. 653, 655-656 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 751-752 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lannon, </em>364 Mass. 480, 484 (1974), noting that this court has never expressly held that the liability referred to in the hospital record statute comprehended guilt of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The statute has long been construed to permit the admission of a record that relates directly and primarily to the treatment and medical history of the patient, \u201ceven though incidentally the facts recorded may have some bearing on the question of liability.\u201d <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 482-483 (1920). This construction of the statute has been called a \u201cliberal interpretation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>359 Mass. 577, 579 (1971). In application this liberal construction has permitted the admission in evidence of statements in hospital records bearing on criminal culpability that seem to relate at most only incidentally to medical treatment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 317-318 (1973) (defendant\u2019s statement to admitting clerk that he had been beaten up), <em>S.C., </em>391 Mass. 123 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concepcion, supra </em>at 654-656 (examining physician\u2019s notation \u201c? Assaulted \u2014 ? Raped\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, supra </em>at 578-580 (results of test for pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ence of sperm on alleged rape victim, performed only for purpose of court appearances).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">For more than a decade the Appeals Court has ruled proper, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, the admission of hospital records for the purpose of showing that a criminal defendant had consumed intoxicating liquor shortly before events that led to a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating. liquor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russo, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 925-926 (1991) (results of blood test conducted as part of hospital routine, showing high blood alcohol content, properly admitted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 660-661 (1987) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 698, 700-701 (1986) (results of blood test ordered by physician to assist in determining defendant\u2019s medical condition, admissible). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 751-752 (1981) (prosecutor did not err in arguing to jury that hospital record stated that defendant had strong odor of alcohol). We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s treatment of the admissibility of hospital record information purporting to show objectively a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. The legislative proviso concerning evidence relating to liability should not be read to bar the admission of relevant evidence obtained in a hospital as a result of physician-ordered tests and appearing in the hospital record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the admission of the portion of the hospital record disclosing the results of the blood test is permitted under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, in the discretion of the trial judge. We, therefore, answer \u201cno\u201d to the second reported question. We have no basis, for the reasons stated, for answering the first reported question beyond what w\u00e9 have said.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> The two questions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cWhether the admission into evidence, over the objection of the Defendant, of testimony of medical personnel concerning the medical treatment of the defendant is violative of the defendant\u2019s right to confidentiality of medical records and treatment pursuant to G.L. c. 233 s. 79?</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">\u2022 \u201cWhether the admission into evidence, over the Defendant\u2019s objection, of that portion of the defendant\u2019s hospital records regarding the results of a blood test performed upon the defendant as a routine medical measure is violative of the defendant\u2019s right to confidentiality and privacy pursuant to G.L. c. Ill s. 70E (b), and G.L. c. 214 s. IB, and G.L. c. 233 s. 79?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AEv\"> The test was \u201can ethanol analysis of the serum of the defendant\u2019s blood,\u201d resulting in a reading of 197 mg/dl (milligrams per decaliter). It seems that the test was similar to that described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 658-659 (1987). A serum test produces a reading which must be converted to the statutory blood alcohol scale. See <em>id. </em>Presumably the Commonwealth will offer expert testimony on this point at trial. We shall refer to the test as the \u201cblood test.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> The defendant\u2019s argument assumes that the right of privacy statute should be read to bar the admission in evidence in a criminal trial of a fact if its disclosure would interfere unreasonably, substantially, or seriously with the defendant\u2019s right of privacy. The parties do not discuss the point. We need not pass on it. This opinion should not be taken to have implicitly endorsed this premise of the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">We are not concerned here with the extrajudicial disclosure of communications between patient and physician which presents a different question. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 65-69, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985). Massachusetts, moreover, has no general statutory physician-patient privilege. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 522 n.22 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> These interpretations of \u00a7 79 received the apparent approval of the Legislature when, after these opinions were released, it amended \u00a7 79 (see St. 1974, c. 225) without changing the relevant language. Compare <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 240-241 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\"> In none of the Appeals Court cases just cited did the defendant argue that, if the evidence was admissible, it was not admissible to prove his culpability. Nor did any defendant argue that the judge should have given the jury a limiting instruction. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any issue other than guilt to which such evidence would be relevant. Some of our opinions in civil cases have indicated that such a limiting instruction could or should be given. See <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 531 (1978); <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>234 Mass. 480, 483 (1920). But see <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster St. Ry., </em>236 Mass. 526, 540 (1920). The question whether limiting instructions are required is not before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>because no trial has yet been held. We would not, however, impose a requirement that a limiting instruction be given to the jury at least where, as here, the information in the hospital record is an objective measure of a criminal defendant\u2019s physical condition obtained on direction of a physician and pursuant to routine hospital procedures. A trial judge does, however, have discretion to give a limiting instruction when, in the judge\u2019s view, a statement or opinion in a hospital record should not be considered on a particular factual issue. See <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 455 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
