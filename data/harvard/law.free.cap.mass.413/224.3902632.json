L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, as inserted by St. 1989, c. 227, \u00a7 2, set forth below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute, commonly known as the \u201cschool zone\u201d statute, establishes a mandatory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>term of imprisonment of not less than two years for any person who violates G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32F, or \u00a7 321, while within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary, vocational or secondary school. The statute also provides that lack of knowledge of school boundaries is not a defense in such a case and that the two-year mandatory minimum sentence be served from and after any sentence imposed for the violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32-32F, or \u00a7 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">At trial, the jury could have found the following facts. Police officers from the city of New Bedford, believing that cocaine was being distributed from a first floor apartment at 305 South Second Street, obtained a warrant to search the apartment. The officers executed the warrant (which did not require them to knock and announce themselves prior to entry) on the evening of August 24, 1989. At approximately 8:30 that evening, an undercover officer approached the rear door of the apartment. He observed a man at the doorway, who knocked on the door and asked for \u201ca half.\u201d The man slid money under the door, received a small bag containing a white substance, then departed. The undercover officer knocked on the door, and a person inside asked him what he wanted. He also requested \u201ca half,\u201d which he testified was a quantity of cocaine with a street value of approximately $40. He slid $40 under the door and shortly afterward received a small bag of cocaine later determined to weigh .73 gram. He left the building and informed his colleagues that he had made the purchase. Shortly afterward, teams of officers broke down the front and the rear doors of the apartment with battering rams. The doors had been barricaded with two-by-four pieces - of wood supported by metal brackets attached to the door frame. As the officers entered the rear door of the apartment, they saw four men running into a bedroom and followed them. Three of the men, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>defendant, resisted the police officers in the bedroom doorway, while the fourth man went into a bathroom that was located inside the bedroom. He was carrying a plastic sandwich bag which held several smaller bags containing white powder. Before the officers could reach him, he flushed the sandwich bag down the toilet. The police searched the apartment and seized .55 gram of cocaine, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of cash, including the $40 that had been used for the purchase by the undercover officer. The defendant, along with four other men inside the apartment, was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The Commonwealth alleged that the apartment was set up for selling cocaine and that the defendant was involved in the business. The defendant was charged with the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, and with violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, the school zone statute. The parties stipulated that the apartment where the drugs were seized is within 1,000 feet of a public school. A judge of the Superior Court denied the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss the \u00a7 32J charge. That motion was presented on the ground that the \u201clack of knowledge of school boundaries\u201d provision in \u00a7 32J deprived the defendant of his Federal and State constitutional rights of due process by removing guilty knowledge as an element of the offense. A jury found the defendant guilty on both charges. The defendant then moved to dismiss his conviction under \u00a7 32A for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute on the ground that crime constituted a lesser included offense of the \u00a7 32J charge. That motion was denied, and the defendant was sentenced to a term of ninety days in a house of correction on the \u00a7 32A conviction, and a two-year consecutive term on the \u00a7 32J conviction. The defendant appealed, and we allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm the convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, violates State constitutional due process provisions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence thereunder violates common law prohibitions against double jeopardy and his State constitutional right to be protected against cruel or unusual punishment. He also claims error in the instruction given by the trial judge, on consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">1. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 32J violates his due process rights as protected by articles 1, 10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights because it removes guilty knowledge as to one element of the offense, namely the school boundaries element.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant is not helped by his reference to decisions where this court, or the Appeals Court, has imposed a mens rea requirement for criminal statutes imposing serious penalties for the defendant\u2019s commission of an unlawful act alone. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234-235 &amp; n.5 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 916 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 511-512 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 157 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>393 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Mass. 132 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 363-364 (1982). In these cases, the criminal statutes at issue were silent as to whether mens rea was required for a conviction, and the appellate courts construed the statutes to require mens rea in order to avoid possible due process doubts. In so doing, however, the courts acknowledged that clear legislative language indicating that mens rea was not required for conviction could produce a different result. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, supra </em>at 511-512.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Legislature has provided such clear direction in \u00a7 32J by specifically stating that lack of knowledge of school boundaries is not to be considered an issue in any prosecution under the statute. The Legislature may permissibly do this. That body has \u201cbroad power to define and limit the mens rea element of criminal offenses,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass. 249, 264 (1990), quoting <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 103 (1982), and, consistent with that authority, may \u201ccreate strict criminal liabilities by defining criminal offenses without any element of scienter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>385 Mass. 521, 524 (1982), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U.S. 147, 150 (1959). Even in the absence of specific language such as the language that appears in \u00a7 32J, we have construed criminal statutes which authorize the imposition of serious sentences to permit conviction without proof of mens rea, acknowledging that \u201c[s]trict criminal liability is not necessarily a denial of due process of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>(statutory rape does not admit of a mistake of fact defense). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knap, </em>412 Mass. 712, 715 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 18-19 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 42 (1983); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Moriarty, </em>484 F.2d 1034 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">It is also of significance that \u00a7 32J is not totally void of any mens rea requirement. Before a conviction can be obtained thereunder the Commonwealth must prove the defendant guilty of a predicate drug-dealing offense requiring mens rea \u2014 in this case the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Section \u00a7 32J thus imposes liability only on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>someone who knows he is dealing in drugs and requires the dealer to proceed at his peril with respect to the proximity of a school. In this last feature \u00a7 32J resembles other criminal statutes which punish an underlying violation committed with mens rea and consider the offense aggravated by a fact of which the defendant may not have express knowledge. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12E (1990 ed.) (discharge of a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling; no requirement of knowledge of the distance); G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (1990 ed.) (increasing mandatory minimum terms based on the weight of controlled substances with no requirement that the defendant have knowledge of the weight of the substance or that it exceeded any specified limit). We conclude that \u00a7 32J does not violate State constitutional rights of due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2. The defendant next argues that the imposition of multiple punishments in this case violates his right not to be punished twice for the same offense. He bases his argument on the \u201csame evidence\u201d rule which states that \u201cwhere convictions are returned under two statutes, unless \u2018each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>consecutive sentences may not be imposed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 124 (1980), quoting <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871). The defendant believes that this rule expresses a right that is at least implicit in articles 1, 10 and 12 of the Declaration of Rights. Since the crimes of which the defendant stands convicted meet the \u201csame evidence\u201d test, the defendant maintains that a consecutive sentence for the \u00a7 32J conviction cannot be imposed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The \u201csame evidence\u201d rule, first expressed in the <em>Morey </em>case, is a rule of Massachusetts common law, and \u201c[o]ur determinations [applying it] have not been based on the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) or on whatever comparable principle may be found in the Constitution of the Commonwealth (there being no explicit double jeopardy clause).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>387 Mass. 291, 294 (1982). Under our common law rule, the fact that the crime described in \u00a7 32A is a lesser included offense of the crime described in \u00a7 32J does not automatically make unlawful the imposition of separate consecutive sentences on a defendant who is convicted of both crimes. As has already been noted, because the Legislature has broad power to define crimes, and to create punishments for them, it may permissibly impose consecutive punishments. See <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368 (1983) (\u201c[s] imply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct . . . does not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the imposition, in a single trial, of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes\u201d); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 381 (1989) (\u201c[Respondent's conviction of both felony murder and [the underlying felony of] attempted robbery gave rise to a double jeopardy claim only because the [State] Legislature did not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tend to allow conviction and punishment for <em>both </em>felony murder and the underlying felony\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>384 Mass. 353, 359-360 (1981) (\u201cWhether characterized as a constitutional requirement under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment . . . or as a common law rule, . . . \u2018where two statutory provisions proscribe the \u201csame offense\u201d [as defined by <em>Morey </em>and <em>Blockburger </em>(see note 6, <em>supra)] </em>they are construed not to authorize cumulative punishments in the absence of a clear indication of contrary legislative intent,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 692 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The \u201csame evidence\u201d rule is a principle of statutory construction designed to aid in the judicial interpretation of criminal statutes where the Legislature has not expressed an intent as to consecutive punishments. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, supra </em>at 360 (\u201c[T]he prohibition against duplicitous convictions limits not the legislative power to declare substantive criminal law but rather the judicial interpretation of that law\u201d). Where the Legislature has specifically authorized cumulative punishment under two statutes, even if the two statutes proscribe the same conduct under the <em>Morey </em>test, a court\u2019s job of statutory construction is terminated, and the intent of the Legislature is to be enforced. See <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 294; <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 260, 272, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 864 (1982); <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The Legislature has made it clear that two consecutive sentences must be imposed by expressly providing that the sentence imposed on the violation of \u00a7 32J must begin after the sentence imposed on the violation of the predicate crime has expired. Although the point might have been stated in other language, the Legislature\u2019s intent is not ambiguous or obscure. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments that the <em>Morey </em>test should be applied to his benefit notwithstanding the Legislature\u2019s definitive expression of intent. We also reject the defendant\u2019s arguments that we should find implicit in articles 1,10, and 12 of the Declaration of Rights a prohib\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tion against multiple punishments that strikes down the punishment explicitly called for by \u00a7 32J.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">3. The defendant also argues that \u00a7 32J, by holding him strictly liable on the school zone element, and then requiring after conviction a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence, violates the prohibition in art. 26 of the Declaration of Rights against cruel or unusual punishment. This issue was not raised below, but we choose to consider it because it involves a fundamental right, has been fully briefed, and is certain to be raised in other cases. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>393 Mass. 150, 154-157 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>410 Mass. 680, 684 (1991). We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We note again that the Legislature has considerable latitude to determine what conduct should be regarded as criminal and to prescribe penalties to vindicate the legitimate interests of society. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 610-611 (1973). <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>173 Mass. 322, 328 (1899). \u201cThe function of the legislature is primary, its exercises fortified by presumptions of right and legality, and is not to be interfered with lightly, nor by any judicial conception of their wisdom or propriety.\u201d <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 379 (1910). It is thus with restraint that we exercise our power of review to determine whether the punishment before us exceeds the constitutional limitations imposed by art. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">This court has recognized that \u201cit is possible that imprisonment in the state prison for a long term of years might be so disproportionate to the offense as to constitute a cruel or unusual punishment.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 328. Although punishment may be cruel and unusual not only in manner but also in length, \u201ca heavy burden is on the sentenced defendant to establish that the punishment is disproportionate to the offense for which he was convicted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neal, </em>369 Mass. 242, 248 (1975) (Tauro, C.J., concurring). It must be so disproportionate to the crime that it \u201cshocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d <em>In re Lynch, </em>8 Cal. 3d 410, 424 (1972). In deciding whether the punishment called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>for by \u00a7 32J violates this standard, we examine three objective considerations: (1) the nature of the offender and offense in light of the degree of harm to society; (2) sentencing provisions in other jurisdictions for similar offenses; and (3) sentences for more severe offenses within the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therriault, </em>401 Mass. 237, 240 (1987). <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 497 (1981), appeal dismissed, 455 U.S. 931 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">As to the first consideration, the Legislature could rationally conclude that the danger to the public, particularly young children and adolescents, posed by the intent to distribute or the distribution of dangerous drugs near a school is grave enough to require severe punishment. It is well recognized that traffic in narcotics creates serious social concerns and is at the root of other crimes. Drugs are especially destructive of children and young people, tending to trap them at an early age in a life of antisocial behavior, poverty, despair and crime. The enhanced penalty in \u00a7 32J serves as a deterrent to those who distribute or traffic in drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Further, the penalty called for by \u00a7 32J does not punish a status offense or a fortuitous event, because the sanction of the statute is imposed only on those who are found guilty of a predicate offense which requires an intent to distribute or distribution of drugs. Compare <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em>370 U.S. 660 (1962) (imprisonment for status of being a drug addict violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment). Also, on the point of proportionality, a sentencing judge retains discretion with respect to any intent to distribute offense which forms the predicate for a \u00a7 32J conviction (viz., the crimes stated in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32, and \u00a7\u00a7 32A through F) to fashion a fair sentence. These offenses do not carry mandatory minimum requirements. Thus, a sentencing judge who concludes that the \u201cfrom and after\u201d penalty provisions of \u00a7 32J are disproportionate to the offense before him may mitigate the impact of \u00a7 32J by sentencing the defendant to a lesser sentence or probation on the underlying offense. (Note, in this case, the defendant\u2019s sentence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>his conviction under G. L. c. 94C, 32A, to a term of ninety days.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Turning to the second consideration of the analysis, the two-year mandatory enhancement for a school zone offense is not excessive when compared to punishments regularly imposed for other narcotics offenses in the Commonwealth, some of which may be considered extreme in particular circumstances. See, e.g., G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b) (4) (fifteen-year minimum mandatory sentence for trafficking over 200 grams of cocaine); G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (d) (five-year minimum mandatory sentence for distribution of cocaine following previous drug conviction). Although one could disagree with the ultimate wisdom of a legislative decision which in some cases places a mandatory minimum sentence upon another mandatory minimum sentence, it cannot reasonably be said that the net result in terms of total years of incarceration is constitutionally disproportionate to sentences regularly imposed for more severe offenses in the Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 499 (upholding forty to fifty year sentence for possession of machine gun).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">With respect to the third consideration, the sentencing scheme of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, is proportionate to punishments imposed in other jurisdictions for a similar offense. The Federal school zone act provides for up to twice the penalty imposed for the underlying drug offense. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860 (1992) (possible forty year sentence). At least twenty-three States and territories have also enacted criminal statutes which penalize in various ways the sale or distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>controlled substances on or near school grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Many of these jurisdictions provide enhanced penalties for school zone drug offenses, either through multipliers patterned after the Federal statute or through required \u201cfrom and after\u201d sentences like the penalties imposed in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>4. The defendant\u2019s last argument concerns the judge\u2019s instruction on consciousness of guilt. It is conceded that the instruction that was given satisfied the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 585 (1982). No request was made for the supplemental instruction discussed in <em>Toney, supra </em>at 585 n.6. No objection was made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to the instruction given. It was adequately brought to the jury\u2019s attention that the defendant\u2019s conduct when the police arrived may have had an innocent basis, and that he maintained that he was only present in the apartment without any knowledge of, or intent to distribute, drugs. As the defendant\u2019s counsel put it in closing argument: \u201cthis [is] a case of [the defendant] being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d In the circumstances, the defendant has not demonstrated that the consciousness of guilt instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-13\"> \u2018Any person who violates the provisions of section thirty-two, thirty-two A, thirty-two B, thirty-two C, thirty-two D, thirty-two E, thirty-two F or thirty-two I while in or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school whether or not in session shall be punished by a term of imprisonment in the state prison for not less than two and one-half nor more than fifteen years or by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not less than two nor more than two and one-half years.

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haynes, </em>881 F.2d 586 (8th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>810 F.2d 1215 (D.C.

Articles 1,10 and 12 have always been considered as embodying due process protections at least parallel to those granted by the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 916 (1976).

See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ofarril, </em>779 F.2d 791 (2d Cir. 1985), cert, denied, 475 U.S. 1029 (1986) (to construe the Federal school zone statute as requiring a scienter element would distort the statutory language and frustrate Congress\u2019 unambiguous intent to penalize the distribution of narcotics within 1,000 feet of a school). Similar Federal decisions are cited in note 3, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>545 So. 2d 279, 281 (Fla. App. 1989) (no knowledge of location within school zone required); <em>State </em>v. <em>Willford, </em>571 N.E.2d 310, 311 (Ind. 1991) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>227 N.J. Super. 429, 435-436 (1988) (Legislature could properly eliminate mens rea from school zone statute to shield school children from the violent and dangerous narcotic criminal milieu); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>782 P.2d 497, 504-505 (Utah 1989) (aggravating element of proximity to school does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">There may be extraordinary circumstances shown in some cases which would make it unfair to find guilt under \u00a7 32J. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coates, </em>739 F. Supp. 146, 152-153 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (dismissing school zone indictment where defendant was alleged to be in possession of drugs on an underground train near a school; \u201c[t]o posit liability ... in these fortuitous circumstances is simple overreaching\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\"> The United States Supreme Court has applied the <em>Morey </em>test in construing the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> With regard to the triggering offenses under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, which themselves carry minimum mandatory penalties (trafficking, distribution to minors, and second and subsequent distribution), it can be argued with force that these constitute the most dangerous narcotics offenses which the Legislature has the greatest interest in punishing and deterring. The Legislature would be acting within its constitutional authority by simply increasing the mandatory penalties for these offenses by two years. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>378 Mass. 822, 831 (1979). As matter of logic, it follows that the Legislature permissibly can punish the commission of these offenses within a school zone with a mandatory minimum two-year sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b256-5\"> Ala.
