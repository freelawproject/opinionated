We hold that the decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) that the plaintiff is personally liable for the penalties and interest from the date of the assessment of the tax to the corporation is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">From a joint agreed statement of facts, we learn that the plaintiff was president and treasurer of M. Berenson Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>pany, Inc. (corporation), and the person responsible for paying sales taxes to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Following an audit of the corporation for the period January, 1981, to August, 1983 (inclusive), the defendant commissioner issued an assessment of a sales tax deficiency in the amount of $18,477.97, excluding penalties and interest. The assessment, including penalties and interest, amounted to $45,934.68 as of September 11, 1988. The corporation appealed and, following abatements, the amount remaining unpaid was $13,704.13, including interest and penalties, as of April 9, 1990. At the time of the filing of the agreed statement of facts in January, 1991, the corporation had been out of business for over two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">A notice of determination of personal liability was sent to Berenson on June 5, 1990. He filed an application for abatement which was denied on August 31, 1990. The plaintiff appealed from this denial. The board heard the appeal and found for the commissioner. The plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Court. We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">A logical starting point is G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 16 (1990 ed.), which imposes personal liability on the officer of a corporation whose duty it is to pay the sales taxes. There is no dispute that Berenson was such person in the corporation, and Berenson concedes that he is liable for the tax. He contests his personal liability only for the penalties and interest. However, \u00a7 16 refers to personal liability for \u201cany sums\u201d due the commissioner. Penalties and interest are sums due the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]ax\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 62C (1990 ed.), as \u201cany tax, excise, <em>interest, penalty, </em>or addition to tax\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 1. The provisions of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 31 A, specifically impose personal liability on Berenson. The regulation adopted (see G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 3) to implement \u00a7 31A expressly imposes personal liability on Berenson for interest and penalties. 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.31A.1 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Interest accrued from the date of the assessment against the corporation. This is the clear import of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 32. There is no tenable basis for Berenson\u2019s argument that interest should run from the date of the commissioner\u2019s notice of determination of personal liability because, as the board points out in its order, \u201cthe Legislature intended to treat interest, penalties, and other additions to taxes in the same manner as the taxes themselves.\u201d See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Molesworth, </em>408 Mass. 580, 582 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Lastly, Berenson argues that G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 31 A, and the accompanying regulation are being applied retroactively and, therefore, unconstitutionally. This argument cannot withstand the plain language of \u00a7 31 A. Section 31A was inserted by St. 1985, c. 593, \u00a7 17. Chapter 593 was later amended by St. 1986, c. 488, \u00a7 65, which provided that \u00a7 31A applied \u201cto all state taxes remaining unpaid on or after its effective date,\u201d December 18, 1985. Clearly, the taxes and, therefore, the interest and penalties on them remained unpaid after December 18, 1985, and remain unpaid today. Accordingly, there has been no retroactive application. The date of determination of Berenson\u2019s personal liability is hardly material.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">For all these reasons, the decision of the board is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-8\"> We do not consider a procedural due process argument that only the amicus curiae has raised.
