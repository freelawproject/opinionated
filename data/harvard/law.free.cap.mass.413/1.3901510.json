We hold that both the certification and summary comply with art. 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, governing the initiative process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\"><em>Background. </em>The petition proposes to add a new chapter to the General Laws, chapter 64K. This new chapter would impose an excise on the \u201cfirst possession\u201d of oil and hazardous material within the Commonwealth. The excise generally would be payable by the individual or entity which first acquires possession of oil or hazardous material imported into the Commonwealth for subsequent sale or use, or which manufactures oil or hazardous material in the Commonwealth. Under \u00a7 2 of c. 64K, \u201coil\u201d would be defined, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>number of exceptions, as \u201cinsoluble or partially soluble oils of any kind or origin and in any form, including, without limitation, crude or fuel oils, lube oil or sludge, asphalt, or insoluble or partially insoluble derivates of mineral oils.\u201d \u201cHazardous material\u201d would be defined, also with exceptions, as \u201cany material that is a hazardous substance or a toxic chemical, as those terms are defined in this section.\u201d \u201cHazardous substance\u201d would be defined in \u00a7 2 as \u201cany substance listed pursuant to sections 101(14) and 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), P.L. 96-510, as amended.\u201d \u201cToxic chemical\u201d would be defined as \u201ca substance which is classified as a toxic chemical pursuant to Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986, Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, P.L. 99-499, as amended.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Under \u00a7 8 of c. 64K, all of the revenue generated by the excise would be credited to the Environmental Challenge Fund and be used, subject to appropriation by the Legislature, for the purposes designated in the statute governing the fund, G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2J. That statute, as currently written, provides that \u201c[a]mounts credited to said fund shall be used, subject to appropriation, solely for the clean up, control or response actions for oil and hazardous materials, reducing the production of hazardous waste or for any other action necessary to implement sections three A and four of chapter twenty-one E.\u201d In conjunction with adding c. 64K, the petition would amend G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2J, to provide that \u201c[a]mounts credited to the Fund shall be used, subject to appropriation, solely for the following purposes: (a) response actions for releases or threats of release of oil or hazardous material or for any other action necessary to implement chapter twenty-one E[;] (b) implementation and enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of chapter sixty-four K.\u201d The amended \u00a7 2J would further provide that, while the amounts credited to the fund from the excise would be used, subject to appropriation, for both of the stated purposes, any amounts credited to the fund from other sources<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would be used, subject to appropriation, for the first purpose only, i.e., implementation of G. L. c. 21E.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">This petition was filed with the Attorney General and certified by him pursuant to art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3. He certified, among other things, that the petition is in proper form and contains only subjects which are not excluded by art. 48 from the initiative process. He also prepared a written summary of the petition, as required by art. 48, and forwarded both his certification and summary to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. In summarizing the petition\u2019s definition of the hazardous material to be covered by the excise, the Attorney General stated: \u201cToxic chemicals would be covered if classified as toxic by the federal Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) under federal law. As of July 1, 1994, substances listed as hazardous by the EPA under federal law would also become subject to the excise.\u201d In summarizing the purposes for which the revenue from the excise would be used, the Attorney General stated: \u201cMoney in the Fund would be used, subject to legislative appropriation, to assess and clean up sites that have been or may be contaminated by oil or hazardous materials, and to carry out and enforce the excise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">After the proponents of the petition gathered and timely filed the required number of additional signatures, the Secretary transmitted the petition to the Legislature under art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 4. It appears the Legislature did not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>act the measure proposed in the petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are informed that the Secretary intends to place the measure and the Attorney General\u2019s summary on the November, 1992, Statewide ballot under art. 48, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1, provided the petition is completed by the timely filing of a sufficient number of further signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Attorney General\u2019s certification and summary do not comply with art. 48, and an injunction barring the Secretary from placing the measure and summary on the ballot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><em>Certification. </em>The plaintiffs attack the Attorney General\u2019s certification on two grounds. Their principal claim is that the proposed measure would make a specific appropriation from the Commonwealth\u2019s treasury and, therefore, is excluded by art. 48 from the initiative process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Under art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, \u201c[n]o measure . . . that makes a specific appropriation of money from the treasury of the commonwealth, shall be proposed by an initiative petition; but if a law approved by the people is not repealed, the general court shall raise by taxation or otherwise and shall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d We recently noted that \u00a7 2 \u201cdoes not exclude from the initiative process a measure that relates to the raising of public revenue but rather, on the subject of public revenue, \u00a7 2 excludes only a measure \u2018that makes a specific appropriation of money from the treasury of the commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tax Equity Alliance for Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>401 Mass. 310, 314 (1987). The basic purpose of excluding specific appropriation measures is to preserve the Legislature\u2019s general authority over the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>treasury, and to preclude special interest groups from attempting to usurp that authority through the use of initiatives which might compel the expenditure of public funds in a piecemeal fashion. <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 627 (1981). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 580-581 (1937). See 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918, 815-833 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The essential aspect of a specific appropriation is that it removes public monies, and the decision how to spend them, from the control of the Legislature. For example, the petition in <em>Slama </em>proposed a law which would have created two separate funds, a local personal income tax fund and a local sales and use tax fund. Certain percentages of the tax revenue collected by and belonging to the Commonwealth would have been credited to those funds and distributed, without further action by the Legislature, to the cities and towns for whatever purposes they saw fit. We held that such a law would violate art. 48\u2019s proscription against specific appropriations, because the public monies \u201cwould be transferred automatically without appropriation by the Legislature,\u201d and thus would be \u201cremoved from the control of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Slama, supra </em>at 622, 627. In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. at 579, the petition proposed a constitutional amendment which would have required, subject to exceptions not relevant here, that \u201cthe net proceeds of all gasoline excise taxes and all motor vehicle fuel, motor vehicle and trailer registration fees, licenses, duties, excises and similar taxes shall be expended only for highway purposes, including policing.\u201d The Justices concluded that this proposed amendment constituted a specific appropriation. \u201cIts direct purpose is to seize upon all the revenue received from the designated sources and to appropriate it permanently to a specified public use. If it were adopted, the Legislature would be powerless to appropriate any revenue from that source to any other public use.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. at 580.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The measure presently before the court would not place the monies in the Environmental Challenge Fund beyond the Legislature\u2019s control. To the contrary, the measure expressly states that the expenditure of monies from the fund would be \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d by the Legislature. It is difficult to imagine how a measure which states that it is \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d could have been intended to be an appropriation in and of itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The plaintiffs concede that this measure, standing alone, would not be a sufficient basis on which to disburse monies from the Environmental Challenge Fund. They concede that some action by the Legislature (an appropriation under art. 63) would be necessary before the monies would be available for use by the Executive Branch. The gist of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument seems to be that the measure impermissibly would remove the Legislature\u2019s discretion in exercising its appropriative power. This is so, they claim, because the measure would compel the Legislature to appropriate the monies in the fund solely for the purposes designated in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2J. In constructing this argument, the plaintiffs focus on the mandatory tone of the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201csolely.\u201d They read the measure to say that the monies in the fund \u201cshall\u201d be used \u201csolely\u201d for the designated purposes of the fund. Obviously, however, those words are tempered by the inclusion of the additional words \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d which clearly refer to the Legislature\u2019s powers to appropriate as specified in art. 63. Cf. <em>Opinion of </em>the. <em>Justices, </em>323 Mass. 764, 767 (1948) (bill which provided twenty per cent pay increase for certain State officers and employees was construed \u201cas increasing salaries subject to existing or future ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>propriation for salaries and not as an appropriation bill\u201d under art. 63).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we continue to adhere to the definition of appropriation set forth in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>323 Mass. at 766, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>50 Neb. 88, 96 (1896). \u201cTo appropriate,\u201d the Justices stated, \u201chas been defined as \u2018to set apart from the public revenue a certain sum of money for a specified object, in such manner that the executive officers of the government are authorized to use that money, and no more, for that object and for no other.\u2019 \u201d We adhered to this definition in <em>Tax Equity Alliance for Mass., Inc., supra </em>at 315, and, before that, in <em>Slama, supra </em>at 625. We have not held, as the plaintiffs argue, that an appropriation occurs whenever public monies are set aside for a specific purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In order for there to be an appropriation, the monies must be set aside \u201cin such manner that the executive officers of the government are authorized to use that money.\u201d It is not until the Executive Branch becomes authorized to use the monies that the monies are removed from the further control of the Legislature. Merely setting aside the monies, in the sense of placing them in a separate fund, does not necessarily remove them from the Legislature\u2019s control. Even directing that they be used for a specific purpose, while at the same time acknowledging and providing that such use shall be \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d by the Legislature, does not usurp the Legislature\u2019s role under art. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that this measure is similar to the measure before the Justices in 1937, which provided that certain public monies \u201cshall be expended only for highway purposes, including policing.\u201d As noted above, the Justices concluded that that measure constituted a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cific appropriation. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 579-582 (1937). There are at least two important distinctions between that measure and the measure before us. First, as far as can be discerned from the Justices\u2019 opinion, that measure \u2014 unlike the measure before us \u2014 did not state expressly that the expenditure of the monies for the designated purposes would be \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d by the Legislature. Second, the measure in 1937 was a proposed constitutional amendment. Due to its constitutional nature, the measure would have left the Legislature with no choice but continually to expend the monies for the designated purposes, unless and until the amendment was repealed. That measure effectively would have bypassed the Legislature\u2019s power and discretion under art. 63.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The measure in this action, by contrast, is a proposed statute and not a constitutional amendment. It would not create the same permanently binding effect on the Legislature. The Legislature cannot, through enactment of an act or statute, bind itself or its successors to make a particular appropriation. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>302 Mass. 605, 610-611 (1939) (\u201cOne General Court cannot bind itself or its successors in this manner\u201d). See also <em>Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>400 Mass. 806, 816 (1987) (G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 7L,. \u201cappears to be an impermissible attempt by one Legislature to dictate to subsequent ones the way in which constitutionally permissible legislative processes may work\u201d). See also art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2 (\u201climitations on the legislative power of the general court in the constitution shall extend to the legislative power of the people\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The plaintiffs also attack the Attorney General\u2019s certification on a second ground. They claim the proposed measure is not a law and, therefore, is not in proper form for submission to the voters. Again we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Under art. 48, an initiative petition must propose either a constitutional amendment or a law. The petition involved in this action does not propose a constitutional amendment. The question is whether it proposes a law. \u201cThe word \u2018law\u2019 imports a general rule of conduct with appropriate means for its enforcement declared by some authority possessing sovereign power over the subject; it implies command and not entreaty; it is something different in kind from an ineffectual expression of opinion possessing no sanction to compel observance of the views announced.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>262 Mass. 603, 605 (1928). Accord <em>Paisner </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 593, 598-601 (1983); <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 569-570 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The plaintiffs argue that, by relying on Federal law to define which hazardous material would be subject to the excise, the measure is too indefinite to constitute a law. They claim that the Federal authorities might amend their list of hazardous substances or classification of toxic chemicals, and that this would change the class of hazardous material which is subject to the excise. Assuming that is true, it does not render the measure too indefinite to be a law. At any given time, an individual or entity would be able to determine exactly which substances and chemicals are listed and classified and, thus, which material is subject to the excise.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">By the terms of this measure, payment of the excise would be mandatory, not optional. The excise would be payable to the Commonwealth and enforceable in the courts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Commonwealth. A failure to abide by it would subject an individual or entity to civil and criminal liability and sanctions. In these respects, the measure definitely proposes a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><em>Summary. </em>The plaintiffs attack the Attorney General\u2019s summary of the measure on two grounds. First, they claim the summary does not fairly inform the voters which hazardous material would be subject to the excise or that the class of material subject to the excise might change if, in the future, the Federal authorities amend their list of hazardous substances or classification of toxic chemicals under Federal law. Second, the plaintiffs claim that the summary does not inform the voters fairly of the significance of the fact that the expenditure of monies from the Environmental Challenge Fund would be \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d by the Legislature. We disagree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Under art. 48, as amended by art. 74 of the Amendments, the Attorney General must prepare a summary which is both fair and concise. \u201cA summary is an abridgment, abstract, compendium, or epitome. The word carries with it the idea that, however much the subject matter may be condensed, the sum and substance of it must remain. No doubt details may be omitted or in many instances covered by broad generalizations, but mention must be made of at least the main features of the measure. And the summary must be \u2018fair\u2019; that is to say, it must not be partisan, colored, argumentative, or in any way one sided, and it must be complete enough to serve its purpose of giving the voter who is asked to sign a petition or who is present in a polling booth a fair and intelligent conception of the main outlines of the measure.\u201d <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>327 Mass. 310, 324 (1951). The Attorney General\u2019s judgment concerning the form and content of the summary is entitled to some deference. We will not substitute our judgment for the Attorney General\u2019s over \u201ca matter of degree.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 229-230 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The summary involved here informs the voters, among other things, that the excise would apply to hazardous substances which are listed, and toxic chemicals which are classified, by the Federal Environmental Protection Administration pursuant to Federal law. That is, without doubt, the \u201csum and substance\u201d of the measure\u2019s definition of which hazardous material would be covered. The summary also sets forth the measure\u2019s numerous exceptions and exclusions. In our opinion, nothing of significance would be gained by requiring the Attorney General to include either the legal citations to the specific Federal law involved or the fact that the measure refers to the Federal law \u201cas amended.\u201d The summary is not unfair or misleading without these matters. To include them might actually tend to \u201cconfuse rather than clarify.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 228, quoting <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>357 Mass. 787, 800 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">On the subject of how the excise revenue would be used, the summary states that it would be used, \u201csubject to legislative appropriation,\u201d to assess and clean up contaminated sites and to implement and enforce the excise. The plaintiffs argue that the summary does not fairly inform the voters that, in the Legislature\u2019s discretion, the monies could be spent for other purposes. Again, however, we believe the summary fairly states the \u201csum and substance\u201d of the measure. The use of the phrase \u201csubject to legislative appropriation\u201d is not inaccurate, since it tracks the basic language of the measure. Nor is that phrase misleading, since it apprises the voters both that the expenditure of monies for the stated purposes would be contingent on (\u201csubject to\u201d) an action of the Legislature, and exactly what that action is (\u201cappropriation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The measure does not expressly state that the monies may be used for purposes other than those set forth in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2J. To require the Attorney General to state that the monies could be spent for other purposes would, in essence, require him to state a legal interpretation of the measure. Nothing in art. 48 requires the summary to include legal analysis or an interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>We remand this action to the county court for entry of a judgment declaring that the Attorney General\u2019s certification and summary of this petition are in compliance with the requirements of art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b22-12\"> We acknowledge the assistance given us by a brief from Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, Inc., as amicus curiae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b23-6\"> The sections of the Federal acts cited in the definitions of \u201cHazardous substance\u201d and \u201cToxic chemical\u201d are codified, respectively, at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 (14), 9602, and 11023 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b24-7\"> The Environmental Challenge Fund was established in 1987 as a separate fund on the books of the Commonwealth.
