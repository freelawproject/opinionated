L. c. 21E (1990 ed.) (Act). We consider whether \u00a7 15, entitled \u201cCitizen Enforcement,\u201d authorizes a trial judge to award attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>a private party suit for reimbursement brought pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm this portion of the judgment and hold that it does authorize such fees. We also consider whether the judge erred in awarding only a percentage of otherwise reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees to a party entitled to reimbursement under G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4, based on the percentage of response costs the party recovered. We conclude that the judge erred on this point and reverse that portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The facts of the underlying action arose from the contamination by hazardous materials and oils of property located on Nursery Lane in Fitchburg. From 1941 until 1968, the defendant, Ileo Unican Corporation (Ileo), owned a portion of the Nursery Lane property. In 1968, Sanitoy, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Sanitoy), acquired Ilco\u2019s portion of the Nursery Lane property, and it has since manufactured toys on the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In 1986, Sanitoy discovered that the Nursery Lane property was contaminated by hazardous material and oil. Pursuant to G. L. c. 2IE, Sanitoy undertook an assessment and removal of the hazardous material and oil. Sanitoy then brought suit against Ileo pursuant to G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4, claiming Ileo was liable for the contamination on that portion of the Nursery Lane property which Ileo had previously occupied. Sanitoy sought reimbursement from Ileo for its pro rata share of response costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The jury found that Ileo was responsible for thirty percent of the contamination at the Nursery Lane site and allowed Sanitoy to recover thirty percent of its response costs from Ileo. After trial, both parties moved to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15. The judge ruled that \u201celigibility for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees depends upon a party\u2019s entitlement to response costs.\u201d Thus, the judge denied Ilco\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees because it did not recover response costs and held that Sanitoy is entitled to 30% of its attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees as it was entitled to recover 30% of its response costs. Both parties appealed and we took the case on our own motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">From the preamble to the 1983 act, which breathed life into the Massachusetts effort to clean up hazardous materials and oils, we learn that the purpose of G. L. c. 21E was \u201cto clarify and improve the commonwealth\u2019s capability for responding to releases of oil and hazardous material and to recover response costs from persons responsible for releases.\u201d St. 1983, c. 7. Under the statutory scheme, clean-up costs \u201care to be borne by those who are responsible for the release because they own or owned the land or because they caused the spill.\u201d <em>Acme Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. </em>Affairs, 410 Mass. 760, 764 (1991). The Legislature equipped the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering, now the Department of Environmental Protection (department), \u201cwith a number of different means of prodding a responsible party into undertaking cleanup actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One such method is the \u201cdepartment order\u201d whereby the department orders \u201cany person causing or legally responsible\u201d for a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>lease or the threat of a release to conduct necessary assessment, containment, and removal actions. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 9 (1990 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">A party that undertakes such remedial action is not necessarily liable for the entire cost of assessment, containment, and removal. Such a party is entitled to reimbursement from other parties in proportion to their relative degrees of contribution to the contamination as a function of the total cost of assessment, containment, and removal. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>Indeed, G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, \u201ccreate[d] a private right of action to enforce the purposes of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 197 (1987). Section 4, however, made no provision for the recovery of attorneys\u2019 or expert witness fees by parties seeking reimbursement under \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In 1986, the Act was amended to include \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> St. 1986, c. 554, \u00a7 3. Section 15 provides: \u201cIn any suit by Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>setts residents to enforce the requirements of this chapter, or to abate a hazard related to oil or hazardous materials in the environment, the court may award costs, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to any party other than the commonwealth who advances the purposes of this chapter.\u201d The single decision to interpret \u00a7 15 is <em>Dedham Water Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms Dairy, Inc., </em>889 F.2d 1146, 1157 (1st Cir. 1989). The <em>Dedham Water </em>court, on whose interpretation the judge below relied, stated: \u201c[I]f the district court finds that Dedham Water is entitled to response costs under [G. L. c.] 21E it may award costs and attorney\u2019s fees to Dedham Water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge below in construing and applying the <em>Dedham Water </em>court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 15, limited eligibility for a fee award to a party\u2019s entitlement to response costs and then awarded a percentage of fees equal to percentage of response costs recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Ilco contends that \u00a7 15 does not apply to private parties such as Sanitoy who have incurred assessment, containment, and removal costs and then seek reimbursement of those costs pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4. Ileo argues that \u00a7 15 only applies to citizen suits brought pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A (1990 ed.), to enforce c. 21E.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by Ilco\u2019s gallant, but in the end unsuccessful, attempt so to characterize the applicability of \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">On its face, \u00a7 15 is not limited to actions brought pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A. Indeed the section expressly applies to \u201cany suit by Massachusetts residents to enforce the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ments of this chapter [21E].\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15. Ileo places special emphasis on the title enacted by the people as part of \u00a7 15: \u201cCitizen Enforcement.\u201d Ileo contends that the title coupled with the term \u201cMassachusetts residents\u201d in the introductory clause of the section leads inexorably to the conclusion that \u00a7 15 applies only to citizen suits brought pursuant to G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cThe title is in a legal sense a part of the act, and resort may be had to it as an aid in the interpretation of the act.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 292 (1945). To this end, \u00a7 15 is entitled \u201cCitizen Enforcement.\u201d In our view, resort to the title supports the construction that a corporate citizen empowered by \u00a7 4 of the act, seeking to enforce the provisions of the Act, see <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., supra </em>at 197, may recover fees pursuant to \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">While \u00a7 15 applies to suits brought by \u201cMassachusetts residents,\u201d it cannot be interpreted logically to preclude an award of fees if only one resident, as in the present case, brings suit. Such a conclusion would diminish the role that a single party must play in resolving the hazardous waste disposal problem in Massachusetts by denying it fees and awarding them to a plaintiff \u201cclass\u201d comprised of multiple Massachusetts residents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Ileo next contends that Sanitoy has not \u201cenforce [d] the requirements of the chapter,\u201d or congruently, has not \u201cadvance [d] the purposes of this chapter\u201d by its action taken pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the Act. See G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15. We reject these arguments and hold, as did the Appeals Court in <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., supra </em>at 197, that any person who undertakes assessment, containment, or removal activities as defined in the Act, and subsequently seeks reimbursement pursuant to G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4, enforces and advances the purposes of the Act. A contrary conclusion would render nuga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tory the cost allocation provisions of the Act and insulate potentially responsible parties from liability where the cost of litigation exceeds the cost of assessment, containment, or removal. See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Litton Indus. Automation Sys., Inc., </em>920 F.2d 1415, 1422 (8th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 499 U.S. 937 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We briefly address one final argument that Ileo raises. In 1992, the Legislature amended c. 21E. See, e.g., St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 271-313. The amendments, among other things, authorize the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs in private party actions brought under G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, in certain circumstances. St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7\u00a7 293, 294 (prospective in their application). Ileo contends that the amendments, which left \u00a7 15 unchanged, demonstrate that \u00a7 15 was never intended to apply to private party actions. We reject this argument. \u201cWhat the . . . legislation involved in this case means cannot rationally be influenced by [subsequent] legislation.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Wholesalers of Malt Beverages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>409 Mass. 336, 344 (1991), quoting <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 726, 729 n.3 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In its cross appeal, Sanitoy contends that the judge erred in failing to award the full amount of its attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees. Sanitoy contends that the judge erred in linking the fee award to the percentage of \u201cresponse\u201d costs recovered. We agree and reverse this portion of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On this issue the statute provides that \u201cthe court may award costs, including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees, to any party . . . who advances the purposes of this chapter.\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 15. In fixing the amount of the fee award, the trial judge first concluded that all of Sanitoy\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees were reasonable but then reduced the fee award to 30 % of this total to reflect the percentage of \u201cresponse\u201d costs Sanitoy recovered from Ileo.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">We have held generally that the amount of a reasonable fee award rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>(1979). In making a determination of reasonableness, we have said that the judge \u201cshould consider the nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the amount of the damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388-389.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It is clear that the judge considered these factors in assessing the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees that Sanitoy incurred. In her memorandum of decision, the judge provided, \u201cSanitoy\u2019s submissions as to its attorneys\u2019 fees and experts\u2019 fees document in painstaking detail the time expended. I find that the fees, although substantial, are not unreasonable, given the nature of the case.\u201d The judge also wrote in deciding the cross motions for fees: \u201cIn effect, Ileo has conceded the reasonableness of Sanitoy\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees by the submission of its own fees which are comparable. Moreover, the fact that [Ilco\u2019s] expert witness\u2019 costs were three times as high as those of [Sanitoy] demonstrates the reasonableness of Sanitoy\u2019s claim for expert fees</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On this basis, we conclude that the judge erred in awarding Sanitoy only a percentage of its reasonable fees. Sanitoy is entitled to recover the full amount of its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees as previously determined by the judge. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> General Laws c. 21E, \u00a7 4, third par. (1990 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who undertakes assessment, containment or removal action regarding the release or threat of release of oil or hazardous material shall be entitled to reimbursement from any other person liable for such release or threat of release for the reasonable costs of such assessment, containment and removal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Sanitoy is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Delaware with a principal place of business in Fitchburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> Ilco counterclaimed demanding, rather cryptically, \u201cthat th[e] court enter judgment for Ileo against Sanitoy in an amount equal to any judgment or other relief entered against Ileo that is in excess of its equitable, proportionate share, and an amount equal to the past and future response costs incurred or to be incurred by Ileo in connection with the Site.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AjF\"> Ilco appeals from the award of attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees to Sanitoy and Sanitoy appeals from the judge\u2019s determination of the fee award. In brief, Ileo raises the additional argument that it is entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expert witness fees under \u00a7 15. While Ilco\u2019s notice of appeal did not specify that it was appealing from this part of the judgment, in contravention of Mass. R. A. P. 3 (c), .as amended, 378 Mass. 927 (1979), we need not consider the issue given our ultimate disposition on the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> We note in G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4, a point of departure from the parallel Federal statute, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 et seq. (1988). See <em>Acme Laundry Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 760, 769 (1991) (Federal statute in many ways analogous to c. 21E). In G. L. c. 2IE, \u00a7 4, the private right of action for reimbursement is limited to costs associated with assessment, containment, and removal. In the parallel Federal provision, the private right of action is for \u201cnecessary costs of response.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B). \u201cResponse\u201d is defined as \u201cremove, removal, remedy, and remedial action; all such terms (including the terms \u2018removal\u2019 and \u2018remedial action\u2019) include enforcement activities related thereto.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(25).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Given the broader language of the Federal statute, Federal courts are split on the question whether a private party\u2019s right to recover \u201cnecessary costs of response\u201d includes attorneys\u2019 fees. Compare <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Litton Indus. Automation Sys., Inc., </em>920 F.2d 1415, 1421-1422 (8th Cir. 1990) (private party can recover attorneys\u2019 fees under CERCLA), cert, denied, 499 U.S. 937 (1991), with <em>In re Hemingway Transp., Inc., </em>126 Bankr. 656, 662-663 (D. Mass. 1991) (attorneys\u2019 fees not recoverable), affd, 954 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1992). Notably, <em>Litton Indus., supra </em>at 1422, like <em>Sheehy </em>v. <em>Lipton Indus., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 188 (1987), held that a private party action for reimbursement of response costs is an enforcement activity within the meaning of the underlying statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\"> As Ilco notes in its brief, an initiative petition which was ultimately approved by the voters inserted \u00a7 3 A, entitled \u201cTimetables and Specifications for Action at Disposal Sites,\u201d \u00a7 14, entitled \u201cPublic Notice and Participation,\u201d and \u00a7 15, entitled \u201cCitizen Enforcement,\u201d to the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>framework.
