A single justice reserved and reported the case on the amended complaint, the answer to the amended complaint and a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that in order to comply with art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, a petition must propose a measure which applies either to all or none of the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim, the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the initiative petition was improper because the proposed measure \u201cis restricted to a particular town, city or other political subdivision or to particular districts or localities of the commonwealth.\u201d We do not agree. We conclude that the Attorney General correctly certified the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><em>The petition. </em>The petition proposes to add a new chapter (c. 2IK) to the General Laws governing the reduction and recycling of packaging. Section 2 of the Act would provide that, with certain exceptions not relevant to this action, \u201cno packager shall use or cause to be used wasteful packaging.\u201d The term \u201cwasteful packaging\u201d is defined as \u201cpackaging that is neither (1) reduced packaging, nor (2) reusable packaging, nor (3) recycled content packaging, nor (4) packaging made of materials which are being effectively recycled, nor (5) packaging which is being effectively recycled,\u201d as these terms are defined by the Act. A \u201cpackager\u201d is defined, in \u00a7 3 <em>(a) </em>of the Act in pertinent part, as \u201cthe first person to receive possession of the product in the commonwealth, and the person who places such products in such packaging.\u201d In turn\", \u00a7 3 of the Act also defines \u201cperson\u201d as \u201cany individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation, partnership, or association engaged in business or in providing service, including the commonwealth of Massachusetts and any authority, district or political subdivision of the commonwealth of Massachu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>setts, except for any city or town of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs claim that the petition impermissibly proposes a measure which applies only to some, but not all, of the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth. According to the plaintiffs, the Act violates art. 48 because it \u201cincorporates value judgments of a parochial nature in contravention of the intent of the Framers to preclude purely local matters from the initiative process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The plaintiffs misapprehend the \u201cparticular districts or localities exclusion\u201d of art. 48. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 224 (1981). Its purpose is \u201cto exclude from the initiative process legislation having only a regional impact\u201d; that is, legislation which \u201caffects only one political subdivision or only particular districts or localities and thus addresses a parochial concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>294 Mass. 607, 609 (1936) (\u201cproposed measure by its geographical specification is limited to . . . cities,\u201d and therefore not proper subject of initiative petition); <em>Mount Washington </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>288 Mass. 67, 74 (1934) (\u201crestriction to a particular town, city or other political subdivision or to particular districts or localities must be specified in the law itself in terms which expressly or by fair implication are geographically descriptive of territorial divisions of the Commonwealth, in order that the law be an excluded matter\u201d); <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>283 Mass. 98, 104 (1933) (\u201cwhole purpose of this Excluded Matters [exception] is to exclude matters that are not of State wide interest, those that relate merely to a particular town or city\u201d), quoting 2 Debates in the Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, 693 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Here, the Act\u2019s exemption of cities and towns is not a geographical exemption; it exempts all cities and towns only in their role as putative packagers of retail products or purchas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ers of out-of-State packaged products. The Act has no local or regional focus, and does not specifically provide for the inclusion or exclusion of any particular city or town. As noted above, the entities that would be subject to the Act include (1) any business in any city or town in the Commonwealth; (2) the Commonwealth itself; (3) county governments; and (4) any governmental authority, district, or other political subdivision of the Commonwealth (other than a city or town). The Act therefore would regulate private and governmental conduct in <em>all </em>geographic areas, including every city and town, of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the Act \u201caddresses a matter of Statewide concern,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 225, it properly may be the subject of an initiative petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The case is remanded to the county court where a judgment shall enter declaring that the Attorney General correctly certified the petition because the operation of initiative petition 91-20 is not \u201crestricted to a particular town, city or other political subdivision or to particular districts or localities of the commonwealth\u201d as proscribed by art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-5\"> An amicus brief was filed on behalf of the original signers of Initiative Petition 91-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\"> The preamble to the petition states, among other things, that \u201ccities and towns and the citizens of the commonwealth are now making aggressive efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> The Act need not have a uniform application; rather, it need only have some application throughout the Commonwealth. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 224 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
