MacKenzie, and James Judge, were each charged with the murder in the first degree of Lois Wentworth, a sixty-two year old resident of Wayland who, at the time of her death, was the defendant\u2019s neighbor. The two men were tried separately. On appeal from his convictions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant argues that: (1) testimony pertaining to the confession of James Judge, who had implicated the defendant in the crimes and who did not testify at trial, was admitted in evidence improperly in contravention of the defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront the witnesses against him; (2) the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty of murder; (3) evidence arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>from a custodial interrogation of the defendant was introduced in evidence in violation of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966); (4) the judge erred in admitting evidence that was seized without a warrant from the home of the defendant\u2019s mother; (5) the prosecutor asked several improper questions during his cross-examination of the defendant; (6) the judge erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of burglary when instructing the jury on the charge of armed burglary with assault, and (7) the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We summarize the evidence presented at trial. The defendant lived at 23 Doran Road in Wayland, diagonally across the street from the victim. Approximately one month prior to Wentworth\u2019s murder, the defendant visited her with a friend, Robert W. McCall, to inquire whether McCall could rent a small cottage that was located on Wentworth\u2019s property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wentworth was reluctant to rent the cottage because it had fallen into disrepair. Eventually, she agreed to rent the cottage after McCall agreed to clean and repair it in exchange for a reduced rental rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In the middle of May, 1986, the defendant met McCall at the cottage to remove Wentworth\u2019s belongings. In the course of this undertaking, McCall told the defendant that he could keep anything he could \u201cmake a buck on.\u201d The defendant kept some silverware and other items. The defendant also kept some prescription pills. He told McCall he planned to check a Physician\u2019s Desk Reference to determine whether the prescriptions could make him \u201chigh.\u201d At trial, McCall testified that the defendant\u2019s eyes \u201clit up\u201d when he discovered the prescription bottles and that, after the defendant had returned home, the defendant wondered if there were any more prescriptions \u201cback over there.\u201d McCall further testified that, in the course of cleaning the cottage, the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>men packed three boxes with pots, pans, books, and old pictures and that they brought these boxes to Wentworth in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On June 5, 1986, Wentworth\u2019s body was discovered on her livingroom floor by her daily \u201cMeals On Wheels\u201d delivery person. Wentworth had been stabbed, beaten, and suffocated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Her house had been ransacked. A television was blaring loudly in the livingroom. Empty prescription bottles were strewn across a table. Many of the victim\u2019s belongings were scattered about the house and the telephone cord had been pulled from the wall. However, the three boxes from the \u201clittle house\u201d were left undisturbed in the livingroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Detective Sandra O\u2019Brien of the Wayland police department was among the officers assigned to investigate Wentworth\u2019s murder. In the course of interviewing the victim\u2019s neighbors, she interviewed the defendant on June 9, 1986. The defendant told Detective O\u2019Brien that he had been to the victim\u2019s house a month earlier and had helped McCall clean out the cottage. The defendant further stated that he had been home in bed with an eye injury on June 4 and June 5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant concluded the interview by stating that he was \u201csorry that [he couldn\u2019t] be of more assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>On June 12, 1986, Detective O\u2019Brien asked the defendant if he would be willing to go with her to the State police offices in Cambridge for questioning. The defendant agreed and they arrived at approximately 6:30 p.m., where he met with Trooper Joseph Flaherty. Flaherty read the defendant his Miranda rights, and the defendant signed a card indicating that he understood his rights, that he was voluntarily waiving them, and that he wished to speak with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Trooper Flaherty commenced his interview with the defendant in a conference room that was adjacent to an open office area. In response to Flaherty\u2019s questioning, the defendant stated that he had been to Wentworth\u2019s house a month earlier to help McCall clean out the cottage, and he reiterated that he had been home in bed with an eye injury on the night of the murder. At some point during the interview, Trooper Flaherty left the room to take a telephone call. On the basis of information he received during this call, Trooper Flaherty arranged to have James Judge brought to the station for questioning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Judge arrived at the barracks at approximately 9:15 p.m., at which time Trooper Flaherty escorted the defendant out of the conference room and through the office area where Judge was standing. Judge and the defendant, who knew each other, passed within a couple of feet but did not acknowledge each other\u2019s presence. At trial, Flaherty testified that he orchestrated this encounter so that, while the two men were being interviewed in separate rooms, each would draw the inference that the other was providing the police with information.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">After situating Judge and the defendant in separate rooms, Flaherty interviewed Judge for approximately fifteen minutes. He returned to the defendant and indicated that the police had information that the defendant was involved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Wentworth\u2019s murder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant denied any involvement. Subsequently, Flaherty left the room and spoke with Judge again. He then returned to the defendant, and the defendant again denied any involvement in the murder. Flaherty left the room a third time and spoke to Judge for approximately one hour. During this time, Judge confessed. Flaherty again returned to the office where the defendant was seated and, after reminding the defendant that he had been advised of his Miranda rights, informed the defendant that Judge had \u201cmade a statement.\u201d Reading from his notes, Flaherty stated that he knew that the defendant and Judge had broken into Wentworth\u2019s home to rob her, that they had been wearing masks and gloves, that they had ransacked the house looking for money the defendant believed to be located in the house, and that the defendant had yelled and screamed at Wentworth. Flaherty further stated that he knew that the two men had beaten Wentworth, that the defendant had attempted to suffocate her with a pillow, and that the defendant had retrieved a large knife from the kitchen, handed the knife to Judge, and that Judge stabbed Wentworth. As Flaherty confronted the defendant with these details of Judge\u2019s confession, the defendant sat with a sullen look and listened to what Flaherty was saying. Eventually, Flaherty informed the defendant that Judge was \u201ctaking the blame\u201d for stabbing Wentworth. At this point, the defendant looked up and said \u201cWell, he should, he\u2019s the one who did it.\u201d When Flaherty asked the defendant if he wanted to ex-. plain what happened, the defendant responded, \u201cWe never meant to hurt the woman.\u201d Trooper Flaherty then asked the defendant if he had \u201cdone anything\u201d to Wentworth, and the defendant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Finally, Flaherty asked the defendant if he had done anything to stop Judge from hurting Wentworth. The defendant responded that he had not, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Judge was \u201cacting crazy,\u201d and that Judge had threatened him with a knife. At this point the defendant indicated that he wished to stop the interview. Questioning ceased, and he was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Dr. Vernard Adams, a medical examiner for the Commonwealth, testified as to the nature of Wentworth\u2019s injuries. Dr. Adams testified that he found numerous bruises on Wentworth\u2019s chest and abdomen, on the sides and top of her head, and on the left side of her back. Additionally, her ribs were fractured in seventeen locations. According to Dr. Adams, these injuries were consistent with Wentworth\u2019s having been beaten by two men with great force. In addition, Dr. Adams noted signs that Wentworth had been suffocated, and he observed a knife wound on the left side of her back. According to Dr. Adams, these wounds were consistent with Wentworth\u2019s having been suffocated with a pillow while simultaneously being stabbed with a \u201ckitchen-type\u201d knife.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Adams further testified that the victim had sustained a laceration to her left forearm, a wound which Dr. Adams characterized as a \u201cdefense wound.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>Finally, Dr. Adams testified that, in his opinion, all Wentworth\u2019s injuries were inflicted while she was alive and that she could have survived those injuries for several minutes to \u201ca couple of hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The defendant testified as the sole defense witness. He testified that he was home in bed on June 4 as the result of an injury and that, at 2 or 3 a.m. on June 5, 1986, he was awakened by James Judge, who was holding a knife. According to the defendant, Judge was crying and kept repeating that \u201che never meant to hurt the woman.\u201d The defendant further testified that Judge asked him for drugs and that, when the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>fendant responded that he did not have any drugs, Judge threatened him with the knife and began \u201ctearing up\u201d the defendant\u2019s room. According to the defendant, this episode lasted approximately ten to fifteen minutes, after which Judge left.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">The defendant further testified that he learned of Wentworth\u2019s murder the morning after his encounter with Judge but that he did not inform the police of that encounter because he \u201cdid not want to get involved.\u201d According to the defendant, he eventually informed Trooper Flaherty of Judge\u2019s visit to his apartment after Flaherty accused the defendant of participating in the murder. At this time, the defendant testified, he told Trooper Flaherty that Judge had come to his apartment with a knife, had threatened the defendant, and had said, \u201cHe [Judge] never meant to hurt the woman.\u201d When asked to explain Flaherty\u2019s testimony that the defendant had stated, \u201cWe never meant to hurt the woman,\u201d the defendant testified that he had said \u201cHe,\u201d not \u201cWe,\u201d and that Flaherty must have misheard him.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">1. <em>Admissibility of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony. </em>Trooper Flaherty testified regarding his interview with the defendant. Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony included references to the details of Judge\u2019s confession, including details implicating the defendant. See Appendix. The judge allowed this testimony on the theory that the defendant adopted Judge\u2019s confession by responding equivocally when confronted with Judge\u2019s statements. On appeal, the defendant raises several related challenges to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony. First, the defendant argues that he did not adopt Judge\u2019s confession and that Flaherty\u2019s testimony was therefore inadmissible hearsay. The defendant further argues that the introduction of this hearsay testimony violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser. Finally, the defendant argues that the error requires that he be granted a new trial. We address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">To the extent that the defendant argues that it was error in part to admit Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony as to the entire statement of Judge on the ground that the defendant\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sponse constituted an adoptive admission, we agree with the defendant that this ruling was partially in error. \u201cAn adoptive admission is \u2018a statement . . . made in the hearing of another, in regard to facts affecting his [or her] rights, and [that person\u2019s] reply, wholly or partly admitting their truth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>397 Mass. 440, 442 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>12 Met. 235, 237 (1847). Where a party is confronted with an accusatory statement which, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would challenge, and the party remains silent or responds equivocally, the accusation and the reply may be admissible on the theory that the party\u2019s response amounts to an admission of the truth of the accusation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>400 Mass. 544, 547 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 510, 515-516 (1985). See also P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 287-289 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985). Evidence of this nature is to be received with caution, especially in criminal cases, due to the fact that the meaning of a defendant\u2019s response, or lack thereof, to an accusatory statement is often ambiguous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 515; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 316 (1973), <em>S.C., </em>391 Mass. 123 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boris, </em>317 Mass. 309, 317 (1944). Indeed, we have previously expressed our \u201cgeneral wariness of adoptive admissions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, supra </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In the present case, we are faced with the question whether the defendant responded to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s accusatory statements in such a manner as to adopt all the details of the confession of James Judge. Having reviewed the relevant testimony, we think it clear that the defendant did not adopt all those details. The defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWe never meant to hurt the woman,\u201d may be viewed as a response adopting the essence of Judge\u2019s accusations, namely, that the defendant was present and participated in the commission of this homicide. It is true, however, that this statement must be viewed in context with the defendant\u2019s further statements that he himself had not done anything to Wentworth and that he had not stopped Judge, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Judge was \u201cacting crazy\u201d and had threatened him with a knife. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>405 Mass. 646, 652 (1989). Viewing the defendant\u2019s response in this context, we think it clear that the defendant did not adopt Judge\u2019s entire account of what transpired at Wentworth\u2019s home.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Although we agree with the defendant that Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony as to Judge\u2019s statement was not admissible as an adoptive admission of all that statement, this does not require the further conclusion that Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony was wholly inadmissible. During his interview with Flaherty, the defendant made several statements that were directly admissible against him as admissions, rather than as adoptive admissions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 731-732 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 347 (1957). Thus, the testimony that the defendant had stated, \u201cWe never meant to hurt the woman,\u201d that he had stated that Judge properly had taken the blame for stabbing Wentworth because \u201che\u2019s the one who did it,\u201d and the testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s other affirmative statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>was admissible on the ground that those statements constituted admissions by the defendant which, when coupled with other evidence, tended to establish guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, supra. </em>Further, the Commonwealth was entitled to place the defendant\u2019s admissions in context by introducing testimony as to what prompted the defendant\u2019s statements. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>862 F.2d 1282, 1296 (7th Cir. 1988), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>United States, </em>490 U.S. 1074 (1989). Thus, only those aspects of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony that were attributable to James Judge, that implicated the defendant in the crime, and that the defendant did not affirmatively adopt were inadmissible. These statements were hearsay which contravened the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415 (1964). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>400 Mass. 544, 547 (1987) (no confrontation clause violation where accomplice\u2019s statements admitted as adoptive admission); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 510, 515 (1985) (same). Accordingly, in the face of a proper objection, the testimony relating the details of Judge\u2019s confession should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We note, however, that the defendant did not raise a proper objection to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony. The defendant\u2019s sole objection to Flaherty\u2019s testimony came during a voir dire conference which was held before Flaherty took the stand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the voir dire, the Commonwealth made an offer of proof as to how Flaherty would testify. The judge then asked defense counsel for his views on the evidence, and defense counsel placed his objection \u201con the record.\u201d Defense counsel went on to concede, however, that, \u201cin reading [the Commonwealth\u2019s] memorandum, there seems to be some responsibility on the part of the defendant to answer in an unequivocal manner.\u201d Having virtually conceded the admissibility of the testimony, defense counsel further stated, \u201cI think a lot of my fire will have to go to the weight of this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>dence.\u201d This objection was wholly insufficient to raise the defendant\u2019s present claims of error. The defendant did not argue that his response to Flaherty\u2019s accusations was anything other than equivocal, nor did he distinguish between the admissible and inadmissible aspects of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony. See <em>Bryer </em>v. <em>P.S. Thorsen Co., </em>327 Mass. 684, 686-687 (1951). See also P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, <em>supra </em>at 73. Moreover, the defendant did not raise any constitutional claim. Rather, after placing an objection on the record, defense counsel went on virtually to concede the admissibility of the evidence. In these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s objection was essentially form over substance; there was no request that the Trooper\u2019s testimony be redacted. Thus, we conclude that the defendant did not preserve his present claims of error for review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, our review is limited to whether the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>405 Mass. 131, 137-138 (1989).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We believe that the improper aspects of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony created no substantial likelihood that justice was not carried out. The properly admitted evidence against the defendant was overwhelming that he was present at the scene of the murder. The defendant\u2019s own statements to Trooper Flaherty that \u201c[w]e never meant to hurt the woman,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>that he had not stopped Judge from harming her because Judge was \u201cacting crazy\u201d were themselves sufficient to place the defendant at the murder scene. Moreover, this evidence was buttressed by the evidence that, although Wentworth\u2019s house was completely ransacked on the night of the murder, the three boxes which the defendant had delivered to Wentworth\u2019s house a month earlier were left undisturbed on the night of the murder. Similarly, the evidence that Wentworth\u2019s pill containers, in which the defendant had previously expressed an interest, were found strewn about in Wentworth\u2019s , home, although not conclusive, was additional evidence that also pointed to the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene. In these circumstances, any hearsay aspect of Flaherty\u2019s testimony which placed the defendant at the scene of the crime was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Similarly, as to those aspects of Flaherty\u2019s testimony detailing the manner in which Wentworth was killed, we note that much of this testimony was cumulative of the testimony of the medical examiner, Dr. Adams. Specifically, Dr. Adams\u2019s testimony that the victim had been beaten, stabbed, and suffocated provided a basis on which the Commonwealth could prove its case in a way independent of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony in this regard did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Finally, as to those aspects of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony implicating the defendant as a participant in the murder \u2014 such as the testimony that the defendant had retrieved the knife, had beaten the victim, and had held a pillow to her face \u2014 we conclude that this testimony, although damaging, does not require reversal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, </em>405 Mass. 634, 642-644 (1989). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>412 Mass. 318, 324 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, supra. </em>The defendant contends that this testimony was the only evidence establishing his complicity in the murder and that, without these inadmissible details of Judge\u2019s confession, the evidence would have been sufficient only to establish that the defendant was present at the scene of the crime and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>was agreeable to a burglary. This argument overlooks, however, that the medical evidence introduced by the Commonwealth established that Wentworth\u2019s fatal injuries were consistent with having been stabbed by one person while being suffocated by another and that her numerous bruises and broken ribs were consistent with having been beaten by two men. When that evidence is considered in conjunction with the defendant\u2019s own statement that \u201c[w]e never meant to hurt the woman\u201d' (emphasis supplied), Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony as to which of the victim\u2019s injuries were directly attributable to the defendant becomes unimportant. This is not a case where the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cbest evidence tended to prove \u2018that at least one . . . but not necessarily both of them, robbed and killed [the victim].\u201d\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 874-875 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 659 (1982). Rather, the admissible evidence tended to prove that both men played a role in inflicting the fatal injuries. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, supra </em>at 873. Further, based on this evidence that both men were involved, the jury could properly infer that the defendant possessed the requisite intent necessary to convict him of participating in a joint venture to commit murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty. See <em>id. </em>In these circumstances, the inadmissible testimony as to which of the victim\u2019s injuries were inflicted by the defendant was not crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libran, supra </em>at 643-644. Accordingly, we conclude that the erroneous admission of this testimony did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>2. <em>The defendant\u2019s Miranda claims. </em>For the first time on appeal, the defendant challenges as violative of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony that: (1) the defendant failed to acknowledge James Judge at the State police offices; (2) the defendant remained silent as Flaherty confronted him with the details of Judge\u2019s confession and (3) the defendant ultimately responded, \u201cWe never meant to hurt the woman.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s challenge to this testimony is twofold. First, relying on <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876 (1980), the defendant claims that Flaherty\u2019s actions in walking the defendant past James Judge and then later confronting the defendant with Judge\u2019s confession were improper because they reflected an \u201cexplicit strategy, undertaken for the express purpose of evoking a confession.\u201d Second, the defendant argues that admission of testimony that he had remained silent during each of these encounters was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">To the extent that the defendant argues that his Miranda rights were violated because Trooper Flaherty employed tactics intended to elicit a response, his reliance on <em>innis </em>and <em>Brant </em>is misplaced. <em>Innis </em>and <em>Brant </em>each involved a situation where a defendant had invoked his right to remain silent and where the officers involved thereafter proceeded to take actions which they reasonably should have known were likely to elicit a response from the defendant. In each case, the evidence thus obtained was held inadmissible because the defendant\u2019s invocation of his Miranda rights was not \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d by the officers. In the present case, however, the evidence indicates that the defendant waived his Miranda rights and indicated his willingness to talk with the police. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>He did not invoke his right to remain silent until after the events of which he now complains. Therefore, it was not improper for the officers to attempt, within proper bounds,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to elicit a confession from the defendant. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim in this regard must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">As to the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the testimony that the defendant remained silent during portions of his interview with Trooper Flaherty, we perceive no Miranda violation. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent and thus the testimony cannot be construed as an impermissible comment on the defendant\u2019s having invoked that right. As to the evidence that the defendant lowered his head as he was escorted past James Judge at the police barracks, we fail to see how this testimony violated the defendant\u2019s rights. Although we agree with the defendant that he had no duty to acknowledge James Judge, any conflicting inferences to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s conduct were for the jury to resolve. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 677 (1992), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">3. <em>Evidence obtained without a warrant. </em>Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, the defendant\u2019s sister, Kim MacKenzie Todd, and her husband, Detective Charles Todd of the Holliston police, retrieved five paper bags belonging to the defendant from a room which the defendant had been using at his mother\u2019s HoIIiston home. Kim and Charles Todd also retrieved a pair of workboots belonging to the defendant from a shed that was adjacent to his mother\u2019s house. Subsequently, Charles Todd turned these items over to the Way-land police. The Commonwealth introduced in evidence the workboots and some cosmetics boxes, coins, and jewelry belonging to Wentworth that were among the items contained in the paper bags. The defendant now claims that these items were seized in violation of his rights under the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Amendment to the United States Constitution and thus were admitted improperly at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The defendant did not move to suppress the contested evidence before trial. He did not argue at trial that the evidence was obtained unlawfully.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the question of the legality of the search, assuming a search occurred,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is not before this court on appeal except as we review the issue under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>398 Mass. 641, 652-653 (1986). Even if we were to assume that an improper seizure occurred, there would be no reason to afford the defendant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. There was no testimony at trial linking the defendant\u2019s boots to the crime, nor was there any evidence to cast into doubt the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he had taken the other items in question from Wentworth\u2019s cottage a month prior to the murder. Indeed, elsewhere in his brief, the defendant characterizes this very evidence as \u201cbarely incriminating.\u201d We agree with that characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">4. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s remarks. </em>The defendant contends that the prosecutor asked him several improper questions during cross-examination. The defendant did not object to any of the questions, and thus our review is limited to whether the allegedly improper questions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The first question challenged by the defendant, in which he claims the prosecutor asked the defendant to comment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the credibility of Trooper Flaherty,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was clearly improper. It is a fundamental principle that a witness cannot be asked to assess the credibility of another witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elam, </em>412 Mass. 583, 586 (1992). We do not believe, however, that the error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. The nature of the question was not such that the defendant\u2019s only option was to characterize Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony as either truthful or false and, more importantly, the defendant was able to respond without making such a characterization. See <em>id:, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 402 (1983). In view of the defendant\u2019s response, we do not think it likely that the jury were led to believe that the variation in the witnesses\u2019 testimony \u201ccould only be the result of lying and not because of misrecollection, failure of recollection or other innocent reason.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, supra, </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Narciso, </em>446 F. Supp. 252, 321 (E.D. Mich. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendant next challenges a series of questions posed by the prosecutor pertaining to the defendant\u2019s failure to call alibi witnesses. The substance of most of these questions was whether the defendant\u2019s housemates were available to testify and whether they could corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was home in bed on the night of the murder. There was no error. \u201cGenerally, a defendant\u2019s failure to call witnesses to support his explanation of events is a \u2018fair matter for comment . . .\u2019 if there is some foundation that witnesses other than the defendant were available for that pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>pose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 575 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 70-71 (1954). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 292 (1974). In the present case, we agree with the Commonwealth that the challenged questions simply reflect the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to lay the necessary foundation for a subsequent comment on the absence of alibi witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, supra. </em>In this regard, we note that the prosecutor did not press the issue after the defendant indicated that one of his witnesses was unavailable. Furthermore, any potential prejudice that arose from the questioning was alleviated by the judge\u2019s charge that the defendant did not have a duty to call any witnesses on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Finally, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly asked him to explain what reason James Judge would have for implicating the defendant in the murder. We doubt the question was improper. Additionally, we fail to see how the question was any more damaging to the defendant than the testimony of Trooper Flaherty to which the question related. We already have concluded that the inadmissible portions of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, and we reach the same conclusion with regard to the question challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">5. <em>The absence of a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of burglary. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that they could convict the defendant of the lesser included offense of burglary on the indictment charging him with armed burglary with assault. The defendant argues that the absence of such a charge, which was not requested at trial, created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because it prevented the jury from considering returning a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree rather than felony-murder in the first degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>353 Mass. 409, 424-425 (1967). The short answer to this argument is that the defendant also was convicted of murder committed with extreme cruelty or atrocity. Thus, the error, if any, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the judge\u2019s charge on burglary or felony-murder was harmless.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">6. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress the evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, to object to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony regarding the statement of James Judge, and to object to testimony that the defendant remained silent at various times during his interview with Trooper Flaherty deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel. In reviewing such claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we have stated that our inquiry is \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). In a capital case, however, we review such claims pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, a standard of review that is even more favorable to the defendant. Under that standard of review, we do not focus on the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s performance. Rather, we consider \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). In short, under this broader standard of review, we review a defendant\u2019s claim even if the alleged error on the part of trial counsel does not constitute conduct falling \u201cmeasurably below\u201d that of \u201can ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Applying this standard, we need not dwell long on the defendant\u2019s claims that his counsel was ineffective. As we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>already noted, the error, if any, resulting from trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to suppress the evidence seized from the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, did not deprive the defendant of an otherwise available defense, as the evidence in question was never linked to the crime. Similarly, although trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony resulted in otherwise inadmissible evidence having been admitted in evidence, we conclude that, in light of the fact that most of Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony was otherwise admissible, and in light of the other admissible evidence linking the defendant to the murder, the defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel add nothing new to the analysis we have already undertaken under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth v. Elam, </em>412 Mass. 583, 588 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">7. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the case on the law and the facts pursuant to our duty under G.

He was also convicted of armed burglary with assault. The defendant was acquitted on a charge of masked armed robbery. The jury returned no findings as to whether the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree committed with deliberate premeditation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">The Commonwealth\u2019s brief reports that Judge was convicted of murder in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> The cottage was located approximately fifty feet from Wentworth\u2019s home and was referred to at trial as the \u201clittle house.\u201d Wentworth\u2019s house was referred to as the \u201cbig house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\"> It appears from the record that Wentworth\u2019s death was initially treated as a \u201csudden death\u201d and that her injuries were not evident. An autopsy revealed that she had been stabbed once in the back, that she had several broken ribs, and that she had been suffocated. Her left forearm was lacerated, a wound which the medical examiner characterized as a \u201cdefense wound.\u201d The autopsy also revealed that Wentworth\u2019s blood alcohol content was 0.34 per cent, a level which the examiner noted was \u201cextremely high.\u201d The examiner testified that the cause of death was the combined effect of the beating, stabbing, and suffocation. He also testified that Wentworth may have lived from between a few minutes to \u201ca couple of hours\u201d following the attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> The defendant indicated that he had sustained a cut near his left eye in a fight a week earlier. According to the defendant, he had been admitted to Leonard Morse Hospital on June 5, after the cut became infected, and he remained hospitalized for three days. Detective O\u2019Brien testified that she did not verify whether the defendant was actually hospitalized because she \u201cbelieved him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> The caller was a Trooper Moynihan who informed Flaherty that he had spoken with one Thomas McEwen and that McEwen had implicated James Judge and the defendant in Wentworth\u2019s murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b523-5\"> At this juncture, Flaherty was acting on the basis of the information he had received during the telephone call from Trooper Moynihan, see note 5, <em>supra. </em>Flaherty did not disclose this to the defendant because he wanted the defendant to believe that the information had been received from Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b524-6\"> Dr. Adams based his conclusion that Wentworth had been suffocated on the presence of petechiae, or pinpoint hemorrhages of the capillaries, in the membrane lining of the victim\u2019s eyelids and facial skin. According to Dr. Adams, petechiae are caused by high pressure in the capillaries which accompanies mechanical asphyxia, or airway obstruction. The absence of any signs of trauma on the victim\u2019s neck led Dr. Adams to conclude that the mechanical asphyxia was due to suffocation rather than strangulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\"> Similarly, we do not view the defendant\u2019s silence during the course of Flaherty\u2019s accusation as amounting to an admission by silence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>370 Mass. 119, 123 (1976). Several factors counsel against construing the defendant\u2019s silence as an admission. First, in the course of confronting the defendant with the details of Judge\u2019s confession, Trooper Flaherty did not pause after each substantive accusation and then await the defendant\u2019s response. Rather, Flaherty read the defendant a continuous series of accusations, and the defendant simply failed to interrupt Flaherty as he spoke. Second, the defendant previously had denied Flaherty\u2019s accusations, including one detailed accusation, on at least two occasions. Thus, the defendant\u2019s silence simply may have reflected his belief that he had already denied sufficiently Flaherty\u2019s accusations. See <em>Refrigeration Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Catino, </em>330 Mass. 230, 238 (1953); P.J. Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 288. Third, the defendant\u2019s silence came during a custodial interrogation during which he had been advised of his right to remain silent. In such circumstances, a defendant\u2019s silence is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous,\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617 (1976), because it may reflect the defendant\u2019s reluctance to make an affirmative statement that would later be used to his or her detriment. See <em>id.; United States </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 176-177 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>363 Mass. 311, 316 (1973). Finally, the adverse use of a defendant\u2019s silence following the issuance of Miranda warnings raises serious constitutional questions, see <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> The voir dire was held on the second day of trial; Trooper Flaherty testified on the fourth day of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\"> Although we do not rely on it, we note that, in the context of his claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial, the defendant concedes that his trial counsel did not object to Trooper Flaherty\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has held that a confrontation clause violation does not require reversal of a conviction where the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 223 (1973); <em>Schneble </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>405 U.S. 427, 432 (1972). In applying this standard, the Court has considered a number of factors, including the importance of the evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the improper testimony was cumulative of other evidence, the extent of cross-examination permitted, and whether the other evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. See <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986) . See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 872 n.8 (1987) . We are guided by similar considerations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>405 Mass. 131, 137-138 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\"> For essentially the same reasons, we conclude that the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. As we have already determined, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>401 Mass. 338, 339-341 (1987), was sufficient to implicate the defendant as a participant in the beating of the victim and thus to warrant his conviction either on the theory that he acted as a principal in the murder or that he acted as a joint venturer. Additionally, the evidence that the victim, a sixty-two year old woman, was beaten repeatedly about the head and chest, was stabbed in the back and in the forearm, was suffocated, and was then left to die <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>from her injuries, certainly warranted a finding that the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 368 (1976). In light of this conclusion, we need not consider whether the evidence was also sufficient to warrant the conviction of felony-murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> The defendant filed no motion to suppress prior to trial, nor did he object to Flaherty\u2019s testimony at trial on Miranda grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> The defendant did not argue below, nor does he now contend, that his statements were coerced or otherwise made involuntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b534-8\"> The defendant\u2019s sole objection was to the relevancy of the boots.

It is well established that \u201ca search conducted pursuant to a valid consent is constitutionally permissible.\u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\"> The prosecutor cross-examined the defendant as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact.. . that you were brought out of that conference room and walked through that State Police Office at the same time Jimmy Judge was walked right past you, an arm\u2019s length away, as you were moved to that new office and he was put where you had been.\u201d The defendant: \u201cNo sir, that\u2019s not true. I did not see Mr. Judge until we were charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cTrooper Flaherty fabricated that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The defendant: \u201cI certainly did not see Mr. Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The prosecutor: \u201cDidn\u2019t you walk by him with your head down?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">The defendant: \u201cAfter the interview was concluded and charges were brought against me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\"> Further, we note that, in the course of instructing the jury on the elements or armed burglary with assault, the judge did in fact instruct the jury regarding the lesser included offense of burglary. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the armed burglary indictment, thus suggesting that an instruction on murder in the second degree would have been of little help to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
