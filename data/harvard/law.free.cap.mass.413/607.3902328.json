Smith, worked as an administrative assistant to a member of the city council (city councillor). From 1982 through June, 1986, Smith was employed as the coordinator of the student employment program by the city. In April, 1986, the mayor of Boston appointed Robert W. Consalvo as director of the office of personnel management for the city of Boston (director).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consalvo\u2019s appointment became effective June 1, 1986, but he immediately assumed the duties and responsibilities of the position. As director, Consalvo was \u201cresponsible for the personnel actions of all the [city] employees except those in the school department.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consalvo testified that his primary responsibility was the \u201chiring and firing\u201d of employees and \u201cthe procedures dealing with personnel policy and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Almost immediately after Consalvo became director he began to \u201charass\u201d Smith because of Smith\u2019s association with a city councillor. Consalvo\u2019s \u201charassment\u201d escalated to disparate treatment and intimidation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 23, 1986, less than one month after his appointment as director became effective, Consalvo fired Smith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following termination, Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>requested a meeting with the mayor. The meeting was held on June 30, 1986. Smith, Consalvo, the mayor, and the city councillor were present. Smith testified that he recounted at the June 30 meeting the circumstances leading to his termination. Smith further testified that the mayor said \u201cthat things would be taken care of,\u201d and that \u201che [the mayor] knew exactly where [Smith] was coming from.\u201d Smith testified that the mayor promised to get back in touch with him. The mayor responded by way of his executive assistant who told Smith that \u201cthere was a position available at the Boston police department in the personnel unit,\u201d and that they would transfer him if he applied for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Thereafter, Smith brought suit against Consalvo, individually and in his capacity as director of personnel, and the city claiming, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1990 ed.), that Consalvo and the city violated his right to be free of reprisals for political association and affiliation guaranteed by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution. At trial, following presentation of the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial judge granted the city\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the State and Federal civil rights claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The matter of Consalvo\u2019s individual liability was submitted to the jury. On a special verdict, the jury found that Consalvo violated Smith\u2019s civil rights secured by the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the United States Constitution, and awarded Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>$137,000 in compensatory damages and $5,000 in punitive damages. Consalvo is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Smith now appeals from the judge\u2019s grant of a directed verdict on the Federal civil rights claim brought against the city asserting, in essence, that Consalvo\u2019s. unconstitutional act is attributable to the city.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In pressing this appeal Smith seeks reinstatement to his prior position. We transferred the matter from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">On the basis of <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658 (1978), and its progeny, we conclude that Smith has failed to demonstrate that Con-salvo\u2019s unconstitutional acts are attributable to the city for the purposes of imposing municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, we affirm the judge\u2019s grant of a directed verdict on the \u00a7 1983 count.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The starting point for our discussion is \u00a7 1983. It provides: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State ... . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . .\u201d In <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., supra </em>at 663, the United States Supreme Court first held that local government units were \u201cpersons\u201d as that term is used in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This decision rendered municipalities amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983 for wrongs caused through \u201ca policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated\u201d by that municipality. <em>Id. </em>at 690. Not limiting its pronouncement to formal acts of government, the <em>Monell </em>Court stated that \u00a7 1983 authorizes suit \u201cfor constitutional deprivations visited pursuant to governmental \u2018custom\u2019 even though such a cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>tom ha[d] not received formal approval through the body\u2019s official decisionmaking channels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690-691.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Further defining the reach of municipal liability under \u00a7 1983, the <em>Monell </em>Court rejected respondeat superior as a basis of imposing liability on a municipality for the unconstitutional act or acts of one of its officers or employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <em>Monell </em>Court stated that a municipality could be held liable only when its \u201clawmakers or those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy\u201d cause the constitutional harm. <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Following <em>Monell, </em>the Supreme Court set out to clarify the circumstances under which an act or acts of a government official represent official policy. See <em>Blum, Monell, DeShaney, </em>and <em>Zinermon: </em>Official Policy, Affirmative Duty, Established State Procedure and Local Government Liability Under Section 1983, 24 Creighton L. Rev. 1, 15-23 (1990). In <em>Pembaur </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 480 (1986), a plurality of the Court stated that \u201cmunicipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by [a] municipal policymaker [ ] under appropriate circumstances.\u201d One of the appropriate circumstances cited was the instance where \u201cthe decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481. The question whether a decision maker possesses \u201cfinal policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>making authority,\u201d the Court stated, is a question of State law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 127 (1988), the Court stated: \u201cWhen an official\u2019s discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official\u2019s making, those policies, rather than the subordinate\u2019s departures from them, are the act of the municipality. ... If the authorized policymakers approve a subordinate\u2019s decision and the basis for it, their ratification would be chargeable to the municipality</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Based on these developments in the Supreme Court\u2019s line of <em>post-Monell </em>decisions, Lincoln Smith, the plaintiff here, advances three theories under which Consalvo\u2019s unconstitutional acts are attributable to the city for the purposes of establishing \u00a7 1983 liability. First, Smith argues that Con-salvo, as director, possessed \u201cfinal policymaking authority.\u201d Second, Smith argues that the mayor\u2019s alleged delegation of \u201cpolicy making authority\u201d to Consalvo necessarily constituted de facto municipal policy having the force and effect of law. Third, Smith argues that, if Consalvo did not possess final policy making authority, the mayor ratified Consalvo\u2019s decision by his actions taken subsequent to the termination. We take up each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Smith asserts that Consalvo, as director, was the official responsible for establishing final policy with respect to personnel matters in the city and therefore Consalvo\u2019s acts are attributable, to the city. While we have little difficulty concluding that Consalvo\u2019s position comes with trappings of authority and discretion as to matters of a managerial nature, we see no basis for the conclusion that the director (or supervisor) of personnel possesses final policy making authority with regard to the complained-of actions. We conclude that the director (or supervisor) of personnel is bound by policies enunciated by the mayor, and as such, these policies, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Consalvo\u2019s abusive departure from them, serve as our benchmark for determining municipal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">We find support for our conclusion in the Revised Ordinances of the City of Boston. They present the mayor as the chief executive officer supported, in the administration of government, by the administrative services board (board). City of Boston Code, Ordinances, Title 5, \u00a7 5-1.1 (as amended, 1991) (amendments not germane for purposes referred to herein). The board is under the charge of the director of administrative services who serves as the chairman of the board. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 5-1.1, 5-1.2. The supervisor of personnel serves as a board member under the director of administrative services. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 5-1.1, 5-1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The ordinances describe the duties of the director of administrative services as one who is to \u201cmake, under the Mayor, studies and <em>recommendations </em>with respect to the organization, activities, policies and procedures of all Departments, Boards and officers so that the administration thereof shall be economical and efficient\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5-1.2. Thus, even the director of administrative services, who chairs the board overseeing the function of numerous departments, including Consalvo\u2019s, is not empowered to make final policy but merely makes recommendations to the mayor. Further, the duties of the supervisor of personnel described in the ordinances do not include responsibility for establishing final policy with respect to personnel matters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Given this organizational structure, it is clear that the mayor, not the director (or supervisor) of personnel, is the final policy making authority. While not completely outside the inner circle of policy makers, the director of personnel\u2019s policy making role is, at most, an advisory one.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Our conclusion is supported by the numerous executive orders and policy statements issued by the mayor\u2019s office governing personnel matters presented at trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One such document is the Executive Employment Policy Manual (manual) adopted by executive order of the mayor, March 9, 1983. Section 1(D) of the manual sets forth the city\u2019s general employment policy: \u201cThe Affirmative Action goals of the City of Boston are to provide fair and equal employment opportunities for employees and applicants for employment on the basis of individual merit and fitness as ascertained through fair and practical methods of selection and promotion . . . with proper regard for their . . . constitutional rights as citizens.\u201d Section 1(B) of the manual, entitled \u201cCoverage of this Policy,\u201d provides that \u201c[a]ny changes to said plan must be approved by the Mayor . . . <em>and </em>the Supervisor of Personnel\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Further, the manual provides at various points that the supervisor of personnel is responsible for administering, maintaining, reviewing, and implementing various aspects of the personnel management plan. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 III(B). Indeed, the responsibilities of the supervisor of personnel delineated at various points in the manual belie the conclusion that one occupying the position possesses final policy making authority with regard to personnel matters and support the city\u2019s claim that someone other than Consalvo possessed final policy making authority with regard to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">While the responsibilities of the supervisor of personnel as detailed in the ordinances and other city documents considered fail to describe one vested with final policy making au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>thority, our conclusion here is based only on positive local law. The question whether Consalvo possessed final policy making authority as a matter of practice, or through custom and usage, is next considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">For his second theory, Smith argues that the mayor delegated final policy making authority to Consalvo at the time Consalvo was appointed. Smith asserts that this delegation rendered the city liable for Consalvo\u2019s act because Consalvo\u2019s decision to terminate Smith necessarily constitutes \u201cpolicy,\u201d despite the fact that Consalvo\u2019s practice was not authorized by law. Generally, Smith relies on the principle that the mayor\u2019s delegation and Consalvo\u2019s subsequent action constitute \u201ccustom and usage,\u201d having the force and effect of law thereby exposing the city to liability for Consalvo\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In support of this proposition, Smith points to the conversation Consalvo had with the mayor at the time of his appointment and Consalvo\u2019s trial testimony. The mayor, in Consalvo\u2019s words, said that he had hired Consalvo to take over that office and \u201crestructure it into a modern office of personnel management.\u201d Consalvo testified that he understood that he was \u201cresponsible for the personnel actions of all of the employees . . . and . . . the hiring and firing and the procedures dealing with personnel policy and the like.\u201d Further, Consalvo testified that he was not required to follow the previous director\u2019s policies and regulations in running the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Municipal liability for governmental custom or practice falling short of a formal government act under \u00a7 1983 is well established, see <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-691 (1978), but Smith misconstrues its application. Governmental custom does not go to the propriety of a delegation of decision making authority, but rather to the existence of a widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy, is \u201cso permanent and well settled as to constitute a \u2018custom or usage\u2019 with the force of law.\u201d <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, </em>485 U.S. 112, 127 (1988), quoting <em>Adickes </em>v. <em>S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 167-168 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>To carry the day on the \u201ccustom\u201d argument, the plaintiff must establish a pattern of occurrences or a practice similar to that experienced by him, but not necessarily induced by Consalvo, so as to rise to the level of custom thereby having the force and effect of law. Smith has cited no incidents that support such a conclusion. Smith cites only the language of the mayor\u2019s instruction: a charge that arguably does not extend beyond the scope of responsibilities defined in the city ordinances and the manual.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that Consalvo\u2019s hiring and firing authority was constrained by overarching municipal policies. See <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, supra </em>at 127. Consalvo\u2019s decision to terminate Smith was an abuse of discretion failing to rise to the level of governmental custom or practice having the force and effect of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Corollary to the second theory, Smith advances the argument that a failure to hold the city liable in this instance will lead to \u201cegregious attempts by local governments to insulate themselves from liability\u201d by allowing, and perhaps encouraging, subordinates to carry out unconstitutional acts. <em>St. Louis </em>v. <em>Praprotnik, supra </em>at 127. While this argument does have appeal, the argument must fail. First, for the reasons noted above, egregious attempts by a municipality to avoid liability are actionable as de facto municipal policy (custom or usage) having the force and effect of law. <em>Id. </em>Second, imposing liability on the municipality for what we view as an abuse of discretion would, without more, be virtually indistinguishable from respondeat superior, a basis of \u00a7 1983 lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>bility that the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">On his third theory, Smith argues that the mayor ratified Consalvo\u2019s unconstitutional acts in failing to overrule them after he was advised of their occurrence at the meeting on June 30. We find no merit to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We assume for the purposes of discussion that Consalvo\u2019s act would be attributable to the city if the mayor is found to have ratified Consalvo\u2019s decision. We note that Smith produced no evidence showing that the mayor approved of Con-salvo\u2019s decision and the basis for it prior to Smith\u2019s termination. The only evidence tending to support this ratification theory is Smith\u2019s description of the circumstances leading to his termination at the June 30 meeting and the mayor\u2019s subsequent promise \u201cthat things would be taken care of.\u201d Assuming, for the moment, that the correct point in time for inquiry is after termination,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the record does not support the conclusion that the mayor ratified Consalvo\u2019s decision and the basis for it. The circumstances lead us to the conclusion that the mayor, at most, acquiesced in Consalvo\u2019s decision. Mere acquiescence in a subordinate\u2019s decision will not subject the municipality to liability because the governmental policy itself causes the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In conclusion, we cannot say that Consalvo\u2019s acts are attributable to the city under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Smith failed to show that Consalvo possessed final policy making authority with respect to the complained-of activities and failed to demonstrate the existence of a municipal policy, express or implied, that caused the constitutional harm. The authority to act for the city does not necessarily grant license to establish final policy. Responsibility for Consalvo\u2019s acts, deplorable as they were, rests squarely on his own shoulders. We recognize that Consalvo\u2019s illegal acts cost Smith his job, but relief against the city is beyond our grasp on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>asserted. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial judge\u2019s grant of the city\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the Federal civil rights claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\"> The Appeals Court has, however, touched on the issue. See <em>Ossinger </em>v. <em>Newton, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 831, 833-834 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\"> Consalvo\u2019s position is also referred to as supervisor of personnel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-9\"> Consalvo testified that the mayor had hired him \u201cto take over [the] department and restructure it into a modern office of personnel management.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> Smith testified that on one occasion Consalvo said to him, \u201cIf [the city councillor] wants you employed by the City of Boston, it is not going to be in this department. I suggest that you look elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">As for the disparate treatment, Smith testified that Consalvo moved him from his North Street office to City Hall, required Smith to submit daily activity reports not required of other employees, and challenged Smith\u2019s attendance record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> Consalvo asserted that he properly fired Smith for failing to turn in a daily report on Friday, June 20. Smith testified, however, that he prepared the report in the late afternoon and went to Consalvo\u2019s office to turn it in at 4:46 p.m. Outside Consalvo\u2019s office, Smith said he was met by one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Consalvo\u2019s administrative assistants, who informed Consalvo of Smith\u2019s arrival and reported back to Smith that Consalvo would be with him shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"A58\">After waiting until 5:30 p.m. for Consalvo to come out of his office and accept the report, Smith departed for the weekend and left the report on his own desk. On Monday morning, June 23, 1986, Consalvo summoned Smith into his office and terminated him for failing to turn in the activity report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\"> The judge also granted the city\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Smith\u2019s claims that the city violated its contract with him and negligently failed to prevent Consalvo from engaging in the described course of conduct, and Consalvo\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Smith\u2019s claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and interference with advantageous relations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> Smith\u2019s notice of appeal also included a reservation of the judge\u2019s grant of a directed verdict on the State civil rights claim. Smith, however, failed to raise the argument in his brief and has presumably abandoned this claim. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> The <em>Monell </em>Court noted that the primary basis for its conclusion was the legislative history of the act which disclosed that Congress questioned \u201cits constitutional power to impose such liability in order to oblige municipalities to control the conduct of others.\u201d See <em>Pembaur </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 479 (1986), citing <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 665-683 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Additional support for the proposition that \u00a7 1983 could not be interpreted to impose vicarious liability on a local governmental unit is the language of the statute itself. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (statute imposes liability only on a person who \u201csubjects or causes to be subjected\u201d any individual to a deprivation of Federal rights).

Make a continuing study of personnel problems, employment conditions and economic changes affecting the several departments of the City; c. Recommend, from time to time to the Mayor and the several officers appointing subordinates, programs designed to provide opportunities for career service within the City and administrative policies tending to improve and coordinate the handling of personnel matters . . . ; and d.

Smith\u2019s interpretation bears little resemblance to the context in which the remark was made and the mayor\u2019s motivation for hiring Consalvo. The mayor appointed Consalvo to restructure the office of personnel management, an office that lacked modern efficiency. The administrative problems which existed in the office were presumably, at least in part, attributable to the manner in which Consalvo\u2019s predecessors managed the office. It is more likely, in our view, that the term \u201cpolicies and regulations\u201d in this context referred to \u201cdepartment policy\u201d and concerned departmental procedures and administrative practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> We express no opinion on the issue whether ratification must occur before the complained-of act occurs.
