The Board of Bar Overseers (board) recommended that the attorney, who has previously received a private reprimand for neglecting an estate, be publicly censured. A single justice of this court issued an order, without opinion, imposing a private reprimand. Bar counsel appealed. We reverse and order a public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts as found by the hearing committee, as modified by an appeals panel of the board, and as accepted by the board. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 8, as amended, 411 Mass. 1315 (1991). The respondent, Walter E. Palmer, was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1957. In 1984, Palmer drafted a will for one Doris Dervan, who was hospitalized with cancer at the time. Dervan died on January 20, 1985, leaving her ninety-two year old mother, Julia Ward, as her sole heir. Palmer was appointed executor for the estate, and he proceeded to act as the estate\u2019s attorney as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Dervan\u2019s estate was of modest size, consisting of personal property valued at approximately $20,000 and a house valued at approximately $145,000. Most of these assets were already in Julia Ward\u2019s possession at the time of Dervan\u2019s death, and Palmer did not encounter any unusual difficulties in administering the estate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Palmer charged the estate a legal fee of $12,142.06 and an \u201cexecutor com-, mission\u201d of $5,203.74. These fees total $17,345.80; the hearing committee found that a reasonable fee for the administration of the estate would not exceed $9,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">On June 9, 1986, Palmer filed a \u201cFirst and Final\u201d account in the Norfolk Probate and Family Court. This account, which was signed \u201cunder the pains and penalties of perjury,\u201d purported to reflect the activities of the estate between March 11, 1985, and December 31, 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The panel found that the account \u201ccontained inaccuracies and misstatements\u201d in that it \u201cmisrepresented the amount of non-probate funds received from Julia Ward, failed to account for interest earned on her funds, showed payments for funeral services for which Julia Ward had paid, misrepresented that estate taxes had been paid in December, 1985, showed payments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the Respondent for legal fees which were not yet paid and showed a payment of $5,308.80 to Staff Builders [Dervan\u2019s private nursing care provider] which Respondent knew had not been made. The Respondent also misrepresented that all estate funds had been disbursed when he had $6,175.99 in the estate account.\u201d On these findings the panel and the board concluded that the respondent violated Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102(A) (4), (5), and (6), as appearing in 382 Mass. 769 (1981), and Canon 6, DR 6-101(A) (2), as appearing in 382 Mass. 783 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Staff Builders had billed Dervan\u2019s estate $5,308 for services provided to Dervan in the months preceding her death. Palmer undertook to secure payment of the bill from Dervan\u2019s insurer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield (BCBS). BCBS declined coverage of the bill in September, 1986, and, in February, 1987, Palmer commenced suit against BCBS. Palmer\u2019s complaint sought judgment in the amount of $3,200, despite the fact that $5,308.80 was due to Staff Builders. In June, 1987, BCBS offered to settle the claim for $1,000. Palmer notified Ward of this offer and Ward advised him that the offer was acceptable. Nevertheless, Palmer did not settle the case. Subsequently, on August 30, 1987, Ward died, leaving her estate to her granddaughter, Janice Ward. Janice Ward retained her own attorney who notified Palmer in November, 1987, that the attorney had authority to settle the case with BCBS. In May, 1988, BCBS raised its settlement offer to $3,000. Ward\u2019s attorney again notified Palmer that Janice Ward wished to settle the claim. Palmer responded that Janice Ward\u2019s wishes were not his affair, and he continued to pursue the suit in his capacity of executor of Dervan\u2019s estate. Subsequently, in October, 1988, Staff Builders, BCBS, and Janice Ward worked out a settlement in which BCBS agreed to pay Staff Builders $3,000, and Janice Ward agreed to pay the balance. Nevertheless, Palmer refused to dismiss his suit against BCBS. He finally did so in June, 1989, after BCBS\u2019s attorney threatened to seek sanctions against him unless he could explain what reasonable basis he had for continuing the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>2. <em>Proceedings below. </em>Bar counsel filed a petition for discipline against Palmer on April 21, 1990, alleging that Palmer had charged an excessive fee in violation of DR 2-106, had filed a false and fraudulent account in violation of DR 1-102(A) (4), (5), and (6), and was negligent in commencing and then failing to pursue the suit against BCBS in violation of DR 6-101 (A) (2) and (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The hearing committee found that Palmer had charged an excessive fee in violation of DR 2-106, but had not violated the other disciplinary rules. The hearing committee recommended that Palmer receive a private reprimand and that he be required to reimburse the estate his entire \u201cexecutor commission\u201d of $5,203.74, plus interest, as well as an additional $2,742.06, in attorney\u2019s fees and interest. Bar counsel and the respondent appealed to an appeal panel of the board. The appeal panel rejected the hearing committee\u2019s conclusions that Palmer had not violated any disciplinary rules in filing a false account and in mishan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>dling the BCBS suit. The appeal panel concluded that, by knowingly misrepresenting material facts in his \u201cFirst and Final\u201d account, Palmer had violated DR 1-102(A) (4), (5), and (6). The panel also concluded that the numerous errors and misrepresentations in the account supported a finding that Palmer had violated DR 6-101 (A) (2) as well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the panel concluded that Palmer\u2019s failure to sue BCBS for the total amount of the Staff Builders\u2019 claim, as well as his failure to pursue the claim diligently, constituted a violation of DR 6-101 (A) (2) and (3). Finally, the panel also rejected the hearing committee\u2019s recommendation that Palmer receive a private reprimand, and instead recommended that Palmer be publicly censured. In reaching this conclusion, the panel noted that in <em>Matter of Kerlinsky, </em>406 Mass. 67 (1989), this court noted with approval that the ABA Standards For Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, \u00a7 7.3 (1986), recommends a public reprimand in cases involving excessive or improper fees. The panel also noted Palmer\u2019s prior disciplinary record, and concluded that the appropriate next step in the ladder of discipline was a public censure. See <em>Matter of Provanzano, </em>5 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 300, 304-305 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">On an information from the board, the matter came before a single justice of this court. On September 26, 1991, the single justice, without opinion, entered an order that Palmer be privately reprimanded and be made to pay restitution plus interest. Bar counsel appeals, claiming that public censure was the appropriate sanction in this case. On appeal, neither party contests the facts found by the hearing committee, the panel, or the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing the judgment of the single justice, our inquiry is whether the sanction imposed is \u201cmark<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>edly disparate\u201d from the sanctions imposed by the various single justices in similar cases. <em>Matter of Knox, </em>412 Mass. 569, 570 (1992). <em>Matter of Alter, </em>389 Mass. 153, 156 (1983). In applying this standard, it is appropriate for us to consider the cumulative effect of the several violations committed by the respondent. See <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 326-327 (1989). Viewing the respondent\u2019s transgressions in this light, we conclude that the sanction imposed by the single justice was markedly disparate in its leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Our review of the cases reveals that the respondent\u2019s conduct in filing a probate account containing inaccuracies and misrepresentations weighs heavily in favor of the imposition of the sanction of public censure. In cases where an attorney has knowingly misrepresented a material fact to a court or to the board, attorneys have received at least a public censure for their misconduct. See <em>Matter of Nagle, </em>6 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 232 (1989) (public censure ordered where respondent mismanaged estate and altered documents provided to bar counsel in subsequent disciplinary investigation); <em>Matter of Provanzano, </em>5 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 300 (1987) (public censure ordered where attorney fabricated evidence for presentation at disciplinary proceeding); <em>Matter of Kouri, </em>4 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 61 (1985) (public censure ordered where attorney commingled funds and filed guardian\u2019s account knowing that the account misrepresented a material fact); <em>Matter of Aronson, </em>3 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 12 (1982) (two-year suspension for filing false affidavit in order to collect payment for indigent representation); <em>Matter of Flannery, 2 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 76 (1980) (public censure and two-year probation where attorney neglected client\u2019s case to the point of nonsuit and then filed false affidavit with board indicating the case had been settled; special mitigating circumstances present). Indeed, we find only two cases involving a misrepresentation by an attorney in which a single justice has ordered a private reprimand rather than a more serious sanction. See <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>3 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 115 (1983); <em>Matter of the Discipline of Attorneys A &amp; B, 2 </em>Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Rep. 123 (1981). Both of these cases are distinguishable. In <em>Matter of the Discipline of Attorneys A &amp; B, supra, </em>a single justice concluded that public censure was appropriate but unnecessary in light of the fact that the attorneys\u2019 names and conduct had already been publicized by a judge of the Housing Court and had been reported in Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. In <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, supra, </em>the attorney did not make an affirmative misrepresentation to the court; rather, he failed to disclose a material fact of which he was only casually aware, and there were mitigating circumstances present.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In the present case, the respondent misrepresented numerous material facts to the Probate Court by filing a probate account that could well be viewed as being fraudulent, rather than merely inaccurate or- rife with misrepresentations. Although we acknowledge the hearing committee\u2019s finding that some of the figures included in the account were \u201caccounting device [s],\u201d this finding does not explain all of the inaccuracies of the account. Furthermore, although the practice of filing an account in anticipation of future estate transactions has apparently gained some currency among practitioners, see 2 G. Newhall, Settlement of Estates \u00a7 278, at 209 (4th ed. 1958) (\u201cit is not technically proper [although frequently done] to put in Schedule B items not actually paid\u201d), we cannot approve of any practice in which an attorney misleads a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Combined with the respondent\u2019s conduct in filing a false account is the clearly excessive fee charged in this matter. In certain circumstances the charging of an excessive fee will warrant by itself imposition of a public censure. See <em>Matter of Kerlinsky, </em>406 Mass. 67 (1989). While <em>Kerlinsky </em>is distinguishable in that the attorney in that case violated a fee agreement with his client, the respondent in this case was not entirely forthright in collecting his fee. The probate account which accurately listed the respondent\u2019s fee contained numerous inaccuracies which prevented the probate judge from assessing the reasonableness of that fee. Moreover, although the hearing committee found that the respondent believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>that Julia Ward\u2019s counsel had assented to his fee, the hearing committee also found that the respondent collected his fee by having Julia Ward forward him funds for \u201cadministration expenses\u201d and outstanding \u201cbills.\u201d Finally, the respondent himself admitted that he was \u201cpuzzl[ed]\u201d by the overly generous \u201cexecutor commission\u201d that he had charged the estate. In such circumstances, the respondent should have scrutinized his charges to ensure that he was not billing the estate twice for the same service: once in his capacity as executor and once in his capacity as attorney. See <em>Grimes </em>v. <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind, 22 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 439, 440-441 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Finally, we consider the respondent\u2019s conduct in his mishandling the BCBS suit, as well as his prior disciplinary record. While we do not consider the mishandling of the BCBS suit to be especially egregious, it is an additional factor in our determination of the appropriate sanction in this case. Similarly, although the respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary sanction was imposed in 1989, after the conduct involved in the present case had already occurred, the complaint in the prior matter was filed in 1985, putting the respondent on notice, if any was needed, that improper conduct would be met with disciplinary action. Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider the respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary record in determining the appropriate sanction to be imposed. See <em>Matter of Saab, supra </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Weighing these factors together, we believe that the respondent\u2019s conduct at least requires public censure. The respondent has not presented any \u201cspecial\u201d mitigating factors to explain his conduct, see <em>Matter of Alter, supra </em>at 157. The board has recommended that the respondent be publicly censured. This recommendation is entitled to substantial deference. See <em>Matter of Alter, supra </em>at 157-158. In this case, we believe that the board\u2019s recommendation that the respondent be publicly censured is consistent with the dispositions in similar cases. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and direct that a judgment be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk ordering a public censure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The record in this case does not reveal whether restitution has been made as ordered by the single justice. That portion of the order is affirmed.
