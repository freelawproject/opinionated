The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished memorandum. See <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1415 (1989). Thereafter, the trial judge, after denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for a hearing, ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>him to pay the defendant $18,837.08 as costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Waldman </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 451 (1991). We allowed the plaintiff\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The judge awarded the costs pursuant to G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1. The plaintiff argues that the judge erred in awarding expert witness fees in excess of the witness fees provided by G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in awarding deposition costs without finding that the deposition costs were \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (e), as amended, 382 Mass. 829 (1980). The plaintiff also asserts that, because there were factual disputes as to the reasonable necessity of the deposition costs claimed by the defendant, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (e), the judge erred in ordering him to pay costs without affording him an opportunity to be heard, as he requested. We reverse the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">1. <em>Expert Witness Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">A. <em>The American rule in Massachusetts. </em>\u201cThe usual rule in Massachusetts is that the litigant must bear his own expenses . . . .\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 389 (1979), citing <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog, </em>377 Mass. 522, 525 (1979). See <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 721 (1977); <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977).

This rule is more broadly known as the \u201cAmerican Rule.\u201d <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Certain taxable costs, however, are recoverable as a matter of course by successful litigants. G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Witness fees are included in taxable costs. See G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 11. See also <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>145 Mass. 203 (1887); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>1 Mass. 295 (1805). In taxing costs, courts do not seek to compensate litigants fully for the cost of litigation. \u201cAs a general rule taxable costs are considered full compensation to a prevailing party for the expense of conducting litigation even though such costs are only nominal and wholly inadequate.\u201d <em>MacNeil Bros. </em>v. <em>Cambridge Sav. Bank, </em>334 Mass. 360, 363 (1956), citing <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>287 Mass. 376, 384 (1934); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Curhan, </em>332 Mass. 310, 312 (1955). The amount of taxable witness fees is governed by G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that this limitation applies to all witnesses, including experts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge therefore erred in awarding expert witness fees as costs in excess of the amounts permitted under G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">A successful litigant may recover the actual, reasonable costs of the action from an adversary only if \u201ca statute permits awards of costs ... or ... a valid contract or stipulation provides for costs, or . . . rules concerning damages permit recovery of costs.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Citation omitted.) <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Direc</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>tor of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 721-722 (1977). General Laws c. 261, \u00a7 1, is not such a statute. Since our 1945 decision in <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., supra, </em>in which we first referred to the American rule as the usual rule in Massachusetts, the Legislature has amended the relevant portions of G. L. c. 261 seven times,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29, five times.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe Legislature must be presumed to have known of [our previous] decision [s]\u201d affirming the vitality of the American rule. <em>Crown Shade &amp; Screen Co. </em>v. <em>Karlburg, </em>332 Mass. 229, 231 (1955). Because nothing in any amendment suggests that the Legislature intended that G. L. c. 261, \u00a7 1, reverse the American rule, we assume the Legislature did not intend to do so. See <em>Crown Shade &amp; Screen Co. </em>v. <em>Karlburg, supra </em>at 231. See also <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>Lowell Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>402 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1988), citing <em>MacQuarrie </em>v. <em>Balch, </em>362 Mass. 151, 152 (1972). When the Legislature determines that actual, reasonable costs, as distinguished from statutory costs, are to be shifted from the losing party to the prevailing party, it enacts an explicit statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on cases decided under G. L. c. 93A is misplaced. General Laws c. 93A provides express statutory authority to award expert witness fees to a successful plaintiff. See <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>185 (1990); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, supra. </em>In <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, supra </em>at 389, we said that \u201c[c.] 93A is a statutory exception to th[e usual rule].\u201d We said that \u201creasonable expert witness fees should normally be recoverable in a c. 93A case <em>in order to vindicate the policies of the </em>act\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., supra </em>at 194, quoting <em>Linthicum, supra. </em>The fee-shifting mandate of G. L. c. 93A is precisely the type of specific statutory exception to the American rule that is absent in the present case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 547, 555 (1987), also is misplaced. In <em>Goulet, </em>we said: \u201cContrary to [the defendant\u2019s] assertion, there is no indication that th[e award of expert witness fees] was \u2018all or in large part apparently generated in connection with defendant\u2019s deposition of the [expert] witness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue whether G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29, limits the amount of expert witness fees that may be awarded under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d) and Mass. R. A. P. 26 (c) was not before us, and we therefore did not resolve it. The other cases cited by the defendant similarly do not support the proposition that, in the absence of statutory or contractual authorization or a finding of frivolousness, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, expert witness fees may be taxed in excess of the amounts provided in G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>B. <em>Result under Federal practice. </em>Practice under the corresponding Federal statutory scheme and rules of procedure yields the same result. The relevant language of the Federal rule, Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 (d), is identical to the language of Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d), as amended, 382 Mass. 821 (1980). Both rules provide that, \u201c[e]xcept when express provision therefor is made either in a statute ... or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d Where this court has \u201cadopted comprehensive rules of civil procedure in substantially the same form as the earlier Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the adjudged construction theretofore given to the Federal rules is to be given to our rules, absent compelling reasons to the contrary or significant differences in content.\u201d <em>Rollins Envtl. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 174, 179-180 (1975). Cf. <em>Creed </em>v. <em>Apog, </em>377 Mass. 522, 525 (1979) (\u201cSuch costs [incurred by defendant in purchasing letter of credit required as collateral security for a surety bond required to dissolve an attachment] have been awarded to prevailing parties by long practice in the Federal courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiff argues persuasively that <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 439 (1987), supports his position. In that case, the United States Supreme Court \u201ch[e]ld that when a prevailing party seeks reimbursement for fees paid to its own expert witnesses [pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 (d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920], a [F]ederal court is bound by the limit of \u00a7 1821(b), absent contract or explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>statutory authority to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>noted that the predecessor statute of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 provided that \u201cthe following <em>and no other </em>compensation shall be taxed [as costs] and allowed\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Crawford Fitting Co., supra </em>at 440, quoting Act of Feb. 26, 1853, 10 Stat. 161. The Supreme Court also explained that, although the language of exclusivity underscored above has been deleted from \u00a7 1920, the omission suggests no \u201capparent intent to change the controlling rules.\u201d <em>Crawford Fitting Co. </em>v. <em>J.T. Gibbons, Inc., supra </em>at 440, quoting <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 250 (1975). The defendant argues that the lingering effect of the language omitted from \u00a7 1920 distinguishes that statute from G. L. c. 261 and therefore counsels against following the Federal practice. .</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Nothing in <em>Crawford Fitting Co., </em>however, suggests that the result of that case turned on the language in the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. Rather, the Supreme Court grounded its conclusion on \u201cthe language and interrelation of [the relevant] provisions.\u201d <em>Crawford Fitting Co., supra </em>at 441. Like G. L. c. 262, \u00a7 29, \u201c[28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1821 specifies the amount of the fee that must be tendered to a witness [; like G. L. c. 261, 28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1920 provides that the fee may be taxed as a cost[; and like Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d), Fed. R. Civ. P.] 54 (d) provides that the cost shall be taxed against the losing party unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"><em>2. Deposition costs. </em>The plaintiff argues that the judge erred in awarding the defendant deposition costs without holding a hearing and without making the finding of reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ble necessity required by Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (e).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that he was entitled to a hearing, which he timely requested, before the trial judge taxed costs. We agree. We held in <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>272 Mass. 142, 146 (1930), that a Probate Court judge \u201chad no authority to award costs . . . except after a hearing to the parties in interest.\u201d See <em>Manganaro Drywall, Inc. </em>v. <em>White Constr. Co., </em>372 Mass. 661, 666 (1977) (parties challenging reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees \u201centitled to an evidentiary hearing if they requested one\u201d), citing, inter alia, <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, supra; Abdallah </em>v. <em>Boumil, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 499, 500-501 (1976) (litigant challenging award of costs entitled to hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims there are factual issues as to the reasonable necessity of the deposition costs taxed against him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621 (1978), in which we upheld an award of attorney\u2019s fees made without an evidentiary hearing, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff was not entitled to a hearing. In <em>Heller, </em>however, we noted that \u201cwhere the award [of attorney\u2019s fees] is provided for by statute . . . , the standard of reasonableness depends not on what the attorney usually charges but, rather, on what his services were objectively worth. . . . [T]he crucial factors in making such a determination are (1) how long the trial lasted, (2) the difficulty of the legal and factual issues involved, and (3) the degree of competence demonstrated by the attorney. ... A judge presiding over the action for which the plaintiff seeks reasonable attorney\u2019s fees has ample opportunity to acquire firsthand knowledge of all these factors.\u201d (Citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ted.) <em>Id. </em>at 629. This rationale is inapplicable to the question of deposition costs. See, e.g., <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Subpoena, </em>411 Mass. 489, 502 (1992). Further, a trial judge is not a practicing attorney. Presiding over a trial does not give a judge the necessary insight into a litigant\u2019s pretrial strategy or the reasonableness of deposition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Posttrial motions concerning costs should not be permitted to \u201cdeteriorate into ancillary major litigation.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 544 (1985). However, \u201c[i] terns proposed by winning parties as costs should always be given careful scrutiny.\u201d <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Arabian Am. Oil Co., </em>379 U.S. 227, 235 (1964). A losing party who seeks to challenge factual issues raised by the affidavits and vouchers of the prevailing party must have an opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, supra; Abdallah </em>v. <em>Boumil, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We also conclude that a judge awarding discretionary deposition costs must make an express finding of reasonable necessity. Requiring a judge to articulate the reasons for awarding deposition costs ensures that the judge will weigh the award carefully and thoughtfully. See <em>Beit </em>v. <em>Probate &amp; Family Court Dep\u2019t, </em>385 Mass. 854, 862 (1982). See also <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the order on costs is reversed and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\"> The plaintiff was ordered to pay expert witness fees of $13,305.54 under Mass.

(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821 (b) (1988) provides: \u201cA witness shall be paid an attendance fee of $30 per day for each day\u2019s attendance. A witness shall also be paid the attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of such attendance or at any time during such attendance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> Massachusetts R. Civ. P. 54 (e), as amended, 382 Mass. 829 (1981), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe taxation of costs in the taking of depositions . . . shall be subject to the discretion of the court, but in no event shall costs be allowed unless the court finds that the taking of the deposition was reasonably necessary . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> For example, the plaintiff states that he was ordered to pay the defendant\u2019s costs of one deposition, the costs for which were originally assessed against the defendant as a sanction for failure to comply with a discovery order. Although the judge might choose to vacate the order, the defendant is entitled to be heard before the judge acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\"> Additionally, we note that, in this case, the plaintiff maintains, and the defendant does not dispute, that the plaintiff was not served by the defendant with copies of the affidavits and vouchers on which the motion for costs was based as required by Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (d), as amended, 382 Mass. 821 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> The plaintiff challenges the appellate brief fee of $1,249.95 as unreasonable on its face. The plaintiff asks us to take judicial notice of the prevailing cost of appellate brief preparation in the Commonwealth, which we decline to do. Taxation of costs for preparation of the transcript and appellate briefs is governed by Mass. R. A. P. 26 (d), as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c [t] he clerk of the lower court shall prepare and certify an itemized statement of costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>[awardable under Mass.
