Specifically, Atlantic sought to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>termine whether it had a duty under the policy to defend Dime in an action for damages arising out of the lead poisoning of two children in property allegedly owned or controlled by Dime and leased to Wendy McFadden and her children. Relying primarily on a provision in the policy entitled \u201cPollution Exclusion,\u201d Atlantic alleged in its amended complaint, the relevant portions of which are set forth in the Appendix, that it did not have to defend or to indemnify Dime in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The judge determined that the pollution exclusion did not exclude coverage for the McFaddens\u2019 claims. The judge ruled that there is no language in the policy which even suggests that lead in paint, putty, or plaster is a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of the provision. To the extent that the provision can be read to imply that lead in paint is a pollutant for which coverage is excluded under the policy, the judge held that the provision is ambiguous and the ambiguity must \u201cbe resolved against the insurer.\u201d <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 83 (1984). The judge entered summary judgment for Dime and issued a judgment for declaratory relief, ordering Atlantic to defend and to indemnify Dime in the action filed by Wendy McFadden. Atlantic appealed. We granted Atlantic\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On appeal, Atlantic challenges only the judge\u2019s ruling regarding the inapplicability of the pollution exclusion provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Atlantic maintains that lead in paint, putty, or plaster, although not specifically listed in the pollution exclusion as a \u201ccontaminant\u201d or \u201cirritant,\u201d certainly falls within either or both of those categories and therefore is properly classified as a \u201cpollutant\u201d for purposes of the exclusion provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not agree with Atlantic\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>When construing language in an insurance policy, we \u201cconsider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990), and cases cited. We conclude that an insured could reasonably have understood the provision at issue to exclude coverage for injury caused by certain forms of industrial pollution, but not coverage for injury allegedly caused by the presence of leaded materials in a private residence. See <em>West Am. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tufco Flooring East, </em>104 N.C. App. 312, 321-326 (1991) (construing substantially same pollution exclusion). There simply is no language in the exclusion provision from which to infer that the provision was drafted with a view toward limiting liability for lead paint-related injury. The definition of \u201cpollutant\u201d in the policy does not indicate that leaded materials fall within its scope. Rather, the terms used in the pollution exclusion, such as \u201cdischarge,\u201d \u201cdispersal,\u201d \u201crelease,\u201d and \u201cescape,\u201d are terms of art in environmental law which generally are used with reference to damage or injury caused by improper disposal or containment of hazardous waste. <em>West Am. Ins. Co., supra </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the judge properly awarded summary judgment to Dime on the issue of the pollution exclusion provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The relevant portions of the amended complaint and of the policy are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>\u201cIntroduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201c1.
