We reverse and vacate the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Appellant raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err in ordering Winterrowd to pay the costs of jury selection and prosecution?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court err in sentencing Winterrowd on a misdemeanor theft conviction by an order <em>nunc pro </em>tunc?</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">\u00b64 In February 1995, Winterrowd was charged by information with felony burglary and misdemeanor theft. After determining that Winterrowd was indigent, the District Court appointed counsel from the public defender\u2019s office to represent him. In August 1995, the public defender moved to withdraw, stating that he had been informed that Winterrowd had received a $10,000 settlement from the Social Security Administration and was no longer indigent. Winterrowd\u2019s counsel stated that the public defender\u2019s office would not reassign counsel. No hearing was held, and the District Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00b65 The District Court continued the trial from December 13, 1995 to February 28, 1996 to give Winterrowd the opportunity to retain counsel. On February 20, 1996, Winterrowd asked the court to continue the trial because he had not been able to retain counsel. He stated that he had not yet received his Social Security settlement but expected to receive it on or about March 11. The State opposed this motion, arguing that Winterrowd had not demonstrated due diligence and that his claim that he would receive the settlement on March 11 was unsupported by documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b66 The District Court never ruled on Winterrowd\u2019s motion. At the start of trial on February 28, Winterrowd again moved the District Court to continue, and the court denied the motion. The trial proceeded through voir dire, but, following a break, the court granted Winterrowd\u2019s motion to continue and excused the jurors. The District Court ordered Winterrowd to pay the costs incurred in summoning jurors and in prosecuting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b67 Winterrowd obtained counsel, who filed a notice of appearance on March 12 and moved the court to reconsider its order requiring Winterrowd to pay costs. The court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial on August 27,1996. Ajury found Winterrowd guilty of burglary and theft. The District Court sentenced Winterrowd to ten years in the Montana State Prison on the felony burglary conviction. The court did not sentence him on the misdemeanor theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b68 On October 17, 1996, Winterrowd filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal with this Court. On December 30, 1996, the District Court issued an order <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>noting that it had failed to impose sentence on the misdemeanor theft conviction and sentencing Winterrowd to six months, suspended, to be served concurrently with the sentence for burglary. Winterrowd, now represented by an appellate public defender, appeals from the orders of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court err in ordering Winterrowd to pay the costs of jury selection and prosecution?</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">\u00b610  We review a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings in criminal cases for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 313, 880 P.2d 829. The State and Winterrowd agree that the District Court abused its discretion by ordering Winterrowd to pay the costs of jury selection and prosecution. We also agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00b611 The District Court granted the public defender\u2019s motion to withdraw based on an unsupported claim that Winterrowd had received a settlement from the Social Security Administration and refused Winterrowd\u2019s request for a continuance. Winterrowd informed the court that he was unable to retain new counsel until he received his settlement on March IT and, in fact, did retain counsel on March 12. The District Court continued the February 28 trial only after requiring Winterrowd to proceed <em>pro se </em>through voir dire and then assessed to him the costs of jury selection and prosecution. We hold that the District Court erred in ordering Winterrowd to pay costs, and we vacate the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b612 2. Did the District Court err in sentencing Winterrowd on a misdemeanor theft conviction by an order <em>nunc pro </em>tunc?</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b613 In this case, the District Court failed to sentence Winterrowd on his misdemeanor theft conviction, in either open court or the written judgment. Four months later, the District Court issued an order <em>nunc pro tunc </em>sentencing Winterrowd to six months imprisonment, the maximum sentence for misdemeanor theft, to run concurrently with his sentence on the burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b6 14  It is within a district court\u2019s power to enter an order <em>nunc pro tunc </em>modifying or amending a judgment to remedy certain types of clerical errors. State <em>ex rel. Kruletz v. District Court </em>(1940), 110 Mont. 36, 98 P.2d 883. However, the purpose of such an order is to make the record reflect what was actually decided. <em>Dahlman v. District Court </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 470, 698 P.2d 423. Therefore, the error \u201cmust be apparent on the face of the record to insure that the correction does not in effect set aside a judgment actually rendered nor change what was originally intended.\u201d <em>State v. Owens </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 135, 138, 748 P.2d 473, 474 (citing <em>Kruletz, </em>98 P.2d at 885).</p>\n<p id=\"AMO\">\u00b615 The State contends that it was clear from the proceedings that the District Court intended to sentence Winterrowd to six months on the theft conviction, analogizing this case to <em>Owens, </em>748 P.2d at 473. In <em>Owens, </em>the sentencing court failed to designate the defendant as a dangerous offender in the written sentencing order, but made a specific finding on the record in open court that the defendant was a dangerous offender. <em>Owens, </em>748 P.2d at 474-75. Subsequently, in what was deemed a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order by this Court, the court amended the sentence to include this designation. <em>Owens, </em>748 P.2d at 474. We held that \u201c[i]t is clear from this Court\u2019s review of the record that the District Court intended to designate the defendant as dangerous\u201d and upheld the district court\u2019s order. <em>Owens, </em>748 P.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u00b616  By contrast, in this case, not only was the sentence on the theft conviction omitted from the written sentencing order, but neither the District Court nor the parties ever discussed it at the sentencing hearing. The State contends that Winterrowd should have known the maximum term to which he could be sentenced and that \u201cit is customary for the sentencing court to impose a six-month concurrent sentence on a misdemeanor offense whenever a prison term is imposed on a felony.\u201d The State argues that, therefore, \u201cit should be no surprise\u201d to Winterrowd that the District Court sentenced him to six months. Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, there is nothing in the record that suggests what sentence the court intended to impose, and we shudder at the suggestion that a criminal defendant should expect a maximum sentence as \u201ccustomary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b617 We hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to attempt to correct, by <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order, its failure to sentence Winterrowd on the misdemeanor theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b618 Therefore, we reverse and vacate the court\u2019s December 30, 1996 order and sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
