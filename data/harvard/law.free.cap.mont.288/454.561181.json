McKee was found guilty on misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence of alcohol, reckless driving, and leaving the scene of an accident. McKee appealed his conviction <em>de novo </em>to the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County. Prior to trial, McKee filed a motion to dismiss the charges pending against him or, in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence. The District Court denied McKee\u2019s motion, and McKee subsequently pled guilty to the three charges on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>which he had been convicted in Darby City Court, but reserved his right to appeal from the District Court\u2019s order denying his alternative motions. For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b62 McKee presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in concluding it could not act as a court of review, thereby denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss based on his assertion that he was denied his right to a jury trial in the Darby City Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in concluding McKee was arrested pursuant to a valid arrest warrant, thereby denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges leveled against him or, in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">\u00b65 Early in the afternoon on December 24, 1994, Officer Larry Rose, Marshall for the town of Darby, was dispatched to the scene of a traffic accident. When Rose arrived at the scene, he spoke with Thomas Boe, whose parked vehicle had been sideswiped. Boe identified McKee as the driver of the other vehicle and told Rose that McKee had appeared intoxicated. Boe also told Rose that McKee had stated he was going home, and that he had left the scene of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">\u00b66 Rose then drove to the McKee residence and met McKee\u2019s wife, Mitzi McKee, at the door. Mitzi initially told Rose that her husband was not home. After Rose explained that it appeared McKee had just left the scene of an accident, Mitzi replied that McKee was inside the house washing a dog. Rose asked Mitzi to go inside and bring McKee to the door, so Mitzi left briefly, but returned, explaining that she had been unable to find him.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">\u00b67 Rose made several calls for backup, and learned through dispatch that Ravalli County Sheriff\u2019s Detective Pete Clarkson was responding from Hamilton. In the meantime, Darby Mayor, Rich Higgins, and Darby resident, Keith Fisher, also heard Rose\u2019s calls, and arrived at the McKee residence to provide assistance. Higgins and Fisher agreed to watch the McKee residence until Clarkson arrived, while Rose left to obtain a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">\u00b68 Rose drove home, and contacted Darby Town Judge, Martha Bethel, by telephone at her home. In their unrecorded conversation, Rose explained to Judge Bethel that a witness had seen McKee, in an apparently intoxicated condition, leaving the scene of an accident. Rose told Judge Bethel he had proceeded to McKee\u2019s residence, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>told her of his discussion with Mitzi. Judge Bethel verbally authorized the arrest, and drafted an arrest warrant on her home computer. Whether Judge Bethel physically executed the warrant, however, is unclear. In any event, Rose did not have a written arrest warrant in hand when he returned to apprehend McKee at his residence on the afternoon of December 24, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b69 Upon receiving Judge Bethel\u2019s verbal authorization, Rose returned to the McKee residence and, without providing any documentation, informed Mitzi that the judge had issued a warrant for the arrest of her husband. In response, Mitzi permitted Rose and Clark-son to enter the home and search for McKee. Unable to locate McKee, Rose telephoned Mitzi\u2019s mother, the owner of the house, who told him of a crawl space located beneath the house. Rose found McKee hiding in the crawl space and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b610 McKee was charged with the misdemeanor offenses of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), reckless driving, leaving the scene of an accident, and obstructing a peace officer. McKee appeared at his January 4,1995, arraignment before Judge Bethel with court-appointed counsel, and entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges leveled against him. At a May 30,1995, omnibus hearing, the court scheduled McKee\u2019s trial for June 30, 1995. On June 5, 1995, McKee waived his right to a speedy trial. Shortly thereafter, McKee\u2019s original counsel relocated her practice, and David Stenerson became McKee\u2019s counsel of record on July 13, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b611 McKee subsequently filed a motion to continue the trial date, and on October 6, 1995, the court ordered that McKee appear for a trial before the bench on October 11,1995. Judge Bethel presided over McKee\u2019s bench trial and, on October 11, 1995, convicted McKee of DUI, reckless driving, and leaving the scene of an accident. On October 16, 1995, McKee filed a notice of appeal, requesting a trial <em>de novo </em>in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b612 The District Court scheduled a jury trial for April 11,1996, and on February 12, 1996, McKee filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him or, in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence. The District Court denied McKee\u2019s alternative motions by way of a May 22, 1996, order. McKee subsequently pled guilty to the offenses of DUI, reckless driving, and leaving the scene of an accident, but reserved his right to appeal the court\u2019s adverse ruling on his motion to dismiss and alternative motion to suppress. The District Court sentenced McKee to the terms previously imposed by the Darby City Court, ordering that McKee serve sixty days in jail with fifty-nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>suspended for the DUI conviction, ten days in jail with nine suspended for the conviction of leaving the scene of a traffic accident, and ninety days in jail with eighty-nine suspended for the conviction of reckless driving. McKee filed his notice of appeal on July 19,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b613  A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss in a criminal case involves a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Nye </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 505, 509, 943 P.2d 96, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b614  We review a district court\u2019s decision denying a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. Woods </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 359, 359, 942 P.2d 88, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\u00b615  Did the District Court err in concluding it could not act as a court of review, thereby denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss based on his assertion that he was denied his right to a jury trial in the Darby City Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\u00b616 On appeal, McKee asserts he never waived his right to a trial by jury, and contends he acquiesced to a bench trial in Darby City Court \u201conly after it became apparent that the Court was determined to proceed and that it would be in his best interest\u201d to do so. Asserting he \u201cwas effectively forced into trial before the Bench without a verifiable waiver of [his] right\u201d to a trial by jury, McKee asserts \u201chis constitutional rights to due process of law were violated\u201d and the District Court thus erred in denying his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">\u00b617 In response, the State concedes there exists \u201cno written record to demonstrate [that McKee] waived his right to a jury trial in justice court,\u201d but disputes McKee\u2019s assertion that Judge Bethel \u201ccompelled\u201d him to proceed with a bench trial. The State instead asserts that McKee\u2019s verbal agreement to proceed with a bench trial constitutes a valid waiver. Even assuming McKee did not properly waive his statutory right to a jury trial, the State asserts his exclusive remedy was an appeal to the District Court for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">\u00b618  We have recognized that, with few exceptions, \u201ca defendant\u2019s exclusive remedy for a conviction injustice court is an appeal to the district court for a trial <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Barker </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 85, 91, 858 P.2d 360, 363. On an appeal from justice court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>district court does not \u201csit as a court of review, but tries the cause <em>de novo.\u201d City of Billings v. McCarvel </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 96, 101, 863 P.2d 441, 444 (quoting <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1907), 35 Mont. 482, 491, 90 P. 514, 516-17). An appeal to the district court thus provides a defendant with the opportunity to have a trial <em>de novo, </em>thereby curing whatever prejudice may have resulted in city court. <em>See, e.g., McCarvel, </em>262 Mont. at 101, 863 P.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b6 19 Similarly, in the present case, the District Court was not sitting as a court of review, but was responsible for providing McKee with a <em>de novo </em>trial. Had McKee chosen to proceed to trial before the District Court, the trial would have cured any prejudice he suffered when \u201ccompelled\u201d to proceed with a bench trial in city court. That McKee chose to forego a new trial and instead pled guilty to the charges against him, does not alter the fact that his exclusive remedy in this case was a <em>de novo </em>trial. Based on the foregoing, we hold the District Court properly denied McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss, and correctly concluded that \u201cany jury trial right violation was statutory in nature and is remedied by trial <em>de novo </em>before a jury in this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b620 Did the District Court err in concluding McKee was arrested pursuant to a valid arrest warrant, thereby denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges leveled against him or, in the alternative, to suppress certain evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b621 In its order denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss and alternative motion to suppress certain evidence, the District Court determined that McKee had been arrested pursuant to a valid arrest warrant. In so holding, the District Court concluded \u201cthat Judge Bethel had adequate grounds to issue an arrest warrant,\u201d and held \u201c[t]he fact that she has only produced an unsigned warrant for this hearing is not deemed to be of such significance that it affects the substantial rights of the accused in this case, \u00a7 46-6-204, MCA, particularly where the warrant was issued upon probable cause and met all other statutory requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b622  On appeal, McKee first argues the warrant pursuant to which he was arrested violated select provisions of \u00a7 46-6-214(1), MCA, and that the District Court thus erred in upholding its validity and the legality of his arrest. More specifically, McKee argues the warrant approved telephonically by Judge Bethel violated \u00a7 46-6-214(1)(a), MCA, which requires an arrest warrant to \u201cbe in writing in the name of the state of Montana or in the name of a municipality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>if a violation of a municipal ordinance is charged,\u201d as well as \u00a7 46-6-214(l)(f), MCA, which mandates that an arrest warrant \u201cbe signed by the judge of the court with the title of office noted.\u201d McKee notes that, although Judge Bethel verbally approved Rose\u2019s request for an arrest warrant and apparently drafted a warrant on her home computer, she did not provide Rose with a signed or written copy. In the absence of a signed and written warrant, McKee argues that both his arrest and the related search of his home were illegal. Based on the foregoing, McKee argues the District Court erred in denying his alternative motions to dismiss and to suppress, and asserts this Court ought to order the charges against him be dismissed. In the alternative, McKee asks that this Court order the suppression of all evidence gained after the alleged illegal entry into McKee\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b623 The State, in contrast, asserts the District Court correctly concluded that the arrest warrant in this case was valid. Conceding that there exists no statute in Montana explicitly authorizing telephonic arrest warrants, the State nevertheless argues the warrant in this case was valid because it complied with the substantive mandates of \u00a7 46-6-214(1), MCA. For instance, the State argues the warrant was based on probable cause, was supported by an oath, and particularly described the person to be seized. Pointing to the case of <em>State v. Andries </em>(Minn. 1980), 297 N.W.2d 124, the State asserts the statutory requirement that the warrant \u201cbe signed by the judge of the court with the title of office noted\u201d amounts to nothing more than a ministerial task, and that Judge Bethel\u2019s failure to sign the warrant at issue did not affect its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b624 In <em>Andries, </em>the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the validity of a search warrant \u201cauthorized over the telephone by a judge who fully complied with the requirements of the relevant statutes except that he did not personally sign the warrant but instead delegated that ministerial act to the applicant.\u201d <em>Andries, </em>297 N.W.2d at 125. In that case, a county attorney with probable cause to believe that marijuana would be found at a certain residence, sought telephone authorization for a search warrant from a judge located eighty-five miles away. <em>Andries, </em>297 N.W.2d at 125. The judge convened a three-way conference call with the county attorney and the deputy sheriff involved in the case, during which the deputy sheriff signed and read an affidavit prepared by the county attorney, and read a proposed warrant. <em>Andries, </em>297 N.W.2d at 125. The judge determined there was probable cause upon which to base a search warrant, and \u201cdelegated to the deputy the task of signing the judge\u2019s name to the warrant.\u201d <em>Andries, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>297 N.W.2d at 125. In upholding the warrant\u2019s validity despite the absence of a statute explicitly authorizing telephonic search warrants, the court in <em>Andries </em>cautioned that it did \u201cnot mean to sanction the indiscriminate use of such a procedure,\u201d but noted that under the circumstances of that case \u201cthere was a demonstrated need for such a warrant, the procedures specified in the statute were substantially followed, and a record was made which was thereafter available for use by defendant in challenging the issuance of the warrant.\u201d <em>Andries, </em>297 N.W.2d at 125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b625 Under the circumstances present in this case, we decline the State\u2019s invitation to follow the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Andries </em>and to declare the statutory requirement that the authorizing judge sign an arrest warrant an inconsequential, ministerial task. Section 46-6-214(1), MCA, clearly mandates that an arrest warrant \u201cbe in writing\u201d and \u201cbe signed by the judge\u201d by whom it is issued. It is undisputed that, for whatever reason, Judge Bethel never signed the warrant she drafted for McKee\u2019s arrest. Moreover, although the District Court record in this case does contain a copy of the unsigned warrant, presumably drafted and dated by Judge Bethel on the afternoon of December 24, 1994, whether the warrant was actually in writing at the time of McKee\u2019s arrest is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b626  Furthermore, in light of the fact that two individuals agreed to stand guard over the McKee residence in Officer Rose\u2019s absence, and in light of the relatively short distance between Officer Rose\u2019s location and Judge Bethel\u2019s residence, we conclude the State has failed to adequately demonstrate its need for the immediate issuance of a telephonic arrest warrant. Finally, we note that the conversation between Officer Rose and Judge Bethel, and upon which Judge Bethel relied in authorizing McKee\u2019s arrest, was not recorded. Thus, although Judge Bethel documented the facts upon which she made her probable cause determination, there exists no electronic recording upon which McKee may rely in challenging the warrant at issue. Based on the foregoing, we hold the District Court erred in concluding that McKee was arrested pursuant to a valid arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b627  Having so held, we must next determine whether the appropriate remedy lies in a dismissal of all charges, or the suppression of any evidence seized after the illegal arrest. We have recognized that the appropriate course of action in the event of an illegal arrest is not to dismiss all charges, but to suppress all evidence seized or otherwise gained as a result of the arrest. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hendrickson </em>(1997), 238 Mont. 105, 112, 939 P.2d 985, 989; <em>City of Billings v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>Whalen </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 293, 298, 790 P.2d 471, 475 (concluding that, where an arrest is illegal, \u201call evidence against defendant seized as a result of such arrest is inadmissible.\u201d); <em>State v. Ellinger </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 349, 356, 725 P.2d 1201, 1205 (recognizing that \u201can unlawful arrest has no impact on subsequent prosecution\u201d and that such an arrest does not prevent the State from proceeding with criminal charges). Accordingly, the appropriate remedy in the instant case is for the court to suppress all evidence gained as a result of the invalid arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b628 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that although the court did not err in denying McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss, it did err in denying his motion to suppress all evidence gained as a result of the invalid arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b629 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
