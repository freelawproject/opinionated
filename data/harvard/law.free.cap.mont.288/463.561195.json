We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b62 Heath began working as a dispatcher for the City of Lewistown Police Department on April 2,1996. The police department is located in the Lewistown City Building. This building fronts on Watson Street, a public street maintained by the City of Lewistown. Adjacent to and abutting the street is a public sidewalk, which for ease of reference will be referred to as the \u201cWatson Street sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b63 On the side facing Watson Street, the Lewistown City Building has three separate entrances, one for the fire department, one for the police department, and the third for other city offices. Separate sidewalks link each of the three entrances to the Watson Street sidewalk. In addition to the front entrances, the police department has an additional entrance at the rear of the building. The police department\u2019s rear entrance is locked, but police department employees are provided keys to that entrance. Heath had not yet received a key when she was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b64 Parking lots are located behind the Lewistown City Building and adjacent to and on the right side of the building when viewed from Watson Street. A \u201cthroughway\u201d or alley separates the adjacent lot from the building. There is also a third parking lot across Watson Street from the building. The rear parking lot has several parking spaces reserved for police department employees. Otherwise, all spaces in the parking lots and on the street, with the exception of a fire lane directly across from the Lewistown City Building, are unreserved and open for parking not only by city employees but by the general public as well. The parking lot adjacent to the building serves both the Lewistown City Building and a nearby community center.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b65 Heath was not required to drive to work and was not paid to do so. She was told that she could park in any of the parking lots on or near the street, except on Watson Street immediately in front of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b66 On her second day of work, April 3, 1996, Heath left her home for work at approximately 7:30 a.m. She drove to work in her car, arriving at the Lewistown City Building approximately five minutes later. She parked in the lot adjacent to the building and after exiting her car walked across the throughway and then down the Watson Street sidewalk. As she approached the sidewalk leading to the police department, she slipped and fell, injuring herself. At the time of her fall she was still on the Watson Street sidewalk and had not entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the sidewalk leading to the police department. Moreover, at the time she fell, Heath\u2019s shift had not begun, she was not being paid, nor was she performing work-related duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b67 On the date of her injury, the City of Lewistown was insured by Montana Municipal Insurance Authority. Heath submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the City\u2019s insurer. The insurer denied the claim on the ground that Heath\u2019s injuries did not occur in the course and scope of her employment. Thereafter, Heath petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to enter an order requiring the insurer to accept liability for her injuries, to pay her medical expenses, and to determine and order payment for any disability arising from her injuries. Following discovery, the matter was submitted to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on cross motions for summary judgment. The motions were orally argued, and following Heath\u2019s deposition, the court deemed the motions submitted. On September 25, 1997, the court entered its order granting summary judgment to the City and dismissing Heath\u2019s petition with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b68 The sole issue presented by Heath on appeal is whether her injury of April 3, 1996, arose within the course and scope of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b69  This Court\u2019s standard of review of a grant or denial of summary judgment by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is the same as that used by the trial court in ruling upon the motion for summary judgment. <em>Heisler v. Hines Motor Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 270, 274, 937 P.2d 45, 47 (citations omitted). We determine whether there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our review of the court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary; we simply determine whether its legal conclusions are correct. <em>Loss v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 80-81, 936 P.2d 313, 314 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">\u00b610 In the case at bar, neither party contends that genuine issues of material fact are in dispute. Accordingly, we determine only whether the trial court correctly ruled in favor of the party entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We hold that the trial court did.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b6 11  Historically, the general rule in Montana is that employees are not covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act while going to and from work. This rule was established in <em>Murray Hospital v. Angrove </em>(1932), 92 Mont. 101, 109, 10 P.2d 577, 580, and has been reaffirmed in numerous cases during the intervening years. <em>See, e.g., Griffin v. Industrial Acc. Fund </em>(1940), 111 Mont. 110, 115, 106 P.2d 346, 348; <em>Hagerman v. Galen State Hospital </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 249, 251, 570 P.2d 893, 894; <em>Gorden v. H.C. Smith Const. Co. </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 166, 170, 612 P.2d 668, 670; <em>Courser v. Darby School Dist. No. 1 </em>(1984), 214 Mont. 13, 16, 692 P.2d 417, 418; <em>Correa v. Rexroat Tile </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 126, 128, 703 P.2d 160, 162; <em>Ogren v. Bitterroot Motors, Inc. </em>( 1986), 222 Mont. 515, 520, 723 P.2d 944, 947; <em>Hetland v. Magnum Petroleum </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 389, 391, 733 P.2d 343, 345; <em>Buhl v. Warm Springs State Hosp. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 363, 364, 769 P.2d 1258, 1259. The exceptions to this general rule of no coverage typically involve cases in which the employee is paid for his or her travel and/or the travel benefits the employer. <em>Hetland, </em>225 Mont. at 391, 733 P.2d at 345; <em>Courser, </em>214 Mont. at 16, 692 P.2d at 418-19.</p>\n<p id=\"AXF\">\u00b612 In 1987, the Legislature enacted a statute specifically addressing travel. This statute, \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA (1995), was in effect at the time of Heath\u2019s injury and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">(1) Each insurer is liable for the payment of compensation, in the manner and to the extent provided in this section, to an employee of an employer that it insures who receives an injury arising out of and in the course of employment or, in the case of death from the injury, to the employee\u2019s beneficiaries, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">(3) An employee who suffers an injury or dies while traveling is not covered by this chapter unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">(a) (i) the employer furnishes the transportation or the employee receives reimbursement from the employer for costs of travel, gas, oil, or lodging as a part of the employee\u2019s benefits or employment agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">(ii) the travel is necessitated by and on behalf of the employer as an integral part or condition of the employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">(b) the travel is required by the employer as part of the employee\u2019s job duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u00b613 In <em>State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund v. James </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 348, 849 P.2d 187, we noted that this statute encompassed the historical \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule as well as the exceptions which had evolved to it over the years. <em>James, </em>257 Mont. at 350, 849 P.2d at 188-89. <em>Accord Dale v. Trade Street, Inc. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 349, 357, 854 P.2d 828, 832- 33; <em>Carrillo v. Liberty Northwest Ins. </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 1, 8, 922 P.2d 1189, 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b614 In <em>James, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">Under subparagraph (b), [of \u00a7 39-71-407(3)] the employee is not covered unless the travel is required as \u201cpart of\u2019 the employee\u2019s job duties. Prior to the enactment of the above statute, we held in <em>Massey v. Selensky </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 101, 731 P.2d 906, that the general rule was that travel to and from an employee\u2019s place of work was outside the <em>course and scope </em>of his employment. We here construe the phrase \u201cas part of\u2019 from paragraph(b) of \u00a7 39-71-407(3), MCA, as equivalent to the phrase \u201cin the course and scope of\u2019 employment from the previous common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>James, </em>257 Mont. at 352, 849 P.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b615  Here, applying the facts of this case to the elements of the statute as interpreted in <em>James </em>and our prior case law, it is clear that Heath cannot satisfy the statutory exception in order to claim compensation for injury while traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b616 Heath was traveling to work at the time of her slip and fall. It is undisputed that the City did not furnish Heath transportation nor did it reimburse her for any costs of travel, gas, or oil as part of her benefits or employment agreement. Heath\u2019s travel was not necessitated by or on behalf of her employer as an integral part or condition of her employment and, of particular importance here, Heath\u2019s travel was not required by her employer as part of her job duties. She was simply on her way to work. In this regard, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly noted that going to and from work does not in itself provide a special benefit to the employer. \u201cIf merely securing the employee\u2019s presence at work is in every case a \u2018special benefit,\u2019 the exception swallows up the rule.\u201d <em>Buhl, </em>236 Mont. at 365, 769 P.2d at 1259. Clearly, on the facts here and given the requirements of the statute and our prior case law, Heath was not in the course and scope of her employment when she was injured traveling to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b617 Notwithstanding, Heath argues that our decision in <em>Nicholson v. Roundup Coal Mining Co. </em>(1927), 79 Mont. 358, 257 P. 270, mandates a different result. In that case we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The employer has control of the ways of ingress and egress within its property and leading to and from the place of work, and it is universally held that, where an industrial accident occurs while an employee is going to or from work while on the premises of the employer and while passing over ways of egress and ingress furnished by the employer, without deviation for purposes of his own, an injury suffered by reason of the accident arose out of and in the course of his employment, as he was under the protection of, and using the things furnished him by, his employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asz\"><em>Nicholson, </em>79 Mont. at 379-80, 257 P. at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b6 18  In further support of her position that her case falls outside the statute because her accident did not occur away from the employer\u2019s premises, Heath cites to several pages ofVolume 4 of Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. The cited sections state that benefits are properly awarded to the injured employee under circumstances where the employee travels along or across a public road between two portions of the employer\u2019s premises either going, coming or pursuing his active duties. This view would include travel on a parking lot owned or maintained by the employer and an off-premises route of travel which lies on the normal route which employees must traverse to reach their employment. Heath contends that where the employee is injured on the employer\u2019s premises or within the \u201czone of employment,\u201d compensation should be awarded for injuries sustained. Heath maintains that because the City maintained the sidewalk on which she fell she was, thus, on her employer\u2019s premises and that the going and coming rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b619 We rejected a similar contention in <em>Griffin v. Industrial Acc. Fund </em>(1940), 111 Mont. 110, 106 P.2d 346, wherein we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">The rule has been settled in this state that a workman is not entitled to compensation for injuries received while traveling to and from his place of work by an instrumentality not under the control of the employer, and when he is subjected only to the ordinary street hazards common to all pedestrians. <em>[Citing Murray Hospital v. Angrove, </em>supra.] Here it is true that the instrumentality causing the injury \u2014 the sidewalk \u2014 was an instrumentality under the control of the employer \u2014 the city; in other words, the injury occurred on premises under the control of the employer. <em>But unless the instrumentality causing the injury, or the premises on which the injury occurred were used in connection with the actual place of work where the employer carried on the business in which the employee was engaged, there can be no recovery.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>Griffin, </em>111 Mont. at 115, 106 P.2d at 348 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b620 Here, Heath was not required to drive to work, was not assigned a parking space or provided with any special parking area, and was traversing a public sidewalk when injured. She had not reached the sidewalk leading into her workplace and was, therefore, not on a sidewalk used only by employees or persons conducting City business. <em>See McMillen v. Arthur G. McKee and Company </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 400, 404, 533 P.2d 1095, 1097 (\u201cthe sidewalk was not used by the employer in carrying on his business in which the employee was employed and consequently the employee was injured only by an ordinary street hazard common to all pedestrians\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b621 While Heath attempts to distinguish <em>Griffin </em>on the basis that her place of injury \u201cdid not occur at a location distant from the place of employment\u201d our decision in <em>Voorhies v. Park Cafe, Inc. </em>(1978), 175 Mont. 232, 573 P.2d 202, made clear that the legal principle applicable to sidewalks and other public ways does not fade or disappear as the worker gets closer to her place of employment. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">There is no legal support in the record to suggest that Montana has recognized the so-called \u201cspecial hazard\u201d doctrine. The fact there was ice in the alley [behind claimant\u2019s place of employment and where she parked her vehicle] would not present a special hazard for cafe employees. Any person traversing the alley would be subject to the same condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-7\"><em>Voorhies, </em>175 Mont. at 234, 573 P.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b622 Furthermore, the facts in the case at bar are distinguishable from <em>Nicholson. </em>In that case a coal miner died of shock when he was exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations as he exited the mine through a tunnel into which outside air was being forced. We agreed that the miner\u2019s death occurred in the course of his employment and that he was \u201cplaced in a position wherein he was ... specially and peculiarly subject to a risk and danger not shared by members of the community generally. <em>...\u2019\u2019 Nicholson, </em>79 Mont. at 379, 257 P. at 275. There, the tunnel was part of the employer\u2019s premises and was used by miners to enter and leave the mine and was not open to the general public. That is obviously not the fact situation in this case. Heath was injured when she slipped and fell on a public sidewalk adjacent to her employer\u2019s premises and she was not specially and peculiarly subject to any risk and danger not shared by members of the community generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u00b623 Moreover, we made clear in <em>Strickland v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 254, 901 P.2d 1391, that whether injuries sustained while traveling to and from work are compensable is governed solely by \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA, and that subsection (3) of this statute \u201cprovides the only circumstances under which an employee\u2019s travel-related injuries are compensable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>273 Mont. at 258-59, 901 P.2d at 1394.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b624  Finally, Heath attempts to avoid the statutory requirements on the basis that at the time of her slip and fall she was no longer traveling to work but, in fact, had arrived. Heath\u2019s argument, however, is not supported by the record. In her deposition Heath admitted that at the time of her fall she was still on her way to work.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZWc\">Q. At the time of \u2014 what is your best estimate of what the time was when you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">A. I would say once again probably between 25 and 20 till the hour of 8:00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Q. And you were not being paid at that time, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">Q. Your shift hadn\u2019t started at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">Q. And you weren\u2019t performing any work related duties at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">Q. Just on your way to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-15\">Q. On a sidewalk that the general public traverses also, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-16\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-17\">Q. Coming from a parking lot where the general public parks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-18\">A. They can, correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">\u00b625 In summary, we conclude that on the undisputed facts in this case, Heath is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injury which she sustained traveling to her place of employment. She has failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-407(3), MCA, and accordingly, her petition was properly dismissed with prejudice by way of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-21\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, GRAY and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
