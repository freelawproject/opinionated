(Madison). Madison also cross-appeals from one of the court\u2019s rulings on its cross-motion for summary judgment. We reverse the trial court\u2019s decision as to the issue on appeal; we affirm as to the issue on cross-appeal; and we remand for further proceedings and entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion. Finally, we dismiss with prejudice as moot American\u2019s appeal of the summary judgment rendered in favor of Valley Bank of Helena (Valley Bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u00b62 The dispositive facts are not in dispute. David Gauvin (David) operated a Helena excavation business. In January 1991, American loaned David and his then wife, Marlene, nearly $32,000 evidenced by a promissory note and secured by a 1989 Caterpillar backhoe (the collateral or the backhoe). American properly perfected its security interest in the collateral in February 1991, by the filing of a financing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>statement with the Secretary of State. David and Marlene divorced in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b63 In the spring of 1994, David was inj nred and his loan, then paid down to under $14,000, went into default. Following his accident, David advertised his business equipment, including the backhoe, for sale. On July 5, 1994, representatives of Madison came to Helena, inspected the equipment, and agreed to purchase some of it, including the backhoe, for a total price of $35,000. As a deposit, Madison left a check for $5,000 payable to David and to David\u2019s girlfriend, Debra White (Debra), with Debra. Debra was acting on David\u2019s behalf, apparently as his attorney in fact. Madison\u2019s representatives then returned home. On that same day Debra called American and asked for and was given a current pay-off figure for David\u2019s loan. Debra also advised American\u2019s employee, Jo Ann Jones (Jo Ann), that David would be selling the backhoe and paying off the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b64 On July 7,1994, a representative of Madison returned to Helena and delivered to David and Debra a $30,000 check for the balance of the purchase price. The check was payable to both David and Debra. Madison had actual knowledge of American\u2019s perfected lien in David\u2019s equipment, and though instructed to obtain lien releases at the time of payment, Madison\u2019s representative failed to do so. Upon taking delivery of the $30,000 check, David and Debra drove from Helena to Bozeman where they cashed the check at a local bank. The proceeds were paid to th\u00e9m in the form of $10,000 in cash to David and a $20,000 cashier\u2019s check payable to Debra.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b65 The following day, July 8, David went to Valley Bank in Helena and presented the $20,000 cashier\u2019s check showing his and Debra\u2019s endorsements. He then negotiated this check and purchased from the proceeds a Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check payable to American for $13,703.31. This check was in the amount of and designated as the pay-off for his American loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b66 That same day, the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check was delivered to American by means and person(s) undetermined. In any event, the check for the loan pay-off was on the desk of loan officer Della Ranard (Della) when she returned from lunch. On finding the check, Della stamped \u201cPAID\u201d on the promissory note; executed a lien release to be sent to the Secretary of State; placed the note and lien release in envelopes for mailing; and deposited the envelopes with the enclosed documents in American\u2019s outgoing mail basket.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b67 Later on July 8, however, Della received a call from Valley Bank. Valley Bank advised Della that Debra had notified the Bank that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>$20,000 check from the Bozeman bank payable to her which David used to purchase the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check payable to American was stolen and that her endorsement was forged by David. Valley Bank requested Della to stop the pay-off of David\u2019s loan. This Della did. She then retrieved the note marked \u201cPAID\u201d and the lien release from the outgoing mail basket and wrote \u201cStamped in error\u201d next to the \u201cPAID\u201d stamp on the note and thereafter regarded the note as still unpaid. Subsequently, Valley Bank called again, and, at its request, Della returned the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check to that institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">\u00b68 On July 15, David and Debra went to Valley Bank. The District Court found that at that time Valley Bank learned that the original $20,000 check had not been stolen from Debra nor had her signature been forged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, Debra requested and obtained the return of her $20,000 check, and the two left the Bank for parts unknown. American\u2019s loan was not repaid and its lien on the collateral purchased by Madison was not released (except to the extent that it was replaced by a cash bond filed by Madison as part of this litigation which cash bond has now been paid over to Madison as a result of the trial court\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b69 Subsequently, American sued David and Marlene to recover on the note. American also sued Madison to recover possession of the collateral. Debra was added as a defendant in an amended complaint. Madison counter-claimed seeking to quiet its title to the collateral it purchased from David as against American\u2019s perfected security interest. Subsequently, by a second amended complaint, American joined Valley Bank as a defendant on the theory that, if American lost its rights in the collateral as against Madison, then American should be indemnified by Valley Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b610 Following discovery, American and Madison filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After briefing and a hearing, the District Court ruled in favor of Madison and against American holding that Madison had superior rights in the collateral but that American had not agreed to David\u2019s sale of the collateral in a manner inconsistent with its security agreement. American timely appealed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Madison cross-appealed. American also appealed the court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Valley Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b611 In American\u2019s appeal we address the issue of which party\u2014 American or Madison \u2014 has superior rights to the collateral in dispute. By way of its cross-appeal, Madison raises the issue of whether American waived its rights under its written security agreement by acquiescing to David\u2019s sale of the collateral in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the security agreement. We will address each of these issues in turn. We also summarily dispose of American\u2019s appeal against Valley Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b612  This case is on appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by American and by Madison. Our standard of review in appeals from a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling is <em>de </em>novo; we apply the same criteria and evaluation as the district court based on Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. The initial burden is on the movant to demonstrate that there exist no genuine issues of material fact. That having been accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to show, by more than mere denial and speculation, that genuine issues of material fact do exist. If the court concludes that there are no genuine issues of material fact, then it must determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Our review of the court\u2019s legal conclusions is plenary. <em>Montana Public Emp. Assoc. v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>1998 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 287 Mont. 229, \u00b6 8, 954 P.2d 21, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted). In the case at bar, since the facts are not disputed, we need only determine whether the District Court\u2019s application of the law to these facts is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">\u00b613 The ultimate question to be answered in every commercial transaction gone bad is: \u2018Who is to bear the loss; who will be the \u2018stuckee\u2019?\u201d In the instant case, the trial court determined that party to be American. In so ruling, the court reasoned that American had not in any way consented to David\u2019s sale of the collateral as contemplated by \u00a7 30-9-306(2), MCA, when it cooperated in giving Debra a loan pay-off figure. Nonetheless, the District Court held that American\u2019s perfected lien along with the underlying debt was discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pursuant to \u00a7 30-3-310(1), MCA, when American took the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check. The court agreed with Madison\u2019s argument that American had no obligation to return the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check and that, in doing so, American waived its absolute right to insist that Valley Bank honor the check and to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">\u00b614 Subject to exceptions not applicable here, the parties do not dispute that, as between a holder of a perfected security interest in collateral (here, American) and a purchaser of that collateral (Madison), the security interest follows the collateral and any identifiable proceeds therefrom notwithstanding sale, exchange or other disposition, unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise. Section 30-9-306(2), MCA. Therefore, unless American lost its lien, its security interest takes priority notwithstanding Madison\u2019s purchase of the collateral. It is this question of which party has superior rights in the collateral that we first address.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b615 <em>Which party </em>\u2014 American <em>or Madison </em>\u2014 has <em>superior rights in the collateral?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b616 Commercial paper is a vital component of the economy of this and other nations and is the means by which commerce is transacted. Accordingly, rules governing the issuance, utilization, honoring and dishonoring of commercial paper have developed over time and have been uniformly accepted and applied. Our present rules find their origins in the Law Merchant of England. Previously codified as the Uniform Sales Act and Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, Montana, like other states, has now enacted these and other commercial laws through its adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The transactions here at issue are governed by these laws and in particular by the laws pertaining to negotiable instruments codified in Title 30, Chapter 3 of the Montana Code Annotated.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b617 \u201cChecks\u201d are negotiable instruments and encompass drafts, cashier\u2019s checks and teller\u2019s checks. Section 30-3-104(1) and (6), MCA. A cashier\u2019s check is a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank. Section 30-3-104(7), MCA. Acceptance of a draft is the drawee\u2019s signed agreement to honor the draft as presented. Section 30-3-410(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b618 Citing <em>Kaufman v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1973), 370 F. Supp. 276, 279, and other authorities, Madison argues that a cashier\u2019s check is the equivalent of cash because the issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>bank stands behind the check and pledges its resources to the payment of the amount of the check on presentation. According to Madison, a bank may not dishonor such an instrument, for to do so would be inconsistent with the issuing bank\u2019s representations and would undermine public confidence in the bank and its checks and thus deprive the cashier\u2019s check of its essential utility as a \u201ccash equivalent\u201d. Accordingly, Madison contends that Valley Bank\u2019s cashier\u2019s check was good as against all the world and was impervious to dishonor. Thus, Madison contends that American had the right and obligation to hold the cashier\u2019s check, to refuse Valley Bank\u2019s request to return the instrument, to insist that the check be paid according to its terms, and to apply the proceeds of the check in discharge of David\u2019s loan and lien. According to Madison and the trial court, the fact that American \u201cgratuitously\u201d returned the check to Valley Bank, did not obviate American\u2019s obligation to discharge David\u2019s loan and to release its lien on the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b619  Given Madison\u2019s arguments and the trial court\u2019s reasoning along these lines, it is appropriate that we begin our analysis by expressing our disagreement with Madison\u2019s basic premise \u2014 that an issuing bank may not dishonor its cashier\u2019s check. While it is true that cashier\u2019s checks may be considered as \u201ccash equivalents\u201d in the minds of the public and in commercial trade, and while various courts and commentators have taken the view, typically on public policy grounds, that an issuing bank may not assert its own defenses against or dishonor its cashier\u2019s check, this rule is neither as universal nor as absolute as Madison suggests. (See, for example, <em>Stringfellow v. First American Nat. Bank </em>(Tenn. 1994), 878 S.W.2d 940. Although the appellate court ultimately sides with Madison\u2019s approach, the appellate court discusses the differing lines of authority and the arguments for each.)</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b620 Importantly, \u201cnothing in the U.C.C. suggests that cashier\u2019s checks should be treated differently from other instruments subject to Articles 3 and 4 [Title 30, chapters 3 and 4, MCA].\u201d <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants State Bank v. Western Bank </em>(9th Cir. 1987), 841 F.2d 1433, 1440. See also <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. G &amp; M Const. Corp. </em>(D. Md. 1982), 544 F. Supp. 736, 746; <em>Santos v. First Nat\u2019l State Bank of N.J. </em>(N.J. Super.Ct.App.Div. 1982), 451 A.2d 401, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b621 Thus, and despite the \u201ccash equivalent\u201d approach, other courts have acknowledged that in limited circumstances an issuing bank may dishonor its cashier\u2019s check. See, for example, the following and the cases cited therein: <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants State Bank, </em>841 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>at 1438-41; <em>Godat v. Mercantile Bank of Northwest Cty. </em>(Mo.Ct.App. E.D. 1994), 884 S.W. 2d 1, 3-4; <em>Rezapolvi v. First Nat. Bank of Maryland </em>(Md. 1983), 459 A.2d 183, 188-89. Appropriate to our later discussion in this opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Rezapolvi </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\">Despite the language in some opinions suggesting that a bank may never dishonor its cashier\u2019s check, courts have recognized that a bank may do so under very limited conditions. These are where the holder has dealt with the bank in connection with the transaction or is not a holder in due course, <em>and </em>where the cashier\u2019s check was obtained by fraud upon the bank or under certain circumstances, where there was no consideration given to the bank for the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><em>Rezapolvi, </em>459 A.2d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b622 Accordingly, contrary to Madison\u2019s basic argument, depending upon the status of the funds used to purchase the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check and American\u2019s status \u2014 i.e., whether it was or was not a holder in due course under the UCC as regards this transaction \u2014 American was not in the unassailable position that Madison argues it was. Indeed, the fact that the aborted loan pay-off at issue here was initiated by the delivery of a cashier\u2019s check does not, in and of itself, dispose of this case. Rather, it is necessary that we look to other provisions of Montana\u2019s UCC as those are applicable to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b623 Underlying the District Court\u2019s decision and Madison\u2019s arguments is the premise that American initially took the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check for value, in good faith and without notice of any defect or defense with the result that the subsequent notice of the stolen nature of the funds used to purchase the instrument did not defeat American\u2019s ability to negotiate the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check free of defenses. The trial court and Madison reason that American\u2019s return of the check instead of presenting it for payment was a gratuitous act. Thus, the debt was still deemed discharged and the lien released.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u00b624 For this approach to be legally supportable, however, it must first be established that American was a holder in due course \u2014 a concept not addressed in the trial court\u2019s decision. That is, if American enjoyed holder-in-due-course status before it returned the check to Valley Bank, then Madison and the trial court are correct. American could have presented the check to Valley Bank for payment free of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>defenses and it should have insisted that Valley Bank pay the check. Section 30-3-305, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b625 If American was not a holder in due course, then \u00a7 30-3-306, MCA, comes into play. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Thus, since David stole the funds he used to purchase the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check delivered to American, American\u2019s claim to the check was subject to Debra\u2019s ownership interest in the funds stolen to purchase it. Furthermore, American\u2019s claim to the check was subject to Valley Bank\u2019s ability to refuse payment and assert Debra\u2019s ownership interest as a defense, subject only to joining Debra in the lawsuit to also personally assert her claim of theft. Section 30-3-305(3), MCA. See also Official Comment No. 4 to 1991 Amendment of \u00a7 30-3-305, MCA. Accordingly, whether American was a holder in due course of the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check is critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u00b626  Under \u00a7 30-3-302(1), MCA, a holder in due course is one who holds an instrument if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(a) the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(b) the holder took the instrument:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">(i) for value;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">(ii) in good faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">(iii) without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-14\">(iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-15\">(v) without notice of any claim to the instrument stated in 30-3-306; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-16\">(vi) without notice that any party to the instrument has any defense or claim in recoupment stated in 30-3-305(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">The elements of this statute being in the conjunctive, all must be present; the failure to meet any one of the requirements defeats the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>holder-in-due-course status. <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants State Bank, </em>841 F.2d at 1443; <em>Godat, </em>884 S.W.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b627 In short, unless American could have demonstrated that it had already taken the instrument in good faith and for value at the time it was notified that the funds used to purchase the Valley Bank check were stolen, then it was not a holder in due course and, as pointed out above, American\u2019s claim to the check would have been subject to Debra\u2019s property interest in the check (\u00a7 30-3-306, MCA) and to Valley Bank\u2019s ability to dishonor the instrument (\u00a7 30-3-305(3), MCA, and <em>Rezapolvi, </em>459 A.2d at 188-89). It follows, then, that we must determine whether, on the facts here, American satisfied the statutory requirements for obtaining holder-in-due-course status. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b628  While American initially received the Valley Bank check in good faith and without notice of the underlying theft, once American was advised of the theft it could not go forward in \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cwithout notice\u201d of Debra\u2019s adverse claim and Valley Bank\u2019s defenses. \u201cGood faith\u201d means \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d Section 30-3-102(1)(d), MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4\">Although fair dealing is a broad term that must be defined in context, it is clear that it is concerned with the fairness of conduct rather than the care with which an act is performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 3-103 cmt. 4, 2 U.L.A. 24 (1990). We would be hard-pressed to conclude that honesty in fact and fairness of conduct would allow a financial institution to negotiate an instrument once having been notified that the instrument was stolen or was purchased with stolen funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b629 As to notice, \u201c[njotice, knowledge or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time when it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction. ...\u201d Section 30-1-201(27), MCA. \u201cTo be effective, notice must be received at such time and in such manner as to give a reasonable opportunity to act on it.\u201d Section 30-3-302(6), MCA. There is no dispute that American was notified of the theft of funds used to purchase the Valley Bank check prior to the note marked \u201cPAID\u201d and the lien release leaving American\u2019s business premises. At the time it received notice, American still had time and was fully capable of reversing the administrative steps it had taken to process the loan pay-off. Thus, the notice of the theft given American by Valley Bank was an effective notice that American could not simply ignore.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00b630  Given the timing of the delivery of the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check to American followed by American\u2019s processing of the loan pay-off and the subsequent notice of the stolen nature of the funds, the crucial inquiry then becomes: Had American taken the instrument \u201cfor value\u201d by the time notice was received? If American took the cashier\u2019s check for value prior to Valley Bank\u2019s notice, then all of the \u00a7 30-3-302(1), MCA, elements would have been satisfied and American would have enjoyed the status of a holder in due course. To the contrary, if, at the time of Valley Bank\u2019s notification, American had not yet given value for the check \u2014 if American had not yet irrevocably changed its position \u2014 then the statutory elements would not have been satisfied (and could not thereafter be satisfied) and American would not be a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b631 \u201cValue\u201d is defined in \u00a7 30-3-303, MCA. This statute, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(1) An instrument is issued or transferred for value if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(a) the instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(b) the transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by judicial proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(c) the instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an existing obligation of any person, whether or not the obligation is due;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(d) the instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">(e) the instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">\u00b632 American argues that the applicable provision of this statute is subsection (l)(a); Madison contends that subsection (l)(c) controls. We conclude that it is unnecessary that we decide which subsection is appropriate, for under either American did not give value or irrevocably change its position before receiving Valley Bank\u2019s notice.</p>\n<p id=\"An6\">\u00b633 As noted by the court in <em>Godat:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">\u201cOne can only take \u2018for value\u2019 by giving in return something \u2018of value\u2019 to the one from whom the instrument is taken.\u201d \u201cGood faith\u201d is in large part a subjective test but \u201cfor value\u201d is objective. Plaintiff\u2019s position essentially eliminates the objective \u201cfor value\u201d requirement by substituting therefore a subjective belief that value is being given. The premise of the \u201cholder in due course\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>doctrine is to protect those persons who part with something of value in reliance on the negotiability of a check or other instrument. Persons who give up nothing of value do not need the protection of the doctrine because they put nothing at risk and give up nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><em>Godat, </em>884 S.W.2d at 6 (citing <em>Blue Cross Health Services v. Sauer </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1990), 800 S.W.2d 72).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b634 That was American\u2019s situation here. When it first received the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check, American had no notice or knowledge of the stolen nature of the funds. Neither had it parted with value, however. American\u2019s stamping the note \u201cPAID,\u201d its executing the lien release, and its placing these documents in the outgoing mail basket, were merely internal administrative actions which, up until the point in time that the documents were placed into the possession of the post office for delivery, did not irrevocably commit American to the pay-off. To that point, American was just as capable of administratively reversing the steps it had taken to process the loan pay-off as it was in performing those steps in the first place. The note had not actually been returned \u201cpaid\u201d nor had American\u2019s lien actually been released. American had not irrevocably changed its position. At the point it received notice from Valley Bank, nothing which American had accomplished in processing the loan pay-off had any effect on American\u2019s secured position. Objectively, at that point, American had given up nothing; it had put nothing at risk. American had not given value \u2014 even assuming that it subjectively believed that value was being given when it commenced the loan pay-off process. <em>Godat, </em>884 S.W.2d at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b635 Putting this within the framework of \u00a7 30-3-303(1)(a), MCA, American effectively agreed that it would discharge the note and release the lien on David\u2019s equipment in exchange for payment of his debt. American was in the process of performing its end of this bargain when it was notified by Valley Bank of the underlying stolen nature of the funds which had been transferred to American. If (1)(a) is the applicable subsection, after notification American would be a holder in due course only to the extent that it had actually performed, i.e., to the extent that it had actually discharged the note and released the collateral lien. See Hawkland &amp; Lawrence UCC Series \u00a7 3-303:02 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The holder is, in essence, required to mitigate the damages of the party having the defense. Discovering a defense to the instrument he bargained for will usually permit the holder to suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the remainder of his counter-performance. Not being required to perform, the holder is not given holder in due course status and is, thus, not permitted to increase the obligor\u2019s loss by rendering an excused performance. The holder is not usually harmed by his suspension of performance. Since a negotiable instrument is simply a promise to pay money, the holder will not be deprived, as in the case of a contract to purchase goods, of some needed commodity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agp\">Hawkland &amp; Lawrence UCC Series \u00a7 3-303:02 (1994). Since American was fully capable of administratively undoing the loan pay-off and retaining its secured position, it was required to suspend performance. Had it proceeded in the face of Valley Bank\u2019s notice, American could not have claimed holder-in-due-course status.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b636 Similarly, in the context of \u00a7 30-3-303(1)(c), MCA, the result is the same on these facts. While the Valley Bank check was issued to American in payment of David\u2019s antecedent obligation, American had not given value because it had not actually released its security interest in the collateral; it had not irrevocably committed itself to the transaction; it had not put its secured position at risk. Again, while it had taken certain internal administrative steps toward discharging the note and releasing the lien, those could all be administratively rescinded and, in fact, were rescinded. Having not irrevocably released its security interest, American had not taken the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check for value by the time it received notice. See Hawkland &amp; Lawrence UCC Series \u00a7 3-303:06 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b637 In short, under either \u00a7 30-3-303(l)(a) or (l)(c), MCA, American did not give value and was, therefore, not a holder in due course. It took the cashier\u2019s check subject to Debra\u2019s possessory and property interest and subject to Valley Bank\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b638 As regards the trial court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 30-3-310(1), MCA, we conclude that the court erred by not first determining whether American was a holder in due course of the cashier\u2019s check. Section 30-3-310(1), MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Unless otherwise agreed, if a ... cashier\u2019s check ... is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Madison maintains that, under this law of \u201cabsolute payment,\u201d the payee/obligee (here, American) who takes a cashier\u2019s check no longer has recourse against the remitter/obligor (David) because the obligation is discharged with the result that the payee/obligee (American) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>has recourse only on the instrument against the issuing bank (here, Valley Bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\u00b639 As a general proposition, we do not disagree. If, in fact, American \u201ctook\u201d the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check for David\u2019s obligation, then, clearly, under \u00a7 30-3-310(1), MCA, David\u2019s obligation is discharged and Madison must prevail as against American. This, however, begs the question: Did American \u201ctake\u201d the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check under the facts of this case? For the reasons set forth above, we determine that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b640 Moreover, both parties and the trial court rely on <em>Transamerica Insurance Company v. Long </em>(W.D. Pa. 1970), 318 F.Supp. 156, in support of their respective positions. We do not find this case at odds with our decision here. While the court ruled that cashier\u2019s checks are like money and that title passes with delivery, the court also made it clear that if the recipient takes stolen funds with knowledge of the theft \u2014 with <em>mala fides, </em>in the words of the court \u2014 then the holder\u2019s title will be defeated. <em>Transamerica, </em>318 F.Supp. at 160. Again, in the case at bar, before American \u201ctook\u201d the cashier\u2019s check it had received notice of the stolen nature of the funds used to purchase the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check. Under such circumstances its title would be defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b641 Finally, our discussion would not be complete without also observing that this case seemingly proves the adage that \u201cno good deed goes unpunished.\u201d In spite of doing what most would agree was honest, responsible, fair and morally correct, American\u2019s reward for \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d was the loss of its security interest and any real ability to obtain payment for the loan it made to David. American was determined to be the \u201cstuckee\u201d despite its being the least blameworthy of all of the participants in this unfortunate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b642 Of the players, Madison was in the best position to protect itself. It had constructive and actual knowledge of American\u2019s security interest. Yet, it delivered two checks payable to David and Debra without taking any of the commercially reasonable steps to protect its purchase that are common in these sorts of transactions. Madison could have insisted on the lien release before payment; it could have withheld part of the payment pending the lien release; it could have confirmed the pay-off amount and paid part of the proceeds directly to American; it could have made payment jointly to American to the extent of its security interest; it could have gone with David to American and witnessed the pay-off and obtained a release; or it could have escrowed the payment until the lien release was obtained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Madison did none of these things. Instead, it merely relied on David\u2019s bald assurance that American\u2019s lien would be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b643 Likewise, Valley Bank could have verified that Debra\u2019s endorsement on the Bozeman bank\u2019s check used to purchase the $20,000 cashier\u2019s check was valid. It did not. Then, of course, there are the real culprits, David and Debra, whose scam left Madison, American and Valley Bank all holding the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b644 In a shoot-out using the weapons of the UCC, there is no guarantee that the survivor will be the party wearing the white hat. Fortunately however, on the facts of this case, the proper application of the code produces not only the correct legal result, but also the one most justifiable from a good public policy, common sense and basic fairness point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b645  We hold that the District Court\u2019s decision on summary judgment awarding superior rights in the collateral to Madison was in error and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u00b646 <em>Did American waive its rights under its written security agreement by acquiescing to David\u2019s sale of the collateral in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the security agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b647  By way of cross appeal, Madison argues that the District Court erred in not ruling that American waived its rights under its written security agreement and, thus, extinguished its lien by \u201cauthorizing\u201d David\u2019s sale of the collateral. Specifically, on July 5, 1994, Debra called American to advise that the loan would be paid off and to obtain the pay-off figure. Jo Ann testified that she answered \u201cgood, I\u2019ll tell Della,\u201d when Debra stated that they (presumably David and Debra) were selling off the loader and expected to pay off the loan by Thursday, July 7th. Madison contends that in her July 5, 1994 conversation with Debra, Jo Ann, with knowledge of the troubled history of the loan, with knowledge of American\u2019s security interest, and with knowledge that the security agreement forbade sale of the collateral without written consent, nonetheless acquiesced in the disposal of the collateral without contemporaneously imposing commercially reasonable restrictions on the sale. Moreover, Madison maintains that a secured party authorizes its debtors\u2019 sale of the collateral when it accepts the proceeds from the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">\u00b648 The District Court concluded that American did not in any way consent to the sale and to the extinguishment of its security interest as contemplated by \u00a7 30-9-306(2), MCA, by merely cooperating in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>giving Debra a pay-off figure. We agree with the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">\u00b649 Section 30-9-306(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">Except where this chapter otherwise provides, a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale, exchange, or other disposition thereof unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise, and also continues in any identifiable proceeds including collections received by the debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">[T]he theory of subsection 9-306(2) and the other cutoff provisions in the [UCC] is that, if the secured party authorizes the sale, he or she should not legitimately be able to continue to look to the collateral as security. Further, a buyer under such circumstances is justified in believing that the collateral will not be looked to. However, when both the secured party and the buyer of the collateral expect the secured party to continue to look to the collateral as security, neither of those justifications exist. In 1990, the Permanent Editorial Board approved PEB Commentary No. 3 and supplemented the second paragraph of official Comment 3 to Section 9-306; both the Commentary and the supplemented Comment confirm the Editorial Board\u2019s position that a transferee will not acquire the collateral free and clear of the security interest if the secured party authorizes the disposition subject to his or her security interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Hawkland, Lord &amp; Lewis UCC Series \u00a7 9-306:2 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u00b650 In the case at bar, we cannot conclude that despite whatever knowledge of the history of David\u2019s loan she had at the time, Jo Ann\u2019s comment \u201cgood, I\u2019ll tell Della,\u201d in the context in which it was made, could have been construed by anyone as American\u2019s authorization or acquiescence that the loader could be sold free of American\u2019s perfected security interest. In fact, the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary. The record gives every indication that Debra, David, Madison and American all understood that David\u2019s loan would be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the equipment to Madison and that the disposition of the collateral was subject to American\u2019s security interest. There is no factual basis in the record here to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"AZl\">\u00b651  Madison also argues that American waived its rights under the security agreement. It is well established, however, that waiver is the voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known right and will be declared only when the waiving party clearly manifests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>such an intention. <em>McGregor v. Mommer </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 98, 110, 714 P.2d 536, 543 (citations omitted). The presence of voluntariness and requisite intent are necessarily questions of fact. <em>McGregor, </em>220 Mont at 110, 714 P.2d at 544. Again, there is no evidence in the record on appeal that American waived its rights under the security agreement. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. The trial court\u2019s finding that American did not consent to or authorize the sale of the collateral free of its security interest is supported by substantial evidence and must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b652  Finally, we find no merit to Madison\u2019s argument that American accepted the proceeds from the sale of the collateral and, thus, discharged David\u2019s obligation. As pointed out above, American did not accept the Valley Bank cashier\u2019s check, but, in fact, returned it to Valley Bank. American has never received any of the proceeds of the sale of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b653 We reject Madison\u2019s arguments on its cross appeal and affirm on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b654 <em>The judgment against Valley Bank.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u00b655 The District Court also rendered summary judgment in favor of Valley Bank and against American on American\u2019s claim of indemnity. While American also appealed from this summary judgment, given our decision as to Issues I and II, this appeal is moot and is properly dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b656 In summary, we hold that American retained its perfected security interest in the collateral and that its rights are superior to those of Madison. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s contrary decision and remand for further proceedings, including the assessment of attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 30-9-511, MCA, and costs against Madison, and for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion. The appeal against Valley Bank is dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\">. Whether the $20,000 check was or was not stolen and forged is not relevant to our decision. It is undisputed that at the time American received notification by Valley Bank and returned the check on July 8, both Valley Bank and American were operating on Debra\u2019s statement earlier that same day that the $20,000 check was stolen and forged. That she changed her story seven days later, does not alter the facts on July 8, and it is on those facts that we decide this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
