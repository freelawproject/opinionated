Vanorio now appeals that order of dismissal to this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00b62 The issue is whether the time allowed to appeal a justice court judgment to district court under \u00a7 25-33-102, MCA, is extended by three days under Rule 6 of the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure (M. J.C.C.R.Civ.P), which provides for three days\u2019 additional time after service by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b63 On July 28, 1997, Northwest Collectors, Inc., obtained a judgment in the Ravalli County Justice Court against Vanorio for a debt and an associated collection fee. On September 2,1997, Vanorio filed an appeal of that judgment to the District Court. In November 1997, the District Court granted the motion of Northwest Collectors to dismiss the appeal on grounds of untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b64 Section 25-33-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">Any party dissatisfied with the judgment rendered in a civil action in a city or justice\u2019s court may appeal therefrom to the district court of the county at any time within 30 days after the rendition of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aic\">In this case, Vanorio filed his appeal in tbe District Court thirty-five days after judgment was rendered in Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b65 Vanorio argues that his notice of appeal was timely because of the additional time allowed under Rule 6C, M.J.C.C.R.Civ.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">Whenever a party has the right or is required to do an act or take a proceeding within a prescribed period after service of a notice or other paper and the notice or other paper is served by mail, 3 days must be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Vanorio argues that the time for filing his notice of appeal was extended under this rule to thirty-three days after the judgment, or until Saturday, August 30, 1997. He then points out that under Rule 6A, M.J.C.C.R.Civ.P., when a deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deadline is extended to the next day. In this case, the next day was a Sunday and the next weekday, Monday, September 1, was a legal holiday. Vanorio maintains, therefore, that his appeal filed on Tuesday, September 2, 1997, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u00b66 As Northwest Collectors points out, this Court has previously rejected the argument raised by Vanorio. In <em>Grimes Motors, Inc. v. Nasciemento </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 147, 796 P.2d 576, the district court dismissed as untimely an appeal from a justice court judgment filed thirty-two days after the judgment was rendered. Appellant Nasciemento argued that the time allowed for appeal should be extended under the rules allowing additional time after service by mail. This Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>As indicated above, \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-101 and 25-33-102, MCA, exclusively govern the time for filing the notice of appeal from justice court to district court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-3\">The time for appeal in this case commenced with the \u201crendition\u201d of the judgment of the justice court as provided in \u00a7 25-33-102, MCA. Because appellant filed his notice of appeal 32 days after judgment was rendered, the District Court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><em>Grimes Motors, </em>244 Mont. at 150, 796 P.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b67 Under \u00a7 25-33-102, MCA, the time for filing an appeal does not run from the date of <em>service </em>of a notice of the judgment \u2014 it runs from the date of <em>rendition </em>of the judgment. Rule 6C, M. J.C.C.R.Civ.P, operates to extend the time allowed \u201c[wjhenever a party has the right or is required to do an act or take a proceeding <em>within a prescribed period after service </em>of a notice or other paper.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The rule does not extend the time allowed by statute when that time begins to run upon rendition of the judgment instead of upon service of a notice or other paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b68 Vanorio relies upon <em>State v. Schindler </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 489, 886 P.2d 978, and <em>State v. Price </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 409, 897 P.2d 1084, arguing that <em>Grimes Motors </em>has been overruled by those cases. The time for appeal of a criminal matter from justice court to district court is governed by \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA: \u201cwithin 10 days after a judgment is rendered.\u201d In <em>Schindler </em>and <em>Price, </em>this Court held that Rule 21, M.U.R.J.C.C., which provides that \u201c[wjhen the period of time prescribed or allowed is ten days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded,\u201d applied to extend the time for filing criminal appeals from justice court to district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b69 This case involves application of a different statute than the one at issue in <em>Schindler </em>and <em>Price, </em>and a different rule of procedure alleged to extend the time allowed under that statute. Importantly, the procedural rule for extension of time which was applied in <em>Schindler </em>and <em>Price </em>was not limited to periods prescribed to act after service of a notice or other papers, as is the extension of time for mailing under Rule 6C, M. J.C.C.R.Civ.P. We conclude that <em>Schindler </em>and <em>Price </em>neither control in this case nor overrule <em>Grimes Motors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b610 Vanorio has not established that his time for filing a notice of appeal from justice court was extended beyond thirty days after rendition of the judgment, or Wednesday, August 27, 1997. We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-9\">JUSTICES GRAY, LEAPHART, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
