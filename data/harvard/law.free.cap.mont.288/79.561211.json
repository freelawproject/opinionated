Sattler raises both trial-related and death penalty-related issues and, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-308, MCA, his appeal is consolidated with this Court\u2019s automatic review of a death penalty case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by limiting Sattler\u2019s questioning of prospective jurors during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Sattler to inquire into the reason the victim had been at the Pine Hills youth correctional facility?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b65 3. Was there sufficient evidence to support the conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court commit reversible error in analyzing aggravating or mitigating circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">\u00b67 5. Was the death sentence imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">\u00b68 6. Is the death sentence imposed disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">\u00b69 7. Are the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the existence of the aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), MCA, and the nonexistence of any mitigating circumstances supported by the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">\u00b610 On May 2, 1995, the State of Montana (State) charged Sattler by information with committing the offense of deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. The facts alleged in support of the charge were that, on or about April 20, 1995, Sattler purposely or knowingly caused the death of Raymond Carl Martinson (Martinson) by beating him to death with a blunt instrument. Both were incarcerated in the Lake County Jail (Jail) at the time of the charged offense. Sattler had been convicted of deliberate homicide in 1987 and incarcerated in the Montana State Prison (MSP); he subsequently was moved to the Swan River Correctional Training Center (Swan River). At the time of the incident on which the deliberate homicide charge in this case was based, Sattler was being held in the Jail as the result of an attempted deliberate homicide committed by him at Swan River. Sattler pleaded not guilty to the charge in the present case and gave notice of his intent to rely on the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force, commonly called self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-18\">\u00b611 The case was tried to a jury in Powell County in March of 1996. The undisputed evidence was that the altercation between Sattler and Martinson which resulted in Martinson\u2019s death occurred shortly before midnight on April 20, 1995, in Cell 1 of the Jail\u2019s Cell Block A and that Sattler inflicted a minimum of six blows to Martinson\u2019s head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>and neck with a metal bar which had affixed the seat to an exercise bicycle located in that cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b612 Each of the four cells in Cell Block A contained bunks and a combination sink and toilet. Cell 1 did not house any inmates, but was used as a common bathroom and exercise room by the inmates. Cell 2 housed five inmates, including Sattler, Martinson, and two inmates who testified for the State at trial. Cells 3 and 4 housed two and five inmates, respectively. The remainder of Cell Block A was composed of a common area containing a main room and a shower. Except during the period from approximately midnight to 6:00 a.m. each day, during which time the inmates were locked in their cells, inmates frequently sat at two picnic tables in the main room and watched television, played cards and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b613 According to the evidence presented by the State, jailer Luc Mathias (Mathias) checked on the inmates in Cell Block A at around 11:20 p.m. on April 20, 1995, and saw that a few of them were watching television in the main room; everything was quiet and seemed normal. About 20 minutes later, Darlene Healy (Healy), a dispatcher whose responsibilities included monitoring a surveillance and intercom system at the Jail, noticed Sattler pacing back and forth in the main room of Cell Block A. She did not see any other inmates in the main room at that time. Approximately 15 minutes later, someone pressed the intercom button in Cell Block A. When Healy pressed the button which allowed her to communicate with the caller and asked what the caller needed, the response was \u201cMan down.\u201d \u201cMan down\u201d was repeated. Healy advised Mathias of the message and called Lake County Deputy Sheriff David Alexander (Alexander). She continued to monitor the surveillance and intercom system; she did not see anything unusual, but thought she could hear someone trying to breathe.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b6 14 Mathias went to the catwalk in front of the cell block, observed feet protruding from Cell 1, locked down all of the inmates and entered Cell Block A. He saw Martinson lying on his back in Cell 1. Martinson\u2019s head was under the bunk opposite the door to the cell; he was lying in a lot of blood but was still alive. Mathias also noticed a bloody metal bar lying across the sink and the exercise bicycle. Mathias left the cell block and directed Healy to call an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">\u00b615 Alexander arrived, together with emergency personnel who also noticed that Martinson\u2019s head was approximately three to four inches under the bunk. Martinson was transported to the local hospital and died there less than an hour later.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u00b616 Inmate Dale Tammen (Tammen) testified that a number of inmates, including himself and Sattler, were watching television at the picnic tables shortly before midnight on April 20,1995. Martinson was there on and off. Tammen heard a \u201cloud thump\u201d from Cell 1, turned, and saw Martinson on the floor of Cell 1 slumped against the exercise bicycle with his legs facing back toward the bunks; Martin-son appeared to be unconscious and Sattler was standing over him looking down. Tammen noticed a large wound in the back of Martin-son\u2019s head, and possibly another next to it. He saw Sattler spin Martinson around and lay him flat on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b617 Tammen went briefly to his own cell, Cell 2, and then followed the other inmates to Cell 4, the cell farthest away from Cell 1. He heard a series of approximately five or six more \u201cthumps\u201d in rapid succession over a three- to five-second period. Soon thereafter, Sattler came to Cell 4 and directed the inmates to go to their cells. Sattler returned to the main room and began pacing, then went to Cell 2, laid down on his bunk and started reading a book. After borrowing a shirt from another inmate, Sattler took off his own shirt and wiped his feet with it. He then tore up his shirt and flushed it down the toilet; Tammen did not observe any injuries on Sattler when he changed shirts. After Sattler said it was okay to do so, Tammen pressed the intercom button and reported that there was a \u201cman down.\u201d According to Tammen, Sattler asked if any of the inmates had seen anything and if anyone was going to betray him.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b618 While not identical, the testimony of inmate Jonathan Nunn (Nunn) largely corroborated Tammen\u2019s version of the events at issue. He heard loud banging noises coming from Cell 1 which sounded to him like metal on metal. Similarly, inmate Leslie Butler (Butler) heard \u201cthumping\u201d noises while showering which sounded like \u201cmetal hitting metal.\u201d On returning to his cell, Butler suspected something was wrong because Sattler was alone in the main room of Cell Block A.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b6 19 Inmate Jody Law (Law) testified that the seat had been on the exercise bicycle in Cell 1 approximately an hour before the incident in question and was still there shortly before the incident when he went into Cell 1 to use the toilet. Sattler came into Cell 1 while Law was there and remained in the cell when Law returned to the main room. Upon his return to the picnic tables, Law noticed that Sattler had left his glasses on the table; this was noteworthy, in Law\u2019s view, because Sattler \u201cjust never took [his glasses] off.\u201d Law did not see anyone else go into Cell 1 after he left Sattler there but, \u201cmaybe a couple minutes\u201d later, he heard a \u201cscuffle going on behind\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>started with kind of a dull thumping sound and then started sounding \u201clike taking a pipe and hitting it against metal... or something.\u201d Law looked into Cell 1 momentarily and saw no one; he noticed only that the exercise bicycle moved a little bit. He then saw Sattler come out of Cell 1, wiping his hands off on his shirt. Sattler went to Cell 2, then came to Cell 4, where the other inmates were gathered, and said only \u201cHas anybody got a problem with that?\u201d Like other inmates, Law could hear someone gasping for breath in Cell 1 while Sattler returned to the main room to pace.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b620 Inmates described Sattler as intimidating, unpredictable, temperamental and the \u201cboss\u201d of the cell block. He was bigger than the other inmates. Martinson, on the other hand, was described as a smaller, nonaggressive \u201chappy go lucky kind of guy,\u201d who was quiet, wimpy, naive and a pest. Sattler apparently did not like Martinson very much and frequently would slap Martinson\u2019s bunk to frighten him.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b621 According to inmate Shannon Swimmer (Swimmer), Sattler\u2019s attitude had undergone a change for the worse several weeks before Martinson\u2019s death when Sattler learned he would be receiving a significant sentence on the attempted deliberate homicide offense which resulted in his placement at the Jail. Indeed, he and Sattler devised a plan to escape from the Jail and considered disassembling the exercise bicycle to use parts of it \u2014 including the metal bar to the seat \u2014 as weapons. They had gotten as far as removing the seat but had not removed the bar which held the seat \u2014 and which Sattler ultimately used to beat Martinson to death. Swimmer abandoned the escape plan upon receiving a lesser sentence than he had anticipated for his underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b622 On the morning of either April 19 or April 20,1995, Swimmer was to be transported to the MSR Before leaving he asked \u2014 and was permitted \u2014 to speak to Sattler. Swimmer testified that, during their conversation, Sattler indicated to Swimmer that somebody was going to die. Sattler pointed in the direction of Martinson or the other inmate sleeping on a top bunk in Cell 2. Swimmer could not tell whether Sattler was joking or serious but, in any event, he did not report the conversation to anyone at the Jail. He later told an investigator about the conversation, stating Sattler said he was going to \u201cdo\u201d someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b623 The State also presented evidence that there were no defensive-type wounds on Martinson and testimony \u2014 in addition to that of Tammen \u2014 that no signs of injury were observed on Sattler after the incident. Sattler did not claim to have been attacked or injured in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>incident at the time. No identifiable fingerprints were found on the metal bar which inflicted the blows resulting in Martinson\u2019s death, but blood spatter evidence was consistent with the State\u2019s theory that most of the blows Martinson received were inflicted after his head was low to the ground in Cell 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b624 Sattler testified on his own behalf as the only witness for the defense. He did not deny having caused Martinson\u2019s death, but testified that he did so in self defense and not purposely. According to Sattler, he had been working out \u2014 during which he did not wear his eyeglasses \u2014 earlier in the evening of April 20, 1995, and then watched the David Letterman show on television with other inmates. When he entered Cell 1 to use the toilet, dropping his pants in preparation, he saw a person who turned out to be Martinson standing by the toilet. Sattler testified that Martinson swung at him with a weapon, that he went into a defensive posture, and that he was hit under the arm and on the left rib cage. He punched Martinson and they struggled over the metal bar Martinson had in his hands; Martinson went down on his knees and Sattler hit him again, but Martinson continued to come at him. According to Sattler, he had no intention of killing Martinson and did not think he had hit Martinson that hard; his only intent was to protect himself. Sattler\u2019s version of the incident was that he struck Martinson on the top of the head a couple of times, Martinson hit the lower bunk pretty hard when he fell against it, and then Martinson hit his head on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b625 Sattler also testified that he was not the \u201cboss\u201d of the cell block, admitted that he had slapped Martinson\u2019s bunk on occasion, but denied that he had any problem with Martinson. He denied having had a conversation with Swimmer about Martinson when Swimmer was leaving the Jail, expressly denied telling Swimmer that he was going to kill anyone and, indeed, denied ever having had a conversation with Swimmer which lasted as long as the conversation Swimmer described.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b626 The State presented six rebuttal witnesses. A Jail inmate testified about Sattler\u2019s threats to inmates. In addition, the jailer who allowed Swimmer to talk to Sattler before being transported to the MSP testified that the conversation lasted about IV2 minutes, and the employee who transported Sattler to the MSP approximately 12 hours after the incident testified that he saw no swelling or bruising on Sattler during a pretransport strip search. Pat Warnecke (Warnecke), the chief juvenile probation officer in Flathead County, testified that he had known Martinson for years through his work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and otherwise and that, in his opinion, Martinson was not considered a violent or particularly aggressive individual. Finally, Martinson\u2019s widow testified that Martinson was nonviolent and that he would get upset and even cry if she got angry at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b627 The jury found Sattler guilty of deliberate homicide and, thereafter, the State provided Sattler with formal notice of its intent to seek the death sentence. Following a sentencing hearing, the District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, judgment and sentence. The court found the existence of two statutory aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. The District Court sentenced Sattler to death and set an execution date of July 10, 1996. Sattler appealed and the sentence was stayed pending resolution of this appeal and automatic review.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b628  1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by limiting Sattler\u2019s questioning of prospective jurors during voir dire?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b629  During voir dire, Sattler\u2019s counsel inquired of individual prospective jurors whether they thought someone in jail \u201cwould commit a homicide unless there was something that caused this to happen[.]\u201d When this question was asked of the third prospective juror, the State objected that the question suggested the State had to prove motive. The District Court sustained the objection. We review such rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Hill v. Turley </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 511, 520, 710 P.2d 50, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\u00b630  Sattler contends that he had a right to voir dire on his defense of justifiable use of force and that the right was infringed by the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow him to inquire about whether there must be a cause or reason to commit a homicide in jail. It is true that, where notice of a defense is given, a refusal to allow the defendant to voir dire prospective jurors on the defense constitutes prejudicial error. <em>See State v. McKenzie </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 481, 501, 608 P.2d 428, 441 (citing <em>State v. Olson </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 339, 480 P.2d 822), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1050, 101 S.Ct. 626, 66 L.Ed.2d 507 (1980). However, neither <em>McKenzie </em>nor <em>Olson </em>provides a basis for determining that the District Court abused its discretion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">\u00b631 In <em>McKenzie, </em>the trial court did not allow the defendant any voir dire regarding mental disease or defect and the defendant claimed prejudice on appeal. We concluded that the voir dire was properly prohibited because notice had not been given of reliance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the defense. <em>McKenzie, </em>608 P.2d at 441. Here, notice of the defense was given and, therefore, <em>McKenzie </em>is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b632 In <em>Olson, </em>the defendant asserted an insanity defense and was denied the opportunity to voir dire on the subj ect. We determined that the defendant could not be assured of an impartial jury without questioning each prospective juror to see if he or she could understand and accept the insanity plea, and reversed the trial court. <em>Olson, </em>480 P.2d at 825. Here, as in <em>Olson, </em>Sattler gave notice of the defense on which he intended to rely. Unlike in <em>Olson, </em>however, Sattler was permitted to voir dire on his defense of justifiable use of force. Indeed, he asked each prospective juror two questions directly related to the defense of justifiable use of force: first, whether a person has a right to defend himself against someone attacking him with a weapon; and second, the extent to which one could defend against an aggressor. These pointed questions regarding the defense properly sought to ascertain whether prospective jurors could understand and accept the defense at issue or, alternatively, whether they were biased against the defense from the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b633 The question disallowed by the District Court in the present case, however, did not relate directly to Sattler\u2019s self defense theory. Instead, Sattler\u2019s question about whether a cause or reason must exist to commit a homicide in jail suggested to prospective jurors that the State was required to prove motive, and Sattler concedes that the State need not do so. On the face of it, the question went beyond an attempt to determine whether potential jurors were biased against the justifiable use of force defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b634 We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Sattler\u2019s voir dire of prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b635  2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Sattler to inquire into the reason the victim had been at the Pine Hills youth correctional facility?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b636 As set forth above, Sattler testified that Martinson was the aggressor in the encounter. Thereafter, the State called Warnecke, the chief juvenile probation officer in Flathead County, as a rebuttal witness. Warnecke knew Martinson through his work and otherwise. In his opinion, Martinson was not considered a violent or particularly aggressive individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u00b637 Prior to beginning his cross-examination of Warnecke, Sattler\u2019s counsel asked for a bench conference at which he apparently sought permission to question Warnecke about Martinson having once been sent to the Pine Hills youth correctional facility (Pine Hills) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>for \u201cmolestation.\u201d Sattler\u2019s theory, apparently, was that \u201cmolestation\u201d was a violent act and that evidence of Martinson\u2019s prior acts of violence became relevant after Sattler had identified Martinson as the aggressor in the incident. The bench conference was not recorded and Sattler did not pursue the line of inquiry thereafter. Sattler contends that the District Court prohibited his line of questioning and that the ruling constituted an abuse of discretion and prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b638 The State asserts that we cannot review this issue absent both a record of the bench conference, which Sattler did not ensure was made, and an offer of proof as to the specific facts which would have been proven by the offered evidence. Sattler contends he was unaware the bench conference was not reported and directs our attention to the fact that, during the settling of instructions, he advised the District Court that he wanted to make a record of his effort to question Warnecke about Martinson being sent to Pine Hills for \u201cmolestation\u201d and of his theory that the molestation was an admissible violent act by Martinson. The District Court acknowledged Sattler\u2019s earlier effort, agreed it had prohibited the questions in response to an objection by the State and directed that \u201c[t]he record will so reflect.\u201d According to Sattler, this record reflects the entirety of the bench conference which occurred prior to his cross-examination of Warnecke. Taking Sattler at his word, the record contains neither his specific legal argument for admissibility or the basis of the State\u2019s objection and, as a result, it is deficient for purposes of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b639 Sattler asserts generally, however, that the offense for which Martinson was sent to Pine Hills was a sexual offense in which Martinson caused bodily injury or used threats, intimidation or force against the victim. As such, according to Sattler, Martinson\u2019s offense was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-104(2)(c), MCA, which constituted a specific instance of Martinson\u2019s conduct admissible under Rule 405, M.R.Evid., as evidence identifying the aggressor in the incident. Rather than leave this issue unresolved, almost certainly necessitating our addressing it in a future collateral proceeding related to this death penalty case, we accept Sattler\u2019s fact-related assertions about the nature of Martinson\u2019s earlier violent act as true for purposes of this opinion only and address, on the merits, the arguments presented in Sattler\u2019s opening brief that the District Court abused its discretion in precluding Sattler\u2019s line of inquiry to Warnecke.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u00b640 Sattler relies first on two cases which predated the July 1, 1977, effective date of the Montana Rules of <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 State <em>v. Jones </em>(1914), 48 Mont. 505, 139 P. 441, and <em>State v. Logan </em>(1970), 156 Mont. 48, 473 P.2d 833 \u2014 in arguing that evidence of the deceased\u2019s reputation for violence is admissible when the issue is self defense and there is doubt as to who was the aggressor. He is correct that the cases stand for the proposition cited, but they are of no assistance to him in this case for reasons in addition to the fact that they predated the Montana Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b641 In <em>Jones, </em>the defendant was charged with first degree murder, admitted the homicide and asserted the defense of self defense. <em>Jones, </em>139 R at 443. On appeal, we addressed the issue of whether evidence that the decedent was reputed to be a turbulent, violent man was admissible for any purpose unless it was first shown to have been known to the defendant. We concluded that, when the issue is self defense and there is doubt as to who was the aggressor, evidence of the decedent\u2019s reputation for violence is admissible in order to enable the jury to resolve the doubt. <em>Jones, </em>139 P. at 446-47 (citations omitted). We reiterated that rule of admissibility regarding reputation evidence in <em>Logan </em>many years later, clarifying that the reputation evidence was not admissible until a proper foundation had been laid via the defendant\u2019s testimony admitting the killing and raising the issue of the decedent being the aggressor. <em>Logan, </em>473 P.2d at 841-42 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b642 As discussed, both <em>Jones </em>and <em>Logan </em>addressed the admissibility by the defendant of evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s reputation for violence. Neither addressed the issue before us in this case, namely, the admissibility of \u201cspecific instance\u201d evidence regarding the victim\u2019s character by the defendant. Since Sattler was attempting to introduce the \u201cmolestation\u201d incident by Martinson, rather than evidence regarding Martinson\u2019s reputation for violence, <em>Jones </em>and <em>Logan </em>do not support his position that the District Court erred in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b643 With regard to current evidentiary rules, Sattler cites to Rule 404, M.R.Evid., in support of his argument that evidence of Martin-son\u2019s character for violence was admissible. As a general rule, character evidence is not admissible to prove action in conformity therewith. Rule 404(a), M.R.Evid. There are exceptions to the general rule, however, and one of those exceptions applies to the case before us. Under Rule 404(a)(2), M.R.Evid., \u201c[ejvidence of a pertinent trait of character of the victim of the crime\u201d is admissible when offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the accused. Thus, Sattler is correct that evidence of Martinson\u2019s character for violence was admissible in this case as a \u201cpertinent\u201d character trait vis-a-vis his justifiable use of force defense. That does not end the inquiry, however, because the question remains regarding the means by which Sattler was entitled to prove Martinson\u2019s character for violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b644  Where character evidence is admissible pursuant to Rule 404, M.R.Evid., character or a character trait can be proven through reputation evidence or specific instances of conduct evidence as expressly authorized in Rule 405, M.R.Evid. Sattler argues summarily that Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid., authorized him to introduce the specific instance of Martinson\u2019s prior act of violence to support his claim that Martinson was the aggressor in the altercation between the two men. Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid., permits proof of character via specific instances of conduct in two situations: 1) where character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim or defense; and 2) where the character of the victim relates to the reasonableness of force used by the accused in self defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b645 With regard to the first circumstance outlined in Rule 405(b), we must look to the justifiable use of force defense to determine whether Martinson\u2019s character for violence was an essential element of that defense. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, a person is justified in using force against another</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself ... against such other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. However, he is justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Nothing in the statutorily-defined defense relates directly to the question of the identity of the aggressor and Sattler cites to no authority under which the identity of the aggressor is an \u201cessential element\u201d of the justifiable use of force defense. His bare contention that Martinson\u2019s character for violence was an essential element of his justifiable use of force defense does not make it so. We conclude that the \u201cspecific instance\u201d evidence regarding Martinson\u2019s prior violent act which Sattler sought to introduce through Warnecke was not admissible under the first circumstance set forth in Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">\u00b646  The second circumstance outlined in Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid., renders specific instances of the victim\u2019s conduct admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>sible where the victim\u2019s character regarding violence or aggression relates to the reasonableness of the force used by the accused in self defense. In this regard, we need observe only that this was not the purpose for which Sattler sought to introduce Martinson\u2019s prior act of violence. Indeed, as discussed above, Sattler sought to introduce the evidence to show that Martinson was the aggressor in the incident, not to support any claim that the force he used against Martin-son was reasonable based on his knowledge of Martinson\u2019s history of violent acts. As a result, we conclude that the \u201cspecific instance\u201d of Martinson\u2019s conduct which Sattler sought to introduce through Warnecke was not admissible under the second circumstance set forth in Rule 405(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b647  Sattler raises two new arguments relating to this issue in his reply brief. Legal theories raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief are outside the scope of such a brief and we do not address them. <em>See </em>Rule 23(c), M.R.App.P.; <em>Loney v. Milodragovich, Dale &amp; Dye, P.C. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 506, 512, 905 P.2d 158, 162 (citation omitted). To do so would tilt the balance in a case in favor of the party who gets the final word in presenting its arguments to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AqU\">\u00b648  Moreover, while we have addressed this issue absent an appropriate record in order to resolve it now rather than later, we did so on the basis that the arguments presented in Sattler\u2019s opening brief were those presented to the District Court during the trial of this case. Under the principles that guide all cases, a party may not change his theory on appeal from that advanced in the trial court. <em>See State v. Fisch </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 520, 524, 881 P.2d 626, 629; <em>State v. Henderson </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 454, 458, 877 P.2d 1013, 1016. Nor may a party raise an argument for the first time on appeal. <em>Jones v. City of Billings </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 341, 347, 927 P.2d 9, 13 (citations omitted). Notwithstanding that this is a death penalty case, we are neither required, nor inclined, to allow Sattler to re-create both the record and his arguments not once, but twice. We decline to address these newly raised arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b649  Finally, we observe that any error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to admit the evidence of Martinson\u2019s prior violent act under Rule 405, M.R.Evid., would not necessarily have resulted in prejudicial and reversible error. Reversible error is error which affects the substantial rights of a party. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-701, MCA; Rule 103(a), M.R.Evid. Here, even if Sattler were entitled to prove Martin-son\u2019s character for violence via the specific instance of conduct under Rule 405, M.R.Evid., we conclude that exclusion of the evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>not have affected Sattler\u2019s substantial rights in light of the other evidence of record. Thus, the record here does not establish prejudicial error and, under \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, a reversal is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b650 First, while Martinson\u2019s act of \u201cmolestation\u201d was relevant in that it had a tendency to make the existence of a disputed fact\u2014 whether, as Sattler testified, Martinson was the aggressor \u2014 more probable <em>(see </em>Rule 401, M.R.Evid.), the relevance was slight given the other evidence of record. It was clear from the circumstances of this case that Martinson was incarcerated in the Jail. In addition, the jury was aware that Martinson had been committed to Pine Hills during his youth and that he had been involved in an escape attempt when he was 14 or 15 years old. Furthermore, Warnecke testified that Martinson \u201ccould be\u201d violent if armed with a weapon, as Sattler testified he was. Thus, whatever the specifics of the evidence of Martinson\u2019s act of \u201cmolestation,\u201d it would have been cumulative to other negative evidence about Martinson which was before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">\u00b651 Moreover, whatever the nature of Martinson\u2019s \u201cmolestation\u201d act, it had occurred approximately eight years before Martinson\u2019s death, by Sattler\u2019s counsel\u2019s own reckoning during oral argument, at a time when Martinson was in his mid-teen years. Therefore, the act was not only remote but potentially excludable on that basis. <em>See State v. Benton </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 401, 404, 825 P.2d 565, 567. Even if not excluded on remoteness grounds, the lapse of time between Martinson\u2019s \u201cmolestation\u201d act and his death in 1995 rendered the probity of his act minimal at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b652 We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Sattler to inquire into the reason the victim had been at Pine Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b653  3. Was there sufficient evidence to support the conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\u00b654 The jury ultimately found Sattler guilty of deliberate homicide, which is defined in \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, as purposely or knowingly causing the death of another human being. In doing so, it implicitly rejected Sattler\u2019s defense of justifiable use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b655  As is true in every criminal case, the State was required to prove Sattler\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-16-204, MCA. Conversely, Sattler had the burden of producing sufficient evidence in support of his justifiable use of force defense to raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt. <em>See State v. Daniels </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 1, 16, 682 P.2d 173, 181. Like the elements of the charged offense, the elements of Sattler\u2019s defense \u2014 that is, that he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the aggressor, that he reasonably believed he was in imminent danger of unlawful force and that he used only such force as was reasonably necessary to prevent his own death or serious bodily harm <em>(see </em>\u00a7 45-3-102, MCA) \u2014 are factual in nature and are to be determined by the jury. <em>See State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 140, 875 P.2d 307, 314 (citation omitted). It is within the province of the finder of fact to weigh the evidence presented and determine the credibility of witnesses; in the event of conflicting evidence on factual issues, the trier of fact determines which will prevail. <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94 (citation omitted). Sattler argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted purposely and knowingly in causing Martinson\u2019s death in light of the evidence he presented in support of his justifiable use of force defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b656  This Court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a guilty verdict in a criminal case to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Richards </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 180, 184, 906 P.2d 222, 224 (citations omitted). Given our discussion above regarding the factual nature of the justifiable use of force defense and Sattler\u2019s burden of producing enough evidence on the defense to raise a reasonable doubt, it is clear that our sufficiency of the evidence standard remains unchanged where, as here, we are reviewing a jury verdict which necessarily rejected the fact-based defense advanced. In other words, the question of whether the defendant produced sufficient evidence regarding the affirmative defense to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt is subsumed in the question of whether, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b657  As set forth above, a person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if he or she purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. A person acts purposely with regard to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in the conduct or cause the result. Section 45-2-101(63), MCA. A person acts knowingly with regard to a result when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the result will be caused by his or her conduct. Section 45-2-101(34), MCA. The purposely or knowingly mental state required to support a criminal conviction can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>proved by direct evidence or inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the acts of the accused and the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-103(3), MCA; <em>State v. Albrecht </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 403, 413, 791 P.2d 760, 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b658 On this record, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Sattler purposely and knowingly caused Martinson\u2019s death. Factually, it was undisputed that Sattler caused Martinson\u2019s death by inflicting blows to his head and neck area with a metal bar. Sattler admitted inflicting the blows which killed Martinson and the State\u2019s medical examiner testified that one of the blows actually indented \u2014 or caved in \u2014 Martinson\u2019s skull; the beating also was sufficient to bruise the brain. Notwithstanding Sattler\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to kill Martinson, the nature of Martinson\u2019s fatal injuries \u2014 together with Sattler\u2019s awareness of his conduct and the jury\u2019s ability to infer that he also was aware that there was a high probability that that conduct would result in Martinson\u2019s death \u2014 was sufficient to support a finding that Sattler purposely or knowingly caused Martinson\u2019s death beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Arlington, </em>875 P.2d at 319. Also supporting the jury\u2019s verdict that Sattler acted purposely or knowingly was the testimony from other inmates that Sattler had been annoyed with Martinson on numerous occasions, and Swimmer\u2019s testimony that Sattler stated his intention to kill either Martinson or another inmate within 18 to 42 hours before Martinson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b659  Sattler points to his denial that the conversation related by Swimmer took place. However, the jailer who permitted Swimmer to talk to Sattler prior to being transported to the MSP corroborated that a conversation between the two occurred. Sattler\u2019s related argument that Swimmer\u2019s testimony about the conversation was undermined by a conflict in the record about the timing of Swimmer\u2019s transport to the MSP goes to Swimmer\u2019s credibility, not to whether there was sufficient evidence regarding the requisite mental state to support Sattler\u2019s conviction. Moreover, it was the job of the finder of fact \u2014 that is, the jury \u2014 to weigh conflicts in the evidence and determine witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>See Flack, </em>860 P.2d at 94. We do not reweigh evidence or credibility here. Indeed, in determining whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential mental state element beyond a reasonable doubt, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>See Richards, </em>906 P.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b660 Sattler\u2019s contention that the State did not present sufficient evidence of his mental state to enable the jury to find him guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt of purposely or knowingly causing Martin-son\u2019s death is not a model of clarity. He appears to argue that, because his testimony supported the existence of the elements of his justifiable use of force defense, the jury was obligated to find that a reasonable doubt existed regarding whether he had the requisite mental state for the deliberate homicide offense. As discussed above, however, the jury is free to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of all witnesses in making its factual findings. We review the jury\u2019s verdict only to determine whether it is supported by sufficient evidence, not to determine whether there was evidence to support a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b661 Nor do <em>Arlington </em>and <em>State v. Popescu </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 493, 774 P.2d 395, on which Sattler relies, support his argument that, having presented evidence on all three elements of his defense, the jury had insufficient evidence before it to find that he acted purposely or knowingly and to convict him of deliberate homicide. In <em>Arlington, </em>we cited to <em>Popescu </em>for the three elements which must be proved in order to establish the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force. <em>Arlington, </em>875 P.2d at 318 (citation omitted). In <em>Popescu, </em>the issue on appeal was whether the defendant had introduced sufficient evidence to warrant submitting the justifiable use of force defense to the jury. We held that he had, reversed the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the defense, and remanded for a new trial. <em>Popescu, </em>774 P.2d at 396-97. That issue is not before us in the present case. Here, the District Court did instruct the jury on Sattler\u2019s justifiable use of force defense and the instruction reflected its determination that there was sufficient evidence to warrant submitting the defense to the jury. Neither <em>Arlington </em>nor <em>Popescu </em>stands for the proposition that evidence sufficient to warrant submitting the justifiable use of force defense to a jury raises a reasonable doubt as to a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b662 Finally, we observe that Sattler effectively conceded this issue in his reply brief on appeal. There, he stated that \u201cit could not be said that the State had failed to prove it\u2019s [sic] case <em>...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b663 We conclude that, on this record, the jury could have found the essential elements of the charged deliberate homicide offense beyond a reasonable doubt. As a result, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support Sattler\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b664  4. Did the District Court commit reversible error in analyzing aggravating or mitigating circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b665 After the State served formal notice of its intent to seek the death penalty, the District Court held the sentencing hearing required by \u00a7 46-18-301, MCA, to determine the existence or nonexistence of aggravating circumstances as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303, MCA, and mitigating circumstances as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304, MCA. It found that two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances existed. Accordingly, the District Court sentenced Sattler to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b666 Sattler challenges the District Court\u2019s determinations regarding both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. We consider his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">a. Aggravating circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b667 The District Court determined that two statutory aggravating circumstances existed: first, that the offense of which Sattler was convicted was deliberate homicide and it \u201cwas committed by a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison!,]\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA; and, second, that the offense was deliberate homicide and Sattler \u201chad been previously convicted of another deliberate homicide[,]\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), MCA. Sattler contends that the District Court\u2019s determination that the offense was committed by a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison is erroneous as a matter of law, relying on <em>State v. Keith </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 214, 754 P.2d 474, and, as a result, that his death sentence should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u00b668 In <em>Keith, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to six charged offenses, including aggravated kidnaping and deliberate homicide. <em>Keith, </em>754 P.2d at 476-77. Keith was on parole from the state of Washington at the time of the offenses and, on that basis, the trial court ultimately determined that the \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA, aggravating circumstance existed. We reversed that determination on appeal, concluding that the statute expressly applied to a person serving \u201ca sentence of <em>imprisonment in the state prison\u201d </em>and that the plain language of the statute did not permit an interpretation which would include an individual on parole. <em>Keith, </em>754 P.2d at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b669 Sattler contends that, because he was under sentence to the MSP at the time of Martinson\u2019s death but physically present in the Jail as the result of a different charge, <em>Keith </em>bars application of the \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA, aggravating circumstance requiring that a person be serving a sentence of imprisonment <em>in </em>the state prison. The State argues, in response, that <em>Keith </em>addressed only the parole situation presented therein and did not preclude application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>aggravating circumstance in situations such as that presently before us where a defendant is temporarily housed at a county detention facility while still under sentence to a term of imprisonment in the MSR We need not resolve this dispute, however, because even if the District Court erred in finding that the aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA, exists and we disregard that circumstance accordingly, the error is harmless in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b670 As set forth above, the District Court determined that two aggravating circumstances existed in this case. The first is the \u201cserving a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison\u201d circumstance discussed above. The second is that contained in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), MCA, and undisputed by Sattler: namely, that the deliberate homicide was committed by a defendant \u2014 Sattler\u2014who previously had been convicted of another deliberate homicide. The court also concluded that \u201ceither [aggravating circumstance] is sufficient to support the sentence to be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b671 In determining whether to impose a death sentence, a sentencing court in Montana must take into account the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances and \u201cshall impose a sentence of death if it finds one or more of the aggravating circumstances\u201d and no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Section 46-18-305, MCA. Thus, the District Court in this case was statutorily required to sentence Sattler to death upon the finding of the single aggravating circumstance that he previously had been convicted of a deliberate homicide and the absence of mitigating circumstances sufficient to call for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b672  Nor, under a statutory death penalty scheme like Montana\u2019s, must a death sentence be reversed or a new sentencing hearing conducted if one of several aggravating circumstances found to exist is subsequently held to be inapplicable. <em>See Zant v. Stephens </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 862, 873-80, 103 S.Ct. 2733, 2741-44, 77 L.Ed.2d 235, 247-52. Sattler does not contend otherwise. Indeed, he concedes that the death penalty still may be imposed under <em>Zant </em>so long as this Court ensures that the inapplicability of one aggravating circumstance does not render the death penalty arbitrary or capricious. Sattler goes on to argue that this death penalty is arbitrary or capricious, and we address his arguments in that regard in issue five below as part of our automatic review of the death sentence pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-307 through 46-18-310, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b673 As noted above, the District Court concluded that the existence of either one of the aggravating circumstances was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>support the death sentence in this case. That conclusion is correct under \u00a7 46-18-305, MCA, and, as a result, any error in the court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA, aggravating circumstance exists in this case would not affect Sattler\u2019s substantial rights or prejudice him. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-20-701, MCA. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not commit reversible error in analyzing the aggravating circumstances,</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">b. Mitigating circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b674 The District Court made extensive findings with regard to both the mitigating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 46-18-304(1), MCA, and the \u201ccatchall\u201d mitigating circumstances set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA. Indeed, its findings addressed each of the mitigating circumstances enumerated in the statute meticulously and methodically, set forth any evidence of record relating to each, and found whether or not the mitigating circumstance existed. Sattler advances a number of assertions of error relating to the District Court\u2019s analysis of the mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b675  Sattler\u2019s first contention is that the District Court erred in considering every enumerated mitigating factor rather than only those he raised and relied on as mitigating circumstances. He cites to no authority in support of this assertion of error and it is clear that \u00a7 46-18-306, MCA, requires a court imposing a death sentence to make \u201cspecific written findings of fact as to the existence or nonexistence of each of the circumstances set forth in ... 46-18-304.\u201d <em>See also State v. Smith </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 158, 167, 931 P.2d 1272, 1277, <em>cert. denied </em>118 S.Ct. 410, 139 L.Ed.2d 314 (1997). We conclude that the District Court did not err in considering each of the mitigating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 46-18-304(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b676  Sattler also contends that the District Court improperly considered the lack of mitigating circumstances as justification for imposing the death sentence, contrary to \u00a7 46-18-305, MCA. This contention is entirely without merit. As discussed above, \u00a7 46-18-305, MCA, requires the imposition of a death sentence if one or more aggravating circumstances exist and there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. In reaching that ultimate sentencing issue in this case, the District Court carefully performed the analysis of mitigating circumstances required by \u00a7 46-18-304, MCA, and found that no mitigating circumstances existed. Nothing in the court\u2019s findings, conclusions, judgment and sentence supports the interpretation urged by Sattler.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b677  Next, Sattler asserts that the District Court erred in failing to find the existence of the mitigating circumstance contained in \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA, namely, that \u201c[t]he victim was a participant in the defendant\u2019s conduct or consented to the act.\u201d The court found that there was no evidence that Martinson was a participant in Sattler\u2019s conduct or consented to the act of being beaten to death by him. The court also found that \u201c[t]he jury did not accept defendant\u2019s claim of self defense and neither does the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b678 Sattler\u2019s argument seems to be that, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s rejection of his self defense theory, the court was required to consider his testimony that Martinson was the aggressor as mitigating evidence under \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA, that Martinson participated in or consented to Sattler\u2019s acts which resulted in his death, and to make findings in his favor thereunder in sentencing. We observe at that outset that, as a matter of logic, Sattler\u2019s argument is flawed because it mixes apples and oranges. The mitigating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA \u2014 that Martinson participated in or consented to Sattler\u2019s act \u2014 would not exist even assuming <em>arguendo </em>the truth of Sattler\u2019s testimony that Martinson was the aggressor. The reason is that, even under Sattler\u2019s theory, Martinson\u2019s acts were his own, as were Sattler\u2019s. In other words, that Martinson\u2019s acts may have produced Sattler\u2019s responsive acts \u2014 in Sattler\u2019s version of the events at issue \u2014 does not make Martinson a participant in or a consenter to Sattler\u2019s acts of beating him to death. Therefore, Sattler\u2019s self defense-related testimony that Martinson was the aggressor simply did not constitute evidence of the mitigating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA. As a result, the District Court was not obligated to consider it or to make findings relating thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b679 Nor is Sattler\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Korell </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 316, 690 P.2d 992, as legal support for this argument well placed. In <em>Korell, </em>the defendant was charged with attempted deliberate homicide and aggravated assault and gave notice of his intent to rely on a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d defense to prove that he did not have the mental state required as an essential element of the offenses charged. <em>Korell, </em>690 P.2d at 995. The jury found Korell guilty of both charged offenses and, on appeal, Korell argued that the trial court erred in not considering his mental condition at sentencing, as required by law, by stating that it would not revisit the jury\u2019s rejection of the defense. <em>Korell, </em>690 P.2d at 996, 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u00b680 We observed that the applicable sentencing statutes expressly required the sentencing court to consider whether the defendant suffered from a \u201cmental disease or defect,\u201d even where the jury had convicted the defendant. Indeed, the court could sentence the defendant to imprisonment only after specifically finding that the defendant did not suffer from such a disease at the time of the offense. <em>Korell, </em>690 P.2d at 1000. In light of the statutes imposing an affirmative obligation on the sentencing court to independently evaluate the defendant\u2019s mental condition, the court\u2019s refusal to do so was erroneous and required that the sentence imposed be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. <em>Korell, </em>690 P.2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b681 <em>Korell </em>is inapplicable here. There, statutes expressly required the sentencing judge to independently determine whether the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect even after the jury had rejected the mental disease or defect defense. No similar statutes required the District Court in this case to independently evaluate Sattler\u2019s self defense evidence after it had been rejected by the jury. Unlike the situation in <em>Korell, </em>the language setting forth the statutory mitigating circumstance relating to a victim participating in or consenting to a defendant\u2019s acts is not similar, much less identical, to the language defining the justifiable use of force defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b682 We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in failing to make independent factual findings in Sattler\u2019s favor \u2014 or at all \u2014 on the evidence Sattler presented on his justifiable use of force defense. We further conclude that the District Court did not err in failing to find that Sattler had established the mitigating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b683  Sattler\u2019s next argument is that the District Court did not properly consider the \u201ccatchall\u201d mitigating evidence he presented under \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA. The first purported mitigating evidence is that Sattler was kept at the Jail, rather than returned to the MSP, following his arrest for attempted deliberate homicide at Swan River; according to Sattler, this evidence reflected that he was not considered a danger to other inmates. Contrary to Sattler\u2019s contentions, however, the District Court did consider that evidence, observing that persons accused of committing felonies within Lake County ordinarily are placed in the Jail to await the disposition of their cases. The court found that this evidence did not establish a mitigating circumstance under \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b684  Sattler also argues that the District Court committed two distinct errors with regard to its finding \u201c[t]hat the sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>imposed following the prison riot trials, referred to by [Sattler], do not constitute a mitigating circumstance as applied to this defendant and this offense.\u201d Sattler first asserts that he referenced those sentences in relation to his \u201cexcessive or disproportionate\u201d arguments under \u00a7 46-18-310(3), MCA, rather than as mitigating evidence. That may be so. Moreover, proportionality evidence is not properly considered by a sentencing court as a mitigating factor in performing the individualized sentencing required by \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-303 and 46-18-304, MCA. <em>Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1282. Rather, it is within the province of this Court, with its statewide perspective, to conduct a proportionality review on automatic review of a death sentence \u201cto prevent imposition of the death penalty in a wanton and arbitrary fashion.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b685 Here, Sattler referred to proportionality during the sentencing hearing and the District Court merely found that sentences in other cases did not constitute a mitigating circumstance with regard to Sattler and the deliberate homicide at issue. This determination is not at odds with our holding in <em>Smith </em>and it was, at most, an indication of the sentencing court\u2019s caution and thoroughness in attempting to address all of Sattler\u2019s arguments and evidence in the findings on mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b686 Sattler\u2019s second assertion of error relating to his reference to the prison riot cases, vis-a-vis his disproportionality argument, is that the District Court failed to address whether the death sentence in this case was excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed after the riot trials. He cites no authority under which the District Court was required to do so, however, and, as discussed above, Montana statutes and case law reserve the proportionality review to this Court. Sections 46-18-307 and 46-18-310, MCA; <em>Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b687  Next, Sattler argues that the District Court did not consider either (1) the psychological report he presented, (2) that he came from dysfunctional family circumstances, as outlined in the presentence report, or (3) that the State was unwilling to negotiate away the death penalty as mitigating circumstances under \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA. It is clear that the court did consider the psychological report, as established by its finding that \u201csaid report has been fully considered by the Court.\u201d Sattler advances no authority under which the fact that the sentencing court considered the report in relation to the mitigating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(d), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>rather than as a mitigating circumstance under \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA, constitutes legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b688 Moreover, while the District Court\u2019s findings on mitigating circumstances did not expressly reference either the family information contained in the presentence report or Sattler\u2019s evidence of the State\u2019s unwillingness to enter into a plea bargain that excluded the death penalty, the court indicated that it had considered all of the evidence and all of the circumstances of the defendant, including his character and propensities. The law does not require the sentencing court to make findings on each piece of purportedly mitigating evidence produced. <em>See Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1282-83. The law requires only that the court consider all such evidence and we must assume that it did so, particularly where \u2014 as here \u2014 the court so states. <em>See Parker v. Dugger </em>(1991), 498 U.S. 308, 314-15, 111 S.Ct. 731, 736, 112 L.Ed.2d 812, 822; <em>Jeffries v. Blodgett </em>(9th Cir. 1993), 5 F.3d 1180, 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b689 We conclude that the District Court did not err in analyzing mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b690  5. Was the death sentence imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor?</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b691  This Court automatically reviews every death sentence imposed under Montana law. Section 46-18-307, MCA. In doing so, we determine \u201cwhether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor[.]\u201d Section 46-18-310(1), MCA. Our review, conducted from a statewide perspective rather than from the individualized perspective the sentencing court must apply, serves as a check against arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. <em>See Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1282; <em>State v. Langford </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 420, 436, 813 P.2d 936, 948 (citing <em>Gregg v. Georgia </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 153, 206, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2940, 49 L.Ed.2d 859, 893).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">\u00b692 Here, Sattler asserts that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factors because the District Court imposed the sentence on the same day the sentencing hearing was held and because the sentence was based on Sattler\u2019s lack of rehabilitation. Indeed, Sattler urges that the District Court improperly converted the lack of rehabilitation into an aggravating circumstance. We have reviewed the record and conclude that it does not indicate that the death penalty was imposed under any arbitrary influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00b693 With regard to the promptness of the District Court\u2019s written findings, conclusions, judgment and sentence, the sentencing hearing in this case lasted only 1V2 hours and the evidence presented was neither extensive nor complex. The District Court recessed the hearing and indicated that it had drafted findings and conclusions to fit both a life sentence and the death sentence and would give its predrafted findings and conclusions full consideration, along with \u201cthe material that was introduced [at the sentencing hearing] and the court file and my notes.\u201d Two hours later, the court reconvened and read its findings, conclusions, sentence and judgment in open court in Sattler\u2019s presence. As discussed above, the District Court\u2019s findings on aggravating and mitigating circumstances were thorough and detailed; further, they reflected that the court took the evidence before it into account in determining to impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">\u00b694 Sattler also contends that the District Court improperly used his lack of rehabilitation as the basis for imposing the death sentence and, indeed, converted that lack of rehabilitation into an aggravating circumstance. The record does not support this contention. First, the court\u2019s findings and conclusions were confined to addressing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-303 and 46-18-304, MCA. On the basis of those findings and conclusions, the District Court entered its judgment and sentence imposing the death sentence on Sattler. In a later portion of the judgment and sentence, the court correctly quoted the correctional policy of this State as being \u201cto protect society by preventing crime through punishment and rehabilitation of the convicted\u201d (see \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA) and observed that, by his own conduct, Sattler had not taken advantage of the opportunities for rehabilitation provided via his prison term for the 1987 deliberate homicide. No legal or factual error exists in that portion of the judgment and, while a discussion of Montana\u2019s correctional policy may not have been required, it certainly was not prohibited. That discussion does not support Sattler\u2019s contentions that the death sentence was imposed because of his lack of rehabilitation and that the court improperly converted the lack of rehabilitation to an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b695 We conclude, on the record before us, that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b696  6. Is the death sentence imposed disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u00b697  As noted above, this Court is required to determine whether the sentence of death imposed in a given case is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.\u201d Section 46-18-310(3), MCA. In performing the proportionality review, we must reference the similar cases we considered. Section 46-18-310(3), MCA. Moreover, we examine only cases where the death penalty was \u2014 or could have been \u2014 imposed after conviction and which were appealed. <em>See State v. Coleman </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 299, 333-34, 605 P.2d 1000, 1020, <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 970, 100 S.Ct. 2952, 64 L.Ed.2d 831 (1980), <em>sentence vacated, </em>874 F.2d 1280 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>Smith, </em>931 P.2d at 1285. In this regard, we review \u201cthe gravity of the offense, the brutality with which it was committed, and the factors, if any, which led to a call for leniency ....\u201d <em>State v. Turner </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 39, 59, 864 P.2d 235, 247 (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 827, 115 S.Ct. 96, 130 L.Ed.2d 46 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b698 We observe that Sattler initially urged us to overrule the <em>Smith </em>limitation vis-a-vis considering only cases where the death penalty was, or could have been, imposed after conviction, and to take into account the so-called prison riot cases in which inmates at the MSP committed deliberate homicides but the death penalty was not sought or imposed. He withdrew that request at oral argument, however, noting that the 1997 Legislature amended \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA, to essentially incorporate the scope of proportionality review we set forth in <em>Smith. See </em>1997 Mont. Laws, Ch. 302, Sec. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b699 With the proper scope of our proportionality review in mind, therefore, we must examine the proportionality of the death sentence in this case as compared with other cases appealed to us in which a deliberate homicide was committed by an incarcerated defendant and the death penalty was sought or imposed. It is undisputed that only two such cases exist and, because they arose from the same circumstances, we consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b6100 Douglas Turner and William Gollehon were charged with, and convicted of, deliberate homicide by accountability based on their having beaten Gerald Pileggi to death with a baseball bat while all three were incarcerated at the MSP. <em>Turner, </em>864 P.2d at 237; <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 1, 8-9, 864 P.2d 249, 254, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 827, 115 S.Ct. 95, 130 L.Ed.2d 45 (1994). The testimony at trial indicated that Pileggi died of multiple injuries to the head and trunk resulting from at least four blows, including one which was sufficient to cave in his skull. <em>Turner, </em>864 P.2d at 238; <em>Gollehon, </em>864 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>252-53. An inmate testified that Gollehon \u201chad indicated that he was going to \u2018mess [Pileggi] up.\u201d\u2019 The same inmate saw Gollehon start the fight with Pileggi in the exercise yard, watched the two struggle for control of the bat and then saw Turner arrive and join Gollehon in continuing to beat Pileggi after he fell to the ground. <em>Gollehon, </em>864 P.2d at 253; <em>Turner, </em>864 P.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b6101 The trial court sentenced both Turner and Gollehon to death. Regarding Turner, the court found the existence of two aggravating circumstances, namely, that Turner was serving a term of imprisonment at the MSP when he committed the offense and that he previously had been convicted of a deliberate homicide. It also found that Turner\u2019s difficult childhood was insufficient to call for lenity under the circumstances. <em>Turner, </em>864 P.2d at 246. With regard to Gollehon, the sentencing court found the existence of the same two aggravating factors and considered mitigating evidence of the inhuman and traumatic childhood to which he had been subjected, but determined that he had not taken advantage of available help in dealing with problems resulting from his childhood. Thus, the court ultimately determined that the family history evidence was not sufficient to preclude the death penalty. <em>Gollehon, </em>864 P.2d at 260, 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b6102 The gravity and brutality involved in Sattler\u2019s beating death of Martinson are substantially similar to the gravity and brutality of the offense committed by Turner and Gollehon. Here, as there, an inmate was attacked with a weapon and beaten to death by blows to the head and other areas of the body. Here, as there, at least one blow was sufficient to cave in the skull. Here, as there, the beating continued after the victim was down. Elere, as in Gollehon\u2019s case, there was an indication in advance that the attack was going to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b6103 Furthermore, Sattler \u2014 like Turner and Gollehon \u2014 had previously been convicted of a deliberate homicide and, while we have not resolved whether the second aggravating circumstance which existed in Turner\u2019s and Gollehon\u2019s cases applies here, it is clear that all three men were incarcerated at the time they committed their deliberate homicides. Finally, the evidence of mitigation on which Sattler premised his call for lenity was no stronger than that presented by Turner and less persuasive than that presented by Gollehon.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b6104 Sattler\u2019s arguments that imposition of the death penalty in this case would be disproportionate to the death penalties imposed in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Gollehon </em>generally are based on his version of the facts rather than the version accepted by the jury. He also argues differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>enees in the facts relating to the two offenses, such as that two persons were involved in the beating death of Pileggi, who was smaller than either of them. He does not explain, and we certainly cannot conceive, how the fact that Sattler \u2014 the \u201cboss\u201d of Cell Block A \u2014 acted alone in beating Martinson \u2014 a smaller, wimpy guy \u2014 to death renders the death penalty here disproportionate to those imposed in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Gollehon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU6\">\u00b6 105 Sattler also points to the fact that Pileggi was beaten to death in front of eyewitnesses, while Martinson was not. From this, he posits that the evidence against him was speculative and circumstantial. Again, this argument essentially relates to the jury\u2019s weighing of the evidence in convicting him of the deliberate homicide, rather than to the proportionality of the death penalty in this case. Having concluded above that sufficient evidence exists to support the conviction, we need not further address these types of arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b6106 Sattler also seems to argue that, absent the existence of both of the aggravating circumstances found in <em>Turner </em>and <em>Gollehon, </em>the death penalty is disproportionate here as a matter of law. He cites to no authority, however, in support of the proposition that disproportionality exists between death penalties when the number of aggravating circumstances in factually similar cases is not equal. Nor is that a matter within the scope of our proportionality review under \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA, <em>Smith </em>and <em>Turner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u00b6107 Finally, Sattler contends that, unlike Turner and Gollehon, he accepted responsibility for his acts and, as a result, the death penalty is disproportionate here. Without regard to whether a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for the offense at issue is a proper consideration in our proportionality review, we reject Sattler\u2019s premise. While it is true that Sattler admitted killing Martinson, he has continued to assert that he had a right to do so because he was defending himself. We do not equate continuing to assert a justifiable use of force defense \u2014 even after the jury has rejected it \u2014 with \u201caccepting responsibility\u2019 for a brutal deliberate homicide. Thus, we need not consider this contention further.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b6108 Having considered the offense and the defendant in the present case in proportion to the offenses and defendants in other Montana cases, we conclude that the death sentence imposed in this case is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b6109  7. Are the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the existence of the aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>MCA, and the nonexistence of any mitigating circumstances supported by the evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b6110 Our automatic review of death sentences includes, in addition to the \u201carbitrary factor\u201d and proportionality issues discussed above, whether the evidence supports the sentencing court\u2019s findings regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-310(2), MCA. This issue is separate and apart from the arguments relating to aggravating and mitigating circumstances which Sattler raised\u2014 and we resolved \u2014 in issue four above.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b6111 The District Court made a number of underlying factual findings relating to its ultimate finding that the aggravating circumstance contained in \u00a7 46-18-303(1), MCA \u2014 namely, that the deliberate homicide was committed by a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison \u2014 exists. The underlying findings are not only supported by the evidence, they are undisputed. As discussed above, we need not resolve here whether the court\u2019s ultimate determination regarding this aggravating circumstance is correct because, even if incorrect, it was harmless. Nor need we address at length whether the evidence supports the District Court\u2019s ultimate determination that the aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), MCA \u2014 that the deliberate homicide was committed by a person previously convicted of a deliberate homicide \u2014 exists. It does and, indeed, this also is undisputed. Furthermore, the evidence supports the court\u2019s findings regarding the nonexistence of other aggravating circumstances set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b6112 With regard to whether the evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings on the existence or nonexistence of the mitigating circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 46-18-304, MCA, we conclude that it does. The only enumerated mitigating circumstance on which Sattler offered evidence or argument was the \u201cparticipating in or consenting to\u201d the homicide argument under \u00a7 46-18-304(l)(e), MCA. As discussed above, Sattler\u2019s self defense testimony did not establish this mitigating circumstance as a matter of fact, logic or law. Thus, the evidence supported the District Court\u2019s finding that this mitigating circumstance did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b6113  Sattler\u2019s other evidence in mitigation was advanced under the \u201ccatchall\u201d provision contained in \u00a7 46-18-304(2), MCA, and consisted of his family background, a 1984 psychological evaluation, and the fact that he was housed in the Jail, rather than returned to the MSP, upon being charged with attempted deliberate homicide while at Swan River. However, the mere introduction of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>regarding mitigating circumstances does not require a finding that the mitigating circumstance to which the evidence relates exists.</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">\u00b6114 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the existence of the aggravating circumstance set forth in \u00a7 46-18-303(2), MCA, and the nonexistence of any mitigating circumstances are supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b6115 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"A0u\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b6116 I concur with the result reached by the Court and I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. However, for the reasons set forth in my special concurrence in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 158, 186, 931 P.2d 1272, 1289, I do not agree with the limits that this Court and the legislature have placed upon the scope of our proportionality review. Section 46-18-310, MCA (1997). Nonetheless, whether reviewed under \u00a7 46-18-310, MCA (1997), or under the more expansive standard that I have suggested, I agree that the sentence imposed on Sattler was not out of proportion to other similar cases, specifically the <em>Turner </em>and <em>Gollehon </em>cases cited in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Arq\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b6117 I concur with the result of the majority opinion. I would affirm the judgment of the District Court. I do not agree with all that is said therein, however, and in particular, disagree with parts of the majority\u2019s rationale for affirming the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the victim\u2019s prior criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b6118 The majority first sets forth \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, which pertains to self-defense, and then concludes that the statute has nothing to do with which of two individuals was the aggressor. I would conclude that the statute is all about who was the aggressor. Self-defense is, by definition, a reaction to an act of aggression. The fact that the term \u201caggressor\u201d is not used in \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA, should not foreclose the obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">\u00b6119 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding Martinson\u2019s prior offense (whatever that offense was) on the basis that no adequate offer of proof was made to preserve the issue for appeal. Rule 103(a)(2), M.R.Evid., provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(a)... Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(2)... In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer or was apparent from the context within which questions were asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqs\">\u00b6120 In this case, we, as the reviewing court, do not know the substance of the evidence Sattler sought to introduce. During the cross-examination of the juvenile probation officer during which Sattler sought to introduce evidence of Martinson\u2019s prior offense, his discussion with the District Court occurred in a manner that could not be heard by the jury and was not recorded. The only record we do have are comments made after the conclusion of evidence and during the settlement of jury instructions. At that time, the following discussion was had:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">[MARTINSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, while we\u2019re waiting, one other thing I think we need to put on the record would be the conversation we had in terms of when Mr. Warnecke was testifying, about my wanting to get in of Mr. Martinson being sent to Pine Hills for molestation because I believe that was a violent act. And the State objected and the Court indicated that it would not allow me to ask those questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">THE COURT: With respect to the molestation charge, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">[MARTINSON\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">THE COURT: The record will so reflect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b6121 There is no offense in Montana known as \u201cmolestation,\u201d and the specific acts by Martinson which Sattler sought to introduce were not identified. Therefore, I conclude that an adequate offer of proof was not made and that there is an insufficient record on which to conclude that relevant evidence pertaining to a characteristic of violence was excluded by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b6 122 For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court, even though I do not agree with all that is said in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b138-10\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"A2L\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">\u00b6123 I concur in the result of the majority opinion and join Justice Terry N. Trieweiler and Justice W. William Leaphart in their concurring opinions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
