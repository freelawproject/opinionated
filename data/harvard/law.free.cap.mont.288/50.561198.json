Slack (Plaintiffs) filed against Aetna Life Insurance Co. (Aetna) on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to file their return of service of summons within the three year period specified by Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u00b62 Plaintiffs commenced their action with the filing of their complaint on November 12, 1992, claiming that Aetna had violated statutory rights of first refusal allegedly granted to Plaintiffs under \u00a7\u00a7 25-13-901 through -904, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summons was issued April 14, 1993. Thereafter, and despite Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Rule 7 [of the Rules of Practice of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court] Order on May 14, 1993, that \u201cthe summons and complaint in this case will be served on defendant within the next 30 to 60 days,\u201d the case languished.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u00b63 On November 9, 1995, the court, pointing out that no proceedings had been taken in the action for two and one-half years, served Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel with notice that, absent a showing of good cause, the action would be dismissed within ten days. Plaintiffs caused their complaint and the summons to be served on the Montana Commissioner of Insurance, Aetna\u2019s statutory agent for service of process, on November 13,1995, at 5:30 p.m. Plaintiffs filed their return of service of process with the Yellowstone County Clerk of the District Court on November 20, 1995. On November 28, 1995, the court entered its order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on the merits. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>court vacated this order on January 12,1996, on the Plaintiffs\u2019motion representing that the summons and complaint had been served on November 13, 1995, and the return of service had been filed on November 20, 1995, eight days prior to the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b64 Aetna moved to dismiss on January 23, 1996, for untimely service of process under Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P. After briefing, the court denied Aetna\u2019s motion on July 24,1996, ruling that process was served within three years of filing the complaint and that, under our decision in <em>Livingston v. Treasure County </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 511, 781 P.2d 1129, the filing of the return of service with the clerk of court was simply a ministerial act which did not affect the timeliness of service of process for Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P., purposes. Aetna filed its answer on September 3,1996. However, on December 18, 1996, Aetna moved the court to reconsider its July 24, 1996 order on the basis of our decision in <em>Haugen v. Blaine Bank of Montana </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 1, 926 P.2d 1364, which overruled <em>Livingston. </em>Aetna\u2019s motion was supported by a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b65 Plaintiffs filed a written objection to Aetna\u2019s motion on January 9, 1997. It is worthy of note, however, that Plaintiffs\u2019 objection, less than a page long, simply stated that they were entitled to rely on the law at the time process was served and that Aetna\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not timely. They filed no supporting brief or memorandum of law; they cited no authority whatsoever to the court; they did not develop any argument in support of their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b66 The court granted Aetna\u2019s motion to reconsider and on January 7,1997, ordered Plaintiffs\u2019complaint dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u00b68  A district court\u2019s determination that a complaint must be dismissed for failure of the plaintiff to comply with Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P. is a conclusion of law. See <em>Sinclair v. Big Bud Mfg. Co. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 363, 366, 865 P.2d 264, 266; <em>First Call, Inc. v. Capital Answering Serv., Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 425, 426, 898 P.2d 96; <em>Haugen, </em>279 Mont. at 5, 926 P.2d at 1366. Our review of the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary. We simply determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>First Call, </em>271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Mont. at 426, 898 P.2d at 96 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">\u00b69  Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">all actions heretofore or hereafter commenced shall be dismissed by the court in which the same shall have been commenced, on its own motion, or on the motion of any party interested therein, whether named in the complaint as a party or not, unless summons shall have been issued within 1 year, or unless summons issued within one year shall have been served <em>and filed with the clerk of the court </em>within 3 years after the commencement of said action, or unless appearance has been made by the defendant or defendants therein within said 3 years. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In <em>Haugen, </em>we held that the filing of proof of service with the clerk of court is not simply a ministerial act and that the rule clearly and unequivocally requires the dismissal of lawsuits when the return of service is not filed with the clerk of court within three years after the commencement of the action. <em>Haugen, </em>279 Mont. at 6, 926 P.2d at 1366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b610 In the case at bar it is undisputed that the return of service of process was not filed with the clerk of the district court within three years after the commencement of Plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action on November 12, 1992, as required by Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P. To the contrary, the record clearly reflects that the return of service was filed with the clerk on November 20,1995, some three years and eight days after commencement of the action. Accordingly, under the plain language of Rule 41(e), M.R.Civ.P, as interpreted by our decision in <em>Haugen, </em>the trial court properly dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b6 11  Notwithstanding, Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint deprived them of procedural due process under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution because they relied on our decision in <em>Livingston. </em>Under <em>Livingston, </em>we determined that filing proof of service is \u201csimply a ministerial act\u201d and failure to file within three years of the commencement of the action did not require dismissal of the complaint. <em>Livingston, </em>239 Mont. at 513, 781 P.2d at 1131 (overruled by <em>Haugen, </em>279 Mont. at 6, 926 P.2d at 1364). We note, however, that this argument was not raised by the Plaintiffs in the District Court. Accordingly, we decline to address it on appeal. <em>Dodd v. City of East Helena </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 518, 523, 591 P.2d 241, 244 (a constitutional issue is waived if not presented at the earliest opportunity) (citing <em>Johnson v. Doran </em>(1975), 167 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>501, 511, 540 P.2d 306, 311; <em>Clontz v. Clontz </em>(1975), 166 Mont. 206, 531 P.2d 1003; and <em>Union Interchange, Inc. v. Allen </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 227, 370 P.2d 492).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b612 Plaintiffs also argue that our decision in <em>Haugen, </em>should not be applied retroactively. Aside from the fact that Plaintiffs also failed to make, much less develop, this argument in the District Court, this issue was discussed at length and decided against Plaintiffs\u2019 position in <em>Haugen. </em>See <em>Haugen, </em>279 Mont. at 7-9, 926 P.2d at 1367-69. Accordingly, we decline to discuss this argument further. <em>See Matter of R.B.O. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 272, 283, 921 P.2d 268, 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b613 We hold that the District Court did not err in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with prejudice.
