Johansen (Johansen) and the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (Department) have filed cross-appeals from an order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. Johansen had filed a petition for judicial review in the District Court of the Department\u2019s decision to cancel his lease of agricultural land for failing to make timely lease payments. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department and dismissed Johansen\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue we address on appeal is whether the District Court erred in holding that it did not have jurisdiction to review Johansen\u2019s petition for judicial review of the Department\u2019s decision to cancel his agricultural lease pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-506, MCA, for failing to make timely lease payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">\u00b63 For decades, Johansen\u2019s family leased agricultural land from the State of Montana. Johansen continued leasing the same land that had originally been leased by his grandfather. The date when Johansen\u2019s rental payments were due are set by statute. Section 77-6-506(2), MCA. Pursuant to that statute, his latest lease payment was initially due on November 15, 1995. If he failed to make a payment by that date, then the full rental and a $25.00 penalty were due on December 31, 1995. The statute also provides the Department with the discretion to extend the deadline past that date. Specifically, that statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-12\">For agricultural leases and the agricultural portion of leases containing both grazing and agricultural land, when the rental is paid on a crop share basis or on a crop share/cash basis, the rental is due in cash on or before November 15 of the year in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>crop is harvested. If the rental is not paid on or before November 15 of the year of crop harvest, a $25 penalty shall be imposed on the lessee. If the full rental and the $25 penalty are not paid on or before December 31 of the year in which the crop is harvested, the entire lease is canceled. The department may extend the deadline in writing. If the lessee does not make the rental payment by the date of extension, the entire lease is canceled. Any rental payment made after November 15 of the year in which the crop is harvested, including payment made after an extension of the deadline, must include the $25 penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Section 77-6-506, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b64 Because Johansen had not paid the rent by November 15, the full rental plus a $25 penalty was due on December 31. Johansen attempted to make this payment from his rural postal box. Postal service for his route is provided by a contract carrier. Contractors, including the contractor on Johansen\u2019s route, routinely accept letters for mailing that are placed in the postal box without the stamps affixed when the customer has provided the correct amount of money for postage. In such a case, the contractor accepts the mail, takes it to the post office, and affixes the postage.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b65 Johansen testified that he and his father before him have mailed the lease payments in this fashion from his rural postal box for the past 38 years. On Friday, December 29, 1995, Johansen again attempted to mail his lease payment in this fashion. He placed the envelope containing his payment in his rural postal box with 32 cents. The postal carrier did not take the letter, however, because snow had blown into the mailbox. The postal carrier left Johansen a note stating that because the box was filled with snow, she was unable to find all the money to pay the required postage. She requested that Johansen remove the snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b66 On Saturday, December 30, 1995, when Johansen went to the mailbox, he discovered the postal carrier\u2019s message. He removed the snow and again left the rental payment in the mail box with money to pay the required postage. That day the postal carrier found the mail and the money in the mailbox, which had been cleaned. Once again, she declined to accept the letter. She left a note, stating that she did not have any stamps and would be unable to get any more because it was a Saturday.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b67 The next two days, Sunday, December 31, 1995, and Monday, January 1,1996 were both legal holidays, so the post office was closed and mail was not delivered. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-1- 216(a) and (b), MCA. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Tuesday, January 2, 1996, Johansen went to his mailbox and discovered the note left by the postal carrier the previous Saturday and saw that the envelope containing the rental payment was still in his postal box. That same afternoon, he drove to East Helena and personally mailed the payment from the East Helena post office. However, the envelope did not receive a postmark until the next day, January 3,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">\u00b68 By letter dated January 24, 1996, and delivered February 9, 1996, the Department notified Johansen that it was canceling his agricultural lease, for failure to timely pay his rent. It notified him that he no longer had the right to use the leased land, and that any use would be considered a trespass. The Department also informed him that it would be advertising the land for lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b69 By letter dated April 1, 1996, Johansen requested that the Department reinstate his lease. He argued that the Department had the authority to do so pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-211(3), MCA, which provides that a lease may be reinstated where \u201cthe violation is not serious enough to warrant cancellation. ...\u201d Alternatively, Johansen requested that the Department give him a contested case hearing pursuant to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), \u00a7 2-4-601, <em>et seq., </em>MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b610 The Department informally discussed the cancellation of the lease with Johansen. With regard to Johansen\u2019s claim that he mailed the letter from the East Helena post office on January 2, 1996, the Department admitted that if had been postmarked that day rather than January 3, it would not have canceled the lease. Subsequently, by letter dated May 30, 1996, the Department denied his request for a contested case hearing, stating that because no person could verify (1) that he indeed placed the rental payment in the mail in a timely fashion; and (2) that the post office routinely accepts letters for mailing without postage stamps affixed to them, there were no issues of fact or law to be resolved by a contested case hearing. It also denied his request for reinstatement of the lease, and stated that the letter constituted a final agency decision pursuant to MAPA, \u00a7 2-4-623, MCA, which pertains to final agency decisions adverse to a party in a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b611 On June 11, 1996, Johansen requested a redetermination of the Department\u2019s decision or alternatively an appeal to the State Board of Land Commissioners pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-211, MCA. In direct response to the Department\u2019s statement that no person could verify whether the postal carrier accepts letters for mailing without postage stamps affixed to them, Johansen submitted a letter from the post<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>master in East Helena verifying that the postal carrier accepts such mail so long as money is provided for the stamps. He additionally submitted relevant excerpts from the USPS Handbook. Johansen also challenged the Department\u2019s failure to address or make factual findings or legal conclusions that addressed the issues raised by Johansen in his original request for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b612 At some point, the postal carrier servicing Johansen\u2019s route testified by affidavit that she routinely accepts letters from the Johansen residence without the stamps affixed when the correct amount of money is provided for postage. She also confirmed Johansen\u2019s statements that she found mail in his mailbox on Friday, December 29, and again on Saturday, December 30, but did not take the mail because snow had blown into the mailbox on Friday, and she was unable to get stamps on Saturday. Although this affidavit was filed with the District Court in connection with various motions below, the record is unclear as to when she signed the affidavit or when Johansen provided it to the Department, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b613 By letter dated June 25, 1996, the Department again refused to reinstate his lease and rejected his request for a hearing before the State Board of Land Commissioners. The Department stated that the cancellation of the lease was \u201cautomatic.\u201d Although the Department insisted that cancellation was \u201cautomatic,\u201d it did not address its statutory authority to extend the rental due date past the December 31,1995 deadline, nor did it explain under what circumstances it has done so in the past. <em>See </em>\u00a7 77-6-506, MCA. It also rejected Johansen\u2019s evidence that his rural postal carrier accepted letters without postage affixed to it, even if there was money for the postage in the mailbox along with the letter. Additionally, although it had earlier stated in its April 1, 1996 letter that its decision was a final decision under contested case proceedings pursuant to MAPA, \u00a7 2-4-623, MCA, it now stated for the first time that Johansen had no statutory right to a contested case hearing, because termination for nonpayment of rent was automatic pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-506, MCA. The Department also stated that its purpose in meeting informally with Johansen was to verify that his payment was not received by the statutory deadline. In its view, whether it set out a formal division of facts and law was thus \u201cirrelevant.\u201d Finally, it stated its view that \u00a7 77-6-211, MCA, which allows for reinstatement when the lease violation is not serious, only applies to cases where the lease is canceled \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as for overgrazing, and not where the lease is canceled for failure to timely pay rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u00b614 Consequently, Johansen filed a petition for judicial review with the District Court. The court ruled in favor of the Department on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment. It held that the Department\u2019s action in this case was not a contested case proceeding, and that it therefore had no jurisdiction under MAPA to review the agency\u2019s decision. Accordingly, it dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. It is from this decision that the parties have filed cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b615  This Court reviews the grant or denial of summary judgment rulings de novo. <em>Seeley v. Davis </em>(1997), [284 Mont. 517], 946 P.2d 119, 121. It applies the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria used by the district court. <em>Seeley, </em>946 P.2d at 121. In response to a motion for summary judgment in this case, the court dismissed the case based upon lack of jurisdiction. This Court reviews that legal determination to determine whether the court erred. <em>Seeley, </em>946 P.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b616 The District Court held that the Department\u2019s action in this case was not a contested case proceeding under MAPA, \u00a7 2-4-601, <em>et seq., </em>MCA. It held that judicial review pursuant to MAPA was therefore not appropriate, and concluded that it had no jurisdiction to review Johansen\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b617 On appeal, Johansen argues that the Department unlawfully denied him his right to a contested case proceeding pursuant to MAPA, \u00a7 2-4-601, <em>et seq., </em>MCA. He contends that the District Court did have jurisdiction under MAPA, \u00a7 2-4-701, <em>et seq., </em>MCA, to review his petition and that it should have ordered the Department to grant him a full contested case hearing prior to canceling his lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u00b618 The Department agrees with Johansen that the District Court had jurisdiction to review his petition. However, it disputes Johansen\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a contested case hearing or that the District Court had jurisdiction to review the petition pursuant to MAPA. Instead, it argues that the District Court had authority to review the petition pursuant to the standard of review for informal agency decisions set forth in <em>Langen v. Badlands Co-op State Grazing District </em>(1951), 125 Mont. 302, 234 P.2d 467; and <em>North Fork Pres. v. DSL </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 451, 778 P.2d 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\u00b619 For the reasons elaborated below, this Court agrees with the District Court\u2019s determination that Johansen was not entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>contested case hearing and that MAPA was therefore inapplicable. But we do not agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to review Johansen\u2019s petition. We hold that the District Court did have jurisdiction to review the Department\u2019s decision to determine whether the lease cancellation was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b620  Johansen is correct in asserting that pursuant to MAPA, an administrative agency must afford all parties a trial-type hearing in a \u201ccontested case.\u201d Sections 2-4-601, 2-4-612, MCA. He is equally correct in asserting that the District Court has jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of such contested cases. Section 2-4-701, <em>et seq., </em>MCA. But the statutory requirement of a trial-type hearing does not apply to every situation where a person\u2019s interest is adversely affected by agency action. Rather, such a hearing is required only in \u201ccontested cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b621 A \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of MAPA is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">a proceeding before an agency in which a determination of legal rights, duties, or privileges of a party is required by law to be made after an opportunity for hearing. The term includes but is not restricted to ratemaking, price fixing, and licensing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Section 2-4-102(4), MCA. The lease of agriculture land does not constitute ratemaking or price fixing, and Johansen does not contend that the lease constitutes a \u201clicense.\u201d We therefore turn to the statutory provisions governing the lease of agricultural land to determine whether the Department was \u201crequired by law\u201d to afford Johansen a trial-type hearing prior to canceling his lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b622 The termination of a lease for failing to make a rental payment is provided for in \u00a7 77- 6-506(2), MCA. That section contains no provision requiring the Department to hold a hearing prior to canceling the lease. In contrast, \u00a7 77-6-211, MCA, provides for an administrative hearing when a lease is canceled pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-113, MCA (for failing to properly manage agricultural lands), \u00a7 77-6-208, MCA (for violating rules regarding subleasing of land), \u00a7 77-6-209, MCA (for failing to seek approval before changing a grazing lease to an agricultural lease), and \u00a7 77-6-210, MCA (for various causes, such as fraud, misrepresentation, or using the land for purposes other than those authorized by the lease). No provision requires the Department to hold a hearing when the lease is canceled for nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u00b623  Although a contested case hearing is not required by-statute, Johansen argues that such a hearing is required by Montana\u2019s constitution. Specifically, he contends that such a hearing is \u201crequired by law\u201d pursuant to Article II, Section 17 of the Montana State Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">Due process of law. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">However, Johansen cites no legal authority and sets forth no analysis to support his argument. Johansen fails to provide analysis as to whether he had a property interest in the continuation of the agricultural lease that was canceled for failure to timely pay rent. Even were we to assume that it does constitute \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of Montana\u2019s constitution, he provides no analysis as to what process was due in this case. For example, he cites no case law that requires the Department to hold a formal, pre-termination hearing as opposed to an informal post-termination hearing. Finally, Johansen provides no analysis as to how the Department allegedly violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b624  Johansen must cite authority for the position he advances. Rule 23, M.R.App.P. It is not this Court\u2019s job to conduct legal research on his behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to that position. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1997), [285 Mont. 449], 948 P.2d 1173, 1180; <em>State v. Fina </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 171, 181, 902 P.2d 30, 38. Johansen has failed to establish that the Montana State Constitution required the Department hold a formal, trial-type hearing prior to canceling his lease. We hold that such a hearing was not \u201crequired by law\u201d prior to terminating his lease, and the District Court did not have jurisdiction pursuant to MAPA to review his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b625  Simply because an administrative decision is not a \u201ccontested case,\u201d however, does not mean that Johansen has no avenue to seek review of the Department\u2019s decision. Indeed, the Department itself admits that the courts have the inherent power to review its decisions, whether or not they involve \u201ccontested cases.\u201d Citing <em>Langen </em>and <em>North Fork </em>Pres.,the Department contends that the District Court may review any informal administrative decision to determine whether the Department used a fair procedure, whether questions of law were properly decided, and whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence. Johansen does not directly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>spond to the Department\u2019s argument, other than to argue that the District Court has jurisdiction to review its decision pursuant to MAPA. He does not challenge the Department\u2019s interpretation of the correct standard of review for non-MAPA agency decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b626 <em>In North Fork Pres., </em>this Court addressed its power to review a non-MAPA administrative decision. That case involved a challenge to the Department of State Lands\u2019 approval of an operating plan on an oil and gas lease on school trust lands. North Fork Preservation Association filed a complaint, alleging that the Department of State Lands had failed to prepare an environmental impact statement as required by law. <em>North Fork Pres., </em>778 P.2d at 863. Upon reviewing the case, this Court noted that \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA, the standard of review for judicial review of contested case hearings under MAPA was inapplicable, because that section deals with review of \u201ccontested cases,\u201d and that case did not involve a contested case. <em>North Fork Pres, </em>778 P.2d at 865-66. We thus addressed the standard of review the district court should use in that non-MAPA case and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">The review by the district court is only for the purpose of determining the legal rights of the parties involved. This is so because of the division of governmental powers under the Constitution, neither the district court nor the Supreme Court may substitute their discretion for the discretion reposed in boards and commissions by the legislative acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">The appeal from the commission to the district court is for the purpose merely of determining whether upon the evidence and the law of the action of the commission is based upon any error of law, or is wholly unsupported by the evidence or clearly arbitrary or capricious. On such review courts will only inquire insofar as to ascertain if the board or commission has stayed within the statutory bounds and has not acted arbitrarily, capriciously or unlawfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-7\"><em>North Fork Pres., </em>778 P.2d at 866 <em>(citing Langen, </em>234 P.2d at 470).</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u00b627 We further stated that in reaching its decision, the Department of State Lands was carrying out a statutory duty assigned to it and not to the courts and that its decision involved expertise within its province. Accordingly, we held that the standard of review to be applied by the trial court and this Court was whether the record established that the agency acted \u201carbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully.\u201d <em>North Fork Pres., </em>778 P.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b628 In this case, the Department is charged by the legislature with managing state trust lands, including the leasing of agricultural lands. Section 77-1-301(1), MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">Under the direction of the board, the department has charge of the selecting, exchange, classification, appraisal, leasing, management, sale, or other disposition of the state lands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Department thus has jurisdiction in the first instance to determine whether to cancel a lease. We agree with the Department that it is the courts\u2019 function to review its decision to determine whether its decision is arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b629  The Department additionally argues that when conducting its review, the District Court should afford its decision great deference. The Department is correct in noting that the courts defer to an agency\u2019s decision where its resolution implicates substantial agency expertise. However, whether Johansen timely mailed his rental payment, whether the U.S. postal service \u201caccepts\u201d letters for mailing without postage on rural routes serviced by a contract carrier where a person has provided money for the postage, or whether mailing takes place upon placing a letter in a mailbox or only upon the receipt of a postmark are not disputes that invoke any particular expertise within the Department\u2019s province. They do not involve the high level of technical expertise that is required, for example, when the Department cancels alease due to mismanagement of State land. Thus, although the reviewing courts will conduct a limited review of the Department\u2019s decision, it is not necessary that they accord any particularly special deference to the decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b630 We hold that the District Court did have jurisdiction to review the Department\u2019s decision to cancel Johansen\u2019s lease for failing to make timely lease payments. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u00b631 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
