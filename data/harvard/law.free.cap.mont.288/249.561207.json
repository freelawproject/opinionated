Randy asserts that Rule 8.22.302, ARM, which requires that the Board defer to a steward\u2019s decision disqualifying a racehorse, deprives him of due process. The District Court held that Randy failed to make an affirmative showing that he was denied due process and affirmed the decision of the Board. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b62 Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce, a thoroughbred race horse owned and trained by Randy, entered and ran as the number 1 horse in a feature race at the Budweiser Derby held at the Montana State Fair. This race was a \u201cstakes race\u201d which requires each participant to pay a series of fees to enter the race. The payments are distributed among the top finishers in the race. Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce came in first in the eleventh race, but was disqualified following the protests of the trainers of the number 6 and number 7 horses. The protesting trainers contended that when Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce was approaching the final turn heading into the stretch, the horse moved to the rail without having sufficient room. This move caused the jockeys of the number 6 and number 7 horses to \u201ccheck\u201d or pull back on their horses.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">\u00b63 When a protest is filed, the stewards are vested with authority to rule on the protest by reviewing video tape replays of the race. This process occurs immediately after the race so that winning wagers can be paid. The State Fair race track has three camera stations, a \u201chead-on\u201d view at the starting gate, a \u201cbackside\u201d view behind the gate, and a \u201cpan view\u201d from the top of the grandstand which simulates the view observed by the racing fans. For some unexplained reason, the \u201chead-on\u201d and \u201cbackside\u201d views were not available for the eleventh race. The stewards viewed the \u201cpan view\u201d replay which showed a parallel view of the horses at the time of the alleged interference by Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce. The stewards, after viewing the tape and without consulting with Randy, determined that Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce obstructed the other horses and disqualified Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce. As a result, Randy lost the first place purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b64 In the event an owner is dissatisfied with the stewards\u2019 ruling, he may appeal the decision to the Board. Randy appealed the stewards\u2019 decision. The Board held an <em>en banc </em>hearing pursuant to the contested case provisions of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. The Board determined that Rule 8.22.302, ARM, precluded it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>from substituting its judgment for that of the stewards on questions of fact and voted to affirm the stewards\u2019 decision. Randy appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the District Court asserting that his due process rights had been violated by the Board\u2019s deference to the stewards\u2019 decision. The District Court found that, since Randy was allowed meaningful participation in the Board hearing he was not deprived of due process. The District Court affirmed the decision of the Board. Randy appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to this Court. Randy presents one issue on appeal: Did the Board of Horse Racing deprive Randy of due process by deferring to the stewards\u2019 decision pursuant to Rule 8.22.302, ARM?</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b65 This Court\u2019s standard for reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474, 803 P.2d 601, 603. The District Court concluded that Randy was allowed meaningful participation in the case and thus was not denied due process. We review this conclusion to determine whether the District Court properly interpreted Montana\u2019s constitutional guarantee to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b66 Rule 8.22.302, ARM, provides that \u201c[o]n review of a stewards\u2019 decision disqualifying a horse in a race, the board shall not substitute its judgment for (second guess) that of the stewards as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\u201d State steward Bob Bird, who appeared at the Board hearing, reviewed the video tape and the stewards\u2019 decision that Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce interfered with the number 6 and number 7 horses in the far turn of the eleventh race. In contrast, Randy testified that Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce was running in a straight pattern, maintained his path and did not interfere with the other horses. The Board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law indicate that pursuant to Rule 8.22.302\u2019s requirement that, as to questions of fact, the Board not substitute its judgment for that of the stewards, the Board was required to accept the stewards\u2019 findings as to the facts of the race over the testimony of Randy. As a result, the Board affirmed the decision of the stewards to disqualify Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b67 The District Court determined that Randy \u201cwas allowed meaningful participation in the case\u201d because he was allowed to testify and cross-examine the steward. The District Court further determined that Randy had the burden of showing that the procedure used by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Board somehow violated his rights and concluded that Randy failed to make an affirmative showing that he was deprived of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"Afd\">\u00b68 Randy argues that it was not the \u201cprocedure\u201d used by the Board at the hearing, but rather, the Board\u2019s interpretation of Rule 8.22.302, ARM, as requiring deference to the stewards\u2019 determination of the facts that deprived him of due process. In other words, Randy argues that since the issue of whether Mickey\u2019s Hot Sauce interfered with the other horses was one of fact, and since Rule 8.22.302, ARM, requires that the Board defer to the stewards\u2019 determination on questions of fact, there was no point in having a Board hearing and allowing Randy to present evidence because, in accordance with the Rule, the evidence necessarily fell on deaf ears. By that point, the decision was a <em>fait accompli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b69 Moreover, Randy asserts that he should have been allowed to discuss the decision with the stewards on the day of the race. The trainers of the number 6 and number 7 horses were allowed to present their arguments to the stewards, but Randy, who was disqualified, was not even contacted or given an opportunity to present his argument before the stewards made their decision. Thus, Randy argues that he was not given a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the day of the race when the stewards made their decision or at the hearing when the Board simply deferred to the decision of the stewards. Randy, owner of \u201cMickey\u2019s Hot Sauce,\u201d cites Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones for the proposition that \u201cYou can\u2019t always get what you <em>want, </em>But if you try sometimes you just might find You\u2019ll get what you <em>needl\u201d </em>Although it is somewhat daunting to contemplate the <em>needs </em>of a steed named \u201cMickey\u2019s Hot Sauce,\u201d for purposes of this appeal we presume that what he needs is a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b610 The State argues that Randy was accorded due process of law in that he was allowed to appeal, was given proper notice of the hearing including the date, time, and place of the hearing and fully participated in the process at the Board level. Accordingly, the State contends that the District Court correctly affirmed the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b611 The State\u2019s position, however, fails to consider the fact that Randy was denied any opportunity to be heard by the persons making the final decision on the facts, i.e., the stewards. The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Connell v. State, Dept. of Social Services </em>(1997), 280 Mont. 491, 496, 930 P.2d 88, 91; <em>Small v. McRae </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 497, 506, 651 P.2d 982, 987. Due process is not a fixed concept as the State would have us believe, \u201crather, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>one which must be tailored to each situation in such a way that it meets the needs and protects the interests of the various parties involved.\u201d <em>Small, </em>651 P.2d at 988. Furthermore, \u201cdue process mandates that an administrative hearing will constitute a fair trial, conducted in accordance with fundamental principles of fair play and applicable procedural standards established by law.\u201d <em>Connell, </em>930 P.2d at 91 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b612 We determine that the stewards\u2019 failure to contact Randy regarding their decision the day of the race denied Randy an opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the Board\u2019s deference to the stewards\u2019 determination of the facts, although in accordance with Rule 8.22.302, ARM, resulted in a hearing which violated fundamental principles of fair play Rule 8.22.302\u2019s requirement that the Board defer to the stewards on questions of fact is unconstitutional as applied to a situation such as this where the stewards made their factual determination without affording both sides an opportunity to be heard. Such deference is only appropriate if the stewards have weighed the factual contentions of both sides of the dispute. When, as here, the stewards have not given both sides an opportunity to be heard, the Board should not defer to the stewards. Rather, it should conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing and make its own findings of fact. Ultimately, there is no guarantee that Randy will get what he \u201cwants.\u201d If not, he, like Mick Jagger, will be lamenting \u201cI can\u2019t get no satisfaction.\u201d Although due process does not guarantee \u201csatisfaction,\u201d it does guarantee that he be allowed a chance to make out a case for satisfaction. We reverse the decision of the District Court and remand this matter to the Board for a <em>de novo </em>administrative hearing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
