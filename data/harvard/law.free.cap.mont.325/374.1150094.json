We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">\u00b63 On October 3, 2002, the State of Montana (State) charged Smith by information with the offenses of theft, a misdemeanor, and theft by common scheme, a felony. The State alleged that Smith stole an ATM card from his mother, Bernice Smith (Bernice), and used the card to withdraw money from her bank account and charge items for his personal use in an amount totaling $4,260.54. During pretrial proceedings, Smith moved <em>in limine </em>to preclude witnesses at trial from testifying regarding any prior crimes, wrongs or bad acts committed by Smith, including any testimony regarding his prior criminal convictions. The State did not oppose the motion and stated it would instruct its witnesses not to refer to any of those matters while testifying. The District Court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">\u00b64 A jury trial was held on September 8, 2003. The State called Bernice to testify during its case-in-chief. Bernice testified that, on July 23,2002, she discovered that her ATM card was missing from her purse. She did not know how long the card had been missing. She further testified that Smith, who had been living in her house, had disappeared during the week before her discovery and she suspected that he had taken the card. During cross-examination, Smith\u2019s counsel asked Bernice what efforts she made to locate Smith after she discovered the ATM card was gone. Bernice responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Well, one of the things was is that I went to his parole officer, my husband and I went to his parole officer, to see if he knew where he was at.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Smith then moved for a mistrial, asserting that Bernice\u2019s reference to his parole officer indicated prior bad acts by Smith and violated the order <em>in limine. </em>The District Court denied the motion on the basis that Bernice\u2019s statement was in direct response to a question asked by Smith\u2019s counsel. Smith did not request the District Court to give the jury a cautionary instruction and the court did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b65 At the close of trial the jury found Smith guilty of both offenses. The District Court subsequently sentenced Smith and entered judgment on the convictions and sentences. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 72, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6 72, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b67 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for a mistrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">\u00b68 Smith contends the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial because Bernice\u2019s testimony referring to his parole officer constituted evidence of prior bad acts in violation of the court\u2019s order <em>in limine. </em>He relies on <em>State v. Partin </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 12, 18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005, for the general rule that a mistrial is appropriate where there is a reasonable possibility that inadmissible evidence may have contributed to a defendant\u2019s conviction. He further observes that, pursuant to <em>Partin, </em>287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1005, this Court considers three factors in determining whether an inadmissible statement contributed to a conviction-the strength of the evidence against the defendant, the prejudicial effect of the testimony and whether a cautionary jury instruction could cure any prejudice. Smith asserts that application of these three factors establishes there is a reasonable possibility that Bernice\u2019s inadmissible testimony may have contributed to his conviction and denied him a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u00b69 The State responds that the District Court correctly observed that Bernice\u2019s statement regarding Smith\u2019s parole officer was in direct response to a question from Smith\u2019s counsel and, therefore, any error resulting from Bernice\u2019s testimony was invited by Smith. It contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>that, on this basis, we should decline to review the merits of this issue under the well-established rule that we will not reverse a district court\u2019s ruling based on error in which the complaining party acquiesced or participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b610  We often have held that a party waives the right to appeal an alleged error by a district court when the appealing party acquiesced in, actively participated in or did not object to the error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6\u00b6 44 and 47, 318 Mont. 436, \u00b6\u00b6 44 and 47, 80 P.3d 1262, \u00b6\u00b6 44 and 47; <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Thus, where objectionable evidence or testimony is elicited by a party\u2019s own actions, that party waives the right to allege error on appeal because of the party\u2019s active participation in creating the error. <em>See Harris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33. \u00b611 In <em>State v. Gafford </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 380, 563 P.2d 1129, for example, the defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on comments made by two prospective jurors dining <em>voir dire </em>regarding the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts. We declined to hold the trial court committed reversible error in denying the motion for mistrial because the allegedly prejudicial comments were elicited by the defendant\u2019s own counsel. <em>Gafford, </em>172 Mont. at 386, 563 P.2d at 1133. The defendant\u2019s counsel invited the comment from the first juror that the defendant previously had been charged with driving while intoxicated by further questioning the juror regarding his remark that he once had been in jail with the defendant. <em>Gafford, </em>172 Mont. at 386, 563 P.2d at 1132-33. As to the second juror\u2019s remark that he knew the defendant had been in trouble before, we held there was no reversible error because the remark was in response to a broadly worded question-rather than a question limited to a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response-by defense counsel and \u201cwas within the bounds of a normal response by a layman unversed in the intricacies of language and correct legal procedure.\u201d <em>Gafford, </em>172 Mont. at 386, 563 P.2d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b6 12 The situation in <em>Gafford </em>with respect to the second juror is similar to that presented here. In this case, Smith\u2019s counsel asked Bernice on cross-examination \u201cwhat efforts, if any, did you [take to] locate [Smith] at that point?\u201d Bernice responded that \u201cone of the things was is that I went to his parole officer, my husband and I went to his parole officer, to see if he knew where he was at.\u201d Smith\u2019s counsel asked Bernice a broad, open-ended question to which she gave an honest answer. Because Bernice was the State\u2019s witness and, thus, was being cross-examined by Smith\u2019s counsel, counsel could have asked a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>which required a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response or a question otherwise leading to a specific answer, but did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b613 Smith contends that <em>Gafford </em>is distinguishable because, in that case, the prospective jurors were not warned to refrain from mentioning the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts or crimes. Here, in contrast, the District Court\u2019s order <em>in limine </em>specifically precluded admitting evidence of such acts and the State\u2019s witnesses-including Bernice-had been instructed not to mention any of Smith\u2019s prior bad acts or crimes in their testimony. Consequently, according to Smith, Bernice should have known to answer his counsel\u2019s question without mentioning any inadmissible information, as she had been instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b614 When Smith moved for a mistrial following Bernice\u2019s remark, the District Court held a discussion outside the presence of the jury during which Bernice stated that she had been instructed not to mention Smith\u2019s prior bad acts or convictions, but \u201cdidn\u2019t know that I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention that\u201d Smith had a parole officer. It is undisputed that Bernice is not a lawyer, nor does she have other legal training or experience which would provide her with the knowledge that mentioning Smith\u2019s parole officer could be within the prohibition on referring to Smith\u2019s prior bad acts. In other words, Bernice\u2019s response to the broad question asked by Smith\u2019s counsel \u201cwas within the bounds of a normal response by a layman unversed in the intricacies of language and correct legal procedure.\u201d <em>See Gafford, </em>172 Mont. at 386, 563 P.2d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b615  Finally, we observe that Smith compounded the effect of his participation in the District Court\u2019s alleged error by not asking the court to cure potential prejudice resulting from Bernice\u2019s remark by moving to strike the answer or requesting the court to give the jury a cautionary instruction regarding the effect of the testimony. <em>See, e.g., State v. Soraich, </em>1999 MT 87, \u00b6 21, 294 Mont. 175, \u00b6 21, 979 P.2d 206, \u00b6 21. We conclude that, by asking Bernice the broad, open-ended question on cross-examination, Smith invited the error contained in her response that she spoke to Smith\u2019s parole officer. Therefore, because Smith actively participated in creating the error of which he now complains, we further conclude that he has waived his right to raise this allegation of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b616  We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b402-9\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
