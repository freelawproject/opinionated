This was not Officer Bell\u2019s first encounter with Matt, as Officer Bell had been called to disturbances involving Matt at the residence on several previous occasions. Upon Officer Bell\u2019s arrival, he observed Matt st\u00e1nding outside of Pablo\u2019s residence. However, before Officer Bell could exit his patrol vehicle, Matt, in an \u201cangry and agitated\u201d state, immediately began <em>\u201cchallenging </em>[Officer Bell].\u201d Officer Bell testified that this behavior was uncharacteristic of Matt, noting that Matt usually attempted to thwart law enforcement by running away. Matt then began to run and entered the residence, and Officer Bell determined to follow. As Officer Bell entered the residence, Matt attempted to grab a kitchen knife, which prompted Officer Bell to draw his service revolver and respond \u201cdon\u2019t do it.\u201d At that point, Officer Bell considered the situation dangerous, and testified that he was prepared to shoot Matt. Matt then threw a chair which struck Officer Bell in the hip and damaged his portable radio. Matt then threw a second chair, which struck Officer Bell\u2019s left shin. Officer Bell pepper sprayed Matt in an effort to subdue him, but to no avail. Still combative, Matt then threw a third chair, which struck Officer Bell\u2019s hand and head. Again, Officer Bell attempted to subdue Matt with pepper spray, but without effect. Ultimately, it required three officers to arrest and transport Matt from Pablo\u2019s residence to the patrol vehicle, as Matt resisted the entire time. Officer Bell was then transported to St. Luke\u2019s Hospital where doctors discovered he had sustained bruising on his hip, a shin contusion, nerve damage to one finger, a head laceration, and whiplash to his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b65 The State charged Matt with Count I, assault with a weapon, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, and Count II, assault on a peace officer, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA, each charge reflecting different injuries inflicted on Officer Bell in the incident. On February 5,2003, Matt pleaded guilty to Count II, assault on a peace officer. He then moved to dismiss Count I, arguing this charge was a lesser included offense of Count II, pursuant to \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>that the State\u2019s prosecution for this charge violated his double jeopardy rights, as set forth in \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA. The District Court rejected Matt\u2019s dismissal motion, whereupon Matt pleaded guilty to Count I, reserving his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy is a question of law, which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 21, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in denying Matt\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge of assault with a weapon under \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, on the grounds it was a lesser included offense of assault on a peace officer under \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA, to which Matt pleaded guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b68 Matt argues that the State\u2019s prosecution on Count I violated the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, because that charge, assault with a weapon, is an \u201cincluded offense,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, of Count II, assault on a peace officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\u00b69 As a preliminary argument, Matt asserts that the State\u2019s discretion to charge a defendant under one subsection of a statute, rather than another equally plausible subsection of the same statute, enables the State to avoid double jeopardy issues by intentionally charging offenses which are not \u201cincluded offenses.\u201d This, he argues, results in defendants being charged under multiple statutes for the same crime. As an example, he explains that, if the State had charged him, in Count II (assault on a police officer), of violating subsection (l)(c) of \u00a7 45-5-210, MCA, instead of subsection (l)(a), then the charge in Count I (assault with a weapon) under \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, would have been a lesser included offense to the charge in Count II, and, therefore, a separate conviction thereunder would have been prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">\u00b610 However, though the State may well have strategically avoided a double jeopardy defense by its charging decision, there is no error in doing so. The State is vested with broad discretion in making charging decisions. As we have noted, \u201ca county attorney has broad discretion in determining when to prosecute a case and what crime will be charged. In Montana, \u2018[i]t is not only incumbent upon the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>attorney to determine when or when not to prosecute a case, but when the facts of a case support a possible charge of more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>2004 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 322 Mont. 206, \u00b6 19, 95 P.3d 137, \u00b6 19 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Fletcher v. District Court </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 410, 415, 859 P.2d 992, 995). Thus, the State properly acted within its discretion by choosing to charge Matt pursuant to both \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), and 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b611 We turn then to Matt\u2019s primary argument that \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, is an included offense of \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA, and therefore cannot sustain a separate conviction. He notes that pursuant to \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA, \u201c[a] defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if one offense is included in another.\u201d However, this provision also contemplates that multiple charges may arise out of one transaction: \u201c[w]hen the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.\u201d Section 46-11-410(1), MCA. The State contends that two charges were properly brought against Matt for his conduct in this transaction, and that neither offense was included within the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b612 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, an \u201cincluded offense\u201d is defined as one that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">(a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; (b) consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included in the offense charged; or (c) differs from the offense charged only in respect that a less serious injury or risk to the same person, property, or public interest or lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b613 In <em>Beavers, </em>we applied this statute and noted that \u201c[w]e have consistently stated that the term, \u2018facts,\u2019 refers to the statutory elements of the offenses, not the individual facts of the case.\u201d <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 30. Further, we explained that pursuant to \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, \u201c[w]e must consider each of these [elements] separately in respect to the statutory definitions of the offenses involved.\u201d <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 25<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b614 Matt argues that under \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, the State\u2019s prosecution of Count I, for violation of \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>proof of the same or less elements as required for conviction of the charge under Count II, \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA. Pursuant to <em>Beavers, </em>and the provisions of \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, we must therefore compare the elements of these statutes. <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b615  We conclude that \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, is not a lesser included offense of\u00a745-5-210(l)(a), MCA. Section 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA, states that \u201cA person commits the offense of assault on a peace officer or judicial officer if the person purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to a peace officer or judicial officer.\u201d In contrast, \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA, provides that \u201cA person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a weapon.\u201d Clearly, \u00a7 45-2-213(l)(a), MCA, requires the finding of the additional element that the offense of assault be committed <em>with a weapon, </em>and thus, cannot be established by the same or fewer elements required to establish an offense under \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA. Likewise, \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA, requires proof of an element not included in \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), MCA-causing bodily injury <em>to a peace officer. </em>Therefore, the State\u2019s prosecution of Matt for assault with a weapon did not violate constitutional or statutory double jeopardy protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> Subsequent to <em>Beavers, </em>\u00a7 46-1-202, MCA, was amended by Laws of Montana, Ch. 303, Sec. 1, (2001), and the definition of \u201cincluded offense\u201d was recodified as \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
