(AMC) and Zollie Kelman (Kelman). We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of AMC, holding as a matter of law Bellanger was not constructively discharged?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of Kelman, holding that Kelman was an agent of AMC acting within the scope of his agency, and therefore could not be sued for tortious interference with the business relationship between AMC and Bellanger?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b65 AMC is a corporation which provides video gaming and gambling machines to local businesses in Great Falls and the surrounding area. Kelman founded AMC, but transferred ownership of the business to his children in 1989. The business is currently owned by Kelman\u2019s daughters, Abby Portney and Natalie Kelman. Kelman is a creditor of the company and owns the building in which AMC is located. Bellanger worked for AMC from October 22, 1990, through May 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b66 Bellanger brought this action against AMC seeking damages for constructive discharge. She claimed the work situation created by Kelman\u2019s conduct and AMC\u2019s failure to control him, caused her stomach problems, impaired her ability to function normally at work, caused her to lose sleep, and caused her concern for her physical safety. She sought damages from Kelman for tortious interference with her business relationship with AMC, alleging he treated her in such an abusive, threatening, and intimidating manner that it caused her to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b67 Bellanger cites numerous examples of Kelman\u2019s intimidating and threatening behavior that occurred in 1998 and 1999, which she documented in a journal. The most threatening incident occurred April 20, 1999, when Bellanger claims Kelman stormed into her office yelling and shaking his finger at her for giving confidential information to technicians outside the company. Per her report, he slammed his hand into her wall and threatened her by stating \u201cit\u2019s you or me.\u201d Bellanger claims she was terrified Kelman would physically hit her the next time.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b68 AMC and Kelman moved for summary judgment. Kelman contended that: 1) the facts alleged could not constitute constructive discharge as a matter of law; 2) Bellanger\u2019s claim against him was preempted by the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), \u00a7 39-2-901, MCA, et seq.; and that 3) since Kelman was an agent of AMC, he is privileged from claims of tortious interference. AMC\u2019s motion was based on its contention that no material fact existed as to whether AMC discharged Bellanger in violation of WDEA. On October 24, 2003, the District Court entered its Order granting both motions, concluding as a matter of law that Bellanger\u2019s claim against Kelman was not barred by WDEA, but that Bellanger had not demonstrated that the conditions of her employment were sufficiently intolerable to constitute a constructive discharge, and that because Kelman was an agent of AMC, pursuant to \u00a7 28-10-103, MCA, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>privileged from a claim for tortious interference. Bellanger now appeals from this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>Motta v. Philipsburg Sch. Bd. Trs., </em>2004 MT 256, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 72, \u00b6 11, 98 P.3d 673, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted). The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of proving there are no genuine issues of material fact that would permit a non-moving party to succeed on the merits of the case, and if the moving party meets that burden, then the non-moving party must provide substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid summary judgment in favor of the moving party. Once it is established that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and this Court reviews that determination to determine whether the district court erred. <em>Motta, </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cSummary judgment is an extreme remedy which should never be substituted for a trial if a material factual controversy exists.\u201d <em>Matthews v. BJS Constr., Inc., </em>2003 MT 116, \u00b6 13, 315 Mont. 441, \u00b6 13, 68 P.3d 865, \u00b6 13 (quoting <em>Montana Metal Blds., Inc. v. Shapiro </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of AMC, holding as a matter of law Bellanger was not constructively discharged?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u00b611 Bellanger argues that, for purposes of summary judgment, her allegations must be taken as true, and that based on her allegations, any reasonable person would find her work environment intolerable. Bellanger asserts the District Court erroneously focused its attention on a single incident of abuse and ignored the duration, nature, and severity of Kelman\u2019s conduct and its physical and emotional impact on her. She argues she has the legal and constitutional right to present her claims to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\u00b612 AMC contends Bellanger\u2019s claim is based solely on the April 20, 1999 incident and that following that incident, she experienced no further adverse contact with him. AMC argues there was no constructive discharge because the facts were not sufficiently severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>so as to constitute constructive discharge and because Kelman was not Bellanger\u2019s employer. AMC contends it was not responsible for the actions of Kelman.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b613 Section 39-2-903(1), MCA, defines constructive discharge as \u201cthe voluntary termination of employment by an employee because of a situation created by an act or omission of the employer which an objective, reasonable person would find so intolerable that voluntary termination is the only reasonable alternative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b614  This Court has recognized that whether a constructive discharge has occurred is usually a question of fact determined by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Snell v. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 56, 65, 643 P.2d 841, 846; <em>Niles v. Big Sky Eyewear </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 455, 461, 771 P.2d 114, 118; <em>Kestell v. Heritage Health Care Corp. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 518, 524, 858 P.2d 3, 11; <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Coop. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 477, 484, 898 P.2d 690, 694. Summary judgment should not be awarded when a factual controversy exists; whether an employer\u2019s actions are wrongful and caused a plaintiffs resignation is generally \u201cfor the trier of fact to decide.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>271 Mont, at 484, 898 P.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b6 15  Bellanger recites numerous instances of Kelman\u2019s intimidating and threatening behavior, not just one instance as AMC claims. Thus, there is conflicting evidence regarding the intolerableness of Bellanger\u2019s working environment, and it is the function of a jury, not the court, to weigh such evidence. Bellanger presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact as to whether a reasonable person in her shoes would feel forced to resign due to intolerable working conditions. Questions of fact may not be adjudicated on motions for summary judgment. The District Court should have allowed a jury to decide if Bellanger was constructively discharged. Thus, the District Court erred when it granted AMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We remand with instructions to hold a trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err when it granted summary judgment in favor of Kelman, holding that Kelman was an agent of AMC acting within the scope of his agency, and therefore could not be sued for tortious interference with the business relationship between AMC and Bellanger?</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b617 Kelman claims he is privileged from Bellanger\u2019s suit, pursuant to <em>Phillips v. Montana Educ. Assn. </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 419, 610 P.2d 154 and <em>Lachenmaier v. First Bank Sys., Inc. </em>(1990), 246 Mont. 26, 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>P.2d 614, because he is an agent of AMC and because he acted in good faith and in AMC\u2019s best interest when he interacted with Bellanger. Kelman asserts Bellanger admitted he acted in good faith and that she failed to rebut his affidavit supporting his agent status.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b618 Bellanger argues Kelman is not an ostensible agent of AMC because there was no act by AMC to lead anyone to believe Kelman was its agent. In fact, Bellanger asserts, AMC has actually denied Kelman\u2019s status as an agent. Bellanger further claims that Kelman\u2019s argument that he acted in good faith is raised for the first time on appeal. Bellanger contends there was a typographical error in the District Court pleadings which resulted in Bellanger\u2019s mistaken admission of Kelman\u2019s good faith. Bellanger disputes Kelman\u2019s claim he acted in the best interests of AMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b619 The threshold question is whether Kelman was an agent of AMC. Section 28-10-103, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">An agency is either actual or ostensible. An agency is actual when the agent is really employed by the principal. An agency is ostensible when the <em>principal </em>intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be his agent who is not really employed by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b620  First, it is undisputed that Kelman is not employed by AMC. Thus, under the statute there can be no actual agency relationship. As to ostensible agency, such does not exist unless there is an act of the principal which leads a third party to believe an agency exists; it must be the principal, not the agent, who intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be his agent. <em>Sunset Point Pshp. v. Stuc-O-Flex Intl., </em>1998 MT 42, \u00b6 22, 287 Mont. 388, \u00b6 22, 954 P.2d 1156, \u00b6 22; <em>Elkins v. Husky Oil Co. </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 159, 168, 455 P.2d 329, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">\u00b621 There was no evidence offered that AMC, the principal, did anything to lead Bellanger to believe Kelman was its agent. In fact, it is undisputed that AMC made it clear to Bellanger that Kelman had no managerial responsibility over her. Because Kelman is not the principal, his unsupported declaration of agency cannot, under the above statute and case law, magically transform him into AMC\u2019s agent. Given these undisputed facts, Kelman failed to carry his burden of establishing that he was an agent of AMC, and the District Court therefore erred in determining he was AMC\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\u00b622  Absent an agency relationship between him and AMC, Kelman\u2019s claimed privilege from suit for tortious interference based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>agency does not apply. Thus, we do not need to discuss the parties\u2019 further arguments regarding this issue. We remand with instructions to hold a trial on the issue of whether Kelman tortiously interfered with the business relationship between AMC and Bellanger.</p>\n<p id=\"AOO\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b623 We reverse the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Defendant AMC and Defendant Kelman and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b251-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b624 I concur with the Court in reversing, under Issue 1, the summary judgment which was entered in favor of AMC, but would affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Defendant Kelman under Issue 2 and, therefore, dissent to that portion of the Court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\u00b625 An agency is ostensible \u201cwhen the principal intentionally <em>or by want of ordinary care </em>causes a third person to believe another to be his agent ....\u201d Section 28-10-103, MCA (emphasis added). The Court concludes that there \u201cwas no evidence offered that AMC, the principal, did anything to lead Bellanger to believe Kelman was its [ostensible] agent.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 21.1 respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\u00b626 First, the District Court identified evidence offered by Kelman from which it could reasonably be inferred that AMC caused, by its omission or by want of ordinary care, Bellanger to believe that Kelman was its agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">Defendant Kelman asserts that, at all time [sic] pertinent, he was acting as an agent of Defendant AMC with respect to AMC\u2019s dealings with Plaintiff [Bellanger]. In his affidavit, Defendant Kelman asserts that he has served as a consultant to AMC since his retirement from AMC. Kelman also asserts that as part of his consulting with AMC, he \u201cobserves the company\u2019s workforce and work [sic] with employees in an attempt to improve their work and AMC\u2019s performance.\u201d... Kelman\u2019s assertion and these undisputed supporting facts indicate that Kelman was at least an actual or ostensible agent of AMC with certain management and supervisory responsibilities and authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">Although Plaintiff avers that Kelman is not an agent of AMC, the Plaintiff has not supported this naked assertion with any supporting affidavits or deposition testimony. To the contrary, Plaintiffs deposition testimony actually supports and is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>with Kelman\u2019s assertion that he was actually an agent of AMC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0z\">\u00b627 Secondly, and more significantly, there was evidence of arguably <em>intentional </em>actions by AMC which would have caused Bellanger\u2019s belief in Kelman\u2019s agency. Abby Portney, AMC\u2019s manager, made various statements to Bellanger about Kelman\u2019s role with the company. For instance, following Kelman\u2019s statement to Bellanger that he had just hired a new employee for AMC, Portney confirmed Kelman\u2019s actions with Bellanger. Further, Portney told Bellanger that AMC would get in trouble if anyone found out that Kelman was actually participating in the management of the business and told Bellanger not to tell anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b628 Thus, Bellanger conducted herself on the belief that Kelman was AMC\u2019s agent. Consistent with her understanding that Kelman had authority over her-that is, that Kelman had the authority to fire her; that she was required to take direction from Kelman, including calling him about AMC business when he was on vacation; and that Kelman was involved in AMC\u2019s major decisions and that he was \u201crunning the company\u201d with Portney- Bellanger reported Kelman\u2019s abusive behavior to both Portney and AMC\u2019s attorney. There would have been no need or purpose for Bellanger to report Kelman to Portney and AMC\u2019s attorney if she did not believe Kelman was acting on behalf of the company. Further, AMC\u2019s attorney responded to Bellanger by informing her that she should not be treated that way and that he would talk to Kelman about it-further evidence that AMC <em>intentionally </em>caused Bellanger to believe that Kelman was its agent. If Kelman was not AMC\u2019s agent, why would its attorney indicate any responsibility for Kelman\u2019s conduct?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b629 All of this evidence, not contradicted by Bellanger, along with the evidence that AMC knowingly permitted Kelman to be on the premises and to supervise Bellanger\u2019s work, sometimes abusively, was sufficient for the District Court to conclude that, under the statute, AMC had \u201cintentionally or by want of ordinary care\u201d caused Bellanger to believe that Kelman was AMC\u2019s agent. I believe the evidence reveals that AMC\u2019s \u201cwant of ordinary care\u201d with regard to Kelman\u2019s actions was rampant, and the District Court correctly concluded that Kelman\u2019s agency was communicated thereby to Bellanger. Bellanger offered nothing to refute this evidence. Indeed, her observations and understanding about Kelman\u2019s authority only bolstered Kelman\u2019s agency claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b630 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Kelman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
