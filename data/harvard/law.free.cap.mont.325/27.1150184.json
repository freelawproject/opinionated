Burkhart appeals his conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court correctly denied Burkhart\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds the State\u2019s accomplice testimony was uncorroborated?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court correctly denied Burkhart\u2019s motion to dismiss and deprived him of due process on the grounds the predicate offense for felony-murder was an assault with a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it removed a prospective juror for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court improperly considered Burkhart\u2019s refusal to admit guilt or express remorse at his sentencing hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b53-16\">\u00b67 On November 13,2001, the body of William Ledeau (Ledeau) was found at 12th Street and 1 Alley North in Great Falls, Cascade County. He had been struck in the head four times with a blunt object. The State initially charged Burkhart on December 10, 2001, with deliberate homicide by accountability. The State later amended the information on September 4, 2002, to include deliberate homicide, felony-murder, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102( l)(b), MCA. Burkhart was found guilty as charged by a jury on September 19, 2002, and sentenced to life imprisonment on October 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-17\">\u00b68 Prior to trial, the State moved to dismiss one juror for cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>during <em>voir dire </em>because of the opinion he expressed concerning a reluctance to follow laws he found disagreeable. The prosecuting attorney brought up the example of seat belt laws and asked the following question of the prospective juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">MR. PARKER: [A]s you know, we have a law in Montana that requires people to wear seat belts. Let\u2019s pretend that you\u2019re here today as a juror in a seat belt trial. And let\u2019s also pretend that you personally don\u2019t like to wear a seat belt and that you personally don\u2019t agree with that law that requires people to wear seat belts. If a judge were to instruct you that that is the law and if the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense were committed, would you be able to follow the law in that situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: I would have a hard time agreeing with that. Because all laws are supposed to be based on the Constitution, and I do not see where you can force people to wear a seat belt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">MR. PARKER: Okay. Well, that\u2019s an important point. Not everyone will always agree with a different law. But you do understand, Mr. O\u2019Leary, if you were chosen as a juror, that you\u2019re actually not allowed to decide whether or not you agree with the law, that your own role would be to evaluate the facts and decide whether the offense happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: I might have a problem with that. If like, say, it was a blatant violation of the Bill of Rights or something, like some of the gun laws we have, you know, it says-in the Constitution it says that the right shall not be infringed upon. Yet there is (sic) all kinds of laws about guns right now that I think are unconstitutional and should be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">MR. PARKER: So you\u2019re saying, in other words, that it might be difficult for you in a certain kind of a case to follow the law as the judge gives it to you if you didn\u2019t agree with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Yeah, it would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">After the prosecutor challenged O\u2019Leary for cause, the District Court allowed Burkhart\u2019s attorney, Vincent van der Hagen, to question him. Their exchange proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">MR. van der HAGEN: [I]s it any law that you would have a problem with or is it just specific laws that you would have a problem with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Just laws that would be, you know-no, just a few laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">MR. van der HAGEN: Just a few laws. What are those laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>MR. O\u2019LEARY: Like I was saying, gun laws, I think a lot of them are unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">MR. van der HAGEN: Gun laws. What about the gun laws do you have a problem (sic)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Just the restriction that are placed on them. When it says that shall not be infringed upon, and yet there is-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">MR. van der HAGEN: Are you talking about a person\u2019s right to possess a gun; is that what you\u2019re talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">MR. van der HAGEN: Would you have a problem if an individual had used a gun to shoot someone, would you have a problem with-under the law, if you believed that the law says if this person did this, and he did it using a gun and he is guilty, guilty of the crime, would you let that person off the-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXn\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">MR. van der HAGEN: Find him not guilty because of the gun laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">MR. van der HAGEN: What other laws do you have a problem with, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Just some of the search and seizure laws like that-you know, people involved in drugs, you know, like I\u2019ve heard of cases where people have marijuana on them or something, and they seize their whole car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">MR. van der HAGEN: Drug forfeiture laws. Do I understand you correctly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Right. Some of those. Unless, you know, I mean-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">MR. van der HAGEN: Why do you have a problem with those kind of laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">MR. O\u2019LEARY: Because it goes against what I believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">Following further exchanges, the District Court stated: \u201cWell, he has said he wouldn\u2019t follow the law if he didn\u2019t agree with it. And I think that\u2019s grounds for disqualification.\u201d The District Court then excused O\u2019Leary and a jury was eventually impaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">\u00b69 The trial began on September 9, 2002. The State\u2019s evidence at trial showed the following: In search of the individuals behind an attempted break-in of his car, Burkhart and his friend, Michael Staley (Staley), encountered Ledeau in the alley between 1 Alley North and 12th Street. Ledeau had been walking home from his aunt\u2019s house. Burkhart and Staley confronted Ledeau, accusing him of breaking into Burkhart\u2019s car earlier that evening. When Ledeau denied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>involvement in the break-in and took offense at being accused, Burkhart hit Ledeau in the head once with a ball-peen hammer. After the initial blow, Ledeau attempted to flee but was eventually caught and hit three more times in the back and top of the head by Burkhart. Burkhart and Staley then returned to Staley\u2019s house and called police to report the break-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b6 10 Officer J amie Pinski of the Great Falls Police Department initially arrived at the crime scene and stated she was approached by Burkhart and Staley. According to Pinski, Burkhart and Staley told her Burkhart\u2019s vehicle had been broken into and they had seen a male run northbound across Central Avenue down 12th Street North. They also saw a second male run after the first male and, intending to confront the suspected thieves, gave chase after the two men. In pursuit, Burkhart and Staley said they ran through the parking lot to the east-side of \u201cAll Seasons Spas\u201d and cut off one of the males in 1 Alley North. Burkhart and Staley told Pinski they caught and confronted one of the males.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b611 Staley indicated the male flipped his hat off and stated, \u201cCome on mother-fuckers, let\u2019s go\u201d and began challenging them to a fight. Pinski reported she pointed out a baseball cap lying near Ledeau and asked them if it appeared to be the same cap the male suspect was wearing. Pinski indicated both Burkhart and Staley agreed that it was the suspect\u2019s hat. Ledeau\u2019s aunt, Joanne Dubois, testified at trial Ledeau was wearing the baseball hat when he left her home that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">\u00b612 Burkhart and Staley were further interviewed that evening by police. Detectives learned from Burkhart he had broken parole that day, traveling from Bigfork to Great Falls to visit Staley, another parolee, and buy some methamphetamine. Burkhart stated he was getting ready to drive back to Bigfork when they both walked out to his car and discovered someone had stolen some change, cigarettes, and a jacket from inside the automobile. Additionally, someone had attempted to pry open the trunk of his car in order to gain access to the speakers in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b613 Both men told officers they had confronted an Indian man in the alley but had walked away when the individual became angry and confrontational. They described the male as Native American, in his twenties, about 5' 10\" with a stocky build, skinny mustache, some hair on his chin and a \u201cskater hair cut.\u201d Burkhart indicated the male was wearing a dark shirt, dark pants and a blue baseball cap. This description matched Ledeau when officers found him that evening. Burkhart and Staley also claimed to have seen other suspicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>individuals in the area that evening. Although Burkhart maintained he and Staley had left the confrontation when the male became angry, he later told detectives he chased the male to within 50 feet of where Ledeau\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b614 As part of their investigation, detectives also interviewed Staley\u2019s roommate, Rochelle Smith-Sterner. Smith-Sterner recalled on November 12,2001, observing Burkhart and Staley leave her residence to execute a methamphetamine purchase. A short time later, she remembered hearing Burkhart yelling that someone had broken into his car, specifically \u201cI am going to kill the fucker that broke into [my] car.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Smith-Sterner observed Burkhart and Staley running after two individuals in the area of Central Ave and 12th Street. Smith-Sterner\u2019s residence is across the street from the alley where Ledeau was found. Smith-Sterner indicated that as Burkhart and Staley caught and confronted the second male on Central Avenue, she \u201cknew right then and there that someone was going to get their ass kicked.\u201d Smith-Sterner described the person encountered as a male about twenty-years old, about 5' 8\" in height with a somewhat heavy build and a dark-complexion of Spanish or Native American heritage. Smith-Sterner also indicated the male was wearing a baseball cap. Smith-Sterner went on to state her attention was diverted by her two small children running in the street. It took approximately five to ten minutes to return her kids to the house by which time she was unable to see what had transpired between Burkhart, Staley and the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b6 15 Although police interviewed a number of other suspects, Burkhart and Staley remained the primary focus of their investigation. Although both men proclaimed their innocence and claimed the man in the alley they confronted was not Ledeau, officers suspected collusion when Staley and Burkhart separately assisted police sketch-artists in producing a composite sketch of the man they confronted in the alley. The sketches resembled Ledeau. When Staley was confronted with this fact, he became emotional and terminated the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b616 Fearing incarceration for accountability to deliberate homicide, Staley eventually admitted he had witnessed Burkhart assault Ledeau. At trial, Staley testified Burkhart, upon confronting Ledeau, had struck Ledeau in the right cheek with a ball-peen hammer which had been lying on the car\u2019s passenger-side fender. After Ledeau stumbled backwards, he regained composure and ran down the alley. Burkhart gave chase, eventually seizing Ledeau and leveling several blows to the top and side of Ledeau\u2019s head. Staley then testified he and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Burkhart agreed to tell friends and police they had seen someone in the alley that night but had left the encounter. Staley then told Burkhart to get rid of the ball-peen hammer because it might have fingerprints. Great Falls Police later recovered the ball-peen hammer from a local resident who found it near where Ledeau had died. The ball-peen hammer in evidence carried neither fingerprints nor bloodstains.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b617 Dr. Gary Dale, the State Medical Examiner, performed Ledeau\u2019s autopsy on November 14, 2001, and determined the cause of death to be blunt-force trauma to the head. Dr. Dale found Ledeau had been struck at least four times in the head by an unknown object. One of the wounds had penetrated Ledeau\u2019s skull, leaving an approximate one and one quarter inch circular hole in his head. The blow tore the brain directly beneath another laceration and also bruised the brain-stem, a wound itself sufficient to kill Ledeau. There were two other tears on the back of his head consistent with a blunt instrument which penetrated the muscle at the back of the neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b618 Dr. Dale also retained the two fractured portions of Ledeau\u2019s skull and used them at trial to show how the ball-peen hammer fit into the depressions. Although police had gathered other hammers through their investigation, only the ball-peen hammer found at the crime scene fit both of Ledeau\u2019s depressions precisely. The rounded bottom of one of the fractures was smooth, matching the ball-peen end, and other characteristics of the wound showed that a rounded surface the size of the ball-peen end caused the injuries. Dr. Dale concluded Ledeau was struck at least four times with an instrument, two blows on the side of his skull and two in the back, including one in the neck. Ledeau would not have been able to stumble consciously after receiving the most severe injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b619 Burkhart was found guilty by the jury on September 19,2002, for felony-murder pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA. On October 24, 2002, the District Court sentenced Burkhart to life in prison. Burkhart appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b620 Whether the District Court correctly denied Burkhart\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds the State\u2019s accomplice testimony was uncorroborated?</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b621 On appeal, Burkhart argues Staley\u2019s accomplice testimony must be corroborated by independent evidence connecting Burkhart with Ledeau\u2019s murder. Burkhart asserts the eyewitness testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>forensic evidence presented by the State failed to corroborate Staley\u2019s testimony, proving only suspicion and not justifying a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b622 In response, the State argues its corroborating evidence was sufficient to prove the circumstances of the crime\u2019s commission. The State maintains the forensic evidence matching Ledeau\u2019s wounds to the murder weapon and verified accounts of Burkhart\u2019s demeanor and activities adequately corroborate Staley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b623  The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a conclusion of law. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 165, \u00b6 10, 998 P.2d 544, \u00b6 10. The sufficiency of evidence to corroborate the testimony of an accomplice is a question of law which we review to determine whether it was correct. <em>State v. Fey, </em>2000 MT 211, \u00b6 5, 301 Mont. 28, \u00b6 5, 7 P.3d 358, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b624  A criminal defendant may not be found guilty of an offense based on the testimony of another person responsible or legally accountable for the same offense unless the other person\u2019s testimony is corroborated by other evidence which, in itself and without the aid of the other person\u2019s testimony, tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. Section 46-16-213, MCA. Corroborating evidence need not extend to every fact to which the accomplice testifies. <em>State v. Ungaretti </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 314, 318, 779 P.2d 923, 925. We have elaborated the test for sufficiency of evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">To be sufficient, corroborating evidence must show more than that a crime was in fact committed or the circumstances of its commission. It must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged. But corroborative evidence need not be sufficient, by itself, to support a defendant\u2019s conviction or even to make out a prima facie case against him. Corroborating evidence may be <em>circumstantial </em>and can come from the defendant or his witnesses. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\"><em>State v. Kemp </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 383, 387, 597 P.2d 96, 99. Corroborating evidence is not insufficient just because it is circumstantial, disputed or even possibly consistent with innocent conduct; it is up to the jury to resolve such factual questions. <em>State v. Kaczmarek </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 456, 460, 795 P.2d 439, 441 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b625  We conclude the District Court correctly determined the accomplice testimony was corroborated by sufficient independent circumstantial evidence submitted to the jury. Setting aside the testimony of Staley entirely, the jury in the present case heard eye<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>witness testimony Burkhart pursued two men towards the place where, and the time when, Ledeau was walking home. The jury also heard Burkhart was extremely angry, exclaiming, \u201cI am going to kill the fucker that broke into [my] car.\u201d Smith-Sterner testified Burkhart confronted someone resembling Ledeau in the alley. Jurors also heard evidence that an altercation probably ensued in the alley. Burkhart subsequently told police he chased after someone resembling Ledeau. Police found Ledeau\u2019s body several feet away from the initial confrontation spot with at least four severe blows to the head. In particular, two skull wounds that produced a depression were matched with the ball-peen hammer found in proximity to Ledeau\u2019s body. Further, the shape and the size of the fractures in Ledeau\u2019s skull were a signature of the instrument and account for the multiple fractures. The District Court correctly concluded Staley\u2019s accomplice testimony was corroborated by sufficient independent evidence submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b626 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b627 Whether the District Court correctly denied Burkhart\u2019s motion to dismiss and deprived him of due process on the grounds the predicate offense for felony-murder was an assault with a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b628 First, Burkhart argues the State abridged his due process rights because the predicate offense underlying his felony-murder charge was not independent of the homicide. Burkhart\u2019s contention is the principle of merger prevents charging him with felony-murder when the predicate offense, felonious assault with a weapon, is an integral part of the homicide. In other words, Burkhart asserts where the only felony committed was the assault upon the victim which resulted in the victim\u2019s death, the assault should merge with the killing and cannot be relied upon by the State as an ingredient of a felony-murder. Burkhart also argues the charge of felony-murder under the facts of this case precludes him from raising certain defenses and lesser included offenses available under the deliberate homicide statute and thereby denies him due process of law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-103(2), MCA, and \u00a7 45-5-104(2), MCA. Thus, Burkhart maintains the felony-murder rule punishes all homicides, committed in the course of proscribed felonies whether intentional, unintentional or accidental, without the necessity of proving the relation between the homicide and the perpetrator\u2019s state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00b629 The State counters the felony-murder statute found in \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA, as written and intended by the Montana Legislature, does not require merger. The State also maintains Burkhart was properly convicted under the felony-murder statute because he knowingly and purposely caused bodily injury to Ledeau with a hammer which resulted in Ledeau\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b630 Second, Burkhart asserts his due process rights were abridged because the State was relieved from having to prove a specific mental state for homicide. Burkhart maintains the felony-murder charge eliminates the State\u2019s burden of proving he purposely or knowingly caused the death of Ledeau. Thus, Burkhart argues the felony-murder charge allows the State to \u201cbootstrap\u201d a homicide charge on the basis of a felonious assault, circumventing the mental state requirements of the deliberate homicide statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b631 The State counters Burkhart\u2019s conduct created a dangerous circumstance and thus, the mental state to commit the felony was properly supplied for all consequences, including the homicide. The State asserts there is little difference between proving Burkhart purposely and knowingly struck Ledeau with a ball-peen hammer, thus causing his injury and consequently death, and proving he purposely or knowingly caused Ledeau\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b632 The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which is reviewed <em>de novo. State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 24, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 24. This Court\u2019s standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. <em>State v. Beanblossom, </em>2002 MT 351, \u00b6 9, 313 Mont. 394, \u00b6 9, 61 P.3d 165, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b633 The felony-murder doctrine comes to us through the common law making one who causes another\u2019s death during a felony responsible for murder. The first formal statement of the doctrine is often said to be in <em>Mansell &amp; Herbert\u2019s Case. (See </em>Note, <em>Felony Murder as a First Degree Offense: An Anachronism Retained, </em>66 Yale L.J. 427, 428 n.15 (1957)). Herbert and a group of more than forty followers had gone to Sir Richard Mansfield\u2019s house under pretense of lawful authority to seize goods by force. One of Herbert\u2019s servants threw a stone at a person in the gateway which instead hit and killed an unarmed woman coming out of Mansfield\u2019s house. The question at trial was whether the accused was guilty of murder or manslaughter. The court assumed that the throwing of the stone was not a careless act but rather the servant who threw the stone intended at least to hit, if not kill, some person on Mansfield\u2019s side. The court thus held that if one deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>performed an act of violence to third parties, and a person not intended dies, it was murder regardless of any mistake or misapplication. <em>Mansell &amp; Herbert\u2019s Case, </em>2 Dyer 128b; 73 Eng.Rep. 279 (KB, 1558). \u00b634 After its early enunciation, the felony-murder doctrine went unchallenged because at that time practically all felonies were punishable by death. Note, <em>Felony Murder as a First Degree Offense: An Anachronism Retained, </em>66 Yale L.J. 427, 428 n.15 (1957). It was, therefore, of no particular consequence whether the condemned was hanged for the initial felony or for the death accidentally resulting from the felony. Case law of the nineteenth century, however, reflects the efforts of the English courts to limit the doctrine by requiring the underlying felony involve violence or be the \u201cnatural and probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct ....\u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 14.5 at 446-47 (2d ed. 2003). In the twentieth century, the felony-murder doctrine was rarely invoked in England and in 1957, abolished. Opponents of the doctrine pointed out that in later years, numerous offenses which were once regarded as gross misdemeanors or misdemeanors had been made felonies by statutory enactment, many of which were <em>malum prohibitum </em>rather than <em>malum in se. </em>These changes, it was argued, made the felony-murder rule too harsh. Prevezer, <em>The English Homicide Act: A New Attempt to Revise the Law of Murder, </em>57 Colum.L.Rev. 624,635 (1957). \u00b635 While some states have recently abolished the felony-murder doctrine as passed down through the common law <em>(see </em>Hawaii Rev.Stat., \u00a7 707-701), others have expressly limited its provisions. In particular, some jurisdictions limit the underlying felony and its manner of commission to a high risk of causing death <em>(see e.g. Commonwealth v. Bowden </em>(Penn. 1973), 309 A.2d 714) while others require the defendant\u2019s conduct be the proximate or legal cause of the victim\u2019s death <em>(see e.g. State v. Mauldin </em>(Kan. 1974), 529 P.2d 124). Still others have circumscribed its application by requiring the underlying felony be independent of the homicide. <em>(See e.g. People v. Ireland </em>(Cal. 1969), 450 <em>P.2d 580). </em>Burkhart urges this Court to adopt the latter. We decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b636  Montana\u2019s felony-murder statute provides that a person who causes the death of another <em>during the course of an enumerated felony </em>is criminally responsible for the death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">(1) A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if:...,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">(b) the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of... assault with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>weapon ... or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Section 45-5-102(l)(a)-(b), MCA. This Court has held the purpose of the felony-murder rule is to ensure that people who engage in dangerous acts likely to result in death are held responsible for any resulting deaths, whether or not the acts were planned or premeditated. <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 438, 449, 734 P.2d 170, 176. The felony-murder rule creates an alternate means of holding one responsible for reckless actions likely to result in death. Thus, the only causal connection required \u201cis that the death actually occurred during the underlying felony or the flight thereafter.\u201d <em>State v. Cox </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 110, 119, 879 P.2d 662, 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b637 When interpreting statutes, the role of this Court \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Where the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required. <em>State v. Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court, </em>1998 MT 34, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 27, \u00b6 15, 955 P.2d 639, \u00b6 15. However, as Burkhart\u2019s attorney attempted to make clear at oral argument, the question confronting this Court is not whether the statute is unconstitutional on its face. Instead, Burkhart asks this Court to consider whether the statute, as applied to the facts of this case, unnecessarily deprives a defendant of the due process of law when he is convicted of felony-murder and the underlying felony is integral to the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b638  The facts of this case disclose Burkhart struck Ledeau once, chased after him, and stuck him several more times, causing his death. Montana\u2019s felony-murder statute specifically contemplates the facts at hand when, <em>\u201cin the course </em>of the forcible felony, any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being.\u201d Section \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA. Montana\u2019s statute does not require the death to be \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the threshold crime, only that the homicide occur in the course of the enumerated forcible felony. Further, we have held the only causal connection required \u201cis that the death actually occurred during the underlying felony or the flight thereafter.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>266 Mont. at 119, 879 P.2d at 668. Evidence at trial indicates Burkhart encountered Ledeau in the alley and physically confronted him. Burkhart then chased after Ledeau where he was eventually found dead. We conclude that Burkhart\u2019s underlying offense was assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>a weapon, a forcible felony, and an offense encompassed under Montana\u2019s felony-murder statute. Under the circumstances Burkhart\u2019s due process rights were not abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b639 Burkhart next maintains the felony-murder rule punishes all homicides, committed in the course of proscribed felonies whether intentional, unintentional or accidental, without the necessity of proving the relation between the homicide and the perpetrator\u2019s state of mind. Burkhart argues the charge of felony-murder under the facts of this case precludes him from raising certain defenses and lesser included offenses available under the deliberate homicide statute and thereby denies him due process of law. This Court has held, \u201c[A] trial court need not give an instruction on a lesser-included offense when there is no evidence to support it. A lesser-included offense instruction is not supported by evidence when the defendant\u2019s evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>State v. German, </em>2001 MT 156, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 92, \u00b6 11, 30 P.3d 360, \u00b6 11. The District Court in <em>German, </em>for example, refused the defendant an instruction on the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide because he consciously shot the victim. <em>German, </em>\u00b6 14. Evidence presented at trial here indicates Burkhart was angry about his car and exclaimed, \u201cI am going to kill the fucker that broke into [my] car.\u201d An instruction for mitigated deliberate homicide would have required evidence of extreme mental or emotional distress for which could be reasonably explained or excused. <em>State v. Brown, </em>2003 MT 166, \u00b6 20, 316 Mont. 310, \u00b6 20, 71 P.3d 1215, \u00b6 20. No evidence of this nature was presented or any other evidence to justify a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide. Although Burkhart gave notice of possible defenses of mistaken identity and justifiable use of force, there was no evidence to warrant such instructions be read to the jury. In the absence of such evidence, there is no due process right to a lesser-included offense instruction. <em>German, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b640 Burkhart also asserts his due process rights were abridged because the State was relieved from having to prove a specific mental state for homicide. Burkhart maintains the charge for felony-murder, with no predicate offense but the assault with a weapon, eliminates the state\u2019s burden of proving he purposely or knowingly caused Ledeau\u2019s death. Burkhart argues all homicide charges require a showing of the necessary mental state whether deliberate, mitigated or negligent while felony-murder only requires a showing of intent to do the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b641 Under the felony-murder rule, Burkhart\u2019s purpose and knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to commit felony-murder was presumed when he assaulted Ledeau with a hammer, causing Ledeau\u2019s death. This Court has held \u201c[w]hen a defendant commits a felony such as burglary, kidnapping or aggravated assault, he initiates conduct which creates a dangerous circumstance. Therefore the intent to commit the felony supplies the intent for all the consequences, including homicide, arising therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 438, 449, 734 P.2d 170, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b642  In enacting the felony-murder rule, the Legislature found the homicidal risk is greater when there is a commission of a felony and that the protection of the person from this increased risk warranted greater penalties. The Criminal Law Commission Comment, on which the Legislature relied in enacting \u00a7 94-5-102 R.C.M. 1947, now \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">Section 45-5-102, MCA, relates only to conduct which is done deliberately; that is, purposely or knowingly. The enumerated offenses in subsection (b) broaden the old law dealing with felony-murders ... to include any felony which involves force or violence against an individual. Since such offenses are usually coincident with an extremely high homicidal risk, a homicide which occurs during their commission can be considered deliberate homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abq\">Clearly, the Legislature properly allowed and broadened the law relating to the felony-murder rule. Indeed, it appears the Legislature specifically enumerated specific felonies which are to be included within the felony-murder category. Quoting from a treatise on the subject, this Court has noted, \u201cIt is not the purpose of the felony-murder rule to foist authorship of a homicide upon a felon; the purpose is merely to clothe the felon\u2019s act of killing with malice.\u201d <em>State v. Weinberger </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 110, 115, 671 P.2d 567, 569 (quoting 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law (14th ed.) 221, \u00a7 149). Thus, in construing the felony-murder statute, it is the mental state which is imputed to the felon for an assault incidental to the homicide, not the act of killing.</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">\u00b643 The dissent frames this Court\u2019s argument in the context of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S, 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39, which held if a state defines an element of a crime that must be proved by the prosecution, that burden cannot be shortcut by use of an evidentiary presumption. The dissent maintains the felony-murder rule creates a conclusive presumption of the defendant\u2019s murderous intent from his intent to commit the underlying felony and thereby retains intent as an element of the offense of felony murder. Diss. Op., \u00b6 74. We have maintained however, the state does not bear the burden to prove an intent to kill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>stating, \u201c[ijntent as such is not an element under the felony murder rule.\u201d <em>Sunday, </em>187 Mont. at 307, 609 P.2d 1197. Thus, <em>Sandstrom </em>is inapposite: we are not considering a conclusive presumption of <em>mens rea. </em>A jury has not been instructed to presume an element of the crime from some other facts, nor has the state been relieved of its burden to prove a statutory element. Rather, \u201cthe state may substitute proof of the mental state necessary to commit a homicide with proof of the mental state required to commit the underlying felony.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>225 Mont. at 450, 734 P.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b644  Further, even if the current statute is viewed as creating a presumption, the presumption at issue here is not analogous to that derided in <em>Sandstrom. </em>The quote from our holding in <em>Nichols, </em>which the dissent uses to validate its contention the felony-murder rule creates and retains a conclusive presumption of the defendant\u2019s murderous intent, actually strengthens our holding here. If the felony-murder rule creates a presumption, it does not operate to shift a burden from the state to the defendant, but rather \u201csubstitute[s] proof of the mental state necessary to commit a homicide with proof of the mental state required to commit the underlying felony.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>225 Mont. at 450, 734 P.2d at 177. The Legislature has determined a killing committed during a felony is deliberate homicide, felony-murder, and we are not convinced the statute, were it to be challenged facially, <em>may be </em>unconstitutional simply because it creates criminal liability for deliberate homicide when the state has not shown the accused had the intent to kill. <em>See also State v. Reeves </em>(Neb. 1990), 453 N.W.2d 359 (felony murder requires only the intent to commit the underlying felony; once that intent is proved, it is imputed to the killing, and <em>Sandstrom </em>is inapplicable), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>498 U.S. 964, 111 S.Ct. 425, 112 L.Ed.2d 409 (1990); <em>People v. Benson </em>(NY 1984), 480 N.Y.S.2d 811 (intent is not an element of the crime of felony murder, and <em>Sandstrom </em>not implicated); <em>Commonwealth v. Rawls </em>(Penn. 1984), 477 A.2d 540 (equating of intent to kill with intent to commit a serious felony is permissible legislative decision reflecting the gravity of killing during a serious felony); <em>State v. Sheffield </em>(Tenn. 1984), 676 S.W.2d 542 (statute makes killing during a felony first degree murder and does not have the effect of shifting burden of proof to defendant). Thus, because the felony-murder rule does not in fact raise a presumption of the existence of an element of the crime, it does not violate the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b645 [8] The dissent also seeks to \u201cwork the sort of violence\u201d upon Montana\u2019s felony-murder statute so as to include in it a <em>mens rea </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>element. Diss. Op., \u00b6 11. In so doing, the dissent relies on <em>Morissette v. United States </em>(1952), 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288, and <em>United States v. United States Gypsum </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 422, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854, for the proposition that a culpable mental element provides a rationale for punishment. Diss. Op., \u00b6 7. However, unlike the crimes of conversion or price fixing, which <em>Morissette </em>and <em>United States Gypsum </em>dealt with respectively, felony-murder does contain an element of intent, albeit not the intent to kill. The perpetrator must intend to engage in dangerous acts likely to result in death and is thus held responsible for any resulting deaths, whether or not the acts were planned or premeditated. <em>Nichols, </em>225 Mont. at 449, 734 P.2d at 176. Further, the state must carry its burden to prove that felony. As stated above, the Legislature properly allowed and broadened the law relating to the felony-murder rale. Indeed, it appears the Legislature expressly enumerated specific felonies which are to be included within the felony-murder category. The Legislature has decided that an individual who attempts to commit a felony and who takes a life during the commission of that felony has committed deliberate homicide, felony-murder. The statute provides notice to such an individual that, should he or she choose to participate in a serious felony, and should someone be killed, the felon will be subject to criminal liability for deliberate homicide. We do not believe this is constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b646 Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b647 Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it removed a prospective juror for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b648 Burkhart argues the State had a tactical advantage when the District Court erroneously removed a prospective juror for cause. Burkhart maintains the District Court\u2019s removal of the prospective juror effectively gave the State an additional peremptory challenge and requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\u00b649 The State counters the juror was properly removed for cause when he indicated a reluctance to follow laws he found disagreeable and therefore no reversible error occurred. The State asserts the prospective juror showed an unwillingness to follow seatbelt, gun and forfeiture laws were he to be impaneled, evidencing grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">\u00b650 This Court reviews the denial of a challenge to dismiss a juror for cause for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 11. We will not reverse a district court\u2019s decision regarding a juror\u2019s fitness to serve absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 40, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 40, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b651 The bases for challenging potential jurors for cause in Montana are set forth in \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. One specified basis is that a juror has a \u201cstate of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without substantial prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. If <em>voir dire </em>examination raises a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, dismissal for cause is favored. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b652 In <em>Freshment, </em>we held the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to dismiss two jurors for cause due to their consistent and direct statements of bias against the defendant\u2019s legal defense of a reasonable belief the victim was old enough to consent. Further, we determined a juror\u2019s retraction of clearly stated bias, whether coaxed by the court, the prosecution or the defense, could not erase actual prejudice against the substantial rights of the party. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 18. \u00b653 Based on the <em>voir dire </em>of O\u2019Leary, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the juror for cause. Although O\u2019Leary did not state a bias towards the exact nature of Burkhart\u2019s defense like <em>Freshment, </em>he stated a bias related to an issue critical to the outcome of the case: whether he could follow the law as given in light of the evidence. Although he later qualified his bias when pressed by Burkhart\u2019s attorney, O\u2019Leary stated he \u201cmight have a problem\u201d with being asked to evaluate the facts when he disagreed with the law. As we stated in <em>Freshment, </em>however, \u201c[c]oaxed recantations in which jurors state they will merely follow the law, whether prompted by the trial court, the prosecution, or the defense, do not cure or erase a clearly stated bias which demonstrates actual prejudice against the substantial rights of a party.\u201d <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 18. Further, O\u2019Leary showed a more general bias when he recited a series of laws that he found disagreeable. Specifically, O\u2019Leary said that he would not necessarily follow the law given him by the court, regardless of the subject matter of the particular instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b654  \u201cBecause of the right to an impartial jury, and the great expense and inconvenience that results from retrial, dismissal for cause is favored when a serious question arises about the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial.\u201d <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 11. Thus, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b655 Whether the District Court improperly considered Burkhart\u2019s refusal to admit guilt or express remorse at his sentencing hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b656 Burkhart maintains the District Court violated his constitutional right to remain silent when it ordered him to answer questions regarding his involvement in the homicide as well as any remorse harbored for his actions. Burkhart asserts the District Court violated <em>State v. Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, 313 Mont. 252, 60 P.3d 991, and based its sentencing on his refusal to admit guilt or show remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b657 The State responds the District Court\u2019s sentencing was properly based on recommendations by the prosecution and Burkhart\u2019s probation officer, Burkhart\u2019s criminal history and the brutality of the offense as well as the lack of remorse. The State maintains the record is devoid of any suggestion the District Court would have handed down a different sentence had Burkhart shown remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b658 We review the imposition of a sentence solely for legality, determining whether the sentence is within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6 12, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6 12. \u201c[A] sentencing court may consider any evidence relevant to a defendant\u2019s sentence, including evidence relating to the crime,\u201d the defendant\u2019s background, his character, his mental and physical condition and any other evidence the court views as having probative value. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b659 In <em>Shreves, </em>we determined the court considered the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse as a general factor in deciding the entire sentence. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13. Shreves testified at trial but invoked his right to remain silent at his sentencing hearing. Although Shreves maintained his innocence throughout the trial, the court sentenced him based in part on the fact Shreves showed no remorse, no accountability, and did not explain why the crime occurred. We determined the court \u201cbased its sentence in large part on Shreves\u2019 lack of remorse and [the court] analogized that lack of remorse to Shreves\u2019 silence.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20. We also noted \u201c[t]he court then based its sentence on Shreves\u2019 failure to \u2018give\u2019 the court something about why the crime happened.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20. We concluded that while \u201clack of remorse can be considered as a factor in sentencing [and its effects on a defendant\u2019s prospective rehabilitation], we cannot uphold a sentence that is based on a refusal to admit guilt.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20. We also held, however, a \u201ccourt can consider as a sentencing factor a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse as evidence by any admissible statement made by the defendant pre-trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>at trial, or post-trial... or gleaned, without more, from the manner of the commission of the offense as demonstrated by the evidence at trial or from other competent evidence properly admitted at the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b660 The record does not reflect that the court considered Burkhart\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing as lack of remorse. The record similarly does not reflect Burkhart\u2019s sentence was in large part based upon the fact he refused to take responsibility and admit his crime. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13. Instead, the record in this case reflects the District Court\u2019s careful consideration of many relevant factors in sentencing Burkhart. These factors include recommendations by the prosecution and Burkhart\u2019s probation officer, Burkhart\u2019s criminal history, the brutality of the offense and Burkhart\u2019s lack of remorse. The District Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Now the reason for this sentence is the brutality of the offense. The court is shocked by the way this young man died. In addition to that, this is the defendant\u2019s third felony conviction. In addition to that, this offense was committed while the defendant was on probation. In addition to that, this offense was in violation of the conditions of that probation, in that he had left his assigned area without permission, and that while in Great Falls, that he was attempting and possibly did buy methamphetamine .... Furthermore, the court finds the defendant completely and totally without remorse. The court does not have a shred of hope of rehabilitation of this young man .... In addition ... I\u2019m following the recommendation of the State of Montana through the county attorney\u2019s office and through the recommendation of Adult Probation and Parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b661 The record thus indicates the District Court did not violate our pronouncement in <em>Shreves </em>when it considered Burkhart\u2019s lack of remorse in the context of his ability to be rehabilitated, finding the former and not the latter. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20. Although Burkhart maintains the court bombarded him with questions regarding his convictions, chastised him for maintaining his innocence, and condemned him for failing to show remorse for the homicide, the record at sentencing instead shows the District Court\u2019s consideration of, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s background, his character, his mental and physical condition and any other evidence the court views as having probative value.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b662  We conclude the District Court did not sentence Burkhart more harshly because he failed to admit he committed the charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>offense. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b663 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b71-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Al\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b664 I concur in much that is said in Justice Leaphart\u2019s Dissent. I too am uneasy with the fact that application of the felony-murder doctrine can impermissibly raise a conclusive presumption of intent to murder from an act which, standing alone, could not supply such a motive. However, as the Court points out, we are faced in this case with an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge of the doctrine, so we must examine whether application of the doctrine has constitutional implications for Burkhart given the particulars of his crime. Because I conclude it does not, I am voting to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b665 The ferocity ofBurkhart\u2019s assaults on Ledeau that led to his death did, in my judgment, supply the intent for murder. This being so, we are not confronted with the situation where a presumption of guilt is imposed upon a set of facts which do not otherwise raise or establish a murderous intent. When and if such a case presents itself to this Court, an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge will likely resonate well with me. However, this is not such a case. I would therefore affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b71-9\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the concurrence of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b71-10\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AtZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b666 Because I believe that the felony-murder statute under which the Appellant was charged is fundamentally defective under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">\u00b667 Although the Court recites the history of the felony-murder rule,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with special reference to the various limitations which courts have imposed upon it in an effort to mitigate some of the more illogical and legally troubling results of its application,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the opinion does not, to my mind, properly confront the rationale behind the limitation which the Appellant cites. The merger doctrine precludes assaultive offenses from providing the basis for a charge of felony murder, when the victim of the assault is also the victim of the homicide-that is, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the assault is an ingredient of the homicide, or is included within it in fact, even (in the doctrine\u2019s most robust <em>form) </em>if not in law. <em>See </em>Robert L. Simpson, <em>Application of the Felony-Murder Doctrine Where the Felony Relied Upon is an Includible Offense with the Homicide, </em>40 A.L.R.4th 1341 (1971). In doing so, the doctrine seeks to prevent the worst results of the felony-murder rule\u2019s having dispensed with a <em>mens rea </em>element for the murder charge. As the Illinois Court of Appeals has explained, \u201cUnless application of the felony-murder rule is limited to cases in which a killing occurs during the commission of a felony consisting of conduct other than that inherent in the killing itself, all deliberate killings and all fatal shootings may be charged as felony murder.\u201d <em>People v. Morgan </em>(Ill.App. 1999), 718 N.E.2d 206, 211. All homicides could be charged as felony murders, because all homicides, by definition, include an initial assault upon the victim. Thus, \u201cthe felony that eliminates the quality of the intent must be one that is independent of the homicide and of the assault merged therein ....\u201d <em>People v. Moran </em>(N.Y. 1927), 158 N.E. 35, 36 (Cardozo, C.J.). <em>See also Ragland v. Hundley </em>(8th Cir. 1996), 79 F.3d 702, 705 n.4 (merger doctrine intended \u201cto avoid the prosecution\u2019s bootstrapping a simple homicide to a higher degree of murder without showing the requisite intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b668 The statute which embodies Montana\u2019s version of the felony-murder rule specifies both simple and aggravated assault as underlying offenses to felony murder. Section 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA. It is thus not subject to a construction that would incorporate the merger doctrine, for where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation. Moreover, this Court is required to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance found in the statute, neither inserting what has been omitted, nor omitting what has been inserted. <em>Hilands Golf Club v. Ashmore, </em>2002 MT 8, \u00b6 20, 308 Mont. 111, \u00b6 20, 39 P.3d 697, \u00b6 20. Nonetheless, the merger doctrine\u2019s focus upon <em>mens rea </em>provides the key to why our felony-murder statute violates the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b669 Section 45-5-102(1), MCA, does not facially require a <em>mens rea </em>element in order to charge murder based on the homicide. The statute reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if: (a) the person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being; or (b) the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of robbery... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b670 This Court has interpreted \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA, accordingly. In <em>State v. Sunday </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 292, 307, 609 P.2d 1188, 1197, we stated that \u201c[ijntent as such is not an element under the felony-murder rule.... Intent was no longer an issue under the felony-murder statute once it was shown by the evidence that\u201d the defendant committed the underlying felony. In <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 438, 449-50, 734 P.2d 170, 177, this substantive rule of law was presented as a rule of evidence: \u201cUnder the felony-homicide statute, the state has not been relieved of the burden of proving an element of a crime. Rather, the method of proving one of the elements has been changed. The state may substitute proof of the mental state necessary to commit a homicide with proof of the mental state required to commit the underlying felony.\u201d <em>See also Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 510, 517, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 2456, 61 L.Ed.2d 39, 46-47; <em>People v. Dillon </em>(Cal. 1983), 668 P.2d 697, 717-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b671 Section 45-5-102(1), MCA, thus defines a distinct offense with its own unique set of elements: an underlying felony and a death deriving from it, with no intent required for the homicide to be charged to the defendant as a murder. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7.5 at 622 n.2 (arguing that felony murder is a category separate from intent-to-kill murder). The homicide is the elevating factor for the purposes of both stigma and sanction, the <em>discrimen </em>between the underlying felony and felony murder. For example, the maximum punishment for simple assault under \u00a7 45-5-201(2), MCA, is a five-hundred-dollar fine and six months of incarceration in the county jail; aggravated assault is punished under \u00a7 45-5-202(2), MCA, by at most a fine of fifty thousand dollars and twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. When either felony is coupled with a death under \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA, however, the maximum potential penalty is increased to life imprisonment, and the convict is termed a murderer, without the intent element for murder having been proven by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b672 This plainly violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as that provision has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Morissette v. United States </em>(1952), 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288, and <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co. </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 422, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854. In <em>Morissette, </em>the Court required that a statute which criminalized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>theft of federal property be read to include the <em>mens rea </em>element of intent. In a famous passage, Justice Jackson wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil. A relation between some mental element and punishment for a harmful act is almost as instinctive as the child\u2019s familiar exculpatory \u201cBut I didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d and has afforded the rational basis for a tardy and unfinished substitution of deterrence and reformation in place of retaliation and vengeance as the motivation for public prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 250-51, 72 S.Ct. at 243, 96 L.Ed. at 293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">\u00b673 In <em>United States Gypsum, </em>furthermore, the Court held that intent is a necessary element in a prosecution for a non-regulatory offense. <em>United States Gypsum, </em>438 U.S. at 436-38, 98 S.Ct. at 2873-74, 57 L.Ed.2d at 869-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b674 Alternatively, certain language in the Court\u2019s opinion, and in <em>Nichols, </em>seems to frame the felony-murder rule as a conclusive presumption of the defendant\u2019s murderous intent from his intent to commit the underlying felony, retaining intent as an element of the offense of felony murder. The Court writes: \u201cUnder the felony-murder rule, Burkhart\u2019s purpose and knowledge to commit felony murder was presumed when he assaulted Ledeau with a hammer, causing LeDeau\u2019s death.\u201d Maj. op., \u00b6 41. The Court goes on to quote <em>Nichols </em>for the proposition that intent to commit the underlying felony somehow \u201csupplies the intent\u201d for murder. Maj. op., \u00b6 41 (citing <em>Nichols, </em>225 Mont. at 449, 734 P.2d at 176). If we are to take these statements at face value, the felony-murder doctrine is unconstitutional under <em>Sandstrom, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court held that a conclusive presumption of guilt as to any element of an offense violates the Due Process guarantee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">[Tjhe trial court may not withdraw or prejudge the issue by instruction that the law raises a presumption of intent from an act. ... A conclusive presumption which testimony could not overthrow would effectively eliminate intent as an ingredient of the offense. ... A presumption which would permit the jury to make an assumption which all the evidence considered together does not logically establish would give to a proven fact an artificial and fictional effect. In either case, this presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>would conflict with the overriding presumption of innocence with which the law endows the accused and which extends to every element of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><em>Sandstrom, </em>442 U.S. at 522, 99 S.Ct. at 2458, 61 L.Ed.2d at 49-50 (quoting the holding of <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 274-75, 72 S.Ct. at 255-56, 96 L.Ed. at 306-07); <em>see also Dillon, </em>668 P.2d at 716-17 (\u201c[w]e start with the indisputable fact that if the effect of the felony-murder rule on malice is indeed a \u2018presumption,\u2019 it is a \u2018conclusive\u2019 one\u201d); <em>State v. Ortega </em>(N.M. 1991), 817 P.2d 1196, 1204 (by interpreting felony-murder rule to presume murderous intent from intent to commit underlying felony, \u201cone runs headlong into <em>Sandstrom\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b675 When this Court reviews the constitutionality of a legislative enactment, we will presume the statute to be constitutional and will uphold the statute on review except when it is proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Folda </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 523, 525-26, 885 P.2d 426, 427. We will, moreover, seek to construe the statute in such a way as to find it constitutional, if possible. <em>State v. Martel </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 143, 148, 902 P.2d 14, 17. In the present context, it seems clear to me that the only way in which to save \u00a7 45-5-102(1), MCA, is to construe it to include a <em>mens rea </em>element. This was the approach taken by the New Mexico Supreme Court in <em>Ortega. See also Robbins v. State </em>(1854), 8 Ohio St. 131 (held, that in a statute providing that if any person shall \u201cpurposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, or in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate, any rape, arson, robbery, or burglary ... kill another\u201d such person should be deemed guilty of murder in the first degree, the word \u201cpurposely\u201d modified each of the following clauses).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b676 Unfortunately, I believe that the statute forecloses such an approach. The Ohio statute which that state\u2019s Supreme Court subjected to interpretation was of far looser and more ambiguous structure than is our own. Section 45-5-102(1), MCA, by contrast, unambiguously provides that a defendant may be found guilty of murder upon proof only of his having committed a felony and having caused a death thereby. Section 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (\u201cthe person purposely or knowingly causes the death of another human being; <em>or . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added)). Out of deference to our coequal branch of government, therefore, I will not attempt to work the sort of violence upon the statute at issue that the necessary interpretation would require.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b677 The felony-murder rule is based on the ancient idea that the defendant is an evil person who has committed a bad act, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>therefore should be held maximally responsible for all the consequences that flow therefrom, whether he intended them in any sense, or not. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>560 (1972). The law once deemed this an adequate arrangement, that a defendant could be punished criminally for results which he may have in no wise intended, and this indifference to the actual culpability of the individual is amply evidenced in the felony-murder rule\u2019s failure to prescribe a <em>mens rea </em>element for a finding of murder-guilt. The law, however, has long since progressed beyond this point, a development reflected in the Due Process jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b678 Make no mistake: I have no sympathy whatsoever for the Appellant. His actions, besides being horrific in themselves, clearly caused the death of another human being, and he should be held accountable to the full extent of the law. But a charge of deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, would have been more appropriate and far less constitutionally troubling. No intensity of personal sentiment, however valid and well-intentioned, can strip this defendant, or any other, of the guarantee of Due Process of law. The remarkable procedure for circumventing the principles of <em>Sandstrom, </em>set forth in <em>Nichols </em>and subscribed to today by the Court, is nothing more than a parlor trick, unworthy of this honorable Court and of our system of justice. The principles enshrined in the Due Process Clause call for the repudiation of the felony-murder rule, and an affirmation of the idea of punishment for individual culpability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-13\"> <em>See also People v.
