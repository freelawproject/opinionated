Lloyd E. Rule appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in granting BNSF\u2019s motion to change venue pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-122(2) and -201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b63 Rule filed this action in Cascade County District Court, seeking damages from BNSF for personal injury arising out of his railroad employment in Dawson County, where he resides. After Rule served BNSF through its registered agent in Yellowstone County, BNSF timely moved to change venue from Cascade County to either Yellowstone County or Dawson County, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-122(2) and -201(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">\u00b64 Relying on the referenced statutes, the District Court granted BNSF\u2019s motion to change venue and ordered the case transferred to either Dawson or Yellowstone County, at Rule\u2019s option. Rule appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">\u00b65 Proper venue is a question of law involving the application of venue statutes to pleaded facts. Our review of a district court\u2019s venue ruling is plenary; we simply determine whether the district court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>Sprinkle v. Burton </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 358, 361, 935 P.2d 1094, 1096 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">\u00b66 Similarly, we review a conclusion that a statute is constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>for correctness. <em>See Powell v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 518, \u00b6 13, 15 P.3d 877, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). The constitutionality of a legislative enactment is presumed, and the party challenging a statute bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in granting BNSF\u2019s motion to change venue pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-122(2) and -201(1), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b68 Venue issues relate to determining the proper place for trial of a legal action. The venue statutes at issue in the present case are \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, and \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA. Subsections (a), (b) and (c), respectively, of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, provide that the proper place of trial for a tort action against a corporation incorporated in a state other than Montana is the county in which the tort was committed, the county in which the plaintiff resides or the county in which the corporation\u2019s resident agent is located. Section 25-2-201(1), MCA, provides that, upon motion and when the county designated in the complaint is not the proper county, a district court must change the place of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b69 In granting BNSF\u2019s motion, the District Court determined that venue was proper in either Dawson County or Yellowstone County. The apparent basis for that determination is that the alleged tort was committed-and Rule resided-in Dawson County, and BNSF\u2019s resident agent is located in Yellowstone County. The District Court implicitly concluded that, because Cascade County was not a proper venue under the plain meaning of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA, required it to change the place of trial to a proper county.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">\u00b610 Rule sets forth three arguments in support of his overall contention that the District Court erred in applying the terms of Montana\u2019s general tort venue statutes to his FELA action: (1) that the Legislature did not intend \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, to apply to FELA cases; (2) that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, cannot coexist with the liberal forum selection policy under FELA; and (3) that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, is unconstitutional because it constitutes an arbitrary and capricious limitation on FELA venue practice in Montana. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b611 Rule contends the Montana Legislature did not intend \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, to apply to FELA cases. In this regard, he relies on Senator Bruce Crippen\u2019s comments during legislative hearings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>1995 and the 1997 amendments to \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA. Specifically, he cites Crippen\u2019s remarks in response to criticism of the bill by railroad worker and union opponents. Crippen stated that \u201cthe provisions of this bill would not restrict their [FELA claimants\u2019] options at all\u201d and \u201c[t]his has nothing to do with FELA. They can still file under the federal forum if they choose.\u201d <em>See </em>Hearing on Senate Bill 63 before the House Judiciary Committee, 1995 Montana Legislature, March 10, 1995, p. 2; Hearing on Senate Bill 314 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, 1997 Montana Legislature, February 13, 1997, p. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b612 Senator Crippen\u2019s comments at the referenced hearings appear to address the rights of FELA plaintiffs to sue in federal court. In any event, Senator Crippen\u2019s remarks do not necessarily reflect the law. When a statute is plain and unambiguous on its face, we do not employ other means of interpretation in determining legislative intent. <em>See Connery v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 115, 119, 929 P.2d 222, 225 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b613 Pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-122(1), MCA, the general rule is that the proper place of trial for a tort action is the county in which the defendant resides or the tort was committed. Section 25-2-122(2), MCA, provides that the proper place of trial for a tort action in which the defendant is a corporation incorporated in a state other than Montana is the county in which the tort was committed, the county in which the plaintiff resides or the county in which the corporation\u2019s resident agent is located. Section 25-2-122(3), MCA, provides that if the defendant is a resident of a state other than Montana, the proper place of trial for a tort action is the county in which the tort was committed or the plaintiff resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b614 A FELA action is a negligence action against a common carrier by railroad under federal law. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51. Negligence is a type of tort. Section 25-2-122(1), MCA, plainly states that-except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) \u2014 it applies to tort actions, and subsection (2) applies to tort actions against defendant corporations incorporated in a state other than Montana. BNSF is a defendant out-of-state corporation. The Legislature did not create an exception from the provisions of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, for FELA claims. Because \u00a7 25-2-122, MCA, does not expressly exclude FELA claims, we conclude the statute applies to FELA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b615 Next, Rule contends \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, cannot coexist with \u201cthe liberal forum selection policy under the FELA to which injured railroad workers are entitled under Montana law.\u201d He advances both federal and state cases in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>\u00b616 There can be no dispute that both federal law and courts, and this Court, are protective of broad venue rights for FELA plaintiffs. Pursuant to federal statute, a federal district court has jurisdiction of a FELA action, concurrent with the jurisdiction of state courts, if the defendant resides in or does business in that federal court\u2019s district or if the cause of action arose in that district. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. Venue choices for FELA actions filed in federal court are broader than the choices allowed under the general federal venue provisions, which \u201cworked injustices to employees.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Kepner </em>(1941), 314 U.S. 44, 53, 62 S.Ct. 6, 10, 86 L.Ed. 28, 33. The United States Supreme Court has stated \u201c[t]he right to select the forum granted in [45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56] is a substantial right.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co. </em>(1949), 338 U.S. 263, 266, 70 S.Ct. 26, 28, 94 L.Ed. 55, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b617 The Supreme Court also has recognized that \u201cthe venue of state court [FELA] suits was left to the practice of the forum ... [provided,] [b]y virtue of the Constitution, [that] the courts of the several states must remain open to [FELA] litigants on the same basis that they are open to litigants with causes of action springing from a different source.\u201d <em>See Miles v. Illinois Cent. R. Co. </em>(1942), 315 U.S. 698, 703, 62 S.Ct. 827, 830, 86 L.Ed. 1129, 1134. Here, Rule does not dispute that the Montana venue statutes provide FELA litigants with access to Montana courts on the same basis as litigants with tort causes of action against nonresident corporations springing from different sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b618 Rule relies on a series of Montana cases, decided over the last quarter-century, for the proposition that this Court does not recognize the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>in FELA actions. <em>See State ex rel. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. District Court </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 146, 154, 891 P.2d 493, 498; <em>State ex rel. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. District Court </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 325, 329, 746 P.2d 1077, 1080; <em>Labella v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 202, 595 P.2d 1184. He is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b619 Whether a change of venue may be allowed on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>differs, however, from the question presented here, which is whether Rule filed his FELA action in a proper venue, in the first instance, under the applicable venue statute. Venue must be changed if the county designated in the complaint is not a proper county. Section 25-2-201(1), MCA. <em>Forum non conveniens, </em>which is codified in Montana at \u00a7 25-2-201(2) and (3), MCA, allows a court to decline to exercise jurisdiction even when jurisdiction is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>under the venue statutes, when an impartial trial cannot be had in the county designated in the complaint or the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change. In the present case, the District Court did not grant BNSF\u2019s change of venue motion pursuant to the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>but instead pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA, on the basis that Cascade County was not a proper county for Rule\u2019s FELA action given the plain language of \u00a725-2-122(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b620 Rule next quotes from several Montana cases involving issues other than <em>forum non conveniens, </em>in which we have made statements relating to venue in FELA cases. For example, we stated in <em>Ford v. Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 188, 193, 819 P.2d 169, 173, <em>aff'd sub nom. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 648 112 S.Ct. 2184, 119 L.Ed.2d 432, that FELA was \u201cdesigned to provide injured railroad workers with as many options as possible when choosing the venue within which to file their complaint.\u201d Similarly, we stated in <em>Haug v. Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 368, 374, 770 P.2d 517, 520, that \u201cthe FELA is to be given a liberal construction in favor of injured railroad employees.\u201d While Rule is correct that, under our cases, a FELA plaintiff may not be afforded <em>fewer </em>venue options than general tort plaintiffs, a FELA plaintiffs options are not necessarily unlimited, under any case law he has cited.</p>\n<p id=\"AY0\">\u00b621 Rule also quotes from <em>Davis v. United Pacific R. Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 233, 245-46, 937 P.2d 27, 34, that \u201c[o]ne area of FELA that this Court has liberally construed in order to further the objectives of FELA is a plaintiffs selection of forum in actions brought under the Act.\u201d This statement is as true today as it was in 1997. However, <em>Davis </em>must be placed in an appropriate context.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b622 Prior to 1995, Montana\u2019s general venue statute allowed a plaintiff to sue any nonresident defendant, including an out-of-state corporation, in any county in the state. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-2-118(2), MCA (1993). In 1995, the Montana Legislature adopted \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA (1995), which restricted venue for a plaintiff bringing a tort action against a nonresident corporate defendant to the county in which the tort was committed, the county in which the plaintiff resided or the county in which the corporation\u2019s resident agent was located. The general venue statute allowing actions against nonresident defendants to be brought in any county remained in effect as to noncorporate nonresident defendants. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-2-118(2), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b623 In <em>Davis, </em>we addressed the constitutionality of the manner in which these venue statutes differentiated between cases in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>defendant was a nonresident corporation and cases in which the defendant was a nonresident individual. We reviewed the statutes in light of their practical application to an example of two motorists injured on a Montana highway, one as a result of the negligence of an out-of-state individual and the other as the result of the negligence of an out-of-state corporation. Based on the vastly different venue options available to the two plaintiffs in our example, we held that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution. <em>Davis, </em>282 Mont. at 246, 937 P.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">\u00b624 Following our decision in <em>Davis, </em>the 1997 Legislature again amended the venue statutes, excepting from the general venue statutes all torts in which the defendant is a nonresident. Under the 1997 venue statutes, which remain in effect, the proper place of trial for a tort action against a nonresident defendant-corporate or otherwise-is the county in which the tort was committed, the county in which the plaintiff resides or, in the case of a corporate defendant, the county in which the corporation\u2019s resident agent is located. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25-2-118(2) and 25-2-122(2) and (3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b625  We have reviewed all of the authorities cited by Rule in support of his second contention. It is true that we have always supported broad FELA venue choices. However, we have never required, nor do the federal statutes or case law, that state court venue for FELA actions must include every place the defendant railroad does business, regardless of venue limits statutorily placed on other tort plaintiffs. We observe that, under \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, FELA plaintiffs have three proper venues for trial, as opposed to two venues available to plaintiffs under the general tort statute or in a tort case in which the defendant is an out-of-state individual. We conclude \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, provides sufficient venue options for FELA plaintiffs to meet the concerns expressed in the federal venue statute and cases and our previous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b626  Rule\u2019s third argument is that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, constitutes an arbitrary and capricious limitation on FELA venue practice in Montana and violates his right to substantive due process of law. We disagree with Rule\u2019s notion that \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, is arbitrary and capricious <em>vis-a-vis </em>FELA venue practice. Under the statute, a FELA plaintiff has the same, or greater, venue rights as any other tort plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b627 Rule claims venue in FELA cases is elevated to a substantive right and \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, is unconstitutional. He properly advances <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, 315 Mont. 107, 67 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>P.3d 892, for the proposition that, in order to comply with substantive due process requirements of the Montana Constitution, a statute must be reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective. Rule contends prevention of forum shopping in FELA cases is not a permissible statutory objective. The statute does not treat FELA plaintiffs differently than other plaintiffs with tort actions, however, and Rule presents no evidence that restricting forum shopping by a FELA plaintiff was the purpose of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b628  The Montana Legislature has broad discretionary powers to enact laws governing venue. <em>See Davis, </em>282 Mont. at 242, 937 P.2d at 32. As a matter of federal law, FELA cases filed in state courts are subject to the same venue provisions as other civil cases filed in state courts. <em>Miles, </em>315 U.S. at 703, 62 S.Ct. at 830, 86 L.Ed. at 1134. Because federal law allows state legislatures to enact venue laws applicable to FELA actions, there is no legal impediment to treating FELA plaintiffs exactly the same as other Montana plaintiffs with tort actions against out-of-state corporate defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b629 Under \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, the state courts of Montana remain open to FELA plaintiffs on the same basis that they are open to tort litigants with causes of action springing from a different source. Rule has established no reason why application of \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, to FELA cases exceeds legislative discretion in enacting venue statutes. As a result, we conclude Rule has not met his burden of proving \u00a7 25-2-122(2), MCA, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b630  We hold the District Court properly applied the venue statutes, which Rule has not proven unconstitutional. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting BNSF\u2019s motion for change of venue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
