The state was represented by Geoffrey Mahar.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he had not been in contact with his attorney and requested his hearing be continued so he can have sufficient time to discuss his case with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be continued to August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">Done in open Court this 10th day of June, 2004.</p>\n<judges id=\"b485-17\">Chairperson, Hon.
