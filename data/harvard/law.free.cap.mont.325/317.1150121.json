Webb was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. He appeals his sentence. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u00b62 There are four issues raised in this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the exception to the mandatory minimum sentence provided in \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, was applicable to Webb\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u00b64 2. Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates Webb\u2019s procedural and substantive due process rights under the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">\u00b65 3. Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution both on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">\u00b66 4. Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates Article II, Section 28(1), of the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b67 On September 12, 2002, the State filed an Information charging Webb with Sexual Intercourse Without Consent pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, a felony, for raping a handicapped neighbor in Great Falls after attempting to kill her by breaking her neck. Webb later turned himself over to police custody, admitted to the crime, entered into a plea agreement and subsequently pled guilty. Webb had a prior conviction of sexual intercourse without consent, so his sentence was given pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, which provides that a person convicted of a second violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA, must be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Webb appeals from this sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b68  Trial judges are granted broad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment for offenses. <em>State v. Hembd </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 407, 411, 838 P.2d 412, 415. On appeal we will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity. <em>Hembd, </em>254 Mont. at 411, 838 P.2d at 415. Rather, this Court will only review a criminal sentence for its legality; that is, whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 8, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 8, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 8. A trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b69 Questions of constitutional law are subject to plenary review by this Court and the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is reviewed for correctness. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">\u00b610 Whether the exception to the mandatory minimum sentence provided in \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, was applicable to Webb\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">\u00b611 Webb argues the District Court erred when it failed to adequately consider the exception found at \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, to the mandatory minimum sentence of \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. The State argues the District Court properly considered the exception and found it did not apply because Webb did not commit the crime under unusual or substantial duress. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">\u00b612 Criminal sentencing alternatives are strictly matters of statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Montana. <em>State v. Stevens </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 114, 115, 854 P.2d 336, 337. In 1995, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, to set a minimum sentence of life in prison without parole for a second conviction of any one of five enumerated offenses, including sexual intercourse without consent. The pertinent part of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">Life sentence without possibility of release. (1) (a)... [I]f an offender convicted of one of the following offenses was previously convicted of one of the following offenses ... the offender must be sentenced to life in prison, unless the death penalty is applicable and imposed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">(iii) 45-5-503, sexual intercourse without consentL]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\u00b613 The Legislature further provided that the mandatory minimum sentence required under \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, does not apply if the sentencing court concludes an exception, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, is warranted. Subsection (3) of that statute allows for relief from the mandatory life sentence if the defendant was \u201cacting under unusual and substantial duress,\u201d at the time he committed the offense. The pertinent part of the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">Exceptions to mandatory minimum sentences and restrictions on deferred imposition and suspended execution of sentence. Mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by the laws of this state, mandatory life sentences prescribed by 46-18-219 ... do not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">(3) the offender, at the time of the commission of the offense for which the offender is to be sentenced, was acting under unusual and substantial duress, although not such duress as would constitute a defense to the prosecutionL]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b614 Webb contends his long history of psycho-sexual problems, his sexual fantasies, his other life struggles of losing two jobs and being evicted from his residence when the local newspaper published his status as a sex offender, his concern and anxiety about re-offending and the negligent supervision by his probation officers combined to provide sufficient duress that the District Court should have granted him an exception pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA. Webb asserts the District Court simply ignored this trauma when it found he was not suffering from any psychological disorder. He argues that because the statute clearly requires \u201csignificant distress\u201d and not a \u201cpsychological disorder,\u201d the District Court committed error by failing to consider \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>46-18-222(3), MCA, in the context of his circumstances at the time he committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b615  Webb\u2019s argument hinges on whether the District Court failed to consider the statutory exception and whether the court erred in finding no \u201cunusual and substantial duress.\u201d The transcript shows Webb\u2019s counsel asked the court for a finding on the applicability of the exception, the District Court specifically considered the exception, applied it to the facts and found the exception did not apply.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">COURT: So you want a finding on this issue, then, based on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">MR. VAN DER HAGEN: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">COURT: So far that we have this hearing. Alright. Regarding the applicability of section 346-18-222(3) [sic], which is the section you\u2019re relying on; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">MR. VAN DER HAGEN: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">COURT: Which provides for an exception to the mandatory minimum if the offender at the time of the commission of the offense for which the offender is to be sentenced was acting under unusual and substantial duress, although not such duress as would constitute a defense to the prosecution, the court finds that anything might be called duress in the defendant\u2019s life as he\u2019s testified to was his own urge to commit crimes of this sort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">The defendant, according to the reports, the presentence report and records that we have at this point, was under no psychological disorder that would cause him to have been acting under unusual or substantial duress at the time of the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">Issues related to his supervision and counseling are not established by the record presented here, and I doubt could be considered evidence in any event of acting under unusual or substantial duress at the time of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">Nor does the Court find any other factors which would satisfy the requirements of that statute. And accordingly, the Court finds that the exceptions of 46-18-222 do not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The record here does not support Webb\u2019s contention that the District Court failed to consider the exception. The court\u2019s task under \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, was to specifically consider and analyze whether the exception was applicable. It did so and found that the exception was not applicable to this case. Webb demonstrates no error in the District Court\u2019s determination that the sentencing exception was inapplicable. We conclude the sentence imposed by the District Court fits within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>statutory parameters of \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, and the District Court correctly analyzed whether the exception found at \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, applied in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b616 Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates Webb\u2019s procedural and substantive due process rights under the United States and Montana Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b617 Webb argues that \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, which requires a court to sentence an offender twice convicted of sexual intercourse without consent to a minimum mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, is unconstitutional because it is arbitrary on several fronts, and as such, violates the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b618 A person who has been convicted of an offense is eligible for, and the court may impose, whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense, so long as the penalty is not cruel and unusual and so long as the penalty is not based on an arbitrary distinction that would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>Chapman v. United States </em>(1991), 500 U.S. 453, 465, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1927, 114 L.Ed.2d 524, 538 <em>superceded </em>by statute on other grounds 21 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 841. Due process requires that a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, and risk of unjust deprivation of that liberty interest, be balanced against the State\u2019s interest in protecting the community. <em>State v. Nichols </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 71, 76, 720 P.2d 1157, 1161 (citing <em>Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates </em>(1979), 422 U.S. 1, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668). It is clear that a convicted defendant\u2019s liberty interest at sentencing does not rise to the level of an accused\u2019s liberty interest at trial. <em>Nichols, </em>222 Mont. at 76, 720 P.2d at 1161 (citing <em>Williams v. New York </em>(1949), 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed.2d 1337). However, it is also true that the rights of the defendant must be protected and due process must be observed in sentencing hearings. <em>Nichols, </em>222 Mont. at 76, 720 P.2d at 1161 (citing <em>State v. Harney </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 55, 62, 499 P.2d 802, 805-06).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">\u00b619 The guarantee of due process has both a procedural and a substantive component. The process requirement necessary to satisfy procedural due process comes into play only after a showing that a property or liberty interest exists. <em>State v. Egdorf, </em>2003 MT 264, \u00b6 19, 317 Mont. 436, \u00b6 19, 77 P.3d 517, \u00b6 19. Under the due process guarantee, every person must be given an opportunity to explain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>argue and rebut any information that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6 18, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6 18. Concerning due process at sentencing hearings, we have held that \u201c[i]t is not the duration or severity of this sentence that renders it constitutionally invalid; it is the careless or designed pronouncement of sentence on a foundation so extensively and materially false, which the prisoner had no opportunity to correct by services which counsel would provide, that renders the proceedings lacking in due process.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>Townsend v. Burke </em>(1948), 334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 1255, 92 L.Ed. 1690, 1693). \u00b620 Here, Webb entered into a plea agreement and changed his plea to guilty. The District Court subsequently held a sentencing hearing where it heard testimony and oral argument. The county attorney made recommendations to the court as to the sentence to be imposed while Webb\u2019s counsel made no recommendations. Webb was provided the opportunity to make a statement to the court. The parties agreed there was no legal reason why sentence should then not be imposed. Concerning procedural due process, Webb was presented with notice of the date of hearing, the presentencing information was fully disclosed in open court, he had the ability to present evidence, to confront witnesses and to participate in the sentencing proceeding. We conclude the sentencing court offered all procedural due process necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b621 The due process clause also contains a substantive component which bars arbitrary governmental actions regardless of the procedures used to implement them and serves as a check on oppressive governmental action. <em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19. Substantive due process primarily examines underlying substantive rights and remedies to determine whether restrictions are unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose of the legislature in enacting the statute. <em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b622 This Court has set forth the following analysis for evaluating a substantive due process claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">A substantive due process analysis requires a test of reasonableness of a statute in relation to the State\u2019s power to enact such legislation. \u201cThe essence of substantive due process is that the State cannot use its police power to take unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious action against an individual.\u201d ... In order to satisfy substantive due process guarantees, a statute enacted under a state\u2019s police power must be reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 21. Accordingly, we turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, to determine whether the mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for a second conviction of sexual intercourse without consent is reasonably related to a permissive legislative goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b623 In 1995, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. During the hearings on the proposed bill, the primary sponsor (sponsor) stated the bill \u201ccame about because of current situations where criminals were being seen in public and dangerous criminals were being released.\u201d The sponsor stated this legislation was necessary to \u201cprotect our children and our grandchildren from the very few predators of society.\u201d Issues surrounding the legislation, such as the wrongfully accused and costs to taxpayers, were discussed by proponents, opponents and committee members. In the end, the sponsor stated the purpose of the legislation was to provide that \u201c[t]wo strikes and you are in [prison] and you are in for good.\u201d This legislative history demonstrates that the purposes in enacting the statute were to discourage recidivist criminal behavior and to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b624 Montana\u2019s correctional and sentencing policy is to protect the public, reduce crime, and increase the public sense of safety by incarcerating violent offenders and serious repeat offenders. Section 46-18-101(2)(b), MCA. Similarly, this Court has noted that Montana has a compelling state interest in discouraging repeat offenders through escalating criminal penalties. <em>Hulse v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 34, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 34, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 34. When the Legislature enacted this statute it made a distinction between first-time offenders and repeat offenders that is not an arbitrary distinction because it fits with Montana\u2019s public policy to discourage repeat offenders and increase the public\u2019s sense of safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b625 Webb makes several arguments to support his contention that \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, is arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional under due process. He first contends the statute is arbitrary because it establishes a minimum sentence for the second conviction of the same enumerated offense, but not for the second conviction of different enumerated offenses. In essence, Webb\u2019s position is that the statute is unconstitutional because it provides different penalties for different crimes. However, providing for criminal penalty statutes is within the province of the Legislature and as discussed above, the purpose of this legislation was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b626 Second, Webb contends \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, is arbitrary because it is based upon the type of offense but ignores the circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>can be considered when determining whether the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed. He argues that discretion must be given to allow for a sentence that is appropriate to the offender and the crime. However, the State points out that the statute does permit the sentencing court to deviate from the mandatory minimum sentence and impose a lesser sentence when an exception from \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, is appropriate and applies to the case. Additionally, \u00a7 46-18-219(1), MCA, permits the sentencing court to impose a greater sentence-the death penalty-after consideration of the circumstances of the particular case. As such, sentencing courts do have some flexibility, albeit very limited, wherein they can consider the circumstances of each particular case. This flexibility consideration was demonstrated here by Webb\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to invoke the exceptions to the minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b627 Third, Webb contends \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, is unconstitutional because the number of situations to which a \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, exception may apply is \u201cpurely arbitrary.\u201d The State counters that the number of applicable situations is irrelevant. \u201c[Webb\u2019s] suggestion, without any supporting analysis or precedent, that merely counting the number of statutory subsections is sufficient to determine the unconstitutionality of a statute falls far short of the proof required.\u201d We agree and decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b628 Fourth, Webb contends the statute is arbitrary because it makes a distinction between the offenses subject to a mandatory minimum sentence and those which are not subject to the same mandate. He gives as an example \u00a7 46-18-219(l)(a)(iv), MCA, which allows imposition of a life sentence for repeat offenses including sexual abuse of children, including instances where a person knowingly possesses any visual or print medium in which children are engaged in sexual conduct. Section 45-5-625(l)(e), MCA. Webb argues that the more serious offenses of incest, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of four years, and sexual assault when a child is involved, which carries a mandatory minimum of two years, are not included in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. He maintains such anomalies illustrate the arbitrariness of the statute. However, we agree with the State\u2019s argument that Webb lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-18-219(l)(a)(iv), MCA, because he was not sentenced pursuant to that subsection. A defendant must show a direct, personal injury resulting from application of the law in question in order to successfully challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute. <em>State v. Krantz </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 501, 506, 788 P.2d 298, 301. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>previously declined to address alleged constitutional violations where the statute complained of was not applied to the complainant. <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 522, 530, 679 P.2d 231, 235. Webb has not been affected by the alleged constitutional infirmities in the statutory examples he provides, so we will not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b629 Finally, Webb argues the statute \u201cviolates substantive due process because it arbitrarily and capriciously prohibits the kind of individual sentencing typical of the modern criminal justice system, except in a very limited number of cases....\u201d In other words, Webb maintains that mandatory minimum sentences negatively affect the fair administration of justice. He asserts that sentencing should be left to judicial discretion and not placed into the hands of the Legislature, which at least through this statute, has imposed unfair and arbitrary sentencing classifications. He alleges that statutes which impose mandatory minimum sentences generally deny the judge the legal power to depart and give a lesser sentence, no matter how unusual the special circumstances that call for leniency and, in reality, basically transfer sentencing power to prosecutors, who can determine sentences through the charges they decide to bring against the offender. However, a review of the record demonstrates this is a case where the District Court analyzed the exception found at \u00a7 46-18-222(3), MCA, and found it did not apply to Webb.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b630  We conclude the sentencing court correctly interpreted \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, and afforded Webb due process when it sentenced him within the statutory sentencing limits to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u00b631 Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under Article II, Section 22, of the Montana Constitution both on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b632 Webb argues the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment because, although it falls within the statutory maximum, it is so disproportionate to the crime that it shocks the conscience and outrages the moral sense of the community or of justice. <em>See State v. Tadewaldt </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 261, 270-71, 922 P.2d 463, 469. He asserts this is particularly true because the statute does not give him an opportunity for parole, even if he rehabilitates himself. The statute, Webb contends, is cruel and unusual in that, once rehabilitated, it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>not allow him an opportunity to return to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b633 Webb is a serial rapist and has demonstrated it is not likely he will be rehabilitated. The District Court listened to testimony by the defendant, victim, social worker and a probation and parole officer during the sentencing hearing. It also considered factors contained in the State\u2019s correctional and sentencing policy in light of the facts of this case. The District Court noted the following observations which supported its sentence and the inapplicability of the exception to the mandatory minimum sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">This Defendant served over 6 years for the identical crime. He went through Phases I and II of the Montana State Prison Sex Offender Program. Yet within 4 months of release, he reoffended. The psychosexual evaluation of Dr. Scolatti offers virtually no hope of rehabilitation. Mr. Webb is found to be in the 98th percentile for risk for violent recidivism. Dr. Scolatti says there is no way to tell or guarantee that if released in 25 years the Defendant will be able to manage his deviant sexual behavior. The Defendant admits to at least 3 rapes. Dr. Scolatti and earlier Mr. Silvers in 1995 indicated a long-standing sexual offense history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Dr. Scolatti rated him and the Court finds the Defendant to be a Level 3, high risk to reoffend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">The victim has suffered irreparable harm. She has been in counseling and her epileptic seizures occur more often.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">In short, Mr. Webb is a guaranteed danger to society. He cannot ever be allowed on the streets again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The District Court was not convinced that Webb would ever cease being a danger to the public and observed, \u201cThis is a grave offense particularly when it is a repeated crime. It seems that a sentence of life without parole is commensurate with the gravity of this crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b634  The general rule regarding sentencing is that a sentence within the maximum statutory guidelines does not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>State v. Dahms </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 1, 13, 825 P.2d 1214, 1221. Here, Webb\u2019s sentence is within the statutory guidelines set out in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA. We therefore reject Webb\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">\u00b635 Whether the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, violates Article II, Section 28(1), of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u00b636 Article III, Section 1, of the Montana Constitution divides the power of government into three distinct branches-legislative, executive and judicial. The power scheme regarding criminal sentencing statutes is that the legislative branch enacts statutes, such as \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA; the judicial branch construes and interprets legislative acts and determines whether a particular law conforms to the Constitution; and the executive branch enforces those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"A2H\">\u00b637  It is within the province of the legislature to distinguish between criminal offenses and to establish punishments. <em>State v. Bruns </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 372, 378, 691 P.2d 817, 821 (citation omitted). This power to enact criminal punishment statutes \u201cshall be founded on the principles of prevention, reformation, public safety, and restitution for victims.\u201d Art. II, Sec. 28(1), Mont. Const. The Legislature used its power to enact \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, based upon constitutional principles and Montana public policy. We have reviewed the statute and the arguments presented by Webb and conclude there is no violation of separation of powers concerning the mandatory minimum sentence given to Webb pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b638 The District Court is affirmed on all issues.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
