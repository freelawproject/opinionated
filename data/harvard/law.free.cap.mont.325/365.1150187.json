We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">\u00b62 We re-state and address the following issues raised by Svaldi on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u00b63 1. Did the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney negligently breach a legal duty owed to Svaldi when he told a newspaper that he was discussing with her attorney a deferred prosecution agreement that concerned possible criminal charges against her?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\u00b64 2. Did the County Attorney negligently breach a legal duty owed to Svaldi when he revealed to a newspaper the initial offense report naming Svaldi as a possible suspect in an offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b65 Prior to her retirement in May 1998, Svaldi had been teaching in the Anaconda public school system for approximately 25 years. On March 2, 1998, parents of children taught by Svaldi made an assault complaint against her to the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Police. Several of the parents alleged Svaldi had assaulted and/or was verbally abusive to their children. A written initial offense report was created and was forwarded to the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney\u2019s Office along with a request for prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b66 About the same time as the initial offense report was filed, the parents made written complaints concerning the same matters against Svaldi to the Anaconda School District (\u201cSchool District\u201d). In response to the complaints, the School District placed Svaldi on administrative leave pending investigation. The School District conducted an independent investigation and prepared an investigation report. The County Attorney, Michael Grayson (\u201cGrayson\u201d), obtained a copy of the School District\u2019s investigation report through an investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b67 On or about April 27, 1998, Grayson contacted Svaldi\u2019s attorney in this matter, Mark Vucurovich (\u201cVucurovich\u201d), to discuss the possible criminal prosecution and the possibility of a deferred prosecution agreement. In a letter dated April 28, 1998, Vucurovich informed Svaldi of the details of his conversation with Grayson.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b68 On May 5, 1998, Vucurovich submitted a letter to Robert Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d) the attorney for the School District, informing him that Svaldi intended to retire at the end of the 1998 school year. In the letter, Vucurovich authorized Brown to discuss Svaldi\u2019s retirement with County Attorney Grayson at a meeting scheduled between Grayson, the complaining parents and Brown. The letter also stated, \u201c[Svaldi] is retiring based upon assurances from the School District that there will be no criminal prosecution in this matter.\u201d However, Vucurovich admitted he was aware that any decision regarding criminal prosecution would be made by the County Attorney, not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>the School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u00b69 On May 12,1998, Grayson sent a letter and deferred prosecution agreement to Vucurovich. The proposed deferred prosecution agreement was for a term of two years and required Svaldi to \u201cretire from teaching children in any capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b610 Subsequently, a reporter from the Anaconda Leader, an area newspaper, contacted Grayson about the case. Grayson informed the reporter that his office was discussing a deferred prosecution agreement with Svaldi\u2019s attorney in exchange for Svaldi\u2019s promise to retire from teaching. Upon request, Grayson also provided the reporter with a copy of the initial offense report. Svaldi did not sign a deferred prosecution, she retired, and Grayson did not pursue criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b611 Svaldi sued the County and the School District for damages alleging breach of her right to privacy and claiming damages for severe emotional distress. The School District and the County both moved for summary judgment. On April 23, 2003, the District Court entered its Opinion and Order granting summary judgment in favor of the School District and the County. Svaldi does not appeal the judgment in favor of the School District. She appeals the judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b612 Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. Our standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling is <em>de novo. Renville v. Frederickson, </em>2004 MT 324, \u00b6 9, 324 Mont. 86, \u00b6 9, 101 P.3d 773, \u00b6 9. \u201cAccordingly, such review affords no deference to the district court\u2019s decision and we independently review the record, using the same criteria used by the district court... to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 9. Moreover, all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">III. DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\u00b613 Did the Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney negligently breach a legal duty owed to Svaldi when he told a newspaper that he was discussing with her attorney a deferred prosecution agreement that concerned possible criminal charges against her?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">\u00b614 Svaldi brings suit to collect damages for the County Attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>alleged negligent violation of the Criminal Justice Information Act. Section 44-5-101, MCA, <em>et seq., </em>(the \u201cAct\u201d). Svaldi first argues that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the County Attorney was discussing with Svaldi\u2019s attorney possible agreements that the State not file charges against her in exchange for an agreement that she retire from teaching. Accordingly, Svaldi argues the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the County. Svaldi next argues that \u201cdiscussions\u201d relating to a possible deferred prosecution agreement constitute confidential, not public, criminal justice information under the Act. Therefore, County Attorney Grayson acted negligently when he told a reporter from the Anaconda Leader that he was discussing the option of a deferred prosecution agreement with Svaldi\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">\u00b615 The basis underlying Svaldi\u2019s claim is that Grayson breached a duty owed to her by releasing confidential criminal justice information to the press. It is not an issue of material fact whether Grayson actually had bi-lateral discussions with Svaldi\u2019s attorney, or whether Svaldi had actual knowledge of any discussions Grayson had with her attorney. The factual basis of this claim is what Grayson said to the press. The parties do not dispute that Grayson made a statement to the press, wherein he identified Svaldi, and said he was discussing a possible deferred prosecution agreement with Svaldi\u2019s attorney. There is no dispute concerning the contents of the statement. Thus, there is no material issue of fact. The issue is one of law; whether the information disseminated by Grayson constituted a tortious release of confidential criminal justice information. Therefore, the District Court did not err in concluding there were no disputed issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b616 By statute, criminal justice information is classified as either public criminal justice information, or confidential criminal justice information. <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. City of Bozeman Police Dept. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 218, 222, 859 P.2d 435, 437-38. Public criminal justice information is defined in \u00a7 44-5-103(13), MCA, and includes information \u201cof convictions, deferred sentences, and deferred prosecutions.\u201d Confidential criminal justice information is defined in \u00a7 44-5-103(3), MCA, and includes information related to criminal investigations or criminal intelligence, fingerprints and photographs, or \u201cany other criminal justice information not clearly defined as public criminal justice information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b617  \u201cWith some qualifications, public criminal justice information may be disseminated without restriction.\u201d <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>260 Mont. at 223, 859 P.2d at 438; \u00a7 44-5-301(1), MCA. The dissemination of confidential criminal justice information, on the other hand, is restricted by statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 44-5-303, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b618 Svaldi asserts that only those deferred prosecution agreements that are in writing and executed by the parties as provided by \u00a7 46-16-130(l)(b), MCA, constitute public criminal justice information. She argues that since no such agreement was ever signed in this case, the information concerning the possibility of such an agreement that Grayson revealed to the newspaper reporter was not public criminal justice information, and could, therefore, not be disclosed. We agree that only those deferred prosecution agreements that are actually executed meet the definition of public criminal justice information in \u00a7 44-5-103(13), MCA. However, that does not mean that discussions related to the possible offering of a deferred prosecution agreement meet the statutory definition of confidential criminal justice information.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b619  Mere discussion of a possible deferred prosecution agreement, which is one of several options available to a county attorney in handling a case, does not constitute a discussion of criminal justice information. Criminal justice information is defined as \u201cinformation relating to criminal justice collected, processed, or preserved by a criminal justice agency.\u201d Section 44-5-103(8)(a), MCA. A county attorney\u2019s discussions related to the possibility that a deferred prosecution agreement may be offered do not concern \u201ccollected,\u201d \u201cprocessed,\u201d or \u201cpreserved\u201d information obtained by a criminal justice agency. Therefore, such discussions are not protected from public disclosure by the Criminal Justice Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b620  Svaldi attempts to create an argument that her privacy rights were violated by Grayson\u2019s interview with a newspaper reporter. She cites <em>Engrav v. Cragun </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 260, 769 P.2d 1224, in support of her position. In <em>Engrav </em>this Court stated \u201c[individuals arrested under suspicion of committing a crime and who are subsequently released without charges or incarceration must be protected from public persecution.\u201d <em>Engrav, </em>236 Mont. at 266-67, 769 P.2d at 1228. While there might be circumstances in which persons suspected of having committed a crime may have a reasonable expectation that their privacy will not be violated by a release of the details of an investigation conducted by law enforcement agencies, the record makes it clear that such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b621 Svaldi cannot seriously argue that her privacy rights were violated by Grayson. She admittedly announced to her students that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the allegations against her were the \u201cworse kept secret in town.\u201d She was the subject of a School Board investigation and the School Board held a public meeting to discuss her retirement. County Attorney Grayson did not reveal any information about the allegations against Svaldi that the newspaper and the public did not already know.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b622  Accordingly, there is no material issue of fact concerning whether Grayson negligently breached a duty owed to Svaldi when he told the Anaconda Leader that he was discussing the possibility of entering into a deferred prosecution agreement with her attorney. And, no legal duty owed to Svaldi was breached by such discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b623 Did the County Attorney negligently breach a duty owed to Svaldi when he revealed to a newspaper the initial offense report naming Svaldi as a possible suspect in an offense?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b624 Svaldi argues, pursuant to a 1988 Attorney General\u2019s Opinion, the initial offense report in this case did not constitute public criminal justice information, as Svaldi was a mere suspect and was never charged with any crime. <em>See </em>42 Mont. Op. No. 119 Atty. Gen. 454 (1988). In this opinion, the Attorney General stated that as a general rule initial offense reports must be made publicly available, however, circumstances may arise in which these documents involve a privacy interest which clearly exceeds the public\u2019s right to know. 42 Mont. Op. No. 119, 464. This, according to the Attorney General, may be the case where an innocent person is publicly designated as a suspect in a crime. 42 Mont. Op. No. 119, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b625 Considering the uncontested facts of this case, we are not called on to determine if the Attorney General was correct in his 1988 opinion referenced above. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b626 Svaldi attempts to further support her argument by reference to <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 441, where this Court noted \u201csuspects\u201d may have an expectation of privacy in \u201ccertain circumstances because criminal investigations occasionally result in the designation of the innocent as suspects, particularly in the early stages of investigation.\u201d Thus, according to Svaldi, as she was a mere suspect in this case, she had a privacy interest in the initial offense report which outweighed the public\u2019s right to know. Her reasoning is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">\u00b627 Section 44-5-103(13)(e)(i), MCA, states that initial offense reports constitute public criminal justice information which can be publicly disseminated without restriction pursuant to \u00a7 44-5-301(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u00b628 <em>Citizens to Recall Mayor James Whitlock v. Whitlock </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 517, 844 P.2d 74; <em>Great Falls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Cascade County Sheriff </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 103, 775 P.2d 1267; and <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle </em>support our conclusion that the public\u2019s right to know outweighs Svaldi\u2019s right to privacy under the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>a newspaper sought public disclosure of the names of three law enforcement officers disciplined for their actions in running over a suspect on a public sidewalk with a police car after the suspect fled on foot from a high-speed chase. This Court held the public\u2019s right to know outweighed the privacy interest of the officers in preventing the release of their names because police officers \u201coccupy positions of great public trust.\u201d <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 775 P.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b630 In <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>the newspaper sought public release of the investigative documents associated with a police officer accused of sexual intercourse without consent by a cadet at the Law Enforcement Academy under the \u201cright to know\u201d clause of the Montana Constitution. No criminal charges were ever filed against the officer, but he was forced to resign from the police force. This Court held that even though criminal investigative information constitutes confidential criminal justice information, \u201csuch alleged misconduct went directly to the police officer\u2019s breach of his position of public trust; that, therefore, this conduct is a proper matter for public scrutiny; and that, accordingly, the Chronicle has met its initial burden to make a proper showing to receive the confidential criminal justice information at issue.\u201d <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 440-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b631 The reasons for public disclosure of allegations against persons holding positions of great public trust which this Court discussed in <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>238 Mont. at 107, 755 P.2d at 1269, and in <em>Whitlock, 255 </em>Mont. at 522, 844 P.2d at 77, apply to Svaldi under the facts presented here. As a teacher in the public schools, entrusted with the care and instruction of children, her position is one of public trust. Also, the allegations of misconduct, assault against her students, went directly to her ability to properly carry out her duties. As in <em>Whitlock, </em>where we pointed out that the particular allegations of misconduct went directly to the public official\u2019s ability to properly carry out his duties, it is not required that the allegations against Svaldi be withheld from public scrutiny even though no criminal charges were ultimately filed against her. <em>Whitlock, 255 </em>Mont. at 522-24, 844 P.2d at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u00b632  Further, as discussed in Issue I, Svaldi cannot seriously claim her privacy rights were violated by the release of the initial offense report when it was already public knowledge that the allegations were against her, what the allegations were, who was involved as complainants, that she was the subject a School Board investigation concerning the allegations, and that her intended retirement from teaching was connected to these same allegations. Grayson was justified in releasing the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b633  The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney did not breach a duty owed to Svaldi by discussing a possible deferred prosecution agreement with the Anaconda Leader, or by releasing to that newspaper a copy of the initial offense report. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-5\">CHIEF JUSTICES GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
