Sanders (Sanders), <em>pro se, </em>appeals from an order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, denying his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court correctly apply the procedural bar in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, and refuse to address Sanders\u2019 claim for relief on that basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">\u00b64 On October 11,2002, Sanders pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to the offense of partner family member assault (assault). On the same day, the District Court held a hearing on the State\u2019s petition to revoke the suspended portion of his sentence for a different offense. At the hearing, Sanders admitted to violating the terms set forth in the petition. Immediately following the hearing, the District Court revoked the suspended sentence and imposed a one-year jail term on the assault charge, to run concurrent with the sentence imposed for the previous offense. Sanders did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">\u00b65 Petitioner alleges that on or about August 18, 2002, he filed a motion to dismiss the assault charge on the grounds that he did not appear before a magistrate and no bail was set within 72 hours of his arrest, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA. <em>See State v. Giddings, </em>2001 MT 76, 305 Mont. 74, 29 P.3d 475. However, Petitioner subsequently withdrew the motion in an effort to resolve all pending claims and charges against him. In consideration for his withdrawal of the <em>Giddings </em>claim, the felony assault charge was reduced to a misdemeanor and Petitioner was not designated a persistent felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b66 In April 2003, Sanders, instead of filing a direct appeal, filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this Court. He alleged the District Court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his suspended sentence because he did not receive a hearing within 72 hours as required by \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, and further sought relief because he was eligible for parole but had not yet appeared before the parol board. On July 8, 2003, this Court ruled Sanders\u2019 first argument constituted a collateral attack upon his conviction and was therefore not appropriate for habeas corpus relief, but remanded the case to the District Court for farther consideration as a petition for postconviction relief. This Court held that his second ground for relief was moot because he had a parol hearing scheduled for July 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b67 The petition was then considered by the District Court. Sanders filed a brief in support of his petition for postconviction relief. The State responded that Sanders\u2019 claim he was not timely brought before a magistrate was waived because he agreed to abandon that issue when he pled guilty, in exchange for the State\u2019s agreement to reduce the assault charge from a felony to a misdemeanor and drop the persistent felony offender designation. The State also pointed out Sanders was held not only on a probation violation, but on the assault offense, so that the applicability of \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, was questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b68 The District Court acknowledged the State\u2019s waiver argument, but denied the petition on the basis of the direct appeal bar in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA; reasoning that since Sanders could have raised the issue on direct appeal, he was procedurally barred from doing so on postconviction review.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b69 Sanders now appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6 36, 316 Mont. 103, \u00b6 36, 68 P.3d 872, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u00b611 Did the District Court correctly apply the procedural bar in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, and refuse to address Sanders\u2019 claim for relief on that basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b612 Sanders argues that a direct appeal is not the sole means by which he can raise the issue that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, because such a claim can be raised at any time. He points out that he waived his right to appeal pursuant to the plea agreement. Therefore, Sanders maintains he was not precluded from raising the jurisdiction argument in his petition for postconviction relief. Sanders cites <em>State v. Moorman </em>(1997), 279 Mont. 330, 928 P.2d 145, in support of this proposition. Sanders argues further that because the District Court lacked the jurisdiction to revoke his suspended sentence, he may be wrongly forced to comply with the Violent Offender Registration Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b613 Relying on our language in <em>Gollehon v. State, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 55, 296 Mont. 6, \u00b6 55, 986 P.2d 395, \u00b6 55, the State contends Sanders\u2019 claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, because Sanders could have raised this argument on direct appeal. The State also argues that Sanders\u2019 claim is barred under the principle that a guilty plea waives any substantive or procedural defense that arose prior to entry of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b614 In <em>Moorman, </em>we concluded the sentencing court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d to impose the particular sentence and that the bar in \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, did not apply in such cases. <em>Moorman, </em>279 Mont. at 336, 928 P.2d at 149. However, we recently overruled that portion of the opinion on which Sanders relies in <em>Pena v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, 323 Mont. 347, 100 P.3d 154, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">However, the question in [Moorman] was not whether the court possessed the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to entertain, hear and determine a matter, but rather whether the particular sentence imposed by the sentencing court was statutorily permissible, and therefore, to the extent that our holding in <em>Moorman </em>characterized and resolved the sentencing issue before it as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d that holding was incorrect, and is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae\"><em>Pena, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b615  Likewise, Sanders\u2019 claim the District Court failed to follow the statutory procedure concerning making arrangements for a hearing within 72 hours, as delineated in \u00a7 46-23-1012(3), MCA, is not a true jurisdictional question. Whether a district court commits a statutory error must not be confused with the question of whether the court had the power or capacity to proceed in the first instance. <em>Pena, </em>\u00b6 22. Sanders\u2019 claim is more properly characterized as a claim that his sentence was illegal, which is a nonjurisdictional claim for purposes of the postconviction statutes. <em>Pena, </em>\u00b6 25. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>precludes postconviction relief upon such a claim because Sanders could have raised it on direct appeal. While the District Court did not have the benefit of <em>Pena, </em>it nevertheless correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, bars Sanders\u2019 claim for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b616  As for Sanders\u2019 argument regarding the Violent Offender Registration Act, this issue was not raised in the District Court. A postconviction claim that is not raised in an original or amended original petition cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Garner, </em>2001 MT 222, \u00b6 45, 306 Mont. 462, \u00b6 45, 36 P.3d 346, \u00b6 45; \u00a7 46-21-105(1)(a), MCA. Thus, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, REGNIER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
