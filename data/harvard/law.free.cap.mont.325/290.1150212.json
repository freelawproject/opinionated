This suit has now been certified as a class action. A subclass was also certified; this appeal concerns Wombolds and other plaintiffs who are a part of the subclass.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>\u00b62 The District Court granted Wombolds\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment to the effect that there is a private right of action under the CLA and points charged by Associates violated the act. Associates now appeal. Wombolds cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of that part of their motion whereby they sought to have the loans in question declared void.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b63 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b64 1. Does the CLA confer a private right of action on borrowers?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b65 2. Does the CLA prohibit licensees from charging a \u201cprepaid finance charge/loan fee/discount points\u201d on the origination of real estate-secured loans?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b66 3. In the alternative, does the CLA require a licensee to refund a portion of the \u201cprepaid finance charge/loan fee/discount points\u201d when a real estate-secured loan is paid in full before its maturity date?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b67 4. Did the District Court err in not declaring the loans void under the CLA after it found that Associates had violated the act?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b68 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\u00b69 The parties agreed to a Statement of Uncontroverted Facts essentially as follows. From January 1, 1995, through November 8, 1999, Associates operated within the State of Montana through Associates Financial Services Company of Montana, Inc., a Montana corporation, that operated a consumer loan business subject to the requirements of the Montana Consumer Loan Act (Title 32, Chap. 5, MCA). From November 8, 1999, through December 31, 2000, the successor in merger to the Montana entity, Associates Financial Services Company, Inc., operated a consumer loan business within the State of Montana subject to the requirements of the Montana Consumer Loan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">\u00b610 From January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, Associates made 3,833 real estate-secured loans in Montana. Of these loans, 1,111 were second mortgage loans. The remaining 2,722 real estate-secured loans were first mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">\u00b611 Associates at times imposed a charge on the Montana real estate-secured loans from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, which could be characterized as prepaid finance charges, loan fees, or points. Hereafter these prepaid finance charges/loan fees/points will simply be called \u201cpoints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">\u00b612 The points were calculated as a percentage of the amount financed by the underlying promissory note and varied from zero <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>percent (0%) to ten percent (10%) of the amount financed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">\u00b613 Associates charged points on 2,818 real estate-secured loans it made between January 1,1995, and December 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b614 Except in rare instances, the points were not directly related to expenses incurred by Associates in relation to services provided to Associates by a third-party, including but not limited to recording fees, reconveyance fees, and other similar fees. Even in those instances, where a third-party expense was incurred by Associates, the majority of the funds received as points constituted gross income to Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"AjI\">\u00b615 The points were added to and made a part of the principal balance of the loan. As they were added to the principal balance of the loan, interest was charged on the points at the agreed rate of interest of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b616 With respect to every real estate-secured loan Associates made in Montana from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, and on which points were collected, Associates did not refund any portion of these points when the loan was prepaid by a cash payment derived from a source other than an Associates refinance of the previous loan.</p>\n<p id=\"AQI\">\u00b617 With respect to every real estate-secured loan Associates made in Montana from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, and on which points were charged and collected, Associates did not refund any portion of those points when the loan was prepaid, or when Associates accelerated the amount due after the debtor had defaulted on the underlying obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b618 With respect to every real estate-secured loan Associates made in Montana from January 1,1995, through December 31,2000, on which points were charged, Associates did not refund any portion of those points when the loan was prepaid from the proceeds of a new loan made more than one year from the original loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b619 With respect to those loans made from January 1,1995, through December 31, 2000, which were refinanced by Associates within one year, a portion of the points was refunded, with the refund calculated based on a ratio of the number of unexpired months in the one year period over 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b620 All second mortgage loans Associates made in Montana from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000, are governed by the Montana Consumer Loan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b621 Additional facts are stated as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b622 In 1997 the Legislature amended the CLA to exclude first mortgage loans from the CLA\u2019s regulation. This litigation concerns first mortgage loans made by Associates from January 1, 1995, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>October 1, 1997, and second mortgage loans made from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b623 In June 2001 Wombolds initiated this action against Associates alleging Associates engaged in illegal lending practices. Associates answered denying Wombolds\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b624 In December 2001 Wombolds moved to amend their complaint to seek certification as a Class Action. The District Court granted the motion and also certified a specific subclass consisting of those persons whose consumer loans were secured by a mortgage on real property. This appeal concerns members in this subclass. The subclass members claim that points charged by Associates on real estate-secured loans violate the CLA. These points, typically one percent of the amount borrowed for each point, in some cases ran as high as eight to ten percent of the note amount. The points were added to the principal amount of the loan at the outset, and interest was charged upon the new principal amount which included the points.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b625 The CLA contemplates two types of loans: first, add-on interest loans where the total interest to be charged on a loan is added to the amount borrowed and the resulting sum is divided by the number of months over which payment is to be made, resulting in the required monthly payment; and second, interest-bearing loans where interest at the agreed rate is charged on the principal balance remaining after each payment is applied first to interest and the remainder to principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b626 The loans in question were set up as interest-bearing loans, not add-on interest loans. Thus, the interest rate and the amount of the loan was agreed on, as well as the points to be charged. The amount of the loan was advanced to the borrower, and Associates kept the points. The points were added to the amount owed, and thus the principal balance of the loan, upon which interest was charged, became the sum of both the points and the amount advanced, and the borrower paid simple interest on this amount. If the loan was paid early, or defaulted, there was no refund of the points that had been added up front.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b627 Both parties moved for partial summary judgment. The District Court granted Wombolds\u2019 motion. Initially, the District Court entered judgment largely adopted from Wombolds\u2019 <em>ex parte </em>submission of a proposed order. Associates moved for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., arguing that the District Court\u2019s Order exceeded the parameters of the parties\u2019 Stipulation. The District Court agreed and vacated its initial Order, and issued its Revised Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order. In its revised order the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>again granted partial summary judgment to Wombolds. However, in its second order it declined to declare the loans void, which is a possible remedy under the CLA. The partial summary judgment was certified as final and ripe for appeal under Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">\u00b628 Associates has appealed the District Court\u2019s judgment that it violated the CLA. Wombolds cross-appeal the denial of a judgment that the loans in question are void as a result of the violation of the CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b629 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Motion for Summary Judgment <em>de novo. Associated Press v. Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 11, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6 11, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6 11. To prevail, the moving party must demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone County </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903. If the moving party is successful, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont, at 264, 900 P.2d at 903. Unsupported, conclusory or speculative statements on the part of the non-moving party, as to what might have happened, do not constitute issues of fact precluding summary judgment. <em>Nelson v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 409, 412, 847 P.2d 284, 286. If no genuine issues of fact exist the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Bruner, </em>272 Mont. at 264-65, 900 P.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b630 Associates urge that we hold, as a matter of law, that the District Court erred in its following conclusions: (1) the CLA confers a private right of action, (2) Associates violated the CLA by charging points on the real estate-secured loans in question; or alternatively, (3) Associates violated the CLA by not crediting or refunding a portion of the points charged when a real estate-secured loan was paid in full prior to the maturity date of the loan. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. E.g., Rossi v. Pawiroredjo, </em>2004 MT 39, \u00b6 13, 320 Mont. 63, \u00b6 13, 85 P.3d 776, \u00b6 13. In part, these issues require this Cotut to interpret the CLA. Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo. Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 315, \u00b6 24, 48 P.3d 697, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b631 Following a Motion for Relief from Judgment under Rule 60, M.R.Civ.P., a slight abuse of discretion need be shown to warrant reversal of a trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside a judgment. <em>Karlen v. Evans </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 181, 185, 915 P.2d 232, 235. If the trial court has set aside the judgment and the appellant requests the judgment be reinstated, then a manifest abuse of discretion must be shown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>warrant reversal. <em>Karlen, </em>276 Mont. at 185, 915 P.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b632 Does the CLA confer a private right of action on borrowers?</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b633 Associates argues that the CLA provision providing: \u201c[a]ll powers and duties of regulation and supervision conferred by this chapter are vested in the department,\u201d constitutes a prohibition of a private right of action, because, it argues, the Department of Administration, which issues licenses and oversees compliance of the act, is the sole entity authorized to seek a remedy for violations of the act in the Courts. Section 32-5-401(1), MCA. Conversely, Respondents argue that the remedy provisions of the act indicate that legislative intent is consistent with allowing a private right of action because, necessarily, the remedy of voiding a loan benefits the borrower.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b634 The CLA does not expressly authorize a private right of action by a person injured as a result of a violation. Likewise, the legislative history is void of language indicating an intent to expressly grant or deny a private right of action. The federal courts have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">[T]he legislative history of a statute that does not expressly create or deny a private remedy will typically be equally silent or ambiguous on the question. Therefore, in situations such as the present one \u201cin which it is clear that [ ] law has granted a class of persons certain rights, it is not necessary to show an intention to <em>create </em>a private cause of action, although an explicit purpose to <em>deny </em>such cause of action would be controlling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\"><em>Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago </em>(1979), 441 U.S. 677, 694, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1956, 60 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u00b635 The question of whether a statute creates a private cause of action by implication is a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">The development of the case law of Montana with respect to the rules of statutory construction may be summarized by the following analysis: (1) Is the interpretation consistent with the statute as a whole? (2) Does the interpretation reflect the intent of the legislature considering the plain language of the statute? (3) Is the interpretation reasonable so as to avoid absurd results? and (4) Has the agency charged with the administration of the statute placed a construction on the Statute?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-12\"><em>Montana Power Co. v. Cremer </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 277, 280-81, 596 P.2d 483, 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">\u00b636 In statutory construction, we also consider the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>legislation; here, regulation of consumer lenders and the protection of borrowers. Generally, \u201c[l]egislation enacted for such a beneficent purpose is to be liberally construed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dreher v. Fuller </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 445, 448, 849 P.2d 1045, 1047; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1-2-103, MCA, (providing statutory \u201cprovisions and all proceedings under them are to be liberally construed with a view to effect their objects and to promote justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">\u00b637 The CLA serves to regulate the consumer loan industry and protect borrowers from predatory lending practices. This legislation grants borrowers certain rights regarding the structure of their loans.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axxn\">[W]e can assume that the legislature is aware of the doctrine of implied statutory causes of action and also assume that the legislature would not enact a remedial statute granting rights to an identifiable class without enabling members of that class to enforce those rights. Without an implicit creation of a remedy, the statute is meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><em>Bennett v. Hardy </em>(Wash. 1990), 784 P.2d 1258, 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b638 Although we encourage the legislature to be more precise in its language, in considering the CLA we cannot conclude that failing to expressly provide for, or to disallow, a private right of action forecloses such right. When considering remedial legislation, we agree with the approach of the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">When Congress intends private litigants to have a cause of action to support their statutory rights, the far better course is for it to specify as much when it creates those rights. But the Court has long recognized that under certain limited circumstances the failure of Congress to do so is not inconsistent with an intent on its part to have such a remedy available to the persons benefitted by its legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\"><em>Cannon, </em>441 U.S. at 717, 99 S.Ct. at 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b639 The act\u2019s remedial measures, are indicative of legislative intent to protect borrowers and are not inconsistent with allowing an implied private right of action under the CLA. Section 32-5-103(4), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">Any act by a licensee in the making of a contract or in the collection of a loan made under the contract that violates the provisions of this chapter is void. The licensee has no right to collect, receive, or retain any principal, interest, or charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">In addition, \u00a7 32-5-301(6), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">If any amount in excess of the charges permitted by this chapter is charged, contracted for, and received, except as the result of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>accidental and bona fide error of computation, the licensee may not collect or receive any charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b640 In <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis (\u201cLewis\u201d), </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80b-15 <em>et seq.) </em>created a private right of action for damages or other relief in favor of persons harmed by violations of the act. <em>Lewis </em>(1979), 444 U.S. 11, 12-13, 100 S.Ct. 242, 243, 62 L.Ed.2d 146. There, the Court noted that the act did not expressly provide for a private cause of action and the only provision expressly allowing any suit to enforce the act authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission to bring suit in a federal district court to enjoin violations of the act. <em>Lewis, </em>444 U.S. at 14, 100 S.Ct. at 244. Undeterred, a shareholder of Mortgage Trust of America brought suit on behalf of the Trust and the Trust\u2019s shareholders, arguing that clients of the investment advisers were the intended beneficiaries of the act and courts should therefore imply a private cause of action in their favor. <em>Lewis, </em>444 U.S. at 15, 100 S.Ct. at 244-45. The United States Supreme Court held under \u00a7 215 of the act (15 U.S.C., \u00a7 80b-15) an aggrieved individual could maintain a limited private action for a violation of the act under a section rendering certain contracts void. The Court reasoned that clients of investment advisers were the intended beneficiaries of the act and that by declaring certain contracts void the section by its terms contemplated that the issue of voidness would be litigated somewhere. <em>Lewis, </em>444 U.S. at 17-18, 100 S.Ct. at 246. \u201c[W]hen Congress declared in \u00a7\u00a7 215 that certain contracts are void, it intended that the customary legal incidents of voidness would follow, including the availability of a suit for recission or for an injunction against continued operation of the contract, and for restitution.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>444 U.S. at 19, 100 S.Ct. at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b641 Similarly, in <em>Transamerica Financial Corp. v. Superior Court (\u201cTransamerica\u201d), </em>the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that a private right of action was implied, in part, \u201c[bjecause the determination of voidness under [the Arizona statute] only inures to the benefit of an individual borrower, a private right of action was contemplated by the legislature for enforcement of this individual right, even though other sections of the act provide for administrative action for enforcement of its regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Transamerica </em>(Ariz. 1988), 761 P.2d 1019, 1021 (there the court also noted that a private right of action had been allowed judicially under a predecessor to the present Arizona statute and the legislature had not, despite amendments and modifications to the statute, disallowed the implied private right of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u00b642 Also revealing as to legislative intent is the CLA\u2019s attorney fees provision. In 1981, the Legislature amended the act, in part, by providing for attorney fees in legal actions. Section 32-5-407(1), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\">If the contract so provides, reasonable attorney fees may be awarded to the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered in any action on a contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Under the logic advanced by Associates, only the Department of Administration could take action to enforce the CLA. If such were the case, there would be no need to provide in \u00a7 32-5-407(1), MCA, that a party could be awarded its fees in an action on a contract entered into pursuant to the act. At best, it could be anticipated that the Department would only bring some type of regulatory action; it would not bring an action on a contract to which it was not a party. The inclusion of the attorney fee provision is proof of a legislative intent to recognize a private right of action under the CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b643 Other courts have found an attorney fee provision indicative of legislative intent to allow for a private right of action. <em>See Cannon, </em>441 U.S. 677, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (concluding legislative intent to provide for a private right of action under Title IX based, in part, upon amendment allowing attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party); <em>see also California Paralyzed Veterans Ass\u2019n v. F.C.C. </em>(Cal., 1980), 496 F.Supp. 125, 129 (concluding the passage of an attorney fee provision, along with other evidence, was persuasive evidence of Congress\u2019 original intent to provide for a private right of action under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b644 Here, the express language allowing the prevailing party to recover attorney fees \u201cin any action on a contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of th[e] [CLA]\u201d so long as such award is provided for in the parties\u2019 contract, is in accord with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that an implied private right of action is consistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the act. Section 32-5-407(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b645 Implying a private right of action in the CLA would not lead to an absurd result. The act itself is for the protection of borrowers, and its enforcement by those it protects is in complete accord with its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b646 The Montana Department of Administration has not appeared herein directly. However, the Montana Attorney General, presenting himself as the Chief Legal Officer of the State, has appeared by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>personally signing an amicus brief wherein he argues that there is a private right of action under the CLA and states: \u201cIf Associated [sic] Financial were successful in overturning the Eighth Judicial District Court\u2019s decision, Montana citizens would find themselves without redress provided for under the Montana Constitution and would be denied the very protection from predatory lending that the act was intended to prevent.\u201d While the Attorney General\u2019s formally stated position is not exactly the same as an interpretation by the Department of Administration, it does weigh in favor of a determination that there is an implied private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b647  If the legislature had intended to prohibit a private cause of action under the CLA, it could have easily done so. We conclude the District Court was correct in holding the CLA does provide a limited private right of action for individuals to bring suit. For the reason pointed out below, we do not address the extent of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b648 Does the CLA prohibit licensees from charging points on origination of real estate- secured loans?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b649 The CLA prohibits a licensee, such as Associates, from charging a borrower any cost not specifically authorized. Section 32-5-103(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[A] person may not engage in the business of making consumer loans in any amount and contract for, charge, or receive directly or indirectly on or in connection with any loan any charges, whether for interest, compensation, consideration, or expense, except as provided in and authorized by this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b650 Section 32-5-301(1), MCA, provides: \u201c[a] licensee or holder of a supplementary license under this part may contract for and receive on any loan of money interest charges as provided under 31-1-112.\u201d Section 31-1-112(1), MCA, provides \u201c[a] regulated lender is exempt from all limitations on the rate of interest that it may charge and is exempt from the operation and effect of all usury statutes.\u201d Thus, a regulated lender, Associates in this instance, is authorized to charge any rate of interest the market will bear.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b651 If the points in question are interest, charging them to the borrower may not violate the act. If they are not interest, the points are costs not specifically authorized by \u00a7 32-5-301(5), MCA, and are unlawful. Or, if by adding these points to the principal of the loan at the beginning, the loan is converted from an interest-bearing loan to an add-on interest loan, \u00a7 32-5-301(3), MCA, was violated because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>there was no refund of a part of such charges. The question then becomes whether the points in question are interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\u00b652 Although not defined under the CLA, interest is generally defined as <em>\u201ca </em>charge made for the use, forbearance, or detention of money ....\u201d <em>Brummer v. TMG Life Ins. Co., Inc. </em>(D. Mont. 1992), 147 B.R. 552,557. \u00b653 Wombolds assert, in a somewhat confusing fashion, that by charging the points in question Associates has violated the CLA\u2019s prohibitions as they are unauthorized fees or, in the alternative, if these points are interest, such must be refunded upon prepayment, as required by \u00a7 32-5-301(3), MCA. During the course of this litigation, Associates changed its position on whether the points in question constitute interest. However, <em>\u201ca </em>label placed upon a charge by the parties will not control the determination of whether that charge is interest....\u201d <em>Brummer, </em>147 B.R. at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b654 Here, the parties have entered into a written stipulation in which they agreed that the issues on appeal include: (1) Does the CLA confer a private right of action, (2) Whether Associates violated the CLA by imposing prepaid finance charges/loan fees/discount points upon real estate-secured loans, and/or (3) Whether Associates violated the CLA by not crediting or refunding a portion of the prepaid finance charges/loan fees/discount points when a real estate-secured loan was paid in full prior to the maturity date of the loan through direct payment, re-financing or acceleration? By this stipulation the parties did not agree on whether the points in question are interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b655 At oral argument counsel for Wombolds stated he did not disagree with Associates new position that the points were indeed interest. However, this Court must, in order to correctly interpret the CLA, determine whether the points at issue, under the circumstances shown in the record, were charged, collected or not refunded in violation of the CLA. Thus, notwithstanding the position of a party hereto, this Court must now make a determination of whether the points in question constituted interest authorized by \u00a7 32-5-301(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b656 Associates argues that the Department of Administration, by its conduct over the years in not taking action to prohibit the charging of points, has interpreted the CLA to permit them. It further argues that both the Department and the Attorney General as its counsel, by entering into a consent order in a different case, wherein a lender was allowed to charge points, have interpreted the CLA to mean that points are allowed. It is true that interpretation of a law by an agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to deference. <em>Montana Power Co. v. Cremer, </em>182 Mont. at 280, 596 P.2d at 485. However, in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>there is no actual interpretation of the CLA by the Department. And, it is at least questionable whether, because of the questions asked and the answers given, the Department was aware of how points were charged and collected. Further, the consent order referred to was a true compromise. We are advised by the parties that under the terms of such consent order, the lender in that case could charge points, and in return the points were limited to 5% of the loan and could not be charged on a re-financed loan. This compromise does not constitute an interpretation of the CLA by the Department of Administration and the Attorney General that points, as defined under the facts of this case, are interest and thus allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b657 Associates admit, in its brief and in the testimony of its expert, that the points charged are, at least in part, to compensate the lender for various costs or services, that is, preparation of loan documents, obtaining and reviewing the borrower\u2019s credit report, helping the borrower complete a credit application, reviewing that application, title insurance, property appraisal, and preparing and recording a trust deed. Associates\u2019 expert states that such a fee \u201cserves a different purpose from [ ] \u2018interest\u2019 in that it does not compensate the lender for the use of its money over time rather it serves to compensate the lender for the up-front service costs incurred in providing the loan.\u201d \u00b658 The record establishes that Associates, in disclosure forms mandated by the federal Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605, 1606, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 226.4, 226.22 advised its borrowers that the interest rate of the loan was one rate, and then after the addition of the points, which was called a \u201cloan fee,\u201d the effective rate of interest was increased. These disclosures may have satisfied the requirements of the TILA, however, they also reveal that points are disclosed independently of interest before being combined in the Annual Percentage Rate and Finance Charge. Regardless, whether Associates complied with TILA is not an issue in this suit; rather this Court has before it the issue of whether Associates complied with Montana\u2019s CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b659  We conclude that the points charged on the loans in question are not interest; that is, they are not charged for the use, forbearance, or detention of money. Under the circumstances of this case and the provisions of the CLA, the imposition of a flat fee, computed as a percentage of the loan, bearing no direct relation to actual costs of specific services performed, front-loaded into the loan, which did not constitute a charge for the use of the lender\u2019s money over time, is not interest. These points are a fee charged by Associates for making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>loan. By the express language of the CLA, Associates was prohibited from charging fees not explicitly authorized under the act, \u00a7 32-5-103(1), MCA; \u00a7 32-5-301(5), MCA. Charging the fee described, which we have called points, violates the CLA despite Associates\u2019 clever attempt to disguise such charge as interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">\u00b660 The Court is cognizant of the fact that the fees, called points herein, are often treated as interest in the lending industry, and when a borrower\u2019s home is involved such are deductible as interest under the United States Internal Revenue Code. However, the very intent of the CLA is to place strict limits on what charges licensees thereunder may make, in order to protect borrowers in the secondary lending market. We decline to interpret the CLA in such a way that it contains a loophole whereby predatory lenders may add points onto the beginning of an interest-bearing loan and thereby escape the requirement that such points be at least partially refunded if the loan is prepaid or refinanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b661 Does the CLA require a licensee to refund a portion of loan fees or points when a real estate-secured loan is paid in full before its maturity date?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b662 Wombolds urge this Court to affirm the District Court\u2019s determination that, even if interest, Associates\u2019 failure to refund a portion of the points upon prepayment violates the CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b663 Refund of a portion of total charges on add-on interest loans is required by \u00a7 32-5-301(3), (7), MCA. Here, the loans in question are indeed interest-bearing loans and not add-on loans. Therefore, they are exempted from this requirement. Section 32-5-301(7), MCA. Interest-bearing loans, by their very nature, do not require a refund of interest because, until it is earned, interest is neither charged nor collected. However, having already concluded in this instance that the points charged were not interest, but were a fee expressly prohibited by the act, we need not further address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b664 Because the District Court found that real estate-secured loans made by Associates to the Wombolds and the other subclass members violated the CLA, should the District Court have declared the loans void under \u00a7 32-5-103(4), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\u00b665 Wombolds assert this issue on cross-appeal. Simply put, Wombolds argue that the District Court erred in granting Associates\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Rule 60(b) motion vacating the August 2002 judgment to the extent that the original judgment imposed the CLA remedy of voidness on the loans the District Court found to be in violation of the CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b666 As stated above, following Associates\u2019 motion, the District Court withdrew its judgment and entered an amended judgment. While not expressly reaching the issue of what remedies may be available for a violation of the CLA, the District Court\u2019s amended judgment includes statements that could be interpreted as doing so. As stated above, we express nothing in this Opinion concerning what remedies may or may not be available for a violation of the CLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b667 The determination of a remedy is not included in the District Court\u2019s certification of issues being ripe for appeal under Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. The parties\u2019 stipulation of the issues on appeal does not reference this issue. Therefore, we decline to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b668  The judgment of the District Court that Associates violated the CLA in its loans to the subclass in which Plaintiffs Wombolds are members, is affirmed. This matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this Opinion and applicable law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b328-9\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A5D\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">\u00b669 I concur in the ultimate conclusions reached by the Court, and urged by the Respondents, that the loan practices of the Appellants violated the Montana Consumer Loan Act, and further, that the Act confers a private right of action to borrowers affected by those practices. However, I reach the conclusion that the Act was violated under a different rationale than offered by the Court, one which would require a different holding with regard to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">\u00b670 I depart from the Court on the issue of \u201cpoints,\u201d that is, whether points are interest and can be lawfully charged under the Act. The Court concludes that \u201c[cjharging the fee . . . which we have called points, violates the CLA despite Associates\u2019 clever attempt to disguise such charge as interest.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 59.1 respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">\u00b671 It should be remembered that this case was submitted to the District Court and to this Court on stipulated facts. It should also be emphasized that this case involves hundreds of different loans, which were not identically structured, or, in other words, are based on differing facts. The Court\u2019s opinion subtly acknowledges the differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in the subject loans, <em>see </em>\u00b6 14 for example, but renders a decision which fails to account for differences in individual loans which well could affect the law\u2019s application to those particular loans. It does so, unfortunately, by relying on testimony in the record which is outside of the stipulated facts and, thus, engages in improper factfinding that should be reserved for litigation upon remand. In order to reach its conclusion that points are not interest, the Court looks to, and adopts, the expert testimony offered by one of the parties. <em>See </em>\u00b6 57. Again, such testimony is beyond the stipulation and beyond the District Court\u2019s action herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\">\u00b672 The Court correctly notes that the parties\u2019 stipulation does not include an agreement that points were interest. <em>See </em>\u00b6 54. It fails to mention, however, that the District Court specifically found that points were interest (\u201c[T]he Court finds that the loan fees constituted \u2018interest\u2019 as defined in \u00a7 31-1-104, MCA,\u201d p. 15, Revised Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on Summary Judgment). Consistent therewith, the parties effectively adopted this finding as part of their stipulation by agreeing before this Court in oral argument that points were interest. Nonetheless, the Court rejects, without appropriate justification in my view, both the District Court\u2019s finding and the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b673 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s finding that points are interest. For purposes of brevity, I simply summarize my reasons for doing so. The statutory definition of interest in \u00a7 31-1-104, MCA, is very broad (\u201cInterest is the compensation allowed by law or fixed by the parties for the use or forebearance or detention of money\u201d). The points charged to the consumer were calculated as a percentage of the amount financed, and, as acknowledged by the parties at oral argument and by the Court, <em>see </em>\u00b6 59, the points were separately disclosed to the consumer and then calculated with accruing interest for purposes of interest disclosure to the consumer under the Truth in Lending Act. Although the parties dispute the effect of the Department\u2019s actions in regard to this issue, it is undisputed that the Department took no action and routinely acquiesced in this treatment of points. Finally, treatment of points as interest has been approved by courts considering the issue. <em>See Layne v. Transamerica Fin. Services </em>(Ariz. 1985), 707 P.2d 963, 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b674 Thus, points being interest, it was permissible for Appellants to assess the points pursuant to \u00a7 32-5-301(1), MCA. That provision of the Act incorporates \u00a7 31-1-112, MCA, which also exempts Appellants from the \u201coperation and effect\u201d of all usury laws. This policy was further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>clarified by the Legislature\u2019s repeal of the ban on the compounding of interest in 1985. Therefore, the assessment of interest on the points, i.e., \u201ccompounding,\u201d is likewise permitted. Indeed, this \u201cloophole for predatory lenders\u201d criticized by the Court does exist and is allowed by the law. <em>See </em>\u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b675 That is not the end of the matter, however, for two reasons. First, as mentioned above, not all of the subject loans are identically structured. Differing facts could well lead to a different conclusion about whether points are interest in individual cases. If, for example, the points were not included in interest disclosure documents, or were not calculated as a percentage of the amount financed, these facts could lead the trial court to conclude that the points were not interest, and therefore, prohibited by the Act under the Court\u2019s reasoning in \u00b6 60. On remand, loans which fall outside the facts on which this opinion is premised would be subject to further litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b676 Secondly, though the points assessed under the agreed facts are considered interest, Appellants nonetheless have violated the Act. The Act acknowledges only two kinds of loans, those being \u201cadd-on\u201d and \u201cinterest-bearing.\u201d \u201cAdd-on\u201d loans are provided some definition pursuant to \u00a7 32-5-301, subsections (2) and (7), as loans which assess interest \u201cat the time the loan is made\u201d even if \u201cthe loan is payable in installments.\u201d \u201cInterest-bearing\u201d loans are not defined by the Act, although it can be reasonably inferred that \u201cinterest-bearing\u201d loans are those which bear or accrue interest over the life of the loan. What is clear, however, is that Appellants are charging interest both ways: adding-on interest up front, and also assessing interest over the life of the loan. Therefore, by charging points (interest) up front, Appellants are bound by the provisions of the Act which apply to \u201cadd-on\u201d loans, including the necessity of refunding the appropriate portions of those assessments when the loan was paid off or otherwise re-financed. There is no other way in which to apply the Act to a consumer lender which engages in the practice of assessing up-front interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b677 Therefore, I would reach the conclusion under Issue 3 that Appellants violated the Act by failing to so comply. I, thus, concur in the Court\u2019s conclusions that the Act has been violated, and that Respondents have a private cause of action to remedy those violations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
