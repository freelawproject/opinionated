Counts II and III are suspended and shall run concurrent with Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">On August 12, 2004, the defendant's application for review of that sentence was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The defendant was present and was represented by Craig Shannon. Stillwater County Attorney, John Petak, III, was present at the Montana State Prison (MSP), however MSP staff failed to escort him to the hearing room in a timely fashion. Therefore, he was unable to participate at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">On August 17,2004, the Sentence Review Division received a Motion for the Prosecution to be Heard by Sentence Review Tribunal from Stillwater County Attorney, JohnPetak, III. The Honorable Marc Buyske, Chairman of the Sentence Review Division, granted the Prosecution\u2019s Motion. It was ordered the State of Montana\u2019s position be heard in this matter on September 24,2004, at the Montana Women\u2019s Prison in Billings, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">On September 24, 2004, the State of Montana\u2019s position was heard by the Sentence Review Division of the Montana Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">The defendant and his counsel, Craig Shannon, participated telephonically from the Montana State Prison. The state was present and represented by John Petak, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The Sentence Review Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed, with respect to Count I, is clearly excessive. It is not commensurate with sentences imposed or similar sentences involving marijuana production where there is no accompanying distribution conviction. Further, the defendant has no prior criminal record other than misdemeanor driving offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be modified as follows: Count I: Twenty (20) years in the Montana State Prison, with Fifteen (15) years suspended. There will be no modification to the terms of Counts II and III, as they run concurrent to Count I. The conditions of the suspended sentence are to remain as imposed in the April 23, 2004 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Done in open Court this 24th day of September, 2004.</p>\n<judges id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Chairperson, Hon.
