Whiteman raises the sole issue of whether the District Court erred when it determined, based upon the brutal nature of the offense and the best interests of the community and of Whiteman, that Whiteman should stand trial in District Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b62 At the outset, we note Whiteman appears to have abandoned his claim that the statute permitting the District Court to transfer a case back to the Youth Court, \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, violated his due process rights based upon its failure to assign the burden of proof. In any event, the District Court clearly assigned the burden of proving that Whiteman should stand trial in District Court to the State in this case. We will avoid hypothesizing regarding possible permutations and incarnations not presented. <em>New York v. Farber </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 747, 767, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3360, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113, 1129 (citing the traditional rule that \u201ca person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied may not challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b63 The State alleges that on February 6, 2004, Whiteman, using a baseball bat, beat and killed Wayne Not Afraid (Not Afraid) and severely injured Floyd Grant (Grant). Whiteman was thirteen years old at the time of the beatings. Earlier that day, Whiteman and two other males, Dietrich Shoulderblade (Shoulderblade), and John Knows His Gun (Knows His Gun), had engaged in a verbal confrontation with Not Afraid and Grant. Cheranda Not Afraid, decedent Not Afraid\u2019s niece, told police that shortly after her grandmother diffused the verbal confrontation, she overheard Whiteman, Shoulderblade and Knows His Gun discussing a plan to assault Not Afraid and Grant. They devised a plan to have Knows His Gun lure the two men out of their trailer where Whiteman and Shoulderblade would attack them with a bat. Although Cheranda did not witness the attack, she told police she saw Whiteman poised with a bat outside her uncle\u2019s trailer shortly before the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b64 In subsequent interviews with police, Knows His Gun admitted the males had conceived of the plan to ambush Not Afraid and Grant and that upon confronting the two men, Whiteman had struck Not Afraid and Grant each in the head with a baseball bat. Knows His Gun stated he did not see Whiteman\u2019s first blow to Grant, but asserted he heard it and saw Grant falling backwards without making any effort to catch himself. He also claimed Not Afraid then rushed towards Whiteman at which time Whiteman struck Not Afraid with the baseball bat, knocking him to the ground. Once Not Afraid was on the ground, Whiteman returned to Grant and inflicted more blows to his head with the baseball bat. Grant appeared to be unconscious as he made no effort to protect himself. Whiteman then returned to Not Afraid and hit him in the head several more times with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b65 The blood spatter found at the crime scene by the police and the physical appearance of Not Afraid and Grant proved consistent with Knows His Gun\u2019s report. The police also recovered a pair of bloody pants from Whiteman\u2019s trailer and a wooden bat covered with a large amount of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">\u00b66 On February 18,2004, the State filed a motion in Youth Court for leave to file a Petition of Delinquency against Whiteman. The motion alleged Whiteman had committed acts that, if he were an adult, would have constituted the offenses of deliberate homicide and aggravated assault. The Youth Court granted the State leave to file a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>delinquency and the State filed it on February 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b67 The next day, February 20,2004, the State filed in District Court a notice of its intent, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(1), MCA, to file an Information against Whiteman in district court and a motion to transfer his case to district court. The State explained that although the statute allowed it to file an Information against Whiteman directly in district court, it believed that based upon <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT 70, 294 Mont. 17, 977 P.2d 1000, a transfer hearing must occur before filing an Information against a minor in district court. The State then filed its motion for leave to file an information directly in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b68 Whiteman filed a separate motion in District Court on June 11, 2004, requesting the court declare the transfer statute, \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, unconstitutionally vague and that the statute\u2019s failure to allocate which party carried the burden of proof denied him due process. The District Court eventually assigned to the State the burden of proof under the transfer statute based on the State\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b69 Whiteman filed a brief in support of his position that the case should be tried in Youth Court on June 24, 2004. The next day, the District Court conducted a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, to determine whether Whiteman\u2019s case should be tried in youth court or district court. On July 23,2004, the District Court issued its first order in which it denied Whiteman\u2019s request that it declare the youth transfer statute unconstitutional. The court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a separate order on August 16, 2004. This second order granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to file an Information against Whiteman directly in district court. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion regarding whether a juvenile should be prosecuted in youth court or district court. <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, \u00b6 12, 294 Mont. 367, \u00b6 12, 982 P.2d 421, \u00b6 12 <em>(citingMatter of J.K.C. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 342, 344, 891 P.2d 1169, 1171). \u2018With regard to specific findings of fact relied on by the [district] court in transferring the case, the standard of review is whether such findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Matter of J.D.W. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 87, 91, 881 P.2d 1324, 1327). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 12 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its conclusions are correct. <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b611 The State may file a motion for leave to file an information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>directly in district court under certain circumstances. These circumstances include a situation in which the youth is twelve or more years of age, the alleged criminal conduct falls within a specified category of offenses, including deliberate homicide as defined in \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, and the court finds, upon considering all the relevant evidence, probable cause to believe the youth has committed the alleged offense. Section 41-5-206(1), MCA. Once the State submits the case to the district court, the district court may not transfer the case to the youth court unless it finds by a preponderance of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">(a) a youth court proceeding and disposition will serve the interests of community protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">(b) that the nature of the offense does not warrant prosecution in district court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">(c) it would be in the best interest of the youth if the matter was prosecuted in youth court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Section 41-5-206(3)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">\u00b612  As a preliminary matter, Whiteman asserts that the District Court, in considering these factors, contemplated only selective factual allegations, proposed by the State and adopted verbatim by the court, that falsely portray the nature of the alleged incident. We need not address Whiteman\u2019s supposition that the District Court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous as a result of their \u201cverbatim\u201d adoption. We conclude the District Court made comprehensive findings of fact that intimately detailed the testimony offered at trial. \u201cFindings and conclusions that are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and are supported by evidence will not be overturned simply because the trial court relied on proposed findings and conclusions submitted by counsel.\u201d <em>Steve v. Smith </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 419, 439, 863 P.2d 1000, 1012 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">\u00b613 We will address, however, Whiteman\u2019s specific allegations of clear error in the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as they relate to the transfer statute. Whiteman first claims the District Court erred in determining that the nature of his offense warranted prosecution in district court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. Specifically, Whiteman asserts the court relied upon the nature of the allegations, rather than the nature of the offense, in determining whether the attack on Not Afraid and Grant was deliberate, and thus warranting prosecution in District Court. Whiteman contends the court ignored significant evidence, including statements in the State\u2019s Affidavit suggesting mitigating factors, that contradicted the State\u2019s allegations that the attack of Not Afraid and Grant had been planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">\u00b614  We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>findings that probable cause existed for the charge of deliberate homicide and thus prosecution in district court. <em>See </em>Section 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA. The District Court received testimony at the hearing from both parties concerning the basis for the charges. Between the testimony presented, including eye-witness accounts, the court found more reliable the reports by Detectives Dalton and Bahm that characterized the attack as premeditated and vicious. The court stated, \u201c[b]oth Detective Dalton and Detective Bahm were called as witnesses for the State. Their respective testimony at hearing confirmed the substantive allegations of the <em>Affidavit ...\u201d </em>Having found \u201cno allegations or assertions currently before the Cotut suggesting that the death of Wayne Not Afraid and severe beating of Floyd Grant could in any way be characterized as justifiable or the result of negligent rather than deliberate conduct,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cbased not only on the seriousness of the alleged offenses but also on what appears to be the premeditated, violent, and deliberate character of the conduct resulting in the alleged offenses, that the nature of the offenses warrants prosecution in the district court in the adult system.\u201d <em>See </em>Section 41-5-206(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b615  As this Court has recognized, \u201c[i]t is within the domain of the trial court to resolve conflicts in the evidence based on its assessment of the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses before it, and this Court will not resolve conflicts on appeal.\u201d <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Matter of T.N. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 81, 85, 881 P.2d 1329, 1332). Therefore, we conclude, based on the evidence presented at the transfer hearing, the District Court did not err when it determined the testimony of Detectives Dalton and Bahm supplied probable cause that Whiteman committed the offense and that the nature of the offense warranted prosecution in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b616 Whiteman, pointing to \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, next contends the District Court improperly relied only upon the State\u2019s witnesses in determining whether youth court proceedings would serve the interests of the community and Whiteman. Whiteman asserts the absence of any criminal history and the testimony of three of his former teachers as well as a psychologist established that he does not present a danger to the community. Further, Whiteman maintains the youth court\u2019s dispositional options included facilities designed to rehabilitate youths that would be more therapeutic and thus better suited to his interests than those offered in the adult prison system.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">\u00b617 We conclude once again that sufficient evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that a youth court proceeding and disposition would not serve the interests of the community or promote Whiteman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>rehabilitation. The District Court received testimony at trial from both parties concerning the interests of the community and of Whiteman. Between the testimony presented, including three of Whiteman\u2019s teachers, a psychologist, and two officers from the Department of Corrections, the court found more substantive the testimony of Officer Pamela Bunke, an administrator for the Department of Corrections, and Officer Jack Lane, a probation officer. Officers Bunke and Lane both testified to the limited resources available to the youth court in handling young violent offenders like Whiteman as well as the continuity to which Whiteman\u2019s case would receive in the adult system. Further, both Officers Bunke and Lane testified that Whiteman\u2019s rehabilitation would be better suited to the adult system.</p>\n<p id=\"AcN0\">\u00b6 18 The District Court determined that youth court proceedings would limit the dispositional options to juvenile correctional or treatment facilities and only for the limited time frame of the youth court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cSuch limitations,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdo not serve the interest of the community protection as does the more extensive sentencing options available to the district court through the adult system.\u201d The court also concluded, \u201c[n]o one reasonably disputes that it is in the offenders\u2019 best interests that they be held accountable for their actions ... The broader options available to the district court in adult proceedings to hold offenders accountable provide the Court with greater ability to impose the appropriate level of accountability ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVc\">\u00b619  The trier of fact resolves conflicts in the evidence before it, and this Court will not reevaluate this same evidence on appeal. <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 30. Despite the testimony of three of Whiteman\u2019s teachers describing him as intelligent and respectful and a psychologist who believed Whiteman just needed more structure, sufficient credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s findings that a youth court proceeding and disposition would not serve the interests of the community or promote Whiteman\u2019s rehabilitation. <em>See </em>Section 41-5-206(3)(a) and (c), MCA. We thus conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions that prosecution of Whiteman in youth court would not serve the best interests of the community or Whiteman are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Whiteman should be tried in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
