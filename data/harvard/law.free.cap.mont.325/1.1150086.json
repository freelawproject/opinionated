The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">The Division finds that the sentence imposed by the sentencing court is clearly excessive considering the recommendation made by the prosecution and the pre-sentence investigation report. Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Division that the defendant\u2019s sentence be modified to Twenty-five (25) years in the Montana Women\u2019s Prison, with Twenty (20) years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Done in open Court this 26th Day of March, 2004.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-19\">Chairperson, Hon.
