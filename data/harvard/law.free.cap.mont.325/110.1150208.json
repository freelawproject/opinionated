By an Order Consolidating Appeals issued by this Court on July 8, 2003, without objection by the State or by Graham, we consolidated the appeal of Shawnon Lanette Jarvis, Cause No. 03-163, a co-tenant of the residence occupied by Graham, pursuant to Rule 4(b), M.R.App.P., as these cases were likewise consolidated in the District Court on the Motion to Suppress. The facts and legal arguments raised below, and the Order of the District Court appealed herein, are identical. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b62 Did the District Court err when it denied Graham\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence and concluded that:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b63 1. the search warrant application contained sufficient probable cause to justify a search of Graham\u2019s residence;</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b64 2. the search warrant application and the search warrant were not overly broad; and</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b65 3. the search warrant application was properly signed under oath?</p>\n<p id=\"A01\">\u00b66 Because Issue One is dispositive, we do not reach the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b67 On July 11,2002, Daniel Lawson was arrested in Lincoln County on a charge related to the manufacture of methamphetamine. Lawson confessed and offered to provide information about other clandestine methamphetamine laboratories operating in the Libby area. The information provided by Lawson led to the execution of a search warrant on Graham\u2019s home and property.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">\u00b68 The search warrant application was signed by Detective Klint Gassett of the Lincoln County Sheriffs Office on July 12, 2002, and signed by Lincoln County Justice of the Peace Marlene Herried the following day. The application recites that Gassett had probable cause to believe that an unlawful clandestine laboratory was operating on the premises of the \u201cJohn Doe Residence\u201d at 3890 South Highway #2 in Libby. Gassett alleged that the property contained items related to a clandestine laboratory and enunciated a list of items to search for that would be considered \u201ccontraband, evidence, fruits of the crime, and articles and instrumentalities used in the commission of the crime....\u201d Gassett further states, \u201c[t]hat the facts which are the grounds of this application and upon which applicant relies to establish probable cause for the issuance of a Search Warrant are outlined in the attached Exhibit \u2018A\u2019, incorporated by this reference herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u00b69 Exhibit A explains that, after confessing to operating a methamphetamine laboratory, Lawson provided information to the arresting officers about other Lincoln County residents who were allegedly manufacturing methamphetamine. It further states that information provided by Lawson about several individuals was corroborated by independent evidence and reports. Exhibit A includes Lawson\u2019s physical description of Graham and the other residents of that household, whose names Lawson did not know. Further specifics Lawson provided about Graham as memorialized by Gassett in Exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>A are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">Lawson stated [John Doe] has a methamphetamines laboratory in his garage. [A woman and a child] reside in the house with [Doe]. They live in a one story white house with a fence. Their vehicles appear to be a Dodge Dart, maroon or red in color and a Silver 79 to 81 Oldsmobile. The home is next to HW#2 ... across the highway from Pioneer Auto Wrecking. There is an unattached garage next to the home and that is where the methamphetamine laboratory is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Lawson said that he has been to the home approximately 10 times, the last time being the day before this interview. Lawson said that he takes out Joe Dubler to the residence and that Joe Dubler cooks methamphetamines for [Doe]. That Dubler has told him this and that when he picks up Dubler from the residence he sometimes get[s] methamphetamines from Dubler. ... Dubler admitted to this affiant that he has been around methamphetamine laboratories. Dubler denies knowing how to cook. Dubler has a prior record for drug related crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Lawson told this affiant that Chris Stone told him he taught [Doe] to cook methamphetamines and that the methamphetamine laboratory was in the garage of DOE....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">Lawson told your affiant that... Stone has been in the garage and does cook methamphetamines with DOE. Lawson stated to your affiant that he has dropped Dubler off at the residence and ... Dubler go[es] into the garage with DOE. Lawson stated that when he has picked up Dubler from that location that Dubler has brought out methamphetamines to his vehicle from the garage. Lawson stated that Dublers [sic] and Stone told him recently that the Methamphetamine Laboratory at the DOE residence/garage is still operational.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">On July 11, 2002, Lawson showed your affiant where the ... residence/garage was located. The home is as described by Lawson, except that there is light green trim on the one story home. [On] July 12,2002, your affiant got close enough to see the license plate on a gray or silver 4-door vehicle parked in front [of] the house ... registered to a Shawnon Jarvis.... An owner registration check shows that Jarvis also owns a 1994 Saturn 2Door Maroon in color....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">The address taken from the Saturn 2-Door registration check is the same address that Lawson showed your affiant where the DOE residence was located....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>On July 11,2002 your affiant saw Joe Dublers mother\u2019s vehicle at [this residence]. Your affiant has seen Joe Dubler drive this vehicle before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">With all the information provided your affiant believes that there is a Clandestine Methamphetamine Laboratory at the JOHN DOE residence located at 3890 S HW #2, Libby, Mt. Lawsons previous information has turned out to be true and correct and there is no known reason why the information regarding this methamphetamine laboratory should be any different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b610 After the search warrant was signed on July 13, the home and property of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d-who turned out to be John Graham-was subsequently searched. No evidence of a methamphetamine laboratory was found in the garage, but evidence was located and seized elsewhere on the property. After Graham\u2019s arrest, he moved to suppress the evidence gained in the search of his residence. The District Court denied the Motion. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Graham pled guilty to Operation of Unlawful Clandestine Laboratory, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA, and reserved his right to appeal the denial of the pretrial Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6 10, 312 Mont. 169, \u00b6 10, 59 P.3d 369, \u00b6 10 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusion on whether or not a search warrant is overbroad <em>de novo. State v. Seader, </em>1999 MT 290, \u00b6 4, 297 Mont. 60, \u00b6 4, 990 P.2d 180, \u00b6 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err when it denied Graham\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence and concluded that the search warrant application contained sufficient probable cause to justify a search of Graham\u2019s residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">\u00b613 Graham argues that the District Court erred when it concluded that Detective Gassett\u2019s search' warrant application contained sufficient probable cause to justify a search of his residence. He argues that the application contained only information identifying Graham\u2019s <em>garage </em>as a location in which a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory operated. While he concedes that the search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>application established probable cause to search his garage, Graham claims the application recited no information upon which the judge could form any belief that a crime was being committed in the residence, or elsewhere on the property. He claims that, in light of the information provided in the application, the issuing court exceeded the scope of a permissible warrant by including his residence, curtilage, outbuildings and vehicles in the warrant. Graham states, \u201cIt is not a logical assumption that if the informant is reliable or that the information provided by the informant is corroborated, that the State may search <em>any </em>real or personal property connected with the person informed upon.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b614 The State responds that the search warrant application enunciated a substantial number of facts establishing probable cause that criminal activity had occurred in the residence and was not confined to the garage. The State points to specific facts in the warrant, and asserts that, \u201ca reasonable inference supports the determination that the kinds of ingredients and equipment used to manufacture methamphetamine would be found in the home where a suspect resides next to an unattached garage.\u201d The State claims that it is a reasonable inference that the circumstances set forth in Gassett\u2019s application would lead a magistrate to conclude that many of the easily portable common household items, such as cold tablets, matches, and cookware, would move back and forth between the house and the unattached garage. The State, citing <em>State v. Sundberg </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 115, 119, 765 P.2d 736, 739, argues that the totality of the circumstances set forth in the four corners of the application, evaluated in a practical and commonsense manner, established a fair probability that incriminating items reasonably connected with criminal behavior would be located inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b615 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-101(1), MCA, a search of a place may be made and evidence may be seized by the authority of a valid search warrant. A warrant is valid if the application made in support thereof states facts sufficient to show probable cause in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. <em>Marks, </em>\u00b6 14. Section 46-5-221, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">Grounds for search warrant. A judge shall issue a search warrant to a person upon application, in writing or by telephone, made under oath or affirmation, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">(3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b616 In its Order Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence, the District Court found that, while Lawson personally observed activity which circumstantially implicated Graham, he did not have direct personal observation of criminal activity by Graham. Thus, the District Court concluded, independent corroboration that suspicious activity was taking place at the location specified by Lawson would be required. (See <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) The District Court further found that this independent corroboration had been satisfied, noting,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">The subsequent police investigation verified a number of innocent details - that the house was similar to the way it was described by Lawson, that Graham had a gray Oldsmobile, that Graham\u2019s girlfriend was approximately the height and weight described by Lawson - but it also established that a car registered to Joe Dubler\u2019s mother and known to be driven by Joe Dubler, a known drug user - according to his prior criminal record and his own admission - was parked at Graham\u2019s residence on July 11, 2002, the day before the search warrant application was prepared. With that piece of police work, Lawson\u2019s information was adequately corroborated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Thus, the District Court concluded, the totality of circumstances recited in the search warrant application established probable cause to believe that the crime of manufacturing methamphetamine was being committed on Graham\u2019s property and that evidence of the crime would be found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b617 While we agree that the information supplied by Lawson was corroborated by the appearance of the Graham residence and the presence there of an automobile used by Dubler, such corroborating information does not-without more-supply probable cause to search the residence. The command to search can never include more than is covered by the showing of probable cause to search. <em>United States v. Hinton </em>(7th Cir. 1955), 219 F.2d 324. In the case at hand, the search warrant application clearly stated that Lawson averred that Graham had a methamphetamine laboratory in his garage; that the unattached garage was where the methamphetamine laboratory was located; and that the methamphetamine was brought by Dubler from the garage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Lawson\u2019s vehicle. <em>See \u00b6 9, above. </em>The showing of probable cause does not extend to the house. The particular place to be searched, as evidenced by the application and circumscribed by \u00a7 46-5-221(3), MCA, was clearly the \u201cgarage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b618 The Dissent argues that methamphetamine laboratories are, by their very nature, portable entities. While this may be true, there were no allegations in this search warrant application that the lab or its parts had been or were being transported. Although the affidavit states that Graham was using his garage for the manufacture of methamphetamine, the affidavit <em>does not </em>state that Graham was engaged in the sale of methamphetamine or that Graham personally transported the methamphetamine from place to place, as the Dissent asserts. The only accusation of methamphetamine transport in the application was as to Dubler, and not as to Graham. Had there been allegations in the application of items being transported back and forth by Graham, we would have no problem upholding the search of Graham\u2019s home. If the government demands to search a person\u2019s home, then it must have probable cause and a warrant; without both, the search is <em>per se </em>unreasonable. This is the \u201cindelible rule.\u201d While there are a few \u201cspecifically established\u201d and \u201cwell-delineated\u201d exceptions to the warrant requirement, a \u201cmeth lab\u201d exception is not one of them. We therefore reject the State\u2019s contention that because the easily portable items associated with methamphetamine laboratories, such as cold tablets, matches and cookware, <em>could </em>\u201cmove back and forth\u201d between the house and the unattached garage, the search of the residence was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b619  We have long recognized the sanctity of the home and the need for particularity in granting search warrant applications. <em>State ex rel. Samlin v. District Court </em>(1921), 59 Mont. 600, 609-10, 198 P. 362, 365 (complaining party must have reasonable cause to suspect that criminal instrumentalities are concealed within the specified house). We have held that an arrest warrant for a person does not permit officers to enter the home of a third party without a search warrant. <em>State v. Kao </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 277, 283-84, 697 P.2d 903, 908 (regardless of how reasonable an officer\u2019s belief may have been that an escaped felon was hiding in the home of a third party, the belief was not subjected to the detached scrutiny of a judge and the resident\u2019s only protection against an illegal entry was the officer\u2019s personal determination of probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b620 Homes have special protection in search and seizure law. In <em>State v. Therriault, 2000 </em>MT 286, \u00b6 53, 302 Mont. 189, \u00b6 53, 14 P.3d 444, \u00b6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>53, we articulated this principle, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">In analyzing the officer\u2019s entrance of the home, however, we restate[] the indelible rule that warrantless searches conducted inside a home are per se unreasonable, \u201csubject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>[State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 212, 951 P.2d 971, 978.] This Court has routinely stated that the physical invasion of the home is the chief evil to which the 4th Amendment and Montana\u2019s Article II, \u00a7 11, are directed. We have emphasized again and again that the entrance to the home is where the federal and Montana constitutions draw a firm line, and that absent an exception, that threshold may not be crossed without a warrant. See, e.g., <em>State v. Kao </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 277, 282-83, 697 P.2d 903, 907 (quoting <em>Payton v. New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639); <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 25, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 25, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 25.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><em>Therriault </em>at \u00b6 53. We recently reaffirmed this principle in <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, \u00b6 40, 321 Mont. 489, \u00b6 40, 92 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 40. \u00b621 In somewhat different language, we also stated this principle in <em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, \u00b6 25, 298 Mont. 15, \u00b6 25, 994 P.2d 683, \u00b6 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u2018At the risk of belaboring the obvious, private residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.\u2019 <em>State v. Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. 41, 48-49, 950 P.2d 722, 726. \u2018The fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is to protect the privacy and security of individuals and safeguard the sanctity of the home against arbitrary invasions by governmental <em>officials.\u2019Dorwart v. Caraway, </em>1998 MT 191, \u00b6 21, 290 Mont. 196, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 1121, \u00b6 21 [(overruled on other grounds)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b622 Although the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses more than the home, the home, nonetheless, is historically the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the constitutional protection. The people\u2019s protection against unreasonable search and seizure in their \u201chouses\u201d was drawn from the English common-law maxim \u201cA man\u2019s home is <em>his </em>castle.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Carter </em>(1998), 525 U.S. 83, 94 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). \u201c[E]very man\u2019s house is looked upon by the law to be his castle.\u201d 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 288 (1768). The home is the most sanctified of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cparticular places.\u201d If the State is to enter a person\u2019s home through the use of a search warrant, it must show probable cause that contraband or evidence will be found in the home. It is not sufficient to show that evidence may be found in an unattached outbuilding and thus, through \u201creasonable inference\u201d may also be found in the home itself. The United States Supreme Court has recognized this, albeit in dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALu\">When an official search is properly authorized - whether by consent or by the issuance of a valid warrant - the scope of the search is limited by the terms of the authorization. <em>Consent to search a garage would not implicitly authorize a search of an adjoining </em>house; a warrant to search for a stolen refrigerator would not authorize the opening of desk drawers. Because \u201cindiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the authority of \u2018general warrants\u2019 were the immediate evils that motivated the framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 575, 583, that Amendment requires that the scope of every authorized search be particularly described.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><em>Walter v. United States </em>(1980), 447 U.S. 649, 656-57 (emphasis added). If authorization to search a garage does not implicitly authorize a search of an adjoining house, it would surely not encompass an unattached house, which is the situation in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b623 Curiously, the Dissent complains that our decision here today means, \u201cthat from now on, in Montana, a home can no longer be the subject of a search warrant unless there is probable cause that relates <em>directly </em>to the home....\u201d <em>See Dissent, \u00b6 </em>31 (emphasis in original). Indeed. This is neither a new or disturbing holding-it has long been the case that, without probable cause, law enforcement officers may not search a person\u2019s home. Like it or not, that is the law under both the federal and Montana Constitutions. Under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution, people are explicitly guaranteed the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures in their houses and homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b624  As noted above, the mere portability of items commonly used in a methamphetamine laboratory does not justify the search of otherwise unimplicated structures. This is especially true when the unimplicated structure is a person\u2019s home. See <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 360, 362, 865 P.2d 263, 264 (probable cause to search one residence of defendant does not automatically grant sufficient probable cause to search a second residence owned by defendant). See also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>v. Meyer, </em>2004 MT 272, \u00b6 23, 323 Mont. 173, \u00b6 23, 99 P.3d 185, \u00b6 23 (probable cause to search residence exists where search warrant application avers that informant specifically observed delivery of contraband directly to suspect\u2019s residence). Were we to adopt the Dissent\u2019s position, any home near a structure rightly subject to a search warrant would be considered fair game, on the sole basis of its proximity and the possible portability of the contraband. Such an expansive interpretation would wholly negate the need to establish by application that it is probable to believe that the items to be discovered are located <em>in the home, as the particular place to be searched. </em>We decline to eviscerate the requirement that when a person\u2019s residence is to be searched, the application must demonstrate the probability that the items to be seized will be found within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b625 The warrant requirement is the mechanism implementing the constitutional protection against the \u201cchief evil\u201d of the government physically invading the privacy and sanctity of a person\u2019s home. It is the requirement which prevents precisely the sort of fishing expedition for evidence based on speculation and suspicion that the Dissent appears to find acceptable. Indeed, long ago we specifically condemned this practice. <em>State ex rel. Thibodeau v. District Court </em>(1924), 70 Mont. 202, 209, 224 P. 866, 869 (\u201cthe search and seizure statutes are not intended to permit fishing expeditions into the homes of citizens on the possibility that evidence of crime may be disclosed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b626 Moreover, this bedrock principle cannot be overcome by resorting solely to \u201ccommon sense,\u201d \u201cpractical considerations,\u201d and \u201cprobability.\u201d Facts stated in the application are also statutorily and constitutionally required before the magistrate is entitled to use these other intuitive approaches in making the totality of circumstances determination. <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 22, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 22, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 22; Section 46-5-221, MCA. Here, there were no facts included in the application for search warrant that implicated Graham\u2019s home. Common sense, practiced considerations and probabilities are not, therefore, enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b627  Rather, if the authorities had probable cause to search Graham\u2019s home, then they were required under well-settled principles of search and seizure law to include facts supporting that conclusion within the four comers of the search warrant application and to ensure that the home was particularly designated as a place to be searched in the warrant. See <em>State v. Meyer, </em>2004 MT 272, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 323 Mont. 173, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23, 99 P.3d 185, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23; Section 46-4-221, MCA; 4th Amend. U.S. Const.; Mont. Const. Article II, Section 11. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>search warrant application contained no information supporting probable cause to search any building but the garage located on the Graham property, we conclude the District Court erred in failing to suppress the evidence seized from Graham\u2019s house. It is therefore unnecessary to reach the remaining issues raised by Graham.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the District Court denying the Motions to suppress filed by Graham and Jarvis and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE. GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b145-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b629 I dissent. This decision will fragment our jurisprudence defining probable cause sufficient to support a search warrant. I would apply the same rules for issuing a search warrant for a residence as I would apply to one\u2019s person, one\u2019s medical records, one\u2019s automobile, and yes, to one\u2019s garage. I would also apply, contrary to what the Court does here, the totality of circumstances test, and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u00b630 Although I emphatically agree with the Court that probable cause to search a detached garage does not <em>automatically </em>translate into probable cause to search a person\u2019s residence on the same property, the warrant was proper as to both structures in this instance. A warrant may issue covering two separate structures based upon information regarding only one structure where, like here, there is a showing that the separate structures are related to each other or used in connection with each other in some material way. <em>See Steele v. United States </em>(1925), 267 U.S. 498, 503, 45 S.Ct. 414, 416, 69 L.Ed.2d 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b631 The Court states: \u201cthe mere portability of items commonly used in a methamphetamine laboratory does not justify the search of otherwise unimplicated structures.\u201d \u00b6 24. This statement blithely disregards the probability that methamphetamine itself would bp found where the defendant was. I also find particularly troublesome the Court\u2019s implication that from now on, in Montana, a home can no longer be the subject of a search warrant unless there is probable cause that relates <em>directly </em>to the home, no matter what the totality of circumstances, or common sense, indicate. These statements disregard our existing jurisprudence defining the permissible breadth of a search warrant, abrogate the common sense and totality of the circumstances approach to the breadth of search warrants, and make law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>enforcement\u2019s job infinitely more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b632 \u201cIn dealing with probable cause ... as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 210, 864 P.2d 1219, 1222-23; <em>State v. Kelly </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 417, 439, 668 P.2d 1032, 1044. We have long held that search warrant applicants need only establish the probability of criminal activity, not a prima facie showing of criminal activity. <em>State v. Crain </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 167, 169, 725 P.2d 209, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b633 A search will be upheld if \u201cthe nexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched rested not on direct observation ... but on the type of crime, the nature of the missing items, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide [the contraband].\u201d <em>State v. Pease </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 455, 465, 724 P.2d 153, 159 <em>quoting United States v. Spearman </em>(9th Cir. 1976), 532 F.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b634 In <em>Pease, </em>the defendant attempted to suppress evidence seized from his home and his vehicle arguing that probable cause did not exist to search those locations. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont, at 464-65, 724 P.2d at 159. Law enforcement had found the body of a homicide victim outside defendant\u2019s workplace and evidence indicating that the location of the crime was defendant\u2019s workplace. Officers were seeking additional evidence including: the murder weapon, possible souvenirs taken by the perpetrator, and personal effects of the victim - items likely to be kept at the residence of the person or persons involved. In addition, law enforcement was seeking a number of other items related to the crime, individually innocuous, that were likely to be present in a vehicle or residence. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 466, 724 P.2d at 159-60. In <em>Pease, </em>although the evidence indicated that the crime was committed in the defendant\u2019s workplace, because of the nature of the crime we held that probable cause existed to believe evidence would also be present in the defendant\u2019s vehicle and his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b635 Similarly, the affidavit in this case indicated that the manufacture of methamphetamine was taking place in the garage located next to the house. This should not preclude a finding of probable cause that evidence of the criminal activity would also be found in the defendant\u2019s residence. Although the informant\u2019s observations indicated the manufacturing was in the garage, the affidavit also stated that the informant had observed the transfer of methamphetamine from Graham\u2019s garage to the informant\u2019s vehicle. The informant reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>taking a person named John to the <em>residence, </em>and that John cooks methamphetamine for Graham. Further, the informant reported that when he picks John up from the residence, the informant would sometimes get methamphetamine from him. This, under our law, constitutes a sale. Section 45-9-101, MCA. The informant also told law enforcement that yet another person, Chris, taught Graham how to \u201ccook methamphetamine\u201d and would \u201cget methamphetamines [sic] from [Graham].\u201d Chris, the informant told the police, cooks methamphetamine for different people and also shows them how to cook. The officer seeking the warrant reported that based on his experience \u201cdrug traffickers/manufactures often have other people transport precursors or other items on a regular basis to keep the process on-going and to divert attention from themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b636 Based upon this evidence of distribution, as well as the officer\u2019s knowledge and experience, a logical nexus existed between the manufacturing site and the residence next to it, where the defendant lived. An issuing magistrate, using a common sense approach, and considering the totality of the circumstances, could easily find that the facts lead to a natural inference that contraband would likely be found in the house especially considering the items sought by law enforcement. <em>See Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 465, 724 P.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b637 We, like other courts, have recognized that drug trade is a very mobile and portable criminal undertaking. <em>See State v. Byers, </em>2003 MT 83, \u00b6 8, 315 Mont. 89, \u00b6 8, 67 P.3d 880, \u00b6 8 (portable methamphetamine lab found in duffle bag); <em>State v. Galpin, </em>2003 MT 324, 318 Mont. 318, 80 P.3d 1207 (officer\u2019s knowledge that chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine are easily mobile, highly toxic, and even explosive justified precautionary search of defendant\u2019s duffle bag incident to arrest); <em>State v. Miles </em>(Kan. 1983), 662 P.2d 1227, 1237 (recognizing \u201c[a]s modern American society becomes increasingly mobile, drugs clandestinely manufactured ... are easily transported\u201d); <em>People v. Smith </em>(Ct. App. 1980), 166 Cal.Rptr. 778, 785 (Zenovich, J., dissenting) (discussing issue of staleness in regards to drugs which are easily transportable, consumed, or hidden).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b638 Law enforcement is also familiar with methamphetamine manufacturers\u2019 efforts to avoid detection, including the production of the drug in a piecemeal fashion. <em>People v. Hard </em>(Ct. App. 2003), 5 Cal.Rptr.3d 107, 112 (\u201c[t]he production of methamphetamine is an incremental, not instantaneous process, often conducted in a piecemeal fashion to avoid detection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b639 This knowledge and common sense strengthen the likelihood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>evidence of drag manufacturing would be found in the manufacturer\u2019s home as well as his garage. The officer seeking the warrant stated that based on his experience as a Peace Officer in Montana for 22 years, 16 of which he was specifically assigned to investigate and enforce the Dangerous Drug Laws of Montana, manufacturers commonly use illicit drags themselves and therefore are likely to keep instruments of inhalation or other preferred use apparatus around.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b640 Here, the Court requires more than this probability of criminal activity in the home, and seemingly imposes a direct observation standard for probable cause to attach to the home. <em>Contra State v. Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 465, 724 P.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b641 I do not harbor the opinion that there should be any type of \u201cmeth lab exception\u201d to the constitution and the statutes. I am of the opinion that, in determining whether there is sufficient probable cause to search a residence, the totality of circumstances should be considered, which includes the use and nature of the items sought, as well as the nexus between separate structures. And, I also think that common sense should not be thrown out the garage window.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b642 I would conclude the District Court\u2019s decision, that the magistrate made a practical, common sense determination there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the residence, is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b643 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-8\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
