We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-25\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in ordering Eaton to pay restitution as part of her suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">\u00b63 On June 13, 2002, the State charged Eaton with forgery, by use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of a common scheme, a felony. On April 2, 2003, Eaton pled guilty to felony forgery in violation of \u00a7 45-6-325, MCA (1999). On May 12,2003, the District Court sentenced Eaton to the Department of Corrections for 10 years with 8 years suspended. As a condition of her suspended sentence, Eaton was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $4,205.66, plus fees in the amount of $470, in monthly installments of $100 starting sixty days from her release from custody. Eaton appeals the order that she pay restitution as a condition of her suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b64 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for legality only (whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). State <em>v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b65 Eaton contends the District Court was without statutory authority to impose restitution as a condition of her suspended sentence under the 1999 amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA. Relying on a footnote in <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, \u00b6 28 n.3, 305 Mont. 242, \u00b6 28 n.3, 25 P.3d 886, \u00b6 28 n.3, <em>abrogated on other grounds by Eaton, </em>\u00b6 11, she argues after October 1, 1999, the effective date of the 1999 statutory amendments, a district court could only require restitution in cases in which it imposed a deferred sentence and thus a court could not require restitution in cases in which it imposed a suspended sentence. In this case Eaton was ineligible to receive a deferred sentence since she had previous felony convictions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-20l(l)(b), MCA. Thus, the District Court suspended a portion of Eaton\u2019s sentence and imposed a condition that she pay restitution. Eaton now urges this Court to reverse the District Court and vacate the judgment as it applies to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b66  Eaton raises the same issue this Court recently addressed in <em>Eaton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17, and <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, 321 Mont. 280, 90 P.3d 426. In <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 16, we held an error was made in codifying the 1999 legislative amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, \u201cwhich was not intended to make any change in the substance or effect [of \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1997)],\u201d requiring restitution when the district court imposed either a deferred or suspended sentence. The result is the same in this case as in Heath; the District Court did not exceed its statutory authority in ordering Eaton to pay restitution as a condition of her suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b67 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
