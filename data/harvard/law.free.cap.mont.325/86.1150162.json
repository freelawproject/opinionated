Malloy was sentenced to 5 years at Montana State Prison, with 2 years suspended. He appeals several conditions of the suspended portion of his sentence. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings. Additional facts are included as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in imposing certain conditions upon Malloy\u2019s suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">\u00b64 Malloy is required to register as a sexual offender as a result of a 1992 Sexual Assault conviction. Malloy discharged his Sexual Assault sentence in 1997, and properly registered with the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Office on November 14, 1997, and later registered a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of address. Then on August 20, 2002, the Sheriffs Office received an anonymous call alleging Malloy had moved from his residence. An investigation determined Malloy had moved from his registered address on August 6, 2002, without reporting his new address in violation of \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b65 On September 4, 2002, Malloy was charged with Failure to Register as a Sexual Offender, a felony. On November 27, 2002, he pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement. On May 23, 2003, Malloy appeared before the District Court for disposition on a probation violation in a different case and also for sentencing in the present case. At the sentencing hearing, Malloy objected to many, but not all, of the proposed conditions of the suspended portion of his sentence. The District Court included many of the probation conditions to which Malloy had objected. The sentence was reduced to writing and filed in the District Court on June 5, 2003. The written judgment included several conditions of probation not orally imposed at the sentencing hearing. Malloy timely appealed the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b66 This court reviews a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for legality only (whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in imposing certain conditions upon Malloy\u2019s suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">\u00b68 Under \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA, numerous conditions may be imposed on a suspended sentence, including, \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d Section 46-18-201(4)(n), MCA. This Court has held, for a restriction or condition to be \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society,\u201d a sentencing limitation or condition must have some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. The \u201crehabilitation and protection of the victim and society\u201d requirement must be read in the context of the charged offense. Further, to be legitimate, the conditions must be both for the purpose of rehabilitating the offender by imposing restitution or requiring treatment to reduce recidivism, and designed to protect society from further similar conduct. <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b69 Malloy challenges conditions on his suspended sentence numbered 3, 5, 6 and 33, related to restrictions on the use of drugs and alcohol and a prohibition on gambling, on the grounds they are not reasonably related to his offense. The State concedes that these conditions are not related to the offense Malloy was convicted of and that they should be deleted from the judgment. Therefore, these conditions shall be vacated on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b610 Malloy further challenges the imposition of conditions 11 and 15, prohibiting Malloy from associating with felons or probationers; conditions 24-28 and 34, prohibiting Malloy from coming into contact with persons under the age of 18; and conditions 29-31 and 35-36, restricting Malloy from having access to or possession of pornographic or other materials that would tend to \u201carouse deviant thoughts or fantasies,\u201d on the grounds they are not reasonably related to the offense of registering as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b611 As to conditions 11 and 15, at sentencing Malloy led the trial court to believe that he agreed with those conditions. On appeal he changes his theory - that there is no nexus between these conditions and his offense. The rule is well established that a party may not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 39, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 39, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 39. Moreover, it is a well-established maxim of law that \u201cacquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it.\u201d Section 1-3-207, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b612 With respect to the remaining conditions, Malloy argues the purpose of the law regarding registration of sexual offenders is to give people in the state notice of where sexual offenders are residing and the conditions imposed go far beyond that requirement. Malloy further argues such conditions are not related to the offense of Failure to Register, which is merely a \u201cstatus offense.\u201d Thus, Malloy argues the conditions are contrary to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ommundson. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\u00b613 In <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 99, 317 Mont. 481, \u00b6 99, 78 P.3d 829, \u00b6 99, this Court concluded the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act, \u00a7 46-23-501 to 520, MCA, under which Malloy was sentenced, \u201cwas adopted to protect the public from the recidivism of sex offenders; to prevent victimization of vulnerable children; and to assist law enforcement in keeping track of the whereabouts of sex offenders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b614  Our review of the record shows Malloy has been convicted of two prior sexual offenses in addition to Failure to Register. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Additionally, Malloy has failed to complete two different sexual offender programs. In fact, he has never completed sexual offender treatment either while incarcerated or under supervision of probation and parole. Malloy\u2019s history demonstrates his inability to conform his conduct to the demands of this State\u2019s sexual offender laws. As such, Malloy exhibits behavior which places society in danger because of his recidivism. The probation conditions were included in his suspended sentence so that he must avoid situations which could reasonably be expected to lead to further offenses, given his history as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b6 15  With regard to the conditions prohibiting Malloy\u2019s contact with persons under the age of 18, conditions 24-28 and 34, there can be no question they are reasonably related to the purpose of protecting society, including children, from Malloy\u2019s predilection toward sex offenses. Likewise, we determine that conditions 29-31 and 35-36, prohibiting Malloy\u2019s access to and possession of pornographic materials are reasonably related to the goal of protecting society from Malloy as a sexual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b616 The District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of Malloy\u2019s sentence governs over the inconsistent terms contained in the written judgment. <em>State v. </em>Lane, 1998 MT 76, \u00b6 40, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 40, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 40; <em>see also State v. Waters, </em>1999 MT 229, 296 Mont. 101, 987 P.2d 1142. This Court has further held, nothing in the 2001 legislative amendments to \u00a7 46-18-116, MCA, \u201csupercedes or modifies this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lane, </em>which established the oral pronouncement of sentence as the legally effective and valid final judgment .... The oral pronouncement of sentence continues to control in situations in which a conflict exists between the oral and written judgments.\u201d <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 18, 322 Mont. 294, \u00b6 18, 95 P.3d 717, \u00b6 18. While it would seem to have been much quicker and easier for Malloy to challenge the written judgment by requesting the District Court for modification under \u00a7 46-18-116(2), MCA, this Court has jurisdiction and may review a sentence on a direct and timely appeal. <em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6 19. \u00b617 Nevertheless, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 290, 302 Mont. 265, 14 P.3d 480, we refined our previous holdings in <em>Lane </em>and <em>Waters, </em>and established a two-part test for determining whether a written judgment that does not conform to the oral pronouncement of sentence is lawful. That test requires we determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">(1) whether the defendant was afforded the opportunity to respond to its inclusion upon sufficient notice at sentencing, and (2) whether that portion of the written judgment substantively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>increases the defendant\u2019s loss of liberty or the defendant\u2019s sacrifice of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 24. In <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Kroll, </em>this Court determined conditions almost identical to conditions 10,12 and 23 in the present case were \u201cstock\u201d conditions for which there was no evidence in the record that they \u201csubstantively increased the defendant\u2019s loss of liberty or sacrifice of property imposed under the oral sentence,\u201d thus, imposition of such conditions in the written judgment was lawful. <em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b618 Such is not the case here. In its oral pronouncement of judgment, the District Court did not impose conditions 10 and 23, requiring Malloy to maintain full-time employment, because Malloy is on full Social Security disability. Likewise, the District Court did not impose condition 12, requiring Malloy not to have contact with the victims of his current offense, because Failure to Register is a \u201cvictimless\u201d crime. Under the present circumstances, we cannot say imposition of these conditions in the written judgment would not substantively increase Malloy\u2019s loss of liberty or his sacrifice of property. Accordingly, conditions 10, 12 and 23 must be vacated on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\u00b619 We remand this matter to the District Court for entry of an amended judgment deleting conditions 3, 5, 6,10,12,23 and 33 of the written judgment entered June 5, 2003. The remainder of said judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
