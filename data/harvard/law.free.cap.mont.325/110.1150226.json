The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-20\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b555-8\">DATED this 3rd day of December, 2004.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive, by comparing the sentence with other sentences of related crimes and criminal histories in the state of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence be modified to ten (10) years in the Montana State Prison, with five (5) years suspended. The conditions set forth in the sentencing order shall be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Done in open Court this 18th day of November, 2004.</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-9\">Alt. Chairperson, Hon.
