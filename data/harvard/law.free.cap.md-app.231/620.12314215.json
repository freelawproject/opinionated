In this appeal, we address a challenge by the Appellants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Frederick County Board of County Commissioners\u2019 (\u201cBOCC\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> approval of a Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement (\u201cDRRA\u201d). The Appellants present three issues for review on appeal, which we have reordered and rephrased slightly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>1. Whether the DRRA violates \u00a7 7-304 of the Land Use Article of the Maryland Code, Md. Code (2012, 2014 Repl. Vol).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">2. Whether the DRRA lawfully contains a provision providing that the DRRA constitutes a covenant running with the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">3. Whether the DRRA is void because it lacks any \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d and/or consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">For the reasons explained herein, we shall hold that the DRRA is void for lack of enhanced public benefits and reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">This is an administrative appeal from an opinion and order of the Circuit Court for Frederick County affirming two separate actions of the BOCC, a rezoning action and the DRRA approval. Although the Appellants raised issues with respect to both actions before the circuit court, on appeal to this Court, the Appellants have raised issues only with respect to the DRRA approval. Nonetheless, we set forth certain facts and proceedings relevant to both issues in order to provide context.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">This case involves two parcels of land (\u201cthe Property\u201d) owned by the Blentlinger family. The Blentlinger family farmed the Property for multiple generations before deciding to explore development opportunities. Until 2007, the Property had a Low Density Residential (\u201cLDR\u201d) land use designation, pursuant to which a property owner is permitted to apply for a Planned Unit Development (\u201cPUD\u201d). In 2007, the BOCC reclassified the Property and removed the LDR designation, rendering the Property ineligible for PUD designation. In 2012, however, the BOCC again reclassified the Property (as well as multiple other properties in the Lake Linganore area) as LDR. The 2012 rezoning action was challenged before the circuit court in this case and was unsuccessfully challenged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>various other appeals before this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 2012 rezoning action is not an issue in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">After the Property was rezoned as LDR, Lillian C. Blent-linger, LLC and William L. Blentlinger, LLC (\u201cthe Blentling-ers\u201d), appellees, filed a PUD zone application for the Property on February 25, 2014. The Blentlingers filed a DRRA petition on March 11, 2014, which included a draft DRRA. The BOCC accepted the DRRA petition on April 15, 2014. After two public hearings before the Frederick County Planning Commission and one public hearing before the BOCC, the BOCC voted to approve the PUD rezoning application and the proposed DRRA, The PUD rezoning application was approved with conditions that limited the total unit count to 675 residential dwelling units, consisting of 500 single-family units and 175 townhomes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An additional condition required that the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>building permit for the construction of a residence not be issued before January 1, 2020. The BOCC enacted the PUD rezoning ordinance and executed the final DRRA on November 24, 2014. The final DRRA (\u201cthe Blentlinger-County DRRA\u201d) was recorded in the Land Records of Frederick County on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The Appellants filed a petition for judicial review of both the PUD and DRRA actions in the Circuit Court for Frederick County. The circuit court upheld both actions. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In general, although we generally defer to the factual findings of an administrative agency, \u201c[w]e review an agency\u2019s decisions as to matters of law <em>de novo </em>for correctness.\u201d <em>Wallace H. Campbell &amp; Co. v. Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>202 Md.App. 650, 663, 33 A.3d 1042 (2011). However, \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Grasslands Plantation, Inc. v. Frizz-King Enterprises, LLC, </em>410 Md. 191, 204, 978 A.2d 622 (2009) (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">A DRRA is \u201can agreement between a local governing body and a person having a legal or equitable interest in real property to establish conditions under which development may proceed for a specified time.\u201d Md. Code (2012, 2014 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-301(b) of the Land Use Article (\u201cLU\u201d). DRRAs are attempts to balance \u201cdevelopers\u2019 and property owners\u2019 desires for a larger measure of certainty than that offered by proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>ing to market through the traditional development processes, while risking the monetary investment to develop their property, against local governments\u2019 desire to receive greater public benefits on a more predictable schedule than might otherwise be attainable through the traditional processes.\u201d <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, Inc. v. Cty. Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s Cty., </em>382 Md. 306, 308-09, 855 A.2d 325 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">One feature of a DRRA is that certain local laws, rules, regulations, and policies are \u201cfrozen\u201d at the time the DRRA is executed. This \u201cfreeze provision\u201d permits developers to move forward with long-term development projects with certainty. The \u201cfreeze provision\u201d is set forth in LU \u00a7 7-304, which provides:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement shall be the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies in force at the time the parties execute the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">(b) If the local jurisdiction determines that compliance with local laws, rules, regulations, and policies enacted or adopted after the effective date of an agreement is essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare, an agreement may not prevent a local government from requiring a person to comply with those local laws, rules, regulations, and policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The Appellants argue that the Blentlinger-County DRRA is invalid because it violates LU \u00a7 7-304 by purporting to \u201cfreeze\u201d certain local laws, rules, regulations, and policies beyond those specifically identified in LU \u00a7 7-304. Specifically, Section 8.1 of the Blentlinger-County DRRA provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\n<em>8.1 Effect of Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>A. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the Property, including but not limited to those governing development, subdivision, growth management, impact fee laws, water, sewer, stormwater management, environmental protection, land planning and design, and adequate public facilities (hereinafter collectively the \u201cDevelopment Laws\u201d) shall be the laws, rules, regulations and policies, if any, in force on the Effective Date of the Agreement, and the Developer shall comply with all Development Laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Before turning to the merits of this issue, we comment briefly on whether this issue is ripe for our review. \u201cA controversy is justiciable when there are interested parties asserting adverse claims upon a state of facts which must have accrued wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded.\u201d <em>Michael, LLC v. 8204, </em>Assocs. <em>Liab. Co., </em>207 Md.App. 666, 672, 53 A.3d 509 (2012) (quoting 1 W. Anderson, <em>Actions for Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7 17 (2d ed. 1951)). We recently found a nearly identical issue regarding the scope of a DRRA freeze provision ripe for review and addressed the merits. <em>Cleanwater Linganore, Inc., et al. v. Frederick County, Maryland, et al., </em>231 Md.App. 373, 151 A.3d 44 (Ct. of Spec. App. 2016) <em>(\u201cCasey\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In our view, this case presents \u201can accrued set of facts, beyond the merely theoretical, that bears directly on the justiciable question[s]\u201d of whether the Blentlinger-County DRRA properly froze a wide range of laws, whether the Blentlinger-County DRRA lawfully contains a provision providing that it runs with the land, and whether the Blentlinger-County DRRA is supported by adequate consideration and/or enhanced public benefit pursuant to the DRRA Act. <em>See id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>281 Md.App. at 385-86, 151 A.3d 44. At oral argument, neither party disputed this issue is ripe for our consideration. Further, the parties agreed at oral argument that the issues in this appeal are ripe for our consideration. Of course, the parties, by agreement, may not confer jurisdiction on a court where none exists; however, we conclude for other reasons expressed above that the questions presented here are ripe for appellate review. As such, we will address the merits in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We now turn to the merits of the DRRA freeze provision issue and consider whether \u00a7 8.1 of the Blentlinger-County DRRA contains an impermissibly broad range of laws. This Court recently addressed this issue at length in <em>Casey, </em>supra. All of the laws, regulations, and policies listed in \u00a7 8.1 of the Blentinger-County DRRA were also included in the <em>Casey </em>DRRA, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">Except as otherwise provided ... the County Development Laws, regulations!],] and policies governing the use, density!],] or intensity of the Property, including but not limited to those governing development, subdivision, zoning, comprehensive planning, moderately priced dwelling units, growth management, impact fees, water, sewer, stormwater management, environmental protection, land planning and design, adequate public facilities laws[,] and architecture shall be the laws, rules, regulations!],] and policies, if any, in force on the Effective Date of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\"><em>Casey </em>DRRA \u00a7 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In <em>Casey, </em>we concluded that \u201cthe intended scope of \u2018the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies\u2019 that \u2018govem[ ] the use, density, or intensity\u2019 of real property\u201d was \u201cambiguous on its face.\u201d 231 Md.App. at 387-88, 151 A.3d 44. Accordingly, we engaged in an exhaustive review of the legislative history of the DRRA Act. We explained that the Fiscal Note for HB 700, the original bill that became the DRRA Act in 1995, as well as the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee Floor Report, \u201cdemonstrate that the General Assembly was aware of, and contemplated presumably, the DRRA Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>freeze provision to embrace more than merely zoning ordinances, including something as seemingly attenuated as a variety of fees related to development.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 390, 151 A.3d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Having established that the legislature intended the DRRA freeze provision to apply to a wider range of laws than merely zoning laws, we turned to the specific ordinances and regulations referenced in the <em>Casey </em>DRRA \u00a7 8.1. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">It is patent that local zoning ordinances govern most directly the \u201cuse, intensity, or density\u201d of real property. Subdivision ordinances and regulations, as well as many environmental and public facility or utilities laws (enforced typically during the subdivision process) are to like effect. Costs and fees associated with public facilities impacts, permits, and water and sewer hookups, on the other hand, seem at first glance rather more attenuated from direct governance of a property\u2019s \u201cuse, intensity, or density.\u201d And yet, the DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s contemplated inclusion of them as well as among reachable local laws for purposes of LU \u00a7 7-304(a). Viewing relevant local provisions on a continuum from the most direct governance to the least contemplated by the freeze provision, zoning and subdivision would be located at one end and fees at the other. Assuming these outer limits for purposes of the DRRA in the present case, the freeze provision must contemplate, axiomatically, local laws, rules, regulations, and policies that might fit between these poles. Local provisions related to development, comprehensive planning, moderately-priced dwelling units, growth management, environmental protection, land planning and design, adequate public facilities laws, and architecture govern more clearly \u201cuse, intensity, or density\u201d than do, for example, impact and permit fees. We conclude, therefore, that the Maryland General Assembly intended the DRRA Act\u2019s freeze provision to contemplate each of the genres of local laws listed in Article VIII \u00a7 8.1(B) of the Casey-County DRRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Id., </em>231 Md.App. at 390-91, 151 A.3d 44. Because all of the laws, regulations, and policies listed in \u00a7 8.1 of Blentlinger-County DRRA were also included in the <em>Casey </em>DRRA, the same reasoning applies to the present appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that the General Assembly intended the DRRA freeze provision to include each of the genres of local laws listed in \u00a7 8.1 of the Blentlinger-County DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In <em>Casey, </em>we found further support for a broad reading of the DRRA Act freeze provision by examining the purpose behind the DRRA Act. <em>See id., </em>231 Md.App. at 391-93, 151 A.3d 44. We discussed the legislative purpose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">In its 1995 analysis of H.B. 700, the House Commerce and Government Committee explained that State DRRA laws seek to \u201csolve the vesting problem\u201d by \u201c(1) prohibiting local governments from applying new regulations to on-going projects by defining when vesting occurs, and (2) authorizing the use of development agreements.\u201d H. Commerce and Gov\u2019t Comm., Bill Analysis, H.B. 700, at 3 (Md. 1995).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The \u201cvesting problem\u201d refers to the balancing of a developer\u2019s interest in securing and consolidating its legal footing to begin and complete a development project with a local jurisdiction\u2019s interest in governing the pertinent legal domains, including amending laws and policies as necessary. In 1993, the Court of Appeals held that a developer\u2019s rights in the development of a property vest only upon a level of visible commencement of lawful construction. <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., Md. v. Sunrise Dev. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>330 Md. 297, 623 A.2d 1296 (1993). This opinion recognized that local governments may \u201cchange a permissible land use ... very late in the land use approval process. In fact, a change could occur after the issuance of a building permit.\u201d Bill Analysis at 3. The purpose of the DRRA Act, therefore, was to strike a balance between the interests of developers and local governments to \u201csolve the vesting problem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The House Commerce and Government Committee explained such a balance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">Development agreements can provide benefits for both developers and local governments. For the developer, a development agreement establishes the rules and regulations which will govern the project throughout its construction, and perhaps beyond. For the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">Bill Analysis at 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">What would achieve best the legislative purpose of balancing a developer\u2019s interest in legal stability against a local government\u2019s interest in certainty and obtaining enhanced public benefits: limiting, for example, the Casey DRRA\u2019s freeze provision to subsequent changes in the zoning code only, as urged by CLI, or allowing it to apply to the expansive list of local provisions in the negotiated DRRA as written? If the DRRA Act only allowed DRRAs to freeze the application of local zoning ordinance provisions, a local government could undermine still the legal and financial stability of an on-going development project by changing the laws related to, for example, development or site plans, subdivision, or planning compliance. Where a developer assumed that its project could be thwarted by a last-minute or mid-stream change to any of these non-zoning laws, it would be less likely to undertake a substantial development at all in a jurisdiction. This, in turn, would frustrate the local government\u2019s interest in obtaining greater public benefits through negotiation of a DRRA\u2019s terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\"><em>Id., </em>231 Md.App. at 391-93, 151 A.3d 44. The reasoning applied in <em>Casey </em>compels the same conclusion in this case. As in <em>Casey, </em>\u201c[w]e conclude that, like its statutory history, the purpose of the DRRA Act suggests a more expansive reading of the local laws eligible for inclusion in a DRRA\u2019s freeze provision, beyond merely the local zoning ordinance, that includes at least the local law provisions listed in the\u201d Blent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>linger-County DRRA. <em>Id., </em>231 Md.App. at 392-93, 151 A.3d 44. We, therefore, hold that the BOCC\u2019s approval of the Blentlinger-County DRRA, including the freeze provision set forth in \u00a7 8,1, does not impermissibly expand the scope of local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing use, density, or intensity beyond the limits of LU \u00a7 7-304.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A2D\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-1\">We next consider the Appellants argument that the DRRA impermissibly included a provision providing that the DRRA constitutes a covenant running with the land. The Appellants maintain that Maryland DRRA law does not authorize a DRRA to be converted into a real property interest. The Blentlingers respond that Maryland and Frederick County law require a DRRA to be recorded and thus to run with the land and that the language of the DRRA merely confirms what is already required under Maryland and Frederick County law. We agree with the Blentlingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-2\">First, we observe that Maryland law requires that all DRRAs be recorded in the land records of the local jurisdiction. LU \u00a7 7\u2014305(d). With respect to the recordation requirement, LU \u00a7 7-305(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-3\">(1) If [a DRRA] is not recorded in the land records of the local jurisdiction within 20 days after the date on which the parties execute the [DRRA], the [DRRA] is void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">(2) The parties to [a DRRA] and their successors in interest are bound to the agreement after the agreement is recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-5\"><em>Id, </em>The statute plainly provides that a properly recorded DRRA binds not only the parties to the DRRA, but any successors in interest as well. <em>Id, </em>Section 1-25-10 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Frederick County Code of Ordinances contains language identical to that in LU \u00a7 7-305(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Article IV of the Blentlinger DRRA provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">This Agreement shall constitute covenants running with the land and shall bind the Property so long as the Project is under development, provided that this Agreement shall terminate and be void twenty-five (25) years after the Effective Date of this Agreement unless extended by an amendment complying with all procedures required in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In our view, the language of the Blentlinger DRRA simply confirms what is required by law. Furthermore, the Blentlinger DRRA satisfies the test set forth by the Court of Appeals for covenants running with the land. In <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>808 Md. 627, 632, 521 A.2d 734 (1987), the Court of Appeals explained that four elements must be satisfied for a covenant to run with the land:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">(1) the covenant must touch and concern the land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">(2) the original covenanting parties must intend the covenant to run with the land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">(3) there be some privity of estate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">(4) the covenant must be in writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">The first element, that the covenant must touch and concern the land, is easily satisfied because the entirety of the DRRA concerns the development of the Property. The second element is similarly easily satisfied. The original covenanting parties\u2014the County and the Blentingers\u2014clearly and unam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>biguously expressed in Article IV of the Blentlinger DRRA that they intended the DRRA to run with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We additionally agree with the circuit court that the third element, requiring privity of estate, is satisfied. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Privity of estate can be satisfied by proof of vertical privity, which focuses ... on the devolutional relationships. For vertical privity to be satisfied, it only is necessary that the person presently claiming the benefit, or being subjected to the burden, is a successor to the estate of the original person so benefitted or burdened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"><em>Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. v. Saddlebrook W. Util. Co., LLC, </em>229 Md.App. 241, 270, 145 A.3d 19 (2016), cert. granted, 450 Md. 663, 150 A.3d 818 (2016) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In this case, the original parties continue to hold interests in the Property. As the circuit court explained, and we agree, the Blentlingers \u201chave a continuing interest in the Property as the owner, and the County government has continuing interest as the regulator of the development of the Property.\u201d Finally, the fourth element, requiring the covenant to be in writing, is satisfied because the DRRA is a written document.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The Appellants cite no authority in support of their position that a DRRA cannot include a provision specifying that the DRRA is a covenant running with the land.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold that because the DRRA satisfies the test set forth in <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co., supra, </em>the DRRA is a covenant running with the land. The language of the DRRA confirms that which is already required under Maryland law. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ingly, we reject Appellants\u2019 covenant running with the land argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Appellants\u2019 third contention is that the DRRA is void for lack of consideration because it lacks any \u201cenhanced public benefits\u201d to the County. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The local governing body of a local jurisdiction, such as Frederick County, is authorized to establish proceedings and requirements for the consideration and execution of DRRAs. LU \u00a7 7-301(b). Frederick County\u2019s DRRA regulations mirror those regulations embodied in the Land Use Article. Those regulations are set forth in Chapter 1-25 of the Frederick County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">We recently noted that \u201cDRRAs generally are bargained-for agreements between property owners/developers and local jurisdictions that, among other things, provide for \u2018freezing,\u2019 as of the date of the agreement, the application of certain extant local laws and regulations during a fixed period of time coinciding typically with the estimated build-out of the proposed development, as long as the period does not exceed the statutory \u2018cap.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Casey, </em>supra, 231 Md.App. at 379-80, 151 A.3d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">By agreeing to enter into a DRRA in Maryland, a local government grants rights to a property owner and insulates those rights from legal changes for a minimum of five years. The consideration provided to a local government by a property owner under a DRRA is not constrained by the constitutional limitations of \u201cnexus\u201d and \u201crough proportionality.\u201d <em>See Dolan v. City of Tigard, </em>512 U.S. 374, 391, 114 S.Ct. 2309, 129 L.Ed.2d 304 (1994); <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, </em>483 U.S. 825, 837, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>(1987). The voluntary nature of a DRRA allows a local government to negotiate public infrastructure improvements or other public benefit features beyond those that it may otherwise attain.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In <em>Casey, </em>we reviewed the purpose of DRRAs and observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\">Obtaining forbearance of the application of subsequent changes in relevant local laws provide certainty and stability to developers, whose projects may take many years to complete and/or sell-off or lease. Local government derive, in return, negotiated greater public benefits than may be attained through typical governmental exactions or conditions of development approvals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">231 Md.App. at 380, 151 A.3d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Every DRRA is required to include \u201ca description of the conditions, terms, restrictions, or other requirements determined by the local jurisdiction to be necessary to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare.\u201d LU \u00a7 7\u2014303(c)(9). Section 7-303(e)(10) further requires that a DRRA shall include \u201cto the extent applicable, provisions for the: (i) dedication of a portion of the real property for public use; (ii) protection of sensitive areas; (iii) preservation and restoration of historic structures; and (iv) construction or financing of public facilities.\u201d The Appellants maintain that the purpose of these provisions in the Land Use Article is to require the local governing body to specifically identify the enhanced public benefits that the locality expects to receive in exchange for entering into a DRRA. Frederick County and the Blentlingers contend that they need not identify any \u201cenhanced benefit\u201d and that they only need to demonstrate that the DRRA is supported by adequate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">In our view, this involves an issue of contract law. As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Queen Anne\u2019s Conservation, Inc., supra, </em>382 Md. at 332, 855 A.2d 325, a DRRA \u201cis a contract whose purpose is to vest rights under zoning laws and regulations, in consideration of enhanced public benefits.\u201d Further, the legislative history of House Bill 700, titled \u201cReal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Property\u2014Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreements\u201d\u2014which ultimately became the DRRA Act in 1995\u2014 addresses the purpose of DRRAs as providing benefits to both developers and local governments. The House Commerce and Government Committee Bill Analysis and the Senate Economic Affairs Committee Bill Analysis provides the following background regarding the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">Development agreements can provide benefits for both developers and local governments. For the developer, a development agreement establishes the rules and regulations which will govern the project throughout its construction, and perhaps beyond. For the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In the instant case, the Blentlinger-County DRRA contained multiple binding promises which the Blentlingers and the County contend constitute consideration under Maryland law. Sections 3.1 through 3.3 of the DRRA include promises by the developer to abide by Frederick County\u2019s Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance with respect to road, sewer, and water improvements. The DRRA provides that the Blentlingers agreed to \u201ceither construct or fund the construction of certain road improvements or contribute to escrow funds for roads improvements, all as will be comprehensively set forth in an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance Letter of Understanding.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3.1 of the DRRA, entitled \u201cRoad Improvements.\u201d With respect to water and sewer improvements, the Blentlingers agreed to \u201cpay tap fees in accordance with the current fee schedule in effect at the time of permit application.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3.2 and 3,3 of the DRRA, entitled \u201cSewer Improvements\u201d and \u201cWater Improvements.\u201d The Blentlingers further agreed to pay the applicable school construction and impact fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3.4 and 3.6 of the DRRA, entitled \u201cSchool Construction Fee\u201d and \u201cSchool Impact Fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In our view, these provisions of the DRRA do not reflect enhanced obligations of the developer. Rather, they reflect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>obligations the developer would otherwise be required to satisfy during the course of the development of the property if no DRRA were in place. Indeed, the benefits relied upon by the developer (specifically those relating to road, sewer, water improvements, and tap fees) are required of the developer under the County\u2019s Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The disagreement between the parties surrounds a provision in the DRRA <em>mb judice </em>that contains what may appear to be a promise by the developer to convey to the Frederick County Board of Education a parcel for a public school that arguably serves as an enhanced public benefit to Frederick County and its citizens. Section 3.4.C of the Blent-linger-County DRRA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">The Developer shall convey in fee simple to the Frederick County Board of Education (\u201cBOE\u201d), with no monetary consideration paid, the Public School Site shown on Exhibit 6, totaling a minimum of 24.5 \u00b1 buildable acres, to the BOE [Board of Education] upon i) its reconsideration of the first subdivision plan for lots in the Project; and ii) BOE\u2019s acceptance of the conveyance of land for Public School Site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The circuit court expressly relied on the developer\u2019s agreement to dedicate a site for construction of a middle school in holding the DRRA in this case was supported by adequate consideration. The Appellants maintain that the circuit court erred because the dedication of the school site was not required as a condition of conferring DRRA approval to the developer. Instead, they argue that such a dedication is a standard rezoning requirement in any large Frederick County zoning project.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The Appellants further maintain that the school site must be given to obtain rezoning of the property rather than as an enhanced public benefit in exchange for a DRRA. Indeed, at the Board of County Commissioners\u2019 meeting on November 6, 2014, Jim Gugel, Planning Director of the Frederick County Government Division of Community Development, testified that the Developer would have been required to proffer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>site to build a middle school for the County even without a DRRA. The record reflects the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Would this property owner be required to proffer the\u2014the middle school site whether or not there is a DRRA in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">MR. GUGEL: Well, the PUD, I mean it\u2014the new PUD regulations do give that discretion in requiring public site dedication. The old regulations were kind of on a per acre basis. But given the symbol on the site and the rezoning request, <em>it would have been conditioned even without a DRRA.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">We need not decide whether the conveyance of a middle school site constitutes an enhanced public benefit to Frederick County. Critically, the DRRA in the instant case merely requires the developer to proffer the site, which the Board of Education, in its discretion, could accept or decline. The record before the Board of County Commissioners reflects the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And under the school dedication requirement I just would like to confirm that there is no guarantee that the school site will be dedicated, it\u2019s contingent on acceptance by the Board of Education; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">MR. GUGEL: Yeah, the site itself. I mean, the Phase I PUD does establish thresholds, timing thresholds of when the dedication and conveyance must occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: But acceptance depends on the Board of Education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">MR. GUGEL: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Mr. Gugel further testified that if the BOE does not accept the dedication of the middle school site, the developer would then retain fee simple ownership of the land that was previously identified as totaling a minimum of 24.5 \u00b1 buildable acres. The DRRA expressly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In the event that the BOE does not approve the Public School Site or determines not to accept conveyance of the Public School site, then Developer shall retain fee simple ownership of the Public School Site and may use the Public School Site in a manner consistent with other uses with the Project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">DRRA \u00a7 3.4.C, entitled \u201cSchool Site Dedication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Because the Developer retains fee simple ownership of the middle school site if the BOE \u201cdoes not approve the Public School site or determines not to accept conveyance of [the site],\u201d this \u201cbenefit,\u201d at the time of execution and recordation of the DRRA, was a conditional promise and potentially an illusory one to boot. Indeed, the offer by the developer to proffer the property in fee simple is not a definitive compulsory obligation to do anything other than offer the site for a middle school contingent on acceptance by the Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Absent the conditional conveyance of the site for the middle school, the developer cannot identify any legally recognizable enhanced public benefit to Frederick County in connection with the DRRA. The testimony before the Board of County Commissioners contains the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A65\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: [W]ould the applicant please explain what greater public benefits the DRRA provides above and beyond those that would otherwise be obtainable absent the DRRA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">[DEVELOPER\u2019S COUNSEL]: A certainty that the project would not lose zoning, wouldn\u2019t lose density, wouldn\u2019t lose its comprehensive plan ... You know, all of that is certainly public benefit ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And what you described certainly would reflect the certainty that the property owner would achieve as a result of the DRRA, but what are the greater public benefits in terms of infrastructure or other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHn\">[DEVELOPER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I mean, it\u2019s one and the same .... [H]ow is it to the greater good or how is it to [sic] public benefit, and by public meaning not just a proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ty owner if the\u2014if zoning can change willy-nilly, if property rights can be given and taken away based on, you know, however the winds change. I mean, it\u2019s Maryland law. I mean, obviously it\u2019s\u2014the way common law in Maryland has developed it\u2019s that zoning is up for grabs unless there\u2019s valid\u2014unless there\u2019s recognizable vertical construction based on a validly issued building permit, all the parties have tried to address this through legislation at the state in terms of vesting and this was the compromise ... As my co-counsel Mr, Rose is referencing, I mean, the school site, the roads, the representations as to making all of the improvements that are required under the APFO, I mean, it\u2019s all right here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">As the developer\u2019s testimony and its counsel\u2019s argument reflects, the public benefit conferred by the DRRA consists of the developer\u2019s vested rights in the project and the applicant\u2019s obligations to satisfy Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (\u201cAPFO\u201d) infrastructure requirements. Clearly, every development must satisfy APFO requirements regardless of whether a DRRA is executed. A DRRA, in contrast, requires the applicant to provide some public benefit beyond complying with statutory land use standards and otherwise satisfy Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance infrastructure requirements. The DRRA <em>sub judice </em>does not require the applicant to unconditionally convey property for a middle school or otherwise provide any extra or enhanced benefit to Frederick County or its citizens. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the DRRA is void for lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED.
