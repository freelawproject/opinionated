After a merits hearing relating to property distribution, the circuit court determined that money the Grandparents had contributed toward the purchase of Wife and Husband\u2019s marital home was a gift conditioned on Husband and Wife\u2019s continued marriage and use of the home, for the sole benefit of the Child, and because the divorce violated that condition, the Grandparents were entitled to recover those funds. After a child support hearing, the court ordered Husband and Wife to pay child support to the Grandparents. Wife challenges all of these decisions; Husband does not, and apparently has decided to align his interests with his parents\u2019. We dismiss one of Wife\u2019s challenges for failure to provide a transcript, reverse the judgment in favor of the Grandparents as to the marital home proceeds, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Husband and Wife were married on October 7, 2006, and Child was born on June 24, 2008. Husband testified at the custody hearing that one week before the wedding, Wife told him that she had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 20, 2011, Husband and Wife, using $131,000 from the Grandparents as a down payment, purchased a $355,000 home in Silver Spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">During the marriage, Husband and Wife were involved in a polyamorous relationship with a woman we\u2019ll call M.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband and Wife met M in late 2008 when they all lived in the same apartment building. Husband testified that about two weeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>after meeting M, he and Wife talked to her about beginning a sexual relationship with her. M testified that as part of this discussion, Wife told her that she had dissociative identity-disorder or multiple personality disorder. Wife, however, testified that the sexual relationship with M started \u201c[b]y [Husband] introducing it.\u201d Husband, Wife, and M met \u201c[a] couple ... to a handful [of] times a month\u201d until M moved into the family home in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">From September 2012 through February 2013, Husband, Wife, and M participated in counseling because Husband wanted M to stay in the house while Wife wanted M to leave. The sexual relationship between M and Wife had ended in December 2012. Wife testified at the custody hearing that she felt coerced by Husband, but offered no other evidence that Husband was coercing or influencing her to have a relationship with M. Husband and M testified that Husband never forced Wife to have a sexual relationship with M.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">During their marriage, Husband and Wife smoked marijuana and used several other drugs together and with M. They scheduled their drug use to allow Husband and Wife to coordinate care for the Child by the Grandparents at the Grandparents\u2019 home. These sessions occurred \u201c[a]nywhere from every other weekend to once a month, to sometimes it would be a few months.\u201d Wife testified that she only used drugs at Husband\u2019s insistence, but offered no other evidence that Husband \u201ccoerced\u201d or \u201cinfluenced\u201d her. Wife kept a calendar that indicated when she was \u201ctripping.\u201d Both Husband and M testified that Wife was never forced to use drugs, and Husband testified that it was Wife\u2019s idea that they use cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">A. The Grandparents</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The Grandparents are both retired and live in a home with a room for Child. The Grandparents have been \u201cheavily involved\u201d in Child\u2019s life\u2014Child spent many weekends and a significant amount of weekday time with the Grandparents, including when his parents were using drugs. As an infant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Child spent three days each week and occasional weekends at the Grandparents\u2019 home. When he was older, Child spent two to four days or nights per week at the Grandparents\u2019 home. Husband also testified that Wife asked that Child go to the Grandparents\u2019 when she would otherwise be left alone with him and that this \u201cbecame more routine\u201d during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In addition, the Grandparents frequently took Child to the doctor and the dentist so that Husband and Wife would not have to take time off from work, and they arranged for Child to attend school programs and recreational activities. The Grandparents took Child to church on Sundays when he was with them. According to Wife\u2019s testimony, the Grandparents \u201c[ha]ve tried to act as parents\u201d to Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">B. Husband And Wife\u2019s Separation</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Husband and Wife\u2019s relationship became strained in 2012 as a result of frequent fights that included profane name-calling and screaming at each other. Both Husband and Wife testified about incidents leading to their separation. Wife testified that Husband became physically violent and threatened to kill her during a trip to King\u2019s Dominion with M. Husband countered that he hit Wife because she intentionally slammed his arm with the car door and that he did not ever threaten to kill her in front of Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On May 30, 2013, after these incidents, Husband and Wife separated and Wife sought and received a protective order against Husband. While the restraining order was in effect, Wife voluntarily arranged visitation with the Grandparents so that Husband could see Child on a weekly basis under the Grandparents\u2019 supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">After the separation, Wife stayed in the marital home with Child, and they lived with two different men shortly after the separation. From early July 2014 until at least the time of the custody hearing (which began on September 15, 2014), Wife and Child lived with Wife\u2019s daughter, Wife\u2019s daughter\u2019s adoptive mother, father, and older sister (the \u201cKs\u201d), four dogs, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>twenty guinea pigs. The Ks did not contribute toward the mortgage or household expenses during the time that they lived in the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">On July 11, 2013, Wife filed a Complaint for Absolute Divorce that sought sole physical and legal custody of Child, child support, and other relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Husband filed a counter-complaint on August 27, 2013 that requested, among other things, an absolute divorce, custody of Child, and child support. They reached a <em>pendente lite </em>settlement that provided, among other things, that Wife would have physical custody of Child, Husband would have visitation with Child under the supervision of the Grandparents and continue paying monthly child support to Wife in the amount of $500, and both Husband and Wife would be subject to random drug testing. Husband paid child support on time until August 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">C. The Grandparents\u2019 Motion For Permissive Intervention</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">On April 24, 2014, the Grandparents filed a Motion for Permissive Intervention relating to Child\u2019s legal and residential custody and a Complaint for Custody. On May 21, 2014, Wife filed a Motion to Strike both. The trial court granted the Grandparents\u2019 Motion for Permissive Intervention on July 14, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">D. Child\u2019s Crisis Center Referral</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Around May 2014, Child began exhibiting behavior issues at school. He became upset, refused to leave the classroom, and pushed desks. Child\u2019s behavioral issues continued during summer camp, around the same time that the Ks moved into the marital home with Wife and Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">During the early part of the 2014 school year, Child became frustrated and angry and sometimes left his classroom and the school building. In one instance on September 4, 2014, Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>hit and kicked the assistant principal and told the school counselor and assistant principal that he was so angry that he wanted to blow up the school. Both Grandmother and Wife arrived at the school after this incident; Grandmother had been scheduled to pick up Child for his visitation with Husband, and the school had called Wife. The principal spoke to Wife about the situation in a conference room while Grandmother sat outside because Wife did not want the principal to speak with Grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The principal advised Wife that the school was referring Child to the Montgomery County Crisis Center (the \u201cCrisis Center\u201d), and strongly encouraged Wife to take Child there. The principal also informed Wife that the school guidance counselor had the Crisis Center referral paperwork. When the principal finished talking to Wife, Child left with Grandmother and Wife met with the guidance counselor. The guidance counselor gave Wife the form referring Child to the Crisis Center and told her to take Child as soon as she could, although Child could return to school even if the Crisis Center had not completed the referral form.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Husband\u2019s attorney\u2014not Wife or the personnel from the school\u2014informed Husband about the Crisis Center referral. Husband called Grandmother and learned that Grandmother had picked up Child and that Wife had not taken Child to the Crisis Center. Husband called his attorney to determine what he should do with Child, and his attorney told him to take Child to the Crisis Center. Within forty-five minutes of learning about the referral, Husband and Grandmother took Child to the Crisis Center.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wife, meanwhile, attended Child\u2019s back-to-school night. After the incident, Wife never returned the form she received from the guidance counselor to the school, and she kept Child at home for several days after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>After the incident, Child began receiving therapy through his school. Wife also testified that, although Child did not receive additional individual counseling, she did seek counseling for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">E. Child Custody Merits Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On the first day of the custody hearing, Wife\u2019s counsel called the Court Evaluator to testify about her February 20, 2014 oral report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court Evaluator testified about Husband\u2019s drug use and expressed concern about Husband\u2019s alleged history of sexually abusing children, including his sister and daughter from an earlier marriage. The Court Evaluator testified that she had concluded in her oral report \u201c[t]hat it was unlikely [Husband and Wife] would be able to successfully cooperate and communicate\u201d and recommended that Wife have primary residential and sole legal custody of Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">During cross-examination, the Court Evaluator explained that she recommended that Wife have custody of Child because she \u201cfelt [Wife] at least expressed the desire to have primary custody and she was in therapy.\u201d The Court Evaluator testified that Wife lied to her about \u201cthe drug test results, because she told [the Court Evaluator] that she had not used marijuana since ... the parents separated. And she did test positive for marijuana [after the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing on January 14, 2014].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The Evaluator also testified about the Grandparents\u2019 relationship with Child, saying that they were \u201cvery important in [Child]\u2019s life,\u201d were \u201cintimately involved in a lot of the details of [Child]\u2019s ... life,\u201d and \u201chad excellent accommodations for [Child] in their home.\u201d The Evaluator also expressed \u201cserious concerns\u201d about both Husband\u2019s and Wife\u2019s judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>[B]oth [Husband and Wife], and the grandparents, and others, told me about ways in which both parents relied on the grandparents when they were ... with [M], when they were having arguments, when they were using drugs together, they often told me, but [Child] wasn\u2019t adversely affected, because he was with his grandparents. He was with them almost every other weekend, although not on a regular set schedule. And other times the[ Grandparents] were going to the school. They were chaperoning and volunteering at the school. They were almost functioning as the parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Evaluator expressed two further concerns: \u201cthat [she] didn\u2019t see ... more signs of attachment and bonding between [Child] and either parent,\u201d and that either or both parents would use drugs again. The Evaluator also felt that Child\u2019s bond with the Grandparents matched the bond he had with his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">At trial, Wife testified about how she cared for Child during the time between the <em>pendente lite </em>hearing and the custody merits hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During her cross-examination, Wife testified about a calendar containing \u201ceverything that was going on ... at that time [2013],\u201d including notations regarding her drug usage and sexual relations with M, Husband, and another man, but claimed that she could not remember the meaning of her notations on the calendar. Wife also could not remember any specific threats Husband made against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">When Husband\u2019s counsel asked Wife about emails she had written in which she referred to her alternate personalities, Wife responded that she was unsure if she wrote them \u201cbecause [Husband] had access to the e-mail account,\u201d but that if she did write them, that she would have referred to herself in the third person. In response to questions from the Grandparents\u2019 attorney, Wife testified that Grandmother would not \u201cpurposely\u201d let harm come to Child or neglect him, but that she had concerns about the Grandparents\u2019 ability to care for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Child; she could not, however, \u201cdescribe anything that may or may not be there\u201d because she was \u201cnot made aware of what happens when [Child]\u2019s [at the Grandparents\u2019] for visitation.\u201d With regard to her drug use at the time of the custody merits hearing, Wife originally answered the judge\u2019s question by saying that she was not clean from drugs, but quickly changed her answer to say that she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Husband testified about his relationships with Wife and Child. He testified that he had tested negative for each of the administered drug tests and did not plan to use drugs in the future. He expressed concern about Wife\u2019s ability to care for Child and cited Child\u2019s recent behavioral issues and the Crisis Center referral. And Husband offered his belief that Wife was not fit and proper to have custody of Child, but that the Grandparents were.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">M testified about her relationship with Husband and Wife. According to M, Wife was capable of becoming violent or aggressive toward Child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">It would be some occasional times during the, usually weekend mornings, where I would wake up and I would see [Wife] either yelling at [Child] or screaming, or whatever. And it didn\u2019t seem like it was such a big deal. It might have been over, like, a yogurt or going outside, or forgetting to, you know, throw recycling away. I mean, a mountain out of a molehill it seemed to be. And I would ask about it later, and [Wife] would tell me, well that, that was Morgan[, one of Wife\u2019s alternate personalities,] and Morgan was just starting to get really frustrated with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">M recounted that Wife and Child \u201cget very frustrated with each other very easily\u201d and that Wife did not like to care for Child alone. When asked whether Wife should have custody of Child, M said no:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">I don\u2019t believe that [Wife] can fully take care of herself, for starters. I have seen a marked difference in [Child]\u2019s mood and behavior. I know that he was supposed to be in therapy, and that he\u2019s not. I know that the school\u2019s had to call in for, he\u2019s been sent to Crisis Center. I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m concerned about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>him. I don\u2019t think that the, the family, there\u2019s a family now that\u2019s living with them. And I [k]now some about that family and their lifestyle and the cleanliness and lack of cleanliness and the hoarding lifestyle that they\u2019ve brought with them. I just, I, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In contrast, M answered that she believed that the Grandparents were the fit and proper people to have full custody of Child because \u201c[t]hey have the time, they have the patience, they have the home that he\u2019s been living in about half, half the time for most of his life. They know his medical history. They\u2019ve been to his school functions. I mean they, they, they were in it sometimes more often than the parents were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Grandfather testified about his relationship with Child, and explained that he and Grandmother were seeking custody because they \u201cha[d] very grave concerns about the ability of either [Husband] or [Wife] to bring up [Child] in a environment that will provide for him the opportunities that a six year old deserves.... [W]e have to rescue him from a lot of the behaviors that have been described.\u201d Grandfather expressed the belief that it would be in Child\u2019s best interests to be in the Grandparents\u2019 primary care and that both Grandparents were fit and proper persons to have custody of Child. Grandfather opined as well that Child\u2019s behavior would improve if he was removed from Wife\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Grandmother also expressed that she and Grandfather were fit and proper persons to have custody of Child for several reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Well, first of all, we love [Child] very, very much. And second of all, the preponderance of testimony in this courtroom today, much of which we were unaware, has made us firmly believe that neither [Wife] nor [Husband] is prepared financially, socially, morally, to raise [Child] in a[n] environment that will help to be the person that he has the potential to be. [Grandfather] and I are caretakers. [Grandfather\u2019s father was bedridden for 18 and a half years. The first 18 and a half years of our marriage, we drove every third weekend to New Jersey to help his mother care for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>father at home. It mattered not what was going on, what invitation we had, what party was going on, we went.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">We\u2019ve cared for [Grandfather's mother in our home, simultaneously with [Child]. She had a litany of ailments .... But we felt that it was an important thing for us to do. We are both caregivers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Grandmother also expressed concern about Child\u2019s social development if Wife were granted custody, about Wife\u2019s ability to care for Child alone for long periods of time, and about Wife\u2019s handling of the Crisis Center referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Other non-family witnesses also offered observations. The Grandparents\u2019 next-door neighbor testified that the Grandparents\u2019 relationship with Child was more like a parent\u2019s relationship than a grandparent\u2019s, and she too opined that the Grandparents would be fit and proper persons to have custody of Child. Same for a member of Grandparents\u2019 church. Child\u2019s school principal and guidance counselor testified about Child\u2019s behavior at school, including the September 4, 2014 Crisis Center referral incident. Husband also called a clinical psychologist who had counseled Husband, Wife, and M and she testified about the emotional amplitude of the unconventional relationship, which included yelling, arguing loudly, and \u201cgoing at it in a volatile manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">At the conclusion of the five-day custody trial, on September 19, 2014, the court, in an oral ruling, granted physical and legal custody of Child to the Grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">F. Interim Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The court followed its oral custody ruling with an interim order dated September 24, 2014 restating its finding that \u201cneither [Wife] nor [Husband is] fit and proper to have custody of the minor child\u201d and the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances ... that are significantly detrimental to the minor child if the child were to remain in the custody of [Wife].\u201d In addition, the court found \u201cthat it [wa]s in the best interest of [Child] to award sole custody to the [Grandparents]\u201d and \u201cthat the [Grandparents] are fit and proper persons to have custody of [Child].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>On October 7, 2014, the Grandparents filed an Emergency Motion to Modify and Limit [Wife]\u2019s Access to Minor Child. After a hearing on the motion, the court, in a second interim order, granted the Motion and prohibited overnight visits with Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">In a perhaps optimistically titled Final Order dated November 25, 2014, the court, among other things, ordered Wife to pay Husband \u201c$9,628.38 as compensation for his half of the expenses he paid towards the maintenance of the family home from November 2013 through October 2014.\u201d On December 24, 2014, Wife filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Final Order and Motion for Expenses She Paid on [Hus-bandj\u2019s Behalf Towards the Maintenance of the Family Home, and the court denied that motion on June 15, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">G. The Grandparents\u2019 Motion For Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In the meantime, the Grandparents filed a Motion for Child Support. A magistrate held a hearing on March 11, 2015 and, on March 24, 2015, recommended that the circuit court grant the motion. On April 2, 2015, Wife filed exceptions to the recommendation, arguing, among other things, that the child support award was grossly excessive because it required Wife to pay nearly half of her gross salary and because the Grandparents are \u201cextraordinarily wealthy.\u201d The circuit court granted Grandparents\u2019 Motion for Child Support in an order dated May 19, 2015 and denied Wife\u2019s exceptions in an order dated May 21, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">H. Property Distribution Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Over Wife\u2019s objection, the court permitted the Grandparents to intervene in the property distribution healing. At the end of the hearing, the court granted Husband and Wife an absolute divorce and incorporated (but didn\u2019t merge) their voluntary separation and property settlement agreement, and entered an order to that effect on January 23, 2015. The court also found that the Grandparents were entitled to the first $131,000 of the proceeds from the sale of the marital home because they made a conditional loan of that amount to Husband and Wife for the purpose of allowing Child to grow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>up in a safe and clean home environment. The court entered an order to this effect on January 27, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Wife filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration on December 24, 2014, which the Grandparents opposed on January 7, 2015. The court took Wife\u2019s Motion for Partial Reconsideration under advisement on January 20, 2015, and later denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Wife filed a timely appeal. We will discuss additional facts below as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Wife presents eight questions on appeal<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that we have consolidated into five. <em>First, </em>Wife asserts that the court violated her \u201cfundamental parental rights\u201d under the United States and Maryland Constitutions when it granted custody of Child to the Grandparents and abused its discretion by denying her request for a continuance. <em>Second, </em>Wife asserts that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>abused its discretion by soliciting expert testimony during a hearing in an \u201cunorthodox manner\u201d and, <em>third, </em>by permitting the Grandparents to intervene in the divorce property distribution hearing. <em>Fourth, </em>Wife argues that the court erred in awarding Husband <em>\u201c </em>\u2018contributions made towards maintenance of the family home.\u201d <em>And finally, </em>Wife challenges the order requiring her to pay child support to the Grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We review child custody determinations using three interrelated standards of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">When the appellate court scrutinizes factual findings, the clearly erroneous standard of [Rule 8-131(c) ] applies. [Second], if it appears that the [court] erred as to matters of law, further proceedings in the trial court will ordinarily be required unless the error is determined to be harmless. Finally, when the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003). We give \u201cdue regard ... to the opportunity of the lower court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 819 A.2d 1030.

The circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it granted the Grandparents\u2019 Motion for Permissive Intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">At the threshold, we agree that the circuit court properly allowed the Grandparents to intervene in the custody case. Wife argues that \u201cthe legislature prohibits [motions to intervene in third-party custody cases], and stated that grandparents may solely assert visitation rights under certain pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>scribed circumstances\u201d because, under the doctrine of <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>\u201c[t]he legislature has clearly limited [] grandparents\u2019 rights to visitation, if permitted by the [grandparents visitation] statue and caselaw.\u201d We disagree. Although third parties such as the Grandparents appropriately bear a difficult burden when seeking custody, there is no doubt that they are allowed to seek it. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 435, 869 A.2d 751 (reversing circuit court judgment granting custody to the maternal grandparents after finding that neither parental unfitness nor extraordinary circumstances existed); <em>Shurupoff v.

Town of Washington Grove, </em>408 Md. 37, 70, 968 A.2d 552 (2009) (citation omitted). And \u201cin determining whether a motion to intervene has been timely filed, a court must consider the purpose for which intervention is sought, the probability of prejudice to the parties already in the case, the extent to which the proceedings have progressed when the movant applies to intervene, and the reason or reasons for the delay in seeking intervention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 968 A.2d 552 (quoting <em>Phar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>maceia Eni Diagnostics, Inc. v.

Rule 2-214(b)(3) (\u201cIn exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the Grandparents to intervene here. They filed their motion five months before the custody merits hearing and the court granted it two months before the hearing. The Grandparents raised substantive challenges to Wife\u2019s and Husband\u2019s parental fitness, and Wife thoroughly addressed the Grandparents\u2019 involvement in Child\u2019s life in her Motion to Strike Grandparents\u2019 Motion for Permissive Intervention and her Answer and Counter-Complaint, all of which demonstrates that she fully understood and had notice of the Grandparents\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Furthermore, Wife did not seek discovery from the Grandparents after they filed their Motion for Permissive Intervention. Wife had an opportunity to depose the Grandparents, but waited until late August 2014 to request to do so. The Grandparents made themselves available for deposition, but Wife\u2019s attorney attempted to schedule the deposition on dates when he knew that the Grandparents\u2019 attorney was not available, which led to Wife\u2019s Emergency Motion to Postpone/Continue Custody Trial Scheduled For September 15.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>And despite the lack of a deposition or any additional discovery, Wife stated in her brief that \u201c[t]he [Grandparents\u2019] strategy continued as expected at trial,\u201d which suggests that any prejudice from the Grandparents\u2019 intervention without discovery was minimal. <em>Cf. Green v. Green, </em>188 Md.App. 661, 677, 982 A.2d 1150 (2009) (finding no prejudice where mother was aware of the third parties\u2019 position and sought and received discovery from them).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The constitutional presumption favoring Wife over the Grandparents also cuts against the notion that Wife was prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision to permit the Grandparents\u2019 intervention. Wife\u2019s burden in seeking custody did not change\u2014the Grandparents, as intervening third parties, undertook the burden of proving that Wife was unfit or that exceptional circumstances existed. The Grandparents also contended, and the circuit court agreed, that they decided to seek custody based on information that they learned about Husband and Wife\u2019s behavior during earlier hearings in the case when Husband and Wife began sharing explicit details of their parenting behavior. The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the Grandparents filed their motion for permissive intervention within a reasonable time of learning the relevant facts, and we see no abuse of discretion in its decision to allow the Grandparents to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">2. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the parents were unfit, that exceptional circumstances existed, and that Child\u2019s best interests would be served if the Grandparents had custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">At the conclusion of the custody merits hearing, the court made several findings, then concluded from those findings that both Wife and Husband were unfit parents and that exceptional circumstances justified consideration of third-party custody. The court identified and relied on the <em>McDermott </em>standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>which states the presumption that parents should have child custody unless they are unfit <em>or </em>exceptional circumstances exist which make such custody significantly detrimental to the child. Wife disagrees, but we find that the record supports the court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The court began by finding that Wife and Husband were \u201cextremely selfish\u201d and neglected the Child. The court found that Wife lied throughout the case about her drug use and testing, \u2022 her relationship with M, her mental health, and Child\u2019s school attendance following the Crisis Center referral, and that she failed to take responsibility for her actions. The court found \u201cthat [Wife] still takes [drugs] or she\u2019s still ready to take them.\u201d And the court cited Wife\u2019s unconcerned attitude about Child\u2019s volatile and violent behavior, noting that she left Child with Grandmother after the September 4 incident at his school rather than engaging directly, and that she had failed to make any adjustments to meet Child\u2019s needs. In particular, the court noted that it \u201cdidn\u2019t see any real[] love or total attachment\u201d between Wife and Child.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Wife acknowledges that the court cited the correct standards, but contends that it applied them incorrectly. She argues that the court \u201ccomparted Wife] to the wealthy [Grandparents]\u201d and based its order and judgment entirely \u201cupon impermissible conclusions, assumptions and prejudices ..., which were themselves primarily based upon lifestyle choices the parties had made years before during the marriage.\u201d She points to the determinations by the Montgomery County Child Welfare Services that she was \u201ca fit and proper parent of the minor child\u201d and by the court-ordered Custody Evaluator that Wife \u201cshould have custody of the minor child,\u201d and argues that the court erred in disregarding those opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">As a factual matter, Wife overstates the helpfulness of those documents to her ease. The Child Welfare Services report stated only that \u201c[a]t this time [December 16, 2013], there are no child welfare issues\u201d and \u201ca best interest attorney or a court evaluator should be considered to evaluate both patents\u2019 interactions with the child to determine custody.\u201d That invest\u00ed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>gation was conducted nine months before the custody merits hearing and was not offered into evidence by anyone at the hearing. So even if the court had known about the results of the investigation, it was completely within its discretion to weigh the report in light of the more current evidence presented at the hearing regarding Wife and Child\u2019s living situation, which had changed from the time that the Custody Evaluator conducted her investigation and made her custody recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Wife also cites the oral finding of the \u201ccourt-ordered psych evaluator\u201d that Wife \u201cdid not have any psychological disorder.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t matter whether Wife has a psychological diagnosis\u2014what matters is how Wife functioned (and functions). And whether or not Wife actually suffered from a psychological illness, the court was appropriately troubled by the way that Wife held herself out to others, including Husband and M, as having a psychological illness when it was far from clear that she really did.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Wife argues further that the Grandparents\u2019 \u201cbelated \u2018knowledge\u2019 that during the mother and father\u2019s marriage they used drugs, ... their recent litigation knowledge that one of the many drug tests taken by [Wife] came up positive for marijuana, ... and the fact that the court had ordered a psychological examination of both of the parents\u201d was not enough \u201cseparately or in total\u201d to meet the exceptional circumstances standard. Wife seeks to distinguish this case from <em>Hoffman, </em>which, according to Wife, affirmed a finding of exceptional circumstances where \u201cthere was extensive psychological testimony of the potential effect of custody on the minor child\u201d and \u201cthe focus of the third party custody [was to] retain custody by the third party, and <em>not </em>to <em>change </em>custody to the absent parent who the child had never known for the child\u2019s first eight years.\u201d (Emphases in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Grandparents respond that the court\u2019s findings about Wife\u2019s unfitness and the existence of extraordinary circumstances were supported by the evidence, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in making them. The Grandparents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>point out that Wife didn\u2019t support her claims of fitness with any witness testimony beyond her own, that neither Wife nor any other witness at the custody merits hearing testified that she was a fit and proper parent, and that none of the opinions referred to by Wife in her arguments were actually part of the custody merits hearing record. And the Grandparents are right on this last point: none of these opinions Wife asks us to consider were before the circuit court, and we cannot consider them now.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">On the actual record that <em>was </em>developed, the court acted well within its discretion when it found the parents unfit. The record supports the court\u2019s finding that Wife still takes or is ready to take drugs and that she has struggled with parenting and properly caring for Child. The court heard and considered testimony regarding Wife\u2019s inability and uneasiness in caring for Child, and that her difficulties often resulted in her and Husband placing Child in the Grandparents\u2019 care. And the record revealed real questions about Wife\u2019s compliance with the parties\u2019 agreed drug testing regiment. She failed to comply with the Child\u2019s Best Interest Attorney\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) request for a random drug test on July 14, 2014. And although she eventually sent the results of a test the BIA requested about a month before the custody merits hearing, she refused to sign the release that would allow her results to be sent directly to the BIA. This meant that Wife received and could review her results before the BIA got them, which undermined the credibility of any negative results. Wife obviously disputes these findings and the factual premises underlying them, but the record contained ample evidence that could support the court\u2019s finding that she and Husband (who doesn\u2019t contest the finding) were unfit parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The record also supports the court\u2019s finding of exceptional circumstances. The evidence and testimony demonstrated that Child had been exposed for years to a volatile and unhealthy home environment; the court cited \u201cthe drugs, the sex, the craziness in the house, the different relationships, the lack of interest in the mother, the mother lying\u2014all of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>things are factors for both [fitness and extraordinary circumstances].\u201d The Child spent long periods of time away from Husband and Wife, especially when Husband and Wife used drugs. The court found that the Grandparents had provided a great deal of care for the Child, and that \u201cthe age of the child when the care was assumed by the third party ... was from the time of birth.\u201d The court considered the possible emotional effect on the child in a change of custody, the period of time that elapsed before the parents sought to reclaim him, the nature and strength of the ties between Child and the Grandparents, and found all factors to strongly favor custody by the Grandparents. The court did not find Wife\u2019s stated desire for custody to be genuine, and that Child \u201cwould continue with instability and he would certainly fail\u201d in the custody of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The court then found that the Grandparents were very fit and proper for custody purposes and knew Child better than either Husband or Wife. It noted that the Grandparents provided stability for him and were \u201csincere, genuine, rock-solid people, the kind of people that you want raising children.\u201d As additional support, the court noted that \u201cthe parents have relied on the[ Grandparents] to do a lot of parenting things throughout this little boy\u2019s life.\u201d The court cited the financial contributions of the Grandparents, their ability to give Child the guidance and time that he needs (and that Wife had not), and the Grandparents\u2019 willingness to address Child\u2019s severe behavioral problems. The trial judge considered the Grandparents\u2019 lack of drug use, their morals and values, and their desire to have custody, as well as Child\u2019s opportunities for the future, the age and health of Child, and the stability of the Grandparents\u2019 residence. The only factor the trial judge considered which weighed against the Grandparents\u2019 custody was their age.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The concept of exceptional circumstances defies easy or mechanical definition, and we agree that it should be a rare and, well, exceptional case that can support such a finding. And there was not an absolute correlation between Child\u2019s behavioral problems and sole custody with his mother; al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>though Child began exhibiting behavioral issues in the months preceding the custody merits hearing, they didn\u2019t begin until several months after Wife\u2019s sole custody began. During the ten months in which Wife had sole custody, Child continued to have regular visitation with Husband and the Grandparents. And we recognize that \u201cMaryland courts have been far less willing to find exceptional circumstances in situations when a child had lived in the same household as a natural parent and a third-party\u201d than when the child had been in the sole physical custody of a third party. <em>Gestl v. Frederick, </em>133 Md.App. 216, 238, 754 A.2d 1087 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Even so, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s finding that exceptional circumstances exist here. Life with his parents, and even with his mother after their split, was chaotic and unstable, and the record revealed serious questions about the prospect of improvement in the short- or medium-term. The court could readily have found from this record that Child\u2019s behavior problems would continue if he were to live with Wife at this juncture, and that the Grandparents provided a stable home that Wife currently cannot. We recognize that reasonable fact-finders might disagree about whether exceptional circumstances exist here. But given the totality of the circumstances before the court in this unusual case, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion by finding exceptional circumstances that could justify consideration of third-party custody. <em>Cf., e.g., McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 425 n.44, 869 A.2d 751 (\u201cupholding chancellor\u2019s finding of \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 in awarding custody of child, born to a sixteen-year-old mother, to paternal grandparents who had raised the child for four years, and observing that granting the mother substantial visitation was in recognition of her improved condition and potential to receive full custody in the future\u201d (citing <em>Burrows v.

The circuit court made an appropriate custody decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Wife contends <em>finally </em>that the circuit court was prejudiced and focused improperly on acts of the parties that occurred before the parties separated and Wife obtained sole custody of Child and \u201cremoved herself from her husband\u2019s influence.\u201d We disagree. The court based its custody decision on testimony and evidence developed during the merits hearing on custody, a large portion of which revolved around Child\u2019s behavior at school from two weeks earlier. Wife characterizes the court as biased, and alleges that this bias \u201caffected his assessment regarding the credibility of [Wife] and all of her testimony\u201d and that \u201cother evidence is in the record and other parties testified that [Wife] had taken appropriate and responsible parental actions.\u201d This makes us wonder if Wife and her counsel are reading the same hearing transcript as we are: Wife\u2019s testimony about her own fitness stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming bulk of the testimony of other witnesses, including the school principal and guidance counsel- or. <em>See, e.g., </em>E2182.12-14 (Wife testified that the school principal \u201cspecifically asked that [she] attend the back to school night.) <em>and </em>E2285.5-9 (Principal testified that she did not specifically ask Wife to come to back to school night.); E2184.16 (Wife testified that Child went to school on September 8, 2014.) <em>and </em>E2337.12-18 (Guidance counselor testified that Child did not attend school on either September 5 or 8, 2014.)) A trial court does not demonstrate bias simply by resolving disputed factual questions in favor of one party and against another, and we see no evidence of bias in the court\u2019s resolution of these disputes against Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>B.

The Circuit Court Abused Its Discretion When It Granted The Grandparents\u2019 Motion To Intervene In The Divorce Property Distribution Hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Wife contends <em>next </em>that the circuit court should not have permitted the Grandparents \u201cto intervene in the divorce property distribution hearing for \u2018judicial convenience,\u2019 [because of] the fact that [Wife] had a right to a jury trial on any such claim by the [Grandparents], it is not permitted in the family law statute or procedure, and was again done in an unorthodox manner without the [Grandparents] filing a motion, providing notice, providing discovery, or filing a cause of action.\u201d The Grandparents respond that allowing Wife to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the money they provided for the purchase of the marital home would result in a \u201cwindfall\u201d because the circuit court judge found that the Grandparents\u2019 testimony that the purchase money was a conditional gift was credible, that the money was only for the benefit of Child, and that the condition attached to the Grandparents\u2019 payment\u2014that Wife and Husband remain married and caring for Child'\u2014had been violated. Whether or not that is true in some broader sense, we agree with Wife that this is not the appropriate proceeding for the Grandparents to assert and pursue their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">While Child was a baby, Husband and Wife lived in a rodent-infested apartment with no suitable play area. On June 20, 2011, Husband and Wife purchased a home, held as tenants by the entirety, for $355,000, and $131,000 of the purchase price for the home came from the Grandparents. Grandmother testified that she and Grandfather spoke with Husband and Wife about the conditions they put on this contribution;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">Those conditions were that [the money] would be a zero percent interest loan, that we did expect it to be returned to us in the event of the sale of the home or they could roll it over if they bought, you know, another home, you know. And that was, that was basically the conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">According to Grandmother, everyone agreed to these conditions. Husband generally agreed: he testified that the Grandparents provided the money with the oral stipulation that Husband and Wife live in the house for ten years and if they moved out or split up, Husband and Wife were required to repay the money that the Grandparents provided to them. Wife, on the other hand, testified that she believed that the money was a gift. And indeed, in the course of obtaining the mortgage on the house, Husband, Wife, Grandmother, and Grandfather executed a \u201cGift Letter\u201d stating that the Grandparents did not expect to be repaid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">I, Gary &lt;&amp; Martha Burak, do hereby certify the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asrh\">(1) I have made a gift of $130,000 to Mark &lt;&amp; Natasha Burak Whose relationship is: Son <em>&amp; </em>Daughter-in-Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>(2) This gift is to be applied toward the purchase of the property located at: 2825 Vixen Lane Silver Spring, MD 20906</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(3) No repayment of the gift is expected or implied in the form of cash or by future services of the recipient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Grandparents undoubtedly could see where things were headed once the divorce got underway, and they filed a motion to intervene in the property distribution hearing. Wife\u2019s counsel objected. The circuit court heard arguments and determined that it was appropriate to adjudicate the Grandparents\u2019 claim as part of this case because their \u201crights were interwoven throughout this entire domestic case\u201d and because judicial economy required that the Grandparents\u2019 claim to any amount derived from the sale of the marital home be heard during the proceeding. The court also reasoned that there would be no prejudice to either party from deciding the question without discovery or a jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">This issue has been out front and center for months in this case. It\u2019s an issue that everyone is intimately aware of and I don\u2019t believe discovery is going to shed any additional light on this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">This case does not present the common situation in which a court must value encumbered marital property (and thus the encumbrances) for purposes of determining whether to make a marital award. Instead, the Grandparents sought to intervene here for the purpose of asserting a claim, as creditors, to the proceeds of marital property. The Family Law Article of the Maryland Code does not expressly address the ability of third parties to intervene in a divorce action. The Court of Appeals has held that Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 7-107(f) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d) authorizes attorneys to intervene in a divorce action involving a former client to recover fees. <em>Tydings &amp; Rosenberg, LLP v. Zorzit, </em>422 Md. 582, 595-96, 30 A.3d 984 (2011). But the Grandparents haven\u2019t cited, and we haven\u2019t found, any legal authority to support the circuit court\u2019s decision allowing them to intervene in the property distribution phase of the proceeding, nor have we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>found any other Maryland cases discussing a third party\u2019s ability to intervene in a divorce in order to assert a money claim against either or both of the divorcing parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Several other states\u2019 courts have wrestled with this same question, and reached mixed results. <em>Compare, e.g., Moore v. Moore, </em>247 Ga. 243, 275 S.E.2d 334, 335-36 (1981) (affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of husband\u2019s mother\u2019s motion to intervene in the parties\u2019 divorce action where \u201c[t]he mother was not trying to intervene in the issue of a divorce per se ...; rather, she was attempting to protect her interest in the property dispute following the divorce\u201d and where mother alleged in her motion that she had an interest in the subject property of the action and that her ability to assert such interest would be impaired by the disposition of the property between the existing parties, husband admitted that his mother had given him money to buy the house and had not intended it as a gift, and husband\u2019s denial that he was obliged to put the deed in his mother\u2019s name eliminated him as an adequate representative of his mother\u2019s interest), <em>and Barrup v. Barrup, </em>198 Vt. 25, 111 A.3d 414, 420 (2014) (holding that the trial court did not err in allowing husband\u2019s mother to intervene in his divorce case \u201c[o]n these narrow facts\u201d where she was a record owner of property over which the trial court exercised jurisdiction), <em>with Aniballi v. Aniballi, </em>255 Mont. 384, 842 P.2d 342, 343-44 (1992) (holding that the court did not err in denying husband\u2019s parents\u2019 motion to intervene where they allegedly loaned money for improvements to son\u2019s marital home and sought to assert interest in son and daughter-in-law\u2019s marital home because the decree of dissolution would not determine the title of marital property <em>in rem </em>and parents failed to make a prima facie showing supporting their claim on the property), <em>and Barrup, </em>111 A.3d at 426 (Skoglund, J. concurring) (\u201cThe scales would tip [against intervention], however, where a third party\u2019s interest is inchoate or general as to one or both spouses, rather than tied to particular property.\u201d). Those states that do allow creditors to intervene tend to be community property states, where the governing law permits this. In <em>Olsen v. Olsen, </em>247 P.3d 77, 81 (Wyo. 2011), for example, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Court of Wyoming reversed a trial court decision that the wife\u2019s mother \u201cwas entitled to a judgment against each party for any deficiency remaining after the proceeds of the sale are applied to the debt\u201d owed to her by the parties. In support of its holding, the Court in <em>Olsen </em>referred to its earlier decision in <em>Nielson v. Thompson, </em>982 P.2d 709 (Wyo. 1999), which distinguished community property states from non-community property states in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">While this Court has said that third parties claiming rights in property that is subject to a property settlement may intervene or be joined, we were not addressing the rights of a judgment creditor. <em>Merritt v. Merritt, </em>586 P.2d 550, 554 (Wyo. 1978). Some states, notably those with community property laws, permit creditors to intervene in divorce actions as a matter of course. <em>Elms v. Elms, </em>4 Cal.2d 681, 52 P.2d 223, 224 (1935); <em>Malcolm v. Malcolm, </em>75 N.M. 566, 408 P.2d 143, 144 (1965); <em>Fletcher v. National Bank of Commerce, </em>825 S.W.2d 176, 179 (Tex. App. 1992); <em>Boyle v. Boyle, </em>194 W.Va. 124, 459 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1995). On the other hand, several states bar creditors from intervening in divorce cases. <em>Eberly v. Eberly, </em>489 A.2d 433, 446 (Del. Supr. 1985); <em>Poteat v. Poteat, </em>632 S.W.2d 511, 512 (Mo. App. E.D. 1982); <em>Foundation Sav. &amp; Loan Co. v. Rosenbaum, </em>113 Ohio App. 501, 171 N.E.2d 359, 360 (1960); <em>Bailey v. Bailey, </em>312 S.C. 454, 441 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1994). We are convinced that the authority of the court in a divorce action to divide property is simply ancillary to its authority to dissolve the marriage. The primary subject of a divorce action is the dissolution of the marriage, and the only proper parties to such an action are the spouses seeking to be divorced. <em>In re Marriage of Soriano, </em>44 Wash.App. 420, 722 P.2d 132, 133 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><em>Olsen, </em>247 P.3d at 81 (quoting <em>Nielson, </em>982 P.2d at 712); <em>see also In re Marriage of Heidema, </em>335 Mont. 362, 152 P.3d 112, 115 (2007) (\u201cIn a dissolution proceeding, the court has authority to apportion marital assets only between the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In Maryland, the division of marital property in a divorce action is governed by the doctrine of equitable distribution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>not the doctrine of community property, and we are persuaded that the Grandparents should not have been permitted to intervene to assert a claim in this case. Although the Grandparents contributed money for the purpose of purchasing the house, they didn\u2019t take or retain any sort of ownership or security interest in it\u2014their interest, whatever it is, lies against the Husband and Wife individually. That\u2019s why they fear the \u201cwindfall\u201d that Wife would reap, in their view\u2014if they can\u2019t capture the house sale proceeds directly, they will have to try and collect them from her and their son as individuals. But if the Grandparents were allowed to intervene here, it would be difficult to distinguish them in a principled way from other unsecured creditors of the divorcing parties, such as credit card issuers, and that is a Pandora\u2019s Box we decline to open judicially. The purpose of divorce proceedings is to sever the marital relationship and distribute the rights and responsibilities that grew out of it, such as the custody and support of children and the division of marital assets, <em>not </em>to facilitate the collection of marital debts by third parties. <em>See, e.g., Boyle, </em>459 S.E.2d at 405 (\u201cThe paramount goal in any divorce proceeding is a just and equitable resolution of the interests and rights of the divorcing spouses. The asserted interests of third parties in marital property are best resolved in legal actions separate and apart from divorce proceedings.\u201d) We hold, therefore, that the circuit court erred in considering and resolving the Grandparents\u2019 claim against the house sale proceeds, and we offer no views on whether the Grandparents have such a claim or on the merits of a claim if they have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">D. The Circuit Court Did Not Err In Reimbursing Husband For \u201cContributions\u201d He Made Toward Maintaining The Family Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Next, </em>Wife contests the circuit court\u2019s denial of her Motion For Partial Reconsideration Of The Final Order And Plaintiffs Motion For Expenses She Paid On Defendant\u2019s Behalf Towards The Maintenance Of The Family Home, in which she \u201crequest[ed] compensation for her half of the expenses she paid towards the maintenance of the family home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>from the time the parties separated through October 2014, or in the alternative, that the respective contributions be set off against each other.\u201d Wife takes issue in particular with what she characterizes as the court\u2019s lack of any findings of fact or analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u201cGenerally, one co-tenant who pays the mortgage, taxes, and other carrying charges of jointly owned property is entitled to contribution from the other.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Gordon, </em>174 Md.App. 583, 641, 923 A.2d 149 (2007) (quoting <em>Crawford v. Crawford, </em>293 Md. 307, 309, 443 A.2d 599 (1982)). In <em>Crawford, </em>293 Md. at 311, 443 A.2d 599, the Court of Appeals held that \u201ca co-tenant in a tenancy by the entireties is entitled, to the same extent as a co-tenant in a tenancy in common or joint tenancy is entitled, to contribution for that spouse\u2019s payment of the carrying charges which preserve the property.\u201d We recognized in <em>Baran v. Jaskulski, </em>114 Md.App. 322, 328, 689 A.2d 1283 (1997), that <em>Crawford </em>\u201cabolished the presumption of gift between separated spouses and permitted a spouse to seek contribution in those instances when married parties were not residing together and one of them, or the other, had paid a disproportionate amount of the carrying costs of property.\u201d We explained in <em>Baran </em>that separated spouses can recover contribution from the other for expenses relating to the marital home:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">Crawford Credits\u2014the general law of contribution between cotenants of jointly owned property applies when married parties, owning property jointly, separate. A married, but separated, cotenant is, in the absence of an ouster (or its equivalent) of the nonpaying spouse, entitled to contribution for those expenses the paying spouse has paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 332, 689 A.2d 1283. \u201cBecause preservation of the property accrues to the benefit of the co-tenant, a tenant by the entirety may also be entitled to contribution for payments of the mortgage and taxes.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>174 Md.App. at 641, 923 A.2d 149. Thus, \u201c[cjontribution is a factor that may be considered in making a monetary award ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Broseus v. Broseus, </em>82 Md.App. 183, 192-93, 570 A.2d 874 (1990)). \u201cOn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the other hand, a trial judge is not obligated to award such contribution between husband and wife at the time of a divorce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Imagnu v. Wodajo, </em>85 Md.App. 208, 223, 582 A.2d 590 (1990)). And \u201cthe award of contribution is an equitable remedy within the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, 923 A.2d 149 (citing <em>Keys v. Keys, </em>93 Md.App. 677, 681, 614 A.2d 975 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We disagree with Wife that the circuit court erred in awarding what essentially constituted <em>Crawford </em>credits. Husband and Wife separated on May 30, 2013. After separating, Wife stayed in the marital home with Child, and they lived with two different men shortly after the separation. Beginning sometime around November 2013, Wife stopped paying the mortgage. When the marital home was one day away from being put into foreclosure, Husband, with assistance from the Grandparents, paid the mortgage to prevent the foreclosure from going forward, all when Husband no longer lived there. We see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to award Husband, the sole party paying the mortgage on the house, contribution against those payments from Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">E. The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Awarding Child Support To The Grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">After the custody merits hearing and oral ruling, the court issued an interim order dated September 24, 2014 awarding the Grandparents sole legal and physical custody of Child. The interim order further ordered that Husband \u201cshall pay Child Support in the amount of $500.00 per month for the minor child, commencing October 1, 2014 directly to the [Grandparents]\u201d and \u201cthat the Assignment Office shall set a hearing before the Master to determine Child support payments to be made by [Wife].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">That hearing took place on March 1, 2015 before a magistrate. Wife\u2019s counsel argued that child support had been addressed already, simultaneously with child custody, in the Final Order, which did not include an award of child support. The Grandparents responded (perhaps ironically) that the Final Order did not override the interim orders that provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>for a child support hearing, except to the extent that the second interim order specifically reduced Wife\u2019s access to the Child. The Grandparents pointed out that the parties\u2019 income and Child\u2019s expenses had not yet been considered, and that child support could not have been considered during the custody merits hearing because the Grandparents had not yet been awarded custody. The Grandparents also pointed to their earlier testimony to the effect that \u201cthat they could support [Child] in the normal fashion ..., but [Child], unfortunately, had very high out-of-pocket expenses due to therapy, and psychological therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">At the hearing, the Grandparents offered the testimony from a pediatric and adolescent psychiatrist who, along with a psychologist, have been treating Child and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The Grandparents offered evidence regarding Wife\u2019s and Husband\u2019s income, and the un-reimbursed medical amounts they had paid for Child\u2019s treatment. At the conclusion of the Grandparents\u2019 case, Wife\u2019s counsel moved for judgment on the ground that the Grandparents failed to present any evidence of their incomes, and the magistrate denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">On March 24, 2015, the magistrate issued an oral recommendation. The magistrate found, among other things, that the Final Order was not a final judgment because it did not adjudicate all of the claims at issue, and ordered Husband and Wife to pay child support to the Grandparents because parents have a legal obligation to financially support their children. Using the Child Support Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d), the magistrate awarded the Grandparents child support dating back to December 30, 2014, the date of filing, in the amount of $1,467 per month from Wife and $629 per month from Husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Wife filed Objections To The Family Law Magistrate\u2019s Recommendations Concerning Findings Of Fact And Conclusions Of Law (\u201cObjections\u201d) on April 2, 2015. She argued that the Grandparents should not be awarded child support because the court did not award any child support to them in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Final Order after the custody merits hearing, the Grandparents voluntarily assumed the obligations of support, the child support award was \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and constituted 47% of Wife\u2019s gross salary, and the Grandparents are, in her words, \u201cextraordinarily wealthy.\u201d In two separate orders entered on May 26, 2015, the circuit court denied Wife\u2019s Objections and granted the Grandparents\u2019 Motion for Child Support.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">For purposes of this appeal, Wife refers us to her Objections and argues that \u201cthe order of child support ..., payable to the wealthy [Grandparents], was not in accordance with the appropriate child support provisions that did not take into account the parties\u2019 relative wealth.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u201cA parent has both a common law and statutory duty to support his or her minor children,\u201d <em>In re Katherine C., </em>390 Md. 554, 570, 890 A.2d 295 (2006)\u2014a principle which the magistrate judge in this case correctly noted. \u201cThe parents of the child, jointly and severally, have a responsibility and obligation to provide child support if they are capable of doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 890 A.2d 295 (citing FL \u00a7 5-203(b)). The Guidelines define the monetary scope of that duty. <em>See </em>FL tit. 12; <em>Drummond v. State, </em>350 Md. 502, 520-21, 714 A.2d 163 (1998); <em>Tannehill v. Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App, 4, 11, 591 A.2d 888 (1991). \u201c[T]he amount of a child support award is [ordinarily] governed by the circumstances of the case and is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d and that \u201cdetermination should not be disturbed unless he has acted arbitrarily in administering his discretion or was clearly wrong,\u201d <em>Gates v. Gates, </em>83 Md.App. 661, 663, 577 A.2d 382 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We see nothing in the statute or elsewhere to suggest that the guidelines should not apply when a third party has custody of a child and seeks child support from the noncustodial parents. Indeed, a parent has an obligation to pay child support to a custodial third party, <em>see Newkirk v. Newkirk, 73 </em>Md.App. 588, 596-97, 535 A.2d 947 (1988) (holding that divorced father continued to owe child support to his children\u2019s deceased mother\u2019s brother where she asked her brother to be the guardian of her minor children), and there is no reason to view the extent of the support obligation differently simply because the payee is someone other than the parent. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 12-202(a) (\u201c[I]n any proceeding to establish or modify child support, whether pendente lite or permanent, the court <em>shall </em>use the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle [\u00a7 12-204].\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also In re Katherine C., </em>390 Md. at 566, 890 A.2d 295 (applying the Guidelines where \u201cthe child support monies will go towards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the reimbursement of State care\u201d); <em>In re Joshua W., </em>94 Md.App. 486, 500, 617 A.2d 1154 (1993) (concluding that \u201cthe General Assembly intended that these child support guidelines be used in all child support cases, including those, like the one at hand, involving government financed child care and no custodial parent\u201d). Nor do we see any reason to deviate from the statutory list of financial considerations, <em>see </em>FL \u00a7 12-204 (adjusted income of the parents, child care expenses, extraordinary medical expenses, school and transportation expenses, and third-party payments, such as disability or retirement dependency benefits), and add consideration of the custodial third party\u2019s financial circumstances. The support obligations lie with the parents, not the Grandparents, and nothing about the Grandparents\u2019 means relieves (or should relieve) Wife of her obligations to the Child. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to award child support to the Grandparents both from Wife and Husband, nor in the amount awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.

Whether \"exceptional circumstances\u201d or parental unfitness could be found in circumstances such as this, including where Child Welfare Services, a court ordered custody evaluator and a court ordered psychologist found the appellant was fit and had no disorders, and the custody evaluator had recommended that the appellant be awarded custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">4. Whether the trial judge otherwise abused his discretion in his application of the evidence or whether he exhibited bias in a comparison of the Appellee Grandparents to the Appellant mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">5. Whether the Appellant\u2019s constitutional due process and parental rights were violated, and whether he abused his discretion, when the trial judge severely limited the Appellant's visitation with the minor child after taking \"testimony\u201d in an unorthodox manner of personally questioning the expert, who was not a sworn witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>and stood in the back of the room, while not permitting cross examination or further review?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">6. Whether the trial judge had jurisdiction or abused his discretion in permitting the Appellee Third Party grandparents to intervene in the divorce property distribution hearing for \"judicial convenience\u201d when the Appellant has a right to a jury trial on this claim, it is not permitted in the family law statute or procedure, and without the Appellee Third Party filing a motion, providing notice, providing discovery, or filing a cause of action, and whether the trial judge's conclusions were based on the actual evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">7. Whether the trial judge\u2019s order addressing the $9,628.38 in \u201ccontributions\u201d made towards maintenance of the family home properly considered and applied the claims made by both parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">8. Whether the order of child support, payable to the Appellee Grandparents, was in accordance with the appropriate child support provisions that did not take into account the wealth of the custodial grandparents?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">. Other states proceed differently. In <em>McDermott, </em>385 Md. at 369-70, 869 A.2d 751, the Court of Appeals discussed <em>Chavez v. Chavez, </em>148 S.W.3d 449, 458-59 (Tex. App. 2004), a case \u201cwhere a third-party grandparent intervened in a divorce case seeking to have conservator-ship created in respect to the children of the marriage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b287-7\">. We also see no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to deny Wife's Emergency Motion to Postpone/Continue Custody Trial Scheduled For September 15. Wife contends that the court should have continued the custody merits hearing to allow an expert to testify as to Child\u2019s present condition. Wife asserts that a continuance would have allowed her to receive prior notice on the \"exceptional circumstances\u201d factors in <em>Hoffman </em>and given her time to provide \"data, assessment, and expertise\u201d regarding Child\u2019s recent behavioral problems. Maryland Rule 2-508(a) provides that \u201d[o]n motion of any party or on its own initiative, the court may continue a trial or other proceeding as justice may require.\u201d \"The ruling on a motion for continuance rests in the sound discretion of the court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Market Tavern, Inc. v. Bowen, </em>92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Md.App. 622, 644, 610 A.2d 295 (1992) (citations omitted). But nothing in the record suggests that the court sought or needed an expert evaluation, or that denying a continuance prejudiced Wife\u2019s ability to make her case for custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">. This was true with regard to several of the hearings in this case, although ultimately (again, after effort on the part of our Clerk and his staff that should not have been necessary in the first place; we could simply have dismissed the appeal instead) Wife obtained and submitted enough of the transcripts relating to the other issues that we could address their merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\">. The Grandparents argue in their brief that the circuit court's ruling should be affirmed because Wife didn\u2019t adhere to Rule 9\u2014208(g)(1) when she failed to order a copy of the transcript of the hearing before the magistrate or cite to the record in her Objections. Rule 9-208 states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">(f) Exceptions. Within ten days after recommendations are placed on the record or served pursuant to section (e) of this Rule, a party may file exceptions with die clerk. Within that period or within ten days after service of the first exceptions, whichever is later, any other party may file exceptions. Exceptions shall be in writing and shall set forth the asserted error with particularity. Any matter not specifically set forth in the exceptions is waived unless the court finds that justice requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">(g) Requirements for Excepting Party, At the time the exceptions are filed, the excepting party shall do one of the following: (1) order a transcript of so much of the testimony as is necessary to rule on the exceptions, make an agreement for payment to ensure preparation of the transcript, and file a certificate of compliance stating that the transcript has been ordered and the agreement has been made; (2) file a certification that no transcript is necessary to rule on the exceptions; (3) file an agreed statement of facts in lieu of the transcript; or (4) file an affidavit of indigency and motion requesting that the court accept an electronic recording of the proceedings as the transcript. Within ten days after the entry of an order denying a motion under subsection (g)(4) of this section, the excepting party shall comply with subsection (g)(1). The transcript shall be filed within 30 days after compliance with subsection (g)(1) or within such longer time, not exceeding 60 days after the exceptions are filed, as the magistrate may allow. For good cause shown, the court may shorten or extend the time for the filing of the transcript. The excepting party shall serve a copy of the transcript on the other party. The court may dismiss the exceptions of a party who has not complied with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>The Grandparents, however, did not raise this issue in the circuit court and there is no indication in the record, particularly in the court\u2019s order on the merits of Wife\u2019s Objections, that Wife did not provide a transcript with her Objections.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
