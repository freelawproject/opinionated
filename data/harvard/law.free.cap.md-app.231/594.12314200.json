After counterclaims were filed, the circuit court issued an order that stayed the proceedings in the circuit court \u201cpending administrative review of the parties\u2019 dispute by the State Board of Education\u201d (the \u201cState Board\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">On appeal, the Charter Schools present a single question for our review, which we have rephrased, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">Did the circuit court err in staying the proceedings pending administrative review on the ground that the State Board has primary jurisdiction over the issues raised in the complaint?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s order is not an appealable order, and therefore, we shall dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">A decision to dismiss an appeal typically will not require a detailed discussion of background facts and law. In this case, however, the nature of the issues presented to the circuit court, including the connection between the authority of the State Board with respect to school budgets and the issues presented in the Charter Schools\u2019 breach of contract claim, requires some background discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">State Board\u2019s Authority Over Public Schools</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Maryland Code (2014) \u00a7 2-205 of the Education Article (\u201cED\u201d) sets forth the \u201cbroad\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d authority of the State Board. <em>See Bd. of Educ. for Dorchester County v. Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 787-88, 506 A.2d 625 (1986). It \u201cexercised general control and supervision over the public schools and educational interests in this State,\u201d ED \u00a7 2\u2014205(g)(2), determines the \u201ceducational policies of this State,\u201d ED \u00a7 2-205(b), and it \u201cshall decide all controversies and disputes under\u201d the Education Article. ED \u00a7 2-205(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The Court of Appeals has stated that ED \u00a7 2-205 provides the State Board with \u201cvisitatorial power of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>comprehensive character as to invest the State Board \u201cwith the last word on any matter concerning educational policy or the administration of the system of public education.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>305 Md. at 788, 506 A.2d 625 (quoting <em>Bd. of Educ. of Prince George\u2019s County v. Waeldner, </em>298 Md. 354, 360, 470 A.2d 332 (1984)). <em>Accord Baltimore City Bd. of Sch. Commr\u2019s v. City Neighbors Charter Sch., </em>400 Md. 324, 343, 929 A.2d 113 (2007) (State Board has the \u201cparamount role\u201d \u201cin interpreting the public education law.\u201d). Although that visitatorial power is not unlimited, \u201c \u2018the paramount role of the State Board of Education in interpreting the public education law sets it apart from most administrative agencies,\u2019 \u201d <em>Patterson Park Pub. Charter Sch., Inc. v. Baltimore Teachers Union, </em>399 Md. 174, 195, 923 A.2d 60 (2007) (quoting <em>Hubbard, </em>305 Md. at 790-91, 506 A.2d 625), and \u201c \u2018decisions of the State Board of Education are entitled to greater deference than those of most other administrative agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 923 A.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Charter School Funding</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Charter schools have been described as \u201csemi-autonomous public schools that operate under a contract with a State or local school board.\u201d <em>City Neighbors, </em>400 Md. at 328, 929 A.2d 113. \u201cThe contract, or charter, defines how the school will be structured, staffed, managed, and funded, what programs will be offered, and how the school will operate and account for its activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">In 2003, the General Assembly created the Maryland Public Charter School Program by enacting Title 9 to the Education Article. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 929 A.2d 113. The purpose of the charter school system is to \u201cestablish an alternative means within the existing public school system in order to provide innovative learning opportunities and creative educational approaches to improve the education of students.\u201d ED \u00a7 9-101(b). Because charter schools are public schools, they generally are subject to the \u201cprovisions of law and regulation governing other public schools.\u201d ED \u00a7 9-102(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The General Assembly, in \u201ctrying to fashion a formula for public funding\u201d for charter schools, opted not to set a \u201cspecific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>formula,\u201d but rather, it determined that funding for charter schools should be in an amount \u201ccommensurate\u201d with the amount disbursed to other public schools. <em>City Neighbors, </em>400 Md. at 354-55, 929 A.2d 113. Accordingly, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFtm\">A county board shall disburse to a public charter school an amount of county, State, and federal money for elementary, middle, and secondary students that is commensurate with the amount disbursed to other public schools in the local jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">ED \u00a7 9-109(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained that this funding provision \u201cnecessarily left some room for interpretation\u2014what was commensurate and how was the amount disbursed to other public schools to be determined when no amounts were actually disbursed to public schools?\u201d <em>City Neighbors, </em>400 Md. at 355, 929 A.2d 113, The Court stated that, by providing for funding in this manner, the legislature \u201cmust have envisioned that\u201d the State Board, \u201cthe body it has consistently vested with the ultimate administrative authority to interpret, explain, and apply the public education laws\u2014would have the primary authority to interpret, and the ultimate authority to implement, that provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Commensurate Funding Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In May 2005, the State Board issued opinions addressing several charter school funding cases. <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 929 A.2d 113.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State Board concluded that the phrase \u201ccommensurate with the amount disbursed to other public schools in the local jurisdiction\u201d meant that a public charter school would receive funding in an \u201camount proportionate to the amount of funds expended for elementary, middle, and secondary level students in the other public schools in the same system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>336, 929 A.2d 113. That included \u201cfunding for services for which students in the public charter schools are eligible such as free and reduced price meals, prekindergarten, special education, English language learners, Perkins, Title I, and transportation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Noting that there was \u201cno statewide formula or methodology for determining how local school systems fund their schools,\u201d the State Board decided on an \u201caverage per-pupil amount,\u201d which is then multiplied by the student enrollment of the school. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37, 929 A.2d 113. The formula to determine the average per-pupil amount was the \u201c[t]otal annual school system operating budget,\u201d excluding debt service and adult education, divided by the \u201cSeptember 30 enrollment count for the previous year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 929 A.2d 113 &amp; n.5. This amount was then reduced by <em>2% </em>for reasonable administrative costs of performing school system central office functions. <em>Id. </em>at 337, 929 A.2d 113.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court determined that the Board\u2019s use of an average per pupil funding approach \u201chad the virtues of both simplicity and flexibility,\u201d given that, at that time, there was not an enrollment history at the schools \u201cupon which to base a more refined enrollment-driven allocation of funds.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 355-56, 929 A.2d 113. Once that type of history existed, however, the Board could revisit the issue. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 929 A.2d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Board again addressed charter school funding in <em>Monocacy Montessori Communities, Inc. v. Frederick County Board of Education, </em>MSBE Op. No. 06-17, p. 3 (May 24, 2006). As this Court explained in <em>Frederick Classical Charter School, Inc. v. Frederick County Board of Education, </em>227 Md.App. 439, 446, 134 A.3d 376, <em>cert. granted, </em>448 Md. 724, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>141 A.3d 135 (2016), the Board in <em>Monocacy </em>determined that \u201ca school system could use a different formula so long as it resulted in a \u2018bottom line amount of money\u2019 \u201d that the Board could conclude amounted to the school system providing \u201cproportionate/commensurate funds to the charter school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">More recently, in <em>Frederick Classical, </em>the Board again addressed funding issues relating to a charter school. This Court upheld the Board\u2019s determination that the charter school was not entitled to funding for transportation costs when, pursuant to its charter agreement, the school did not \u201cparticipate in the public school transportation program,\u201d but rather, the families of the students provided transportation. <em>Id. </em>at 459, 134 A.3d 376. The Board determined that a charter school is not entitled to receive funds for services it does not provide, and if it did, it would receive \u201cmore than its share of commensurate county funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 134 A.3d 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Proceedings in the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"AjQi\">In 2015, a number of Baltimore City\u2019s public charter schools filed breach of contract complaints against the City Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaints alleged that, for the 2015-2016 school year, there would be 34 charter schools in Baltimore City, \u201cwith a combined enrollment of approximately 13,724 students, or more than 15% of Baltimore City\u2019s public school enrollment.\u201d The Charter Schools asserted that the Charter School Agreement (the \u201cContract\u201d) that they entered into with the City Board, addressed, among other things, funding of the schools and the City Board\u2019s obligation to provide financial transparency in the funding process. Specifically, the Contract provided the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">6.1 OPERATING FUNDS. The parties agree that Title 9[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] requires funding of the charter school that is commensurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>with the amount disbursed to other public schools in the local jurisdiction, and that Commensurate Funding is integral to this contractual relationship and essential to the School Operator\u2019s ability to operate the School hereunder and that all funds provided by the School Board to the school are to be used solely for the benefit of the school and its students. Accordingly, during each school year during the Term, the School Board shall allocate Commensurate Funding to the School Operator for the following school year pursuant to Applicable Requirements. Any financial commitment on the part of the School System contained in this Agreement is subject to the annual appropriation by the School Board. The School Board\u2019s staff shall deliver to the School Operator a draft of the funding formula including the amount of the estimated per pupil allocation for the applicable school year (determined in accordance with the School Board\u2019s \u201capproved funding formula\u201d and Applicable Requirements) and will make a good faith effort to deliver these materials in no less than two weeks prior to the budget (distinct from the Budget of the School Operator covered in Section 6.2) submission deadline for the School, such deadline to be consistent with the deadline for all School System schools. The draft document will include: (i) the School System\u2019s budget and line item amounts necessary to calculate the per pupil allocation, and (ii) copies of any materials or documentation related thereto that is delivered to the School Board for public presentation. Additionally, the School Board agrees to make reasonable efforts to provide to the School Operator background information on the methodology and assumptions behind the calculations as soon as such materials are available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The complaints asserted one count for breach of contract, averring that the City Board \u201cis contractually obligated to provide [the Charter Schools] \u2018commensurate funding\u2019 under the Contracts, but has failed to do so\u201d; the City Board \u201cis contractually obligated to provide [the Charter Schools] certain budget and financial information under the Contracts, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>has failed to do so\u201d; and the Charter Schools \u201cha[ve] sustained damages and will continue to sustain damages as a result of [the City Board\u2019s] breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Specifically, the complaints alleged that the City Board never provided the Charter Schools with commensurate funding, and instead, \u201cfrom year to year, arbitrarily presented charter school operators with take-it-or-leave-it charter school per pupil figures derived using varying (or no) calculation methodology, inflated estimates of overall System enrollment, and unsupported and dubious financial and budget figures.\u201d Further, the City Board \u201cfailed to apply the per pupil calculation methodology put forth by the [State Board] and affirmed by the Court of Appeals,\u201d and it not only failed to disclose the details of its calculations, but it \u201cunilaterally changed their methodology in developing the amount to be disbursed to charter schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The City Board filed motions \u201cto dismiss, or in the alternative, motion to stay,\u201d asserting, among other things, that the \u201cgravamen\u201d of the complaints, that the City Board had not provided \u201ccommensurate funding\u201d for charter school students, was a matter that should be decided by the State Board, not the court, under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Noting that it had filed, the same day as it filed the motions to dismiss, a petition for declaratory relief with the State Board, seeking a ruling that it had provided commensurate funding and properly applied the funding formula, the City Board asked that the complaints be dismissed pending a decision from the State Board. Alternatively, the City Board proposed that the circuit court proceedings be stayed until the State Board, the body best equipped to hear those issues, had ruled on the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Charter Schools opposed the City Board\u2019s motions, asserting that the circuit court, not the State Board, \u201chas proper jurisdiction over this breach of contract action.\u201d They asserted that the relief being sought was \u201cequitable and legal redress and monetary damages for [the City Board\u2019s] ongoing breach of its contractual obligations to pass through commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>surate funding to [the Charter Schools] and its students in an open and transparent process,\u201d which is \u201cnot a dispute resolvable through administrative remedies.\u201d In any event, they argued, \u201cthe only remedy the ... State Board ... could provide\u2014its own interpretation of [the City Board\u2019s] related statutory obligations,\u201d including the methodology applicable to funding of charter schools, had already been decided in <em>City Neighbors. </em>Thus, they asserted, to the extent the State Board \u201cever had \u2018primary jurisdiction\u2019 over its interpretation of [ED \u00a7 9-109] that jurisdiction has long been fully completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">With respect to the alternative relief requested, the Charter Schools asserted that the City Board\u2019s motions to stay should be denied because its petition to the State Board was not asking the State Board to interpret the \u201ctrue intent and meaning\u201d of education law, but instead, it was requesting that the State Board \u201capply the education law, as already explained and interpreted, and incorporated into a contract, to a specific set of circumstances.\u201d Moreover, they asserted that, because the State Board was not required to issue a declaratory ruling, if the motions to stay were granted, appellants could \u201cbe left indefinitely without any result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">After a hearing on January 8, 2016, the circuit court issued a lengthy oral ruling from the bench. The court relied heavily on the <em>City Neighbors </em>opinion, stating that the following paragraph in the opinion was important:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">Finally, perhaps in light of the fact that it was already dealing with three charter schools and that there were several others in the pipeline and that it was issuing a declaratory ruling, the Board noted that its opinions should be used as \u201cguidance and direction\u201d to other charter school applicants and local school systems \u201cfor the refinement of the working relationships on behalf of the public school children throughout this [S]tate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">(quoting <em>City </em>Neighbors, 400 Md. at 839, 929 A.2d 113), The circuit court explained that this paragraph was important because it showed that the State Board understood that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>methodology identified \u201cshould be used as guidance and direction\u201d in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The court ultimately determined that <em>City Neighbors </em>\u201cprovided sufficient guidance\u201d regarding the meaning of commensurate funding, including the \u201crequisite factors to be considered, the data to be considered.\u201d Under these circumstances, it concluded that the court was \u201cno longer obliged to punt the issue to the expertise of the administrative body,\u201d but rather, it was entitled \u201cto decline to invoke primary jurisdiction.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">After the circuit court ruled, the State Board dismissed the City Board\u2019s petition, without prejudice. It noted that the circuit court had \u201casserted its jurisdiction\u201d on the issue, and it did not serve the interests of conserving judicial (and quasi-judicial) resources to have parallel proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Subsequently, the City Board filed counterclaims against the Charter Schools. It stated that Baltimore City is the fourth largest school system in Maryland, serving 85,000 students in 186 schools and programs. Of those 186 schools, 84 are public charter schools, and approximately 16% of all students in public schools attend charter schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The counterclaim alleged that the City Board\u2019s goals for schools had to \u201cbe carried out with limited resources that must be spread across a diverse population of students with varying needs,\u201d and if \u201cCharter Schools receive more than their legally required share, less money is available for students attending Traditional Public Schools.\u201d The City Board asserted that Charter Schools had received services that exceed \u201cthe 2% administrative cost included in the funding formula,\u201d and as a result, the Charter Schools had \u201creceived more funding than the Traditional Public Schools.\u201d Accordingly, because the parties disputed \u201cwhich services provided by the District Office are appropriately included in \u2018Administrative Costs,\u2019 \u201d the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Board sought a \u201cdeclaratory judgment regarding which services provided by the District Office are appropriately included in the funding formula 2% line item for \u2018Administrative Costs.\u2019 \u201d The City Board also sought damages for breach of contract by the Charter Schools and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">On April 18, 2016, a hearing was held on the Charter Schools\u2019 motion to dismiss the counterclaims. At the hearing, the court questioned whether there was an administrative procedure pending, and it asked \u201cwhat happened that causes you to rightfully be in my courtroom.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel for the City Board responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">I wish I was in front of you several months ago. I think in January we had a hearing on a motion to dismiss where we argued exactly what Your Honor is stating, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction that this case should be stayed in favor of the State Board ... making a determination of these issues and our motion was denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">After further discussion regarding the procedural history of the case, and after a brief recess, the court noted that the City Board \u201cwould like to make an oral motion at this time.\u201d Counsel for the City Board then moved to dismiss \u201con the basis that the appropriate tribunal or court or body to hear this matter is the State Board of Education.\u201d Citing <em>City Neighbors, </em>counsel stated that the \u201ccase law is very clear that that body should be the first one to take up matters such as the ones that have been raised by the Plaintiff here relating to intricate, detailed, and important issues of public policy relating to education and educational funding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Counsel for the Charter Schools responded that the claim raised in the complaint was for breach of contract, and the resolution of such disputes are for the courts. Counsel asserted that the issue of commensurate funding had already been settled and affirmed by the courts, thus \u201csatisfying the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>quirements of primary jurisdiction of letting the administrative agency have a crack at setting out the interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The court ultimately granted the Charter Schools\u2019 motion to dismiss the counterclaim seeking declaratory judgment, without prejudice. With respect to the other matters, however, it ruled that dismissal was not appropriate, and the action should be stayed \u201cpending the matter be administratively reviewed before it comes to the [cjircuit [cjourt.\u201d The court entered a written order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On May 5, 2016, the Charter Schools filed this appeal seeking review of the court\u2019s stay order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The issue presented by the Charter Schools involves the exhaustion of administrative remedies. As the Court of Appeals has explained, when the General Assembly provides an administrative remedy and a judicial remedy to resolve a matter, the relationship between the remedies typically falls into one of three categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201c[T]he administrative remedy may be exclusive, thus precluding any resort to an alternative remedy. Under this scenario, there simply is no alternative cause of action for matters covered by the statutory administrative remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATp\">[T]he administrative remedy may be primary but not exclusive. In this situation, a claimant must invoke and exhaust the administrative remedy, and seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision, before a court can properly adjudicate the merits of the alternative judicial remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>[T]he administrative remedy and the alternative judicial remedy may be fully concurrent, with neither remedy being primary, and the plaintiff at his or her option may pursue the judicial remedy without the necessity of invoking and exhausting the administrative remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><em>United Ins. Co. of Am. v. Maryland Ins. Admin., </em>450 Md. 1, 14-15, 144 A.3d 1230 (2016) (quoting <em>Prince George\u2019s County, v. Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. 632, 644-45, 922 A.2d 495 (2007)). In the situation where there is no \u201cspecific statutory language indicating the type of administrative remedy, there is a rebut-table presumption that an administrative remedy was intended to be primary,\u201d which means that \u201c \u2018a claimant cannot maintain the alternative judicial action without first invoking and exhausting the administrative remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 144 A.3d 1230 (quoting <em>Zappone v. Liberty Life Ins.

Code (2013) ] \u00a7 12-303 [of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article], the collateral order doctrine, or Rule 2-602(b), a party may appeal only from a final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>FutureCare, </em>229 Md. App. at 118, 143 A.3d 191. We will address first whether the Stay Order is a final judgment, and then we will address the Charter School\u2019s claim that the order is appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201c[T]o constitute a final judgment, a trial court\u2019s ruling \u2018must either decide and conclude the rights of the parties involved or deny a party the means to prosecute or defend rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md. Bd. of Physicians v. Geier, </em>451 Md. 526, 545, 154 A.3d 1211, 2017 WL 281914 (2017) (quoting <em>Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 565, 989 A.2d 210). Here, the Stay Order did not conclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>rights of the parties or adjudicate all of the claims in the action. Thus, the issue is whether the Stay Order denied the Charter Schools the ability to litigate its breach of contract claim and resulted in the Charter Schools being put effectively out of court. <em>See Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 571, 989 A.2d 210 (an order compelling arbitration of a controversy is appealable as a final judgment because it \u201c \u2018has the effect of putting the parties out of court\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach v. Pessoa Constr. Co., </em>330 Md. 744, 750-53, 625 A.2d 1014 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Here, City Board argues that the Stay Order did not have the effect of putting the Charter Schools out of court because it merely \u201cdirected that the parties first go to the State Board,\u201d which is \u201ca jurisdictional issue regarding which body should hear threshold issues in the case in the first instance.\u201d We agree. Once the State Board makes a determination on the commensurate funding issues presented, the breach of contract case can return to the circuit court and proceed on the merits. The Stay Order effectively operates as a postponement of trial, not as an order resulting in the Charter Schools being put effectively out of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Other courts have reached a similar conclusion. For example, in <em>Crystal Clear Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. SW Bell Tel. Co., </em>415 F.3d 1171, 1173 (10th Cir. 2005), a federal trial court issued an order similar to the one here, staying a lawsuit filed by several payphone providers against Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, pending the resolution of certain issues by federal and state agencies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted that, although a decision to stay litigation ordinarily does not constitute a final judgment, there is an exception for a stay order that puts a party \u201ceffectively out of court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175 (quoting <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 10 n.11, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983)). The Court held, however, that the order in that case, staying the proceedings in court pending resolution of certain issues by the agencies pursuant to the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>jurisdiction doctrine, with contemplation of return to court, was not a final decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1176-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">That is not to say that a stay order pending administrative review can never qualify as a final judgment. In <em>Occidental Chem. Corp. v. Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>810 F.3d 299, 305, 307 (5th Cir. 2016), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit addressed whether an order by a federal court indefinitely staying proceedings to allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to act on an administrative complaint was a final judgment when the court retained jurisdiction for a later determination on the merits. The Fifth Circuit held that the order <em>in that case </em>\u201cfunctioned as a final decision\u201d because it resulted in Occidental being \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d for a protracted and indefinite period, and therefore, the order was appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Here, there is no indication that the State Board will delay in deciding the commensurate funding issue. Although the State Board declined to weigh in on the issue while the matter was simultaneously being pursued in court, that reasoning no longer is applicable. Because there is no indication that there will be a substantial delay in obtaining an administrative ruling, if there is a proper request, the Stay Order does not place the Charter Schools \u201ceffectively out of court.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Stay Order merely postpones resolution of the contract case pending guidance from the State Board on the commensurate funding issues. Under these circumstances, the Stay Order is not a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We thus turn to the Charter School\u2019s argument that the Stay Order is appealable under the collateral order doctrine. This doctrine is \u201c \u2018based upon a judicially created fiction, under which certain interlocutory orders are consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ered to be final judgments, even though such orders clearly are <em>not </em>final judgments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Geier, </em>at 546, 154 A.3d 1211 (quoting <em>Dawkins v. Balt. City Police Dep\u2019t, </em>376 Md. 53, 64, 827 A.2d 115 (2003)). Application of the doctrine \u201c \u2018is very limited\u2019 \u201d <em>Schuele, </em>412 Md. at 572, 989 A.2d 210 (quoting <em>Walker v. State, </em>392 Md. 1, 15, 895 A.2d 1024 (2006)), and it \u201cshould be applied sparingly in only the most extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">To be appealed under the collateral order doctrine, an order must meet the following four requirements: \u201c \u2018(1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue, (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, <em>and </em>(4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Walker, </em>392 Md. at 15, 895 A.2d 1024). These requirements are \u201cstrictly applied.\u201d <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 59, 827 A.2d 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The Charter Schools contend that the Stay Order meets each of the four requirements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Initially, the Stay Order does not meet the third requirement, that it resolve an issue separate from the merits of the action. Indeed, other courts have found that \u201cthe issues involved in a determination of primary jurisdiction are \u2018inextricably bound up\u2019 with a determination of the merits\u201d of a case. <em>Crystal Clear, </em>415 F.3d at 1179-80 (quoting <em>Richman Bros. Records, Inc. v. U.S. Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co., </em>953 F.2d 1431, 1447 (1991)). As the court in <em>Crystal Clear </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">The entire purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine is to allow agencies to render opinions on issues underlying and related to the cause of action. <em>See United States v. W. Pac. R.R. Co., </em>352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126 (1956). Moreover, in order to determine whether the doctrine of primary jurisdiction was implicated in this case, the district court was required to give preliminary consideration to plaintiffs\u2019 claims to determine the extent to which they fell under the jurisdiction of the FCC and OCC. <em>See Delta Traffic Serv., Inc. v. Occidental Chem. Corp., </em>846 F.2d 911, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>914 (3d Cir.1988) (\u201cOnly after [the district court] had ascertained the nature of the claim and related defenses could it know whether it needed to request the expert and specialized knowledge of the [agency] as a preliminary step in the resolution of this matter.\u201d (quotation omitted)). In particular, the district court\u2019s decision whether to invoke primary jurisdiction required it to consider whether the issues of fact in the case: (1) are not within the conventional experience of judges; (2) require the exercise of administrative discretion; or (3) require uniformity and consistency in the regulation of the business entrusted to a particular agency. <em>See Marshall v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., </em>874 F.2d 1373, 1377 (10th Cir.1989). These issues are all highly dependent on the specific allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and required the district court to examine factual and legal issues underlying the dispute. The parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, filled with detailed factual and legal arguments regarding plaintiffs\u2019 claims, further underscore the impropriety of reviewing the district court\u2019s stay order prior to final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1179 (parallel citations omitted). <em>Accord Beach TV Cable Co. v. Comcast of Florida/Georgia, LLC, </em>808 F.3d 1284, 1292 (11th Cir. 2015) (order staying action pending resolution of issue by an administrative agency, pursuant to the primary jurisdiction doctrine, is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine because \u201cdecision whether to refer a case for administrative action was sufficiently bound up with the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We agree with this reasoning. A trial court\u2019s determination whether the primary jurisdiction doctrine is applicable \u201cis not sufficiently separable from the cause of action\u201d to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 1291.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The Charter Schools contend, however, that <em>Crystal Clear </em>\u201cruns counter to established Maryland law\u201d and \u201ccannot constitute even persuasive authority.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><em>County Comm\u2019rs of Frederick County v. Schrodel, </em>320 Md. 202, 577 A.2d 39 (1990), upon which the Charter Schools rely, is distinguishable. In that case, Frederick County brought an eminent domain action to acquire property for use as a landfill. <em>Id. </em>at 204, 577 A.2d 39. The circuit court granted the Schrodels\u2019 motion for a postponement of the condemnation trial on the merits, enjoining the condemnation action until the County obtained a Maryland Department of the Environment permit to construct a landfill on the property. <em>Id. </em>at 210-12, 577 A.2d 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that the order was an appealable interlocutory order under the collateral order doctrine because the order \u201cha[d] the effect of blocking the County from prosecuting its condemnation action against the Schrodels unless and until it obtained] a state permit to construct the landfill on the property,\u201d thereby satisfying \u201call four requirements of the collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212, 577 A.2d 39. First, the Court noted that the order \u201cconclusively determined that the County must wait until it receives a permit from the Maryland Department of the Environment before it can go to trial with its condemnation case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cthe issue of whether a court can lawfully impose such a condition on the government\u2019s power to acquire property by condemnation is clearly important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, \u201cthe question of whether the County can be required to obtain the permit before having a trial is obviously distinct from the trial itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And fourth, the Court stated that, \u201cif not appealable until the trial\u2019s conclusion, the claim that the County\u2019s right to condemn cannot be conditioned on first obtaining all necessary permits would irretrievably be lost,\u201d as the \u201cgovernment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>already will have had to comply with a possibly unlawful condition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The Court noted that a stay order ordinarily is not appeal-able. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 577 A.2d 39. In holding, however, that the interlocutory order in that case was appealable, the Court noted the unique circumstances of that case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">The circuit court granted no ordinary postponement of the trial. Not only is the length at least eighteen months, but it is certain that there will never be a trial if the County fails to obtain the permit. The order in this case assures that if the County does get the permit, only then can it prepare the property as a landfill. An important government prerogative has been delayed or defeated because of an allegedly unlawful condition. The vast majority of postponement orders, in contrast, merely require a party to wait longer for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 214, 577 A.2d 39. The Court emphasized \u201cthat this is a case where \u2018our holding concerning appealability goes no further than the circumstances presented in this case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 210, 477 A.2d 759 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">This case is very different from <em>Schrodel. </em>Initially, as previously explained, unlike the issue of whether a permit is required before prosecuting a condemnation action, the issue of primary jurisdiction is \u201cbound up\u201d with the merits of the action. Thus, although the third requirement of the collateral order doctrine was satisfied in <em>Schrodel, </em>it is not satisfied in this case. Moreover, the Stay Order here, unlike the order in <em>Schrodel, </em>is more akin to a mere postponement of trial. Once the State Board makes a determination on the commensurate funding issue, a determination entrusted to the State Board, Charter Schools can return to the circuit court and proceed on the merits of its breach of contract claim. The Stay Order here is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Accordingly, because the Stay Order is not a final judgment, and it is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine, we must dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED.
