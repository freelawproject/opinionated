In accordance with Md. Rule 4-215(e), the court allowed Mr. Cousins to explain the reasons for his request, but found that he did not have good cause to discharge counsel. The court proceeded to inform Mr. Cousins that the trial would proceed as scheduled and that he would have to represent himself if he discharged his counsel. Mr. Cousins said that he would discharge his counsel and represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">When the trial began the following day, Mr. Cousins announced his intention to disrupt the proceedings, and he engaged in a profanity-laden tirade against the judge. The court ordered that he be removed from the courtroom, but offered him the opportunity to return if he agreed to behave in a civil fashion. Mr. Cousins did not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The jury convicted Mr. Cousins of robbery, and the court sentenced him to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Mr. Cousins presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in finding that [Mr. Cousins] lacked a meritorious reason to discharge counsel, including that it failed to conduct any inquiry into a possible conflict after assigned counsel said he was conflicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">II. Did the trial court err when it removed [Mr. Cousins] from the courtroom during his trial without providing him with any means to monitor the proceedings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">On September 13, 2014, Mr. Cousins entered the First Mariner Bank on Loch Raven Boulevard in Baltimore County and surveyed his surroundings. A teller asked Mr. Cousins if he needed help, and he replied that he was looking for his grandmother. Then he exited the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Approximately 45 minutes later, Mr. Cousins returned with a second man. One of the men approached the teller and asked her to make change. The other approached another teller and said, \u201cI want everything you got in your drawers, don\u2019t give me a dye pack, don\u2019t give me bait money and I\u2019ve got a gun so don\u2019t make me use it[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Footage from the bank\u2019s surveillance system, which showed the incident, was played in court, and still photographs from the surveillance cameras were introduced into evidence. A teller identified Mr. Cousins as the man who robbed her. A detective identified Mr. Cousins based on his detailed review of the surveillance footage, photographs of Mr. Cousins, and time that he spent interviewing Mr. Cousins.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">Baltimore County detectives arrested Mr. Cousins and interviewed him regarding the robbery. A video-recording of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>interview was played for the jury. In the recording, Mr. Cousins told the detectives that he committed the robbery with a man named Nelson. Mr. Cousins explained that he was addicted to drugs and that he committed the robbery to obtain money to buy drugs. Mr. Cousins identified Nelson and himself in photographs. A detective testified that he also interviewed Nelson and learned that the two were \u201cassociates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We shall provide additional facts as necessary in our discussion of each of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">I. Mr. Cousins\u2019 Request to Discharge Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">A. February 5, 2015, Postponement Hearing Before Judge Cahill</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Mr. Cousins first expressed disagreement with his appointed counsel at a hearing on February 5, 2015, at which defense counsel requested a postponement. Mr. Cousins stated that he did not agree to the postponement. He said, \u201cI\u2019m ready for trial today for real. I don\u2019t even need him [defense counsel] ... I\u2019m ready to go and I have a lawyer and it ain\u2019t him ... John Deros is my lawyer now.\u201d Apparently addressing the prosecutor, Mr. Cousins added, \u201cHow do you like that, asshole?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The court granted the postponement, and advised Mr. Cousins to \u201ctell Mr. Deros the trial is now April 7, 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">B. March 25, 2015, Hearing Before Judge Cahill</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">By the time of a subsequent hearing on March 25, 2015, private counsel had not yet entered an appearance. At that hearing, Mr. Cousins\u2019s appointed counsel expressed concern over his ability to communicate with his client and requested a competency evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I\u2019m asking Your Honor to enter an Order for an examination for competency as well as criminal responsibility as long as I\u2019m having him evaluated. You may recall our last appearance before Your Honor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>when the matter was postponed on the last trial date. Mr. Cousins had some choice words for Mr. Cox [the prosecutor] .... Over the course of the last month to six weeks, Mr. Cox and I have been attempting to resolve some discovery issues, most of which have been resolved and as I collected that discovery ... I have gone to see my client and review those with him. Those conversations deteriorate to the point where I\u2019m not, I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Cousins, it deteriorates to the point where he\u2019s not a meaningful participant in one, reviewing the discovery with him and two, being able to participate in strategy decisions or litigation.... But based on the demeanor, I think it\u2019s important to have him evaluated so that if there\u2019s something we can do to, to help him be a meaningful participate, participant in, in trial preparation and litigation, I\u2019d, I\u2019d rather have that done before we did anything else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Later in the proceedings, Mr. Cousins explained that the case had previously been postponed and that he was supposed to get another attorney, but that this had yet to happen. The following colloquy between Mr. Cousins and the court ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">[MR. COUSINS]: I seen my attorney and every time I see him, it\u2019s the day before trial, okay? Now, we was going in front of Judge Ensor, right? If you don\u2019t have everything that you need for the case, then that\u2019s a discovery violation. Don\u2019t get mad at me when I ask you for certain things. I like to go over things concerning my case because when it\u2019s all over with, I\u2019m the one in prison, he\u2019s the one home with his family, you know what I mean? I\u2019ve been in prison twenty-five years, it ain\u2019t, it ain\u2019t a pretty feeling, right? But don\u2019t tell me no lie, tell me anything get mad when I question what\u2019s having something to do with me, you know? I don\u2019t be disrespectful to you. I was trying to talk to you in the bullpen, you walked away from me. You want me to respect you, I respect you but don\u2019t tell lies and don\u2019t think that you going to do anything to me because I\u2019m not going to let you do that to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>[COURT]: All right. Easy, Mr, Cousins. Let me ask you this. You just referred to the fact that you had another attorney entering an appearance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">[MR. COUSINS]: I was trying to get a, John (inaudible) and they talked, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">[COURT]: Well, did you hire Mr. Diros (phonetic)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">[MR. COUSINS]: I was trying to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">[COURT]: Okay. It would be exceedingly unwise, in my professional judgment, for you to discharge [defense counsel] at that, at this point in time, when discovery is being exchanged and he, in my independent judgment, is trying to look out for your best interest. But if you\u2019re, are you asking to discharge [defense counsel] at this point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">[MR. COUSINS]: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I\u2019m asking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">[COURT]: Okay and, and then you would be left without a lawyer, is that what you want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">[MR. COUSINS]: I\u2019d be left without a lawyer. If I\u2019m going to give myself, I can get myself some time, I can throw myself on the mercy of the Court because we are not seeing eye to eye okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">[COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">[MR. COUSINS]: And you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">[COURT]: Is there any other reason, aside from what you\u2019ve expressed, to support your request\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-15\">[MR. COUSINS]: Well, how do I, how do I communicate with somebody who don\u2019t want to communicate with me? I can\u2019t walk out the County jail and say, hey, I want, I call your office, you come and see me three times, and its [sic] every time before Court date. You don\u2019t come and see me, I\u2019m right down the street from you. You got mad yesterday, I can\u2019t watch the videos, I don\u2019t have the pictures, all I have is police reports and some other stuff, you know, I don\u2019t have the things that I\u2019m supposed to have. I filed my Motion for discovery, I filed for bail review, I filed for the things I needed, you know, I don\u2019t have none of them. I don\u2019t have no responses to that ..,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Defense counsel argued that the court should not rule on Mr. Cousins\u2019s request to discharge counsel until it had resolved the issue of competency. The court agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would think that should the evaluation come back that he\u2019s competent and, and the Court wants to address that again, that is absolutely appropriate but this is too serious a matter to leave him without counsel, at least at this junction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[COURT]: Couldn\u2019t agree more. So at this point in time, based on the limited colloquy that we\u2019ve had on the bench, or from the bench I should say, I do not find that there are good reasons or meritorious reasons to support a discharge of [defense counsel] and the Office of the Public Defender. That\u2019s a, that\u2019s a matter that I can take up again down the road but I\u2019m going to deny any request, to the extent that I must under Maryland law, complicated as it is, interpret what you said and request a discharge at this time, that request is denied. I\u2019m going to grant the request to postpone the trial in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The court concluded the proceeding by indicating that it would \u201csign the Order for examination for competency to stand trial, criminal responsibility.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">C. May 28, 2015, Motions Hearing Before Judge King</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">After finding Mr. Cousins competent to stand trial on May 28, 2015, the court heard pretrial motions, which included a motion to suppress Mr. Cousins\u2019s recorded statement to the police. The recording of Mr. Cousins\u2019s statement was played and transcribed into the record. In the statement, Mr. Cousins admitted that he had been using large amounts of cocaine and heroin, that he was intoxicated when he committed the robbery, and that he committed the robbery to obtain money to buy drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Appointed counsel, who was still representing Mr. Cousins, argued that the court should suppress the statement because Mr. Cousins did not give a knowing and voluntary waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He maintained that Mr. Cousins\u2019s admission to recent and extensive drug use, in addition to his demeanor while making the statement, demonstrated that he was intoxicated or in withdrawal and that his statement could not have been voluntary. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">D. February 1, 2016, Motions Hearing Before Judge Cahill</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">On February 1, 2016, the day before the trial was to begin, the court held a hearing to address a letter that Mr. Cousins had -written to the court. Before the court read the letter into the record, it asked Mr. Cousins if he wished to discharge his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Mr. Cousins responded by complaining of defense counsel\u2019s failure to introduce a portion of his police interview during the motions hearing on May 28, 2015. The portion of the interview in question showed him lying on the floor for several hours, asleep or unconscious, in a manner consistent with intoxication or withdrawal. Specifically, Mr. Cousins said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">[T]he issue that I\u2019m bringing towards the Court was we had a Motion hearing and we were shown, the disc was shown concerning the police interrogation and the whole disc was not shown, parts was withheld and the parts (inaudible) showing me high, sick, laying on the floor with a sheet wrapped around me. Now if you\u2019re going to show the disc, if you\u2019re going to show what happened at the arrest, then show the whole disc .... You know, and it deals with my arrest too, and I was high and if you going to withheld something, that\u2019s prosecutor misconduct. My attorney know what was withheld from the Judge and I wrote Judge King and as far as him trying not to go in front of Judge King. Judge King even said, if we have any other problems or anything, bring it to him. Okay? I asked him to go back to him and let him know ... If you\u2019re going to show the disc, show the whole disc (inaudible) and to say we\u2019re going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>trial for the 13th case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no, no, no, we ain\u2019t going nowhere. This man is not going to represent me. If you\u2019re going to give me a trial, give me a fair trial, don\u2019t show what you want to show. The whole disc deal with my arrest and that\u2019s where I\u2019m at with that and let\u2019s go over this, let\u2019s go over, let\u2019s show the disc, let\u2019s show what he redact from the disc and let\u2019s take it in front of the Motion Judge. That\u2019s have a fair trial. If we\u2019re going to have a trial, have a fair trial, you know?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The court read Mr. Cousins\u2019s letter into the record. Mr. Cousins\u2019s grievances included these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">1. The prosecutor had withheld a portion of the video-recording that was shown to the motions court. The part of the recording shows him on the floor with a sheet wrapped around him, withdrawing from drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">2. On the day he used profanity in addressing the prosecutor, he had asked to represent himself, and asked his attorney whether there were \u201cany prints,\u201d but his attorney said \u201cno.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">3. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t need [defense counsel] to get me life. I could get myself that and that\u2019s when I cussed [the prosecutor] and [defense counsel] out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">4. He \u201cspent twenty-three years in prison because [he] had ten whites, two blacks and all from your County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">5. He wanted to call various attorneys and the judge from the May 28 motions hearing to be witnesses at a hearing at which he would play the full, three-hour recording.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">After the court read Mr. Cousins\u2019s letter into the record, it reminded Mr. Cousins of his right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Lawyers, [defense counsel] included, are experts in preparing defenses and challenging the State\u2019s proof and the manner in which it was gathered. Attorneys are experts in negotiating pleas, presenting Motions, sitting next to you and trying the case if necessary, advising you on how and whether to present defenses and if you are found guilty of an offense and presenting mitigation to the Court that might lessen your punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The court asked Mr. Cousins if he had \u201cany other complaints about [defense counsel]?\u201d Mr. Cousins replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">Yes, sir. Basically, you know, to, to even talk about starting tomorrow, right? ... you take the disc itself, you know. If you\u2019re going to show the Motion, let\u2019s show the Motion and let\u2019s show the Judge everything that deal with the Motion. You going to start a trial and you\u2019re going to withheld [sic] something from the Motion, Judge, that\u2019s denied me a fair trial. I\u2019m on the floor high. He testified that, that the detective over there testified when he arrested me I looked to be defeated. You know, he didn\u2019t get on the record and state that I was high. He knew I was high. I was under the influence of drugs during the interrogation. He also said that I looked defeated and I just looked (inaudible). I was arrested in, in west Baltimore on the City streets, drug syringe in my pocket, cocaine in my pocket and I\u2019m high on that tape. High as a god damn kite, you know what I mean? And he tried to get me life, he want to give me life so he say, right? ... Let\u2019s go in front of Judge King and show this part that he redacted from the tape and then we can start trial. And I\u2019m actually representing myself because I don\u2019t need him to get me life. I really don\u2019t. I can get myself life. I can say, hey, Judge Cox, come on let\u2019s have a kangaroo court like we had before, you know? I don\u2019t need no lawyer to get me life, Your Honor. I had twenty-five no parole. I know the games this man play. He lied about a fingerprint report. It wasn\u2019t no fingerprint when I cussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>him out in Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It wasn\u2019t none of that, you know. And I still don\u2019t have all the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cousins said, \u201cI don\u2019t even think I can get a representation out of this man in the conflict that we have, ain\u2019t no coming back from that, man. You know, ain\u2019t no coming back from that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">When the court asked defense counsel to respond, he addressed the alleged \u201cconflict,\u201d which involved a complaint to the Attorney Grievance Commission. The complaint, which was dismissed after Mr. Cousins\u2019s trial but before his sentencing, appears to have concerned his counsel\u2019s failure to attempt to play the three-hour video-recording in its entirety, including the lengthy portions that depicted Mr. Cousins while he was unconscious or asleep, at the suppression hearing. Defense counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">[T]he Attorney Grievance matter has been pending since late November, early December, and that\u2019s tied my hands as far as being able to communicate with my client towards the possibility of reopening the Motions to try and make the record he\u2019s asking me to make. The record of the Motion, there is a record at the Motions, there were somethings played, there were some things that were not played. The officers were cross[-]examined. My hands are tied to, to the extent that, you know, I\u2019m kind of in this, this limbo with the grievance pending. Now, if the grievance hadn\u2019t been filed or had been cleared up, I would have an opportunity to talk to my client with an eye towards deciding whether or not we wanted to reopen Motions on his request. This is a very serious, these are very serious matters. There\u2019s five separate incidents, any of which could subject Mr. Cousins to life without parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Earlier in the hearing, defense counsel stated that he was ready to go forward with trial the following day, but would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>be able to do so unless the grievance was settled. Later, however, counsel stated that he would like to take every opportunity to continue to represent Mr. Cousins. Although the grievance had been pending for at least two months (\u201csince late November, [or] early December\u201d of 2015), and the trial was scheduled for the following day, appointed counsel had not moved for leave to withdraw his appearance under Md. Rule 4-214(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The State made it clear that the portion of the recording in question depicted Mr. Cousins once his police interview had concluded. The recording equipment continued to run because Mr. Cousins remained in the interview room after the questioning had ended. In the State\u2019s view, the rest of the video was irrelevant to the motion court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In his description of the portion of the recording that had not been shown to the motions court, defense counsel observed that it was \u201ca couple hours\u201d long and that the detectives had re-entered the room to have Mr. Cousins identify a picture. Defense counsel could not \u201ctell if [Mr. Cousins was] asleep or just lying on the floor with a blanket over him[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In ruling that it did not find a meritorious reason for Mr. Cousins to discharge his appointed counsel, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">I certainly do not believe that there\u2019s any meritorious reasons for a discharge of [defense counsel] based on the information that has been presented here and I will make that finding on the record. Now, I am duty bound to advise you, Mr. Cousins, since I do not find any reason at all, meritorious or otherwise, that, that is intelligible, to allow you to discharge [defense counsel]. But I still can\u2019t legally prevent you from discharging or firing him. You have the absolute right to represent yourself, but if you fire [defense counsel], this trial will proceed as scheduled. I\u2019ve heard no reason to think that a postponement would be in order under the circumstances</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u215b # <em>\u215b </em>\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>So you can fire him, but then you\u2019re going to be standing there picking a jury tomorrow by yourself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Before the court asked Mr. Cousins for his final decision regarding the discharge of his counsel, the following exchange ensued, beginning with Mr. Cousins\u2019s concern about the video:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">[MR. COUSINS]: You ruled on it and you ruled it on something you haven\u2019t even seen, that\u2019s basically, and we was in front of Judge King, okay? And my reason was asking for the witness that I had, who was attorneys at law and was there to review the tape as it was playing in Court, right? Of course, [the prosecutor] going to make everything where he want it to be and I still say he\u2019s a liar and he\u2019s a crook and he\u2019s a cheat and he\u2019s a piece of shit and I will tell him that in his face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">[COURT]: Okay. Well, that, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ve made my ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[MR. COUSINS]: [Defense counsel] is a piece of shit and a liar too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">[COURT]: You can discharge [defense counsel] if you wish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">[MR. COUSINS]: And I discharge [defense counsel], and that, that police over there is a liar and a piece of shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">[COURT]: You would be extraordinarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">[MR. COUSINS]: (inaudible) asshole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">[COURT]: You would, you would, it would, it would not be in your interest to discharge [defense counsel],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">[MR. COUSINS]: (inaudible) he\u2019s discharged and may you have a blessed day, asshole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-15\">[COURT]: Wait a minute.... Keep him right there. Do you wish to fire [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-16\">[MR. COUSINS]: Yes, I wish to fire [defense counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-17\">[COURT]: If, if, if you do that, you are going to be standing in front of a jury box tomorrow with twelve people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-18\">[MR. COUSINS]: Guess what? That\u2019s a fair trial. That\u2019s a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-19\">[COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>[MR.

COUSINS]: Yes, I\u2019d rather have nobody than to have somebody who ain\u2019t for me and I\u2019d rather be tried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">[COURT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">[MR. COUSINS]: Put your hood on tomorrow, asshole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">[COURT]: ...

I have two State\u2019s Attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">In his parting words, Mr. Cousins told the court, \u2019\u2018And I don\u2019t have a State\u2019s Attorney. I have an asshole trying to try me. ([I]naudible) [Prosecutor], and you\u2019re still a dickhead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">The trial commenced the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">II. Good Cause to Discharge Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">In his brief, Mr. Cousins writes that he sought to discharge counsel because of (1) counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the portion of the video-recording from his police interview during the motions hearing and (2) the breakdown of his relationship with his counsel, which included the grievance that he filed. Mr. Cousins contends that the trial court abused its discretion in its February 1, 2016, ruling that he did not have a meritorious reason to discharge his counsel and in not appointing substitute counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject this contention and hold that the trial court satisfactorily complied with Rule 4-215(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>A. The Applicable Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"AHi\">A defendant in a criminal case has the right to counsel. U.S. Const, amend. VI.; Md. Const. Declaration of Rights, Art. 21. But even though an indigent defendant has a right to appointed counsel, that right does not afford an indigent defendant the right to select the appointed counsel of his or her choice. <em>See Dykes v. State, </em>444 Md. 642, 648, 121 A.3d 113 (2015). Nor does this right \u201cgive an accused an unfettered right to discharge current counsel and demand different counsel shortly before or at trial.\u201d <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 605, 536 A.2d 1149 (1988). \u201c[A] defendant may not manipulate this right so as to frustrate the orderly administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">An indigent defendant may waive the right to assistance of counsel and choose to represent him- or herself. <em>Williams v. State, </em>321 Md. 266, 270, 582 A.2d 803 (1990). \u201cA defendant has a right to self-representation, but it may be unwise to exercise that right.\u201d <em>Dykes, </em>444 Md. at 646, 121 A.3d 113. Courts will indulge every reasonable presumption against a defendant\u2019s waiver of appointed counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 121 A.3d 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cMaryland Rule 4-215 implements a defendant\u2019s right to waive counsel, and incorporates safeguards to ensure that the defendant is acting knowingly and voluntarily in making that choice.\u201d <em>Dykes, </em>444 Md. at 651, 121 A.3d 113. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">(e) Discharge of Counsel\u2014Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u201cIn light of the fundamental rights implicated, Md. Rule 4-215(e) provides a \u2018precise rubric[]\u2019 with which we demand \u2018strict compliance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Graves, </em>447 Md. 230, 241, 135 A.3d 376 (2016) (quoting <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>427 Md. 77, 87, 46 A.3d 413 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In <em>Dykes, </em>the Court of Appeals outlined the steps a court is required to take when the Rule 4-215(e) process is triggered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">(1) <em>The defendant explains the reason(s) for discharging counsel[.] </em>While the rule refers to an explanation by the defendant, the court may inquire of both the defendant and the current defense counsel as to their perceptions of the reasons and need for discharge of current defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(2) <em>The court determines whether the reason(s) are meri</em>torious[.] The rule does not define \u201cmeritorious.\u201d This Court has equated the term with \u201cgood cause.\u201d This determination\u2014whether there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for discharge of counsel\u2014is an indispensable part of subsection (e) and controls what happens in the third step.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">(3) <em>The court advises the defendant and takes other action[.] </em>The court may then take certain actions, accompanied by appropriate advice to the defendant, depending on whether it found good cause for discharge of <em>counsel\u2014i.e., </em>a meritorious reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-10\"><em>Dykes, </em>444 Md. at 652, 121 A.3d 113 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">In this case, the court afforded Mr. Cousins multiple opportunities to explain his reasons for discharging counsel, which were the same as those articulated in his brief. After Mr. Cousins\u2019s explanations, the court asked if he had \u201cany other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>complaints [he] wish[ed] to register about [defense counsel\u2019s] misrepresentation of [him].\u201d Later, the court asked if there was \u201canything else\u201d to say about his motion to discharge counsel. In addition, the court inquired of defense counsel as to his perception of Mr. Cousins\u2019s request for discharge. Based on what it heard, the court found that Mr. Cousins did not have good cause, and it advised him accordingly. Hence, the central question here is whether the court abused its discretion in finding that Mr. Cousins did not have good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In evaluating the trial court\u2019s compliance with Rule 4\u2014216(e), Maryland appellate courts generally apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>Graves, </em>447 Md. at 240, 135 A.3d 376. However, a trial court\u2019s determination that a defendant had no meritorious reason to discharge counsel under Rule 4-215(e) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>431 Md. 615, 630, 638, 642, 66 A.3d 698 (2013). To constitute an abuse of discretion, the decision \u201chas to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 277, 914 A.2d 25 (2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">B. The Video</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The video that Mr. Cousins wanted to show consisted of almost two hours of irrelevant footage of Mr, Cousins passing time in a room after he had been interviewed by the police. Throughout the majority of the video, Mr. Cousins is either asleep or lying on the floor with a blanket on top of him. When given the opportunity to dispute that characterization, Mr. Cousins did not disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Nonetheless, Mr. Cousins argues that this footage is relevant because it shows that he was either high or withdrawing from drugs, and thus is evidence that his police statement was not voluntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Presenting the video to the motions court would have been senseless and an unproductive use of the court\u2019s time. The motions court had an ample opportunity to observe Mr. Cousins\u2019s demeanor during the interview itself, which included the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and to rule accordingly on the voluntariness of his statements. The court did not abuse its discretion in finding no meritorious reason to discharge counsel because of the failure to attempt to introduce an additional two hours of video footage showing Mr. Cousins asleep or unconscious after the interview had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">C. Breakdown of Relationship With Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Mr. Cousins maintains that the court abused its discretion in ruling that the breakdown of his relationship with defense counsel, which included the subsequently dismissed grievance, was not a meritorious reason for discharging counsel. Taken together, we view the overall breakdown of the relationship between Mr. Cousins and defense counsel as Mr. Cousins\u2019s unilateral attempt to manipulate the proceedings against him. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that this was not a meritorious reason to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">A complete breakdown in communication is considered \u201cgood cause\u201d to discharge counsel. <em>Weathers v. State, </em>231 Md.App. 112, 149 A.3d 1194, 1210 (2016) (Graeff, J., concurring) (citing <em>McKee v. Harris, </em>649 F.2d 927, 931 (2d Cir. 1981)). In determining whether a court abused its discretion in denying a request to discharge counsel because of a breakdown of communication, a relevant factor is \u201cwhether appellant and his or her \u2018counsel experienced a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1210 (quoting <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted)). It is also relevant to examine \u201c \u2018[wjhether the defendant substantially and unreasonably contributed to the communication breakdown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Lott, </em>310 F.3d 1231, 1250 (10th Cir. 2002)). This Court views both of these factors as relevant in determining whether a court abused its discretion in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>that there was not good cause to discharge counsel because of a lack of communication. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Mr. Cousins argues that the grievance compromised defense counsel\u2019s ability to represent him. In support of his argument, Mr. Cousins points to defense counsel\u2019s statement that the grievance prevented him from asking the court to re-open the suppression hearing and his equivocal statement that he would not be able to go forward at trial until the resolution of the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Assuming for the sake of argument that the grievance prevented counsel from asking to re-open the suppression hearing as counsel said, we still see no basis to conclude that the court abused its discretion in finding no meritorious reason to discharge counsel. The only fathomable reason for defense counsel to attempt to re-open the motions hearing was that Mr. Cousins vehemently adhered to the false impression that it would alter the motions court\u2019s ruling on the voluntariness of his statement. Mr. Cousins, as seen in the record, became unjustifiably fixated on this issue, to the point of engaging in an obscenity-filled rant. It is, however, beyond any serious dispute that the court would not have changed its decision to deny the motion to suppress if it were required to review two hours of video-footage of Mr. Cousins lying asleep or unconscious on a floor. Indeed, given the undisputed characterization of what little the footage showed, it is highly doubtful that the court would have reviewed it at all before reiterating the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The grievance presents a different question, because it does point out an area of adversity between Mr. Cousins and his counsel. Nonetheless, because the grievance was based on the meritless contention that counsel had somehow breached his professional obligations by not asking the motions judge to view the hours of footage of Mr. Cousins while he was asleep or unconscious, it is difficult to conceive how it would have interfered with counsel\u2019s ability to represent his client at trial. Although counsel objected to going forward while the grievance was still pending, he did not identify how the grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>would inhibit his ability to represent Mr, Cousins, other than to prevent him from making a vain request to re-open the suppression hearing. Nor was the alleged conflict sufficient to motivate counsel to move for leave to withdraw his appearance, even though the trial was to begin the next day. Meanwhile, counsel told the court that he was ready to try the case and \u201cwould like to take every opportunity to continue to represent Mr. Cousins.\u201d The court did not abuse its discretion in finding no meritorious reason to discharge counsel on the basis of a groundless grievance, subsequently dismissed, which had no material effect on counsel\u2019s ability to represent his client at trial. <em>See </em>3 LaPave et al., <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 11.4(b) (4th ed. 2007) (\u201ca defendant cannot manufacture a conflict requiring disqualification of appointed counsel by simply filing a disciplinary complaint against the attorney\u201d); <em>State v. Bryant, </em>285 Kan. 970, 993, 179 P.3d 1122 (2008) (holding that court did not abuse discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel where defendant claimed that current counsel had conflict of interest because he had filed disciplinary complaint against her).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Mr. Cousins correctly observes that when a court \u201cis confronted with the possibility of a conflict of interest,\u201d it \u201cmust take adequate steps to determine whether such a conflict exists.\u201d <em>Duvall v. State, </em>399 Md. 210, 233, 923 A.2d 81 (2007). He complains that the court did not adequately investigate the nature of counsel\u2019s conflict in this case. We disagree, because we are satisfied from our review of the record that the court gave wide latitude to both Mr. Cousins and his attorney to discuss Mr. Cousins\u2019s complaints. In fact, the very purpose of the hearing was to investigate the bases, if any, for his complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Although Mr. Cousins concedes that the trial court is not obligated to appoint a new attorney whenever an indigent defendant flies a grievance against appointed counsel, he asserts that this matter should prove the exception. In support, Mr. Cousins cites <em>Taylor v. State, </em>428 Md. 386, 51 A.3d 655 (2012). Mr. Cousins\u2019s reliance on <em>Taylor </em>is misplaced, because it is inapposite to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In <em>Taylor, </em>defense counsel sued the defendant for unpaid fees while representing him in a criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 51 A.3d 655. The Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[s]uch a conflict, where the <em>attorney-created </em>adversarial relationship adversely affects counsel\u2019s representation, infects the attorney-client relationship with an element of distrust, likely to affect the reliability of the trial and undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 51 A.3d 655 (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, the attorney did not create an adversarial relationship. The putative conflict arose only because of the meritless claim put forth by Mr. Cousins, and it had no material effect on defense counsel\u2019s ability to present an adequate defense. The grievance was baseless, and the trial court clearly recognized it as such in its determination that Mr. Cousins had no meritorious reason to discharge counsel. Therefore, we too reject Mr. Cousins\u2019s contention that his attorney grievance complaint constituted a meritorious reason to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In addition, we disagree with Mr. Cousins\u2019s assertion that the alleged breakdown of his relationship with defense counsel, with the grievance as one example, constituted a meritorious reason to discharge counsel. Although Mr. Cousins may have harbored acrimony towards defense counsel, this acrimony resulted principally from Mr. Cousins\u2019s unreasonable demands and did not rise to the level of \u201cgood cause\u201d to warrant discharge of counsel. <em>Weathers, </em>231 Md.App. 112, 149 A.3d 1194, 1210 (2016) (Graeff, J., concurring) (\u201ca defendant is not entitled to substitute counsel where he or she is the cause of the communication breakdown\u201d); <em>accord United States v. DeTemple, </em>162 F.3d 279, 289 (4th Cir. 1998) (a \u201ccourt can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>properly refuse a request for substitution of counsel when the defendant\u2019s own behavior creates the problem\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1137, 119 S.Ct. 1793, 143 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[a]ttorney-client conflicts justify the grant of a substitution motion only when counsel and defendant are so at odds as to prevent presentation of an adequate defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weathers, </em>231 Md.App. 112, 149 A.3d at 1210 n.7 (Graeff, J., concurring) (quoting <em>State v. Stenson, </em>132 Wash.2d 668, 940 P.2d 1239, 1272 (1997) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1008, 118 S.Ct. 1193, 140 L.Ed.2d 323 (1998)). Yet, here, defense counsel said that he was ready to try the case and \u201cwould like to take every opportunity to continue to represent Mr. Cousins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Of Mr. Cousins\u2019s complaints, the most that could be said is that he and his counsel disagreed about what to do with the lengthy portion of the recording that showed him while he was asleep or unconscious. A disagreement regarding legal strategy is not, however, a meritorious reason to discharge counsel. <em>See Bey v. State, </em>228 Md.App. 521, 534, 139 A.3d 1113 (2016) (holding that court did not abuse discretion in denying implied request to discharge counsel based on disagreement about whether to cross-examine victim); <em>see also United States v. Lott, </em>310 F.3d 1231, 1249 (10th Cir. 2002) (\u201c[g]ood cause for substitution of counsel consists of more than a mere strategic disagreement between a defendant and his attorney\u201d); <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 207 n.10 (3d Cir. 1999) (\u201cdisagreement over legal strategy does not constitute good cause for substitution of counsel); <em>People v. Linares, </em>2 N.Y.3d 507, 511, 780 N.Y.S.2d 529, 813 N.E.2d 609 (2004) (\u201cgood cause does not exist ... where, on the eve of trial, disagreements over trial strategy generate discord\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Throughout the course of these proceedings, Mr. Cousins showed an inability to conduct himself in an appropriate manner. He relentlessly attacked defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial judge, employing vulgar language and profanity. Mr. Cousins had difficulty communicating with anyone throughout these proceedings. Given Mr. Cousins\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>inability or unwillingness to communicate in an appropriate, civil manner, it is very likely that his communication problems would have persisted even if the court had granted a postponement and appointed substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The predicament in which Mr. Cousins placed the trial court is not unique to this case. Rule 4-215(e) cases present dilemmas for trial courts, and trial courts must exercise their considered discretion in navigating this \u201cugly patch of difficult terrain.\u201d <em>See Garner v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 122, 127, 960 A.2d 649 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>414 Md. 372, 995 A.2d 694 (2010). In its evaluation of such a demand, a trial court may choose to credit or discredit the arguments presented, and after doing so, must use its own judgment in making a ruling. Almost 30 years ago, Judge Eldridge outlined the conundrum courts have long faced in these instances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">The interplay among the right to counsel, waiver of the right to counsel, and the <em>Faretta [v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975) ] right of self-representation, has posed problems when, shortly before or at the beginning of trial, a defendant makes an unmeritorious demand for the discharge of current counsel and for the appointment or retention of different counsel, and where, as is usually the situation, the appointment or retention of new counsel would require a trial postponement. If the trial judge properly refuses to grant such demand, a defendant will often attempt to delay the proceedings by refusing either to proceed with current counsel or to make an affirmative election of his <em>Faretta </em>right of self-representation. In such circumstances, where a postponement would be improper, the trial judge is faced with the dilemma of forcing the defendant to trial without an attorney or forcing the defendant to proceed with an unwanted attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ1_\"><em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Here, Mr. Cousins made a demand for the discharge of defense counsel on the eve of trial. After permitting Mr. Cousins and defense counsel to speak on the issue, the trial court found the request to be unmeritorious. The trial court was under no obligation to accede to Mr. Cousins\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and to credit his complaints. Instead, in holding that the demand was unmeritorious, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining what to accept as true, and what to discount as false. <em>See id. </em>at 607, 536 A.2d 1149. The record fully supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">If the court had appointed different counsel, it undoubtedly would have been forced to postpone a trial that was set to take place the following day. A postponement would have been disruptive, as both parties were ready to proceed with trial but for Mr. Cousins\u2019s request to discharge counsel. Furthermore, a postponement would have rewarded Mr. Cousins for his unacceptable conduct, for his unjustified contentions, and for fabricating a conflict by filing a groundless grievance. Therefore, we cannot fault the trial court for ruling that Mr. Cousins did not have a meritorious reason to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">After the ruling, Mr. Cousins both refused to proceed with defense counsel and elected to exercise his right of self-representation. His actions placed the trial court in a predicament, as the court had no choice but to force an unrepresented defendant to stand trial or force him to stand trial with an attorney he did not desire. The trial court attempted to dissuade Mr. Cousins from dismissing defense counsel on multiple occasions and warned him of the consequences of doing so. Mr. Cousins, steadfast in his desire to proceed without an attorney, said \u201cYes, I\u2019d rather have nobody than to have somebody who ain\u2019t for me and I\u2019d rather be tried.\u201d On another occasion, he affirmed that he had \u201cwaived [his] right to counsel.\u201d On yet another occasion, he told the court that he was \u201cready to go to trial without\u201d an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In summary, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Mr. Cousins lacked a meritorious reason to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">III. Mr, Cousins\u2019s Removal From the Courtroom</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Mr. Cousins stood trial on February 2, 2016, the day after he had discharged his appointed counsel. Mr. Cousins was to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Before jury selection, Mr. Cousins made it clear that he would disrupt the court during the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">[COURT]: [W]e\u2019re going to make you a copy of the charge papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">[MR.

Mr. Cousins\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">[MR.

Is there anything else you want to say at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">[MR. COUSINS]: Yeah, fuck you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">[COURT]: Oops. All right. So Mr. Cousins, the Court has the authority to remove you from these Court proceedings which I intend to exercise in such a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">[MR. COUSINS]: (inaudible) exercise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-18\">[COURT]: Hold on just a second, guys.

State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 847 A.2d 1239 (2004), to remove a disruptive defendant from the courtroom and indicated that it intended to exercise that authority. The court explained that in its view Mr. Cousins would continue to interrupt the proceedings, as he had promised. Mr. Cousins indeed continued with his disruptive behavior, and eventually countered with a statement that, \u201cThat\u2019s why they got a Courts of Appeal [sic] for you, asshole. Come on, let\u2019s go away. Fuck, yeah. Have a nice day.\u201d The court had Mr. Cousins removed from the courtroom after it explained how the trial would proceed. The court also explained that should Mr. Cousins wish to return to the courtroom and conduct himself appropriately, all he needed to do was to inform a deputy,</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Mr. Cousins was placed in a holding cell outside of the courtroom for the remainder of the one-day trial. The court assigned a deputy to sit with Mr. Cousins so that he could notify the court if he wished to rejoin the proceedings. At various phases of the trial, the court, via the deputy, asked Mr. Cousins whether he wanted to return to the courtroom. Mr. Cousins declined each time. Mr. Cousins contends that the court erred when it removed him from the courtroom during his trial and failed to provide him with any means to monitor the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>A defendant has the right to be present at every stage of his or her trial. <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 670, 847 A.2d 1239; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 4-231. However, \u201c[t]he right to be present is waived by a defendant \u2018who engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 671, 847 A.2d 1239 (quoting Md. Rule 4-321(c)(l)-(2)). When faced with a disruptive defendant, a trial judge can \u201c(1) bind and gag him, thereby keeping him present; (2) cite him for contempt; [or] (3) take him out of the courtroom until he promises to conduct himself properly.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). \u201cWhen the trial court selects the third option, however, the defendant who is removed from the courtroom must be advised of the opportunity to return upon a promise to behave.\u201d <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 671, 847 A.2d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We hold that the court\u2019s decision to exclude Mr. Cousins from the courtroom was reasonable. Mr. Cousins concedes that he \u201cinitially waived his right to be present.\u201d Mr. Cousins \u201cdid not simply speak out of turn or make the occasional outburst.\u201d <em>Shiflett v. State, </em>229 Md.App. 645, 671, 146 A.3d 504 (2016). He consistently used vulgar, insulting, inappropriate, and angry language with the court and the prosecutor. Mr. Cousins promised the court that he would engage in disruptive behavior to prevent the trial from proceeding, and he fulfilled that promise while he was in the courtroom. His conduct left the court with little choice but to remove him.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Mr. Cousins, however, argues that the court erred when it did not afford him the opportunity to observe the proceedings after his removal. Citing <em>Biglari, </em>Mr. Cousins contends that the court should have given him a video or audio feed of the proceedings so that he could remain apprised of what was happening. He asserts that the court\u2019s failure to do so obstructed his constitutional right to present a defense and to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Mr. Cousins maintains that even if he chose to return to the proceedings, his exercise of this right would essentially have been futile be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>cause he could not see or hear the evidence presented in his absence. We disagree with his interpretation of <em>Biglari </em>and hold that his position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Biglari, </em>the court removed Biglari from the courtroom after his repeated interruptions and his refusal to comply with the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 664, 847 A.2d 1239. Biglari was escorted to the judge\u2019s office, where he observed the proceedings on a closed-circuit TV set. <em>Id. </em>at 663-64, 847 A.2d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Mr. Cousins maintains that \u201c[tjrials are invariably video or audio recorded,\u201d and he asserts that, \u201c[pjractically speaking, providing a video or audio feed of a trial to an absent defendant is hardly an onerous requirement.\u201d We reject his contention because we are unwilling to assume that all courtrooms in Maryland have the capacity to support a live feed to an outside location.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Mr. Cousins reads <em>Biglari </em>to mandate that defendants be provided a means to watch or listen to the proceedings when a court removes them from the courtroom because of their misconduct. <em>Biglari </em>contains no such mandate. Although the circuit court provided Biglari with a TV to view the proceedings, this Court did not hold that the court was required to do what it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\"><em>Biglari </em>requires only that a trial court give a defendant the opportunity to return upon a promise to behave appropriately. <em>Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 674, 847 A.2d 1239 (\u201c[ejrror occurred, however, when appellant was not afforded the opportunity to return to the courtroom upon a promise to behave properly\u201d). In this case, the trial court made it abundantly clear to Mr. Cousins how he could, if he chose, exercise his right to reenter the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">I\u2019m going to place a deputy in the cell with you at all times. If you decide that you have changed your mind and wish to attend your own trial, all you need to do is tell that deputy that you have changed your mind and wish to come out here and participate in the process. You will have a seat at the trial table, just like any other litigant, you can listen to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>evidence. As I told you before, you can make an opening statement, you can cross examine witnesses, you can abide by the same terms and conditions that every other person abides by when they walk through the backdoors of a courtroom in this County or any other jurisdiction in this State or in the United States of America. We want you to participate in your trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The deputy with Mr. Cousins had an earpiece so that he could quickly communicate with the trial judge if Mr, Cousins elected to rejoin the proceedings. Before the court recessed for lunch, it observed that Mr. Cousins had not asked to return to the courtroom. The record indicates that a representative of the court inquired with the deputy in Mr. Cousins\u2019s cell every five or ten minutes to confirm that he had not asked to return to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">After the recess, the court again ensured that Mr. Cousins had not asked to return to the proceedings. In an abundance of caution, the court requested that the deputy ask Mr. Cousins if he wanted to re-enter the courtroom. According to the court, Mr. Cousins indicated that he did not wish to come back in the courtroom because he would be disruptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Later, the court summoned Mr. Cousins to inform him that the State had rested its case. The court asked Mr. Cousins if he -wished to participate in the trial, and Mr. Cousins declined. The court again told Mr. Cousins that if he changed his mind, all he needed to do was to inform the deputy. Lastly, the court requested that the deputy ask Mr. Cousins if he wished to observe the jury verdict. Once again, Mr. Cousins declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In compliance with <em>Biglari, </em>the court afforded Mr. Cousins multiple opportunities to return to the courtroom if he promised to behave properly. Mr. Cousins refused to conform his conduct to the court\u2019s reasonable expectations, and those of civil society. The court did not err in its decision to remove Mr. Cousins from the courtroom, in the procedure that it used to effectuate the removal, or in the manner in which it safeguarded Mr. Cousins\u2019s right to re-enter the trial upon a promise to behave appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.
