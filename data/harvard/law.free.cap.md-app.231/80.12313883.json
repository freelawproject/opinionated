The Tolson Rubble Landfill permit (\u201cpermit\u201d or \u201cthe permit\u201d) authorized Tolson to construct and operate the Tolson Rubble Landfill (\u201cTolson Landfill\u201d or \u201cthe Landfill\u201d) located on Capital Raceway Road in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Although it was not issued until 2014, Tolson applied for the permit in July of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Appellants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Piney Orchard Community Association, et al. (\u201cPiney Orchard\u201d), filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County on December 19, 2014, challenging MDE\u2019s grant of the permit to Tolson on the grounds that MDE did not comply with Md. Code Ann., Environment Article (\u201cEN\u201d), \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>court affirmed MDE\u2019s decision to grant the permit. Appellant Piney Orchard timely noted an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">On appeal, Appellants present two issues for our review,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which we rephrase as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">1. Whether the Maryland Department of the Environment complied with \u00a7 9-210(a)(3) of the Environment Article of the Maryland Code in issuing the Tolson Rubble Landfill permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">2. Whether the trial court erred in finding that Bills 21-14 and 34-03 do not apply to the Tolson Rubble Landfill permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Amk\">A. The Permit Approval Process</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">MDE is the State agency vested with authority to regulate the installation, alteration, and extension of refuse disposal systems. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7\u00a7 1-101(k), 9-204(d); <em>see also </em>COMAR 26.04.07.03B(1). A rubble landfill site, like the one that Tolson proposed to build, is a refuse disposal system, which requires a permit from MDE. Once an application is submitted to MDE, MDE begins a complex review that proceeds in three \u201cphases.\u201d COMAR 26.04.07.13-18. At the completion of each of these phases, the applicant must submit a report, which is reviewed and approved by MDE\u2019s Solid Waste Management Program before the next phase begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Phase 1 of this process\u2014and the part that is most important to this case\u2014primarily entails a preliminary review of the application and the site itself and an opportunity for a public informational meeting, during which MDE accepts and responds to comments from members of the public. COMAR 26.04.07.14; <em>see also </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(a). Phase 2 focuses on the soil, geology, and hydrology of the proposed site. COMAR 26.04.07.15. During Phase 3, MDE compares the applicant\u2019s engineering plans and reports with MDE\u2019s technical regulatory requirements and ensures that the proposed landfill will be constructed in a manner that protects public health, public safety, and the environment. COMAR 26.04.07.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Pursuant to EN \u00a7 9-210(a), after MDE has reported the findings of its preliminary Phase 1 in writing to the county\u2019s chief executive official and planning commission, it must cease processing the application until the County has completed its review of the site \u201cand has provided to the Department a written statement that the refuse disposal system: (i) Meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements .... \u201d EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). The statute makes clear that the three steps required by EN \u00a7 9-210(a) must be followed in this sequence. EN \u00a7 9-210(a) and (b). Furthermore, MDE completes most of Phase 1 by the time it requests the County\u2019s evaluation and certification of the site, except for the public notice and opportunity for an informational meeting. Critically, MDE may not complete Phase 1 and proceed to Phase 2 until it has received the statement from the County certifying the site\u2019s compliance with local zoning and land use codes. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(b). Although MDE is the agency responsible for ensuring compliance with State laws and regulations, the County is responsible for determining whether a proposed site meets county zoning and land use requirements. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">After all three phases of MDE\u2019s review, MDE prepares a draft permit and tentative determination and holds a public hearing on the tentative determination. EN \u00a7 1-604. Depending on the comments received during the public comments period, MDE may be required to prepare and issue a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>determination to approve the permit. EN \u00a7 l-601(c). Pursuant to EN \u00a7 l-601(c), if a party \u201cparticipated in a public participation process through the submission of written or oral comments,\u201d that party may petition for judicial review to challenge the final determination to issue the permit. EN \u00a7 1-601(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Judicial review must be \u201con the administrative record before the Department and limited to objections raised during the public comment period,\u201d with minor exceptions. \u00a7 1-601(d)(1). Although a party to an action for judicial review \u201cmay not challenge the applicant\u2019s compliance with zoning and land use requirements,\u201d such a party may question whether MDE complied with \u00a7 9-210(a)(3). EN \u00a7 l-605(d). In other words, a party to an action for judicial review may challenge whether the County completed its evaluation of a proposed site and submitted a written statement to MDE certifying the site\u2019s compliance with county zoning and land use requirements, and whether the site \u201c[i]s in conformity with the county solid waste plan.\u201d EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">B. The Tolson Refuse Disposal Permit</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The Tolson Landfill is located within a previously excavated sand and gravel mine. The landfill spans four lots covering a total of approximately 72 acres of land in Anne Arundel County. This location has been the site of sand and gravel mining for over 40 years, and mining and related operations are currently being conducted on other areas of the site. Landfill operations began on the mine in the early 1980s. In 1993, the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals issued a special exception for the Tolson site, which permitted the construction and operation of a rubble landfill on the site. A rubble landfill is \u201ca sanitary landfill permitted under State law and regulation as a rubble landfill.\u201d A.A.C. \u00a7 18-1-101. A rubble landfill accepts only trees, land clearing, construction, or demolition debris. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">A special exception is an exception to the current law in effect in the zoning district in which a \u201cnonconforming use\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>land is located, granted by the Office of Planning and Zoning. <em>See </em>A.A.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-1-101(70), \u00a7 18-15-101(d). A special exception \u201cterminates when the use ceases operation for 12 consecutive months or when the scope of the use is so significantly reduced during the 12-month period as to change its nature or character.\u201d A.A.C. \u00a7 18-15-104(a). The special exception granted in 1993 for the site on which the Tolson operation was located was operative at the time MDE issued the Tolson Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">On July 31, 2002, Tolson applied for a Refuse Disposal Permit. As part of the application process, and pursuant to the statutory requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3), the County evaluated the site and determined whether the facility complied with local zoning and land use laws. On August 28, 2002, the Director of the Department of Public Works, Ronald E. Bowen, and Planning and Zoning Officer in the Office of Planning and Zoning for Anne Arundel County, Denis Cana-van, sent MDE a letter stating \u201cTolson and Associates, L.L.C. proposed Rubble Landfill in the Crofton Area of Anne Arun-del County meets all applicable zoning requirements and conforms to the current Solid Waste Management Plan.\u201d There is no dispute that the County completed its review of Tolson\u2019s proposed rubble landfill and that it had provided to MDE a written statement that the landfill met the statutory requirements prior to MDE\u2019s continuation of the permit process. MDE received the completed Phase 1 Report on March 25, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">MDE held an informational meeting on the permit application on July 15, 2004 after publishing a public notice of the meeting in <em>The Capital </em>and <em>The Maryland Gazette </em>newspapers on June 30, 2004 and July 7, 2004. MDE continued to process Tolson\u2019s application through the remaining two phases of the complex approval process. The Phase 2 Report was completed on November 1, 2006, and the Phase 3 Report was completed November 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On August 3 and 10, 2011, MDE published its Tentative Determination to issue the permit to Tolson in <em>The Capital </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>and <em>The Maryland Gazette </em>newspapers. On August 18, 2011, MDE held a second informational meeting as well as a public hearing on the tentative determination. In its Response to Comments for the Tolson <em>&amp; </em>Associates Rubble Landfill\u2014a 65-page document sent to concerned citizens who had participated in the permit approval process\u2014MDE categorized hundreds of oral comments made at the public hearing and written comments received by MDE regarding the Tolson permit into several categories and provided detailed responses. MDE altered conditions of the permit with many of these public concerns in mind and in its Report of Findings, dated January 28, 2014, MDE recommended 12 conditions be added to the permit, but found \u201cthat the technical, statutory and regulatory requirements of the application process have been satisfied ... .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 21, 2014, MDE sent letters to concerned citizens, including Piney Orchard, to notify them of its final determination to issue the permit authorizing the construction and operation of the landfill. In its Notice of Final Determination, MDE stated that the draft permit was modified subsequent to the public hearing in response to the concerns of members of the public. The letter provided that MDE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">found the application to be technically complete and in compliance with the applicable State laws and regulations. The Final Determination is based upon the review of the permit application and supporting documents submitted by the applicant, and upon testimony and evidence presented at the public hearing held on August 18, 2011 at the Crofton Elementary School,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Thereafter, MDE issued its Final Determination, effective November 24, 2014, granting Tolson the permit to operate the rubble landfill. Tolson and its affiliates commenced construction related to its rubble landfill activities at the site on the same day. Appellants timely filed their petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>C. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Piney Orchard challenged MDE\u2019s decision to approve the permit on the grounds that, as they interpreted it, \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) \u201cmandates the conclusion that the proposed rubble landfill complies with local zoning laws at <em>the time of application, </em>at the <em>time of issuance </em>of the permit, and at the time that <em>applicant begins to construct </em>the [rubble landfill].\u201d Because, as Piney Orchard argued, Bill No. 21-14<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was passed before MDE issued the permit, and the bill prohibited rubble landfills within residential areas of Anne Arundel County, the Tolson landfill did not comply with local zoning regulations. Piney Orchard asserted that \u201c[t]he record lacks any statement by MDE that the proposed [rubble landfill] complies with the [e]ounty current zoning laws.\u201d They further noted that MDE should not, therefore, have issued the permit due to this failure to comply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In this appeal, Piney Orchard argues that \u201cMDE erred legally when it determined in 2014 that the proposed [rubble landfill] meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements based on the County\u2019s statement in 2002 that the proposed [rubble landfill] complied at that time with the County\u2019s zoning law.\u201d Piney Orchard\u2019s argument is based on the premise that MDE, a state agency, determines whether a rubble landfill meets local zoning regulations, rather than simply whether it has received a written statement from the County certifying the facility\u2019s compliance with local zoning regulations. Indeed, Piney Orchard argues that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">[S]ection 9-210(a)(3)(i) required MDE to make the factual finding that the proposed [rubble landfill] complied with local zoning and land use laws when MDE issued the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>in 2014. Instead, MDE stated that the proposed [rubble landfill] met all applicable zoning requirements in 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\">Tolson and MDE maintain that the statute creates no such requirement. As such, the statute did not require MDE to make a \u201cfactual finding\u201d regarding the Tolson Landfill\u2019s compliance with local zoning regulations before it issued the permit, except to the extent that it had received a letter from the County stating the facility\u2019s compliance. Moreover, Tolson asserts that MDE must receive only one statement from the County, not multiple statements at each phase in the process, and not even an additional statement just before the permit was approved in 2014. The circuit court agreed with Tolson and MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-b\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In reviewing the decision of an agency, we \u201clook[] through the circuit court\u2019s ... decision[ ], although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate! ] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007); <em>see also Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 273, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012) (\u201c \u2018On appellate review of the decision of an administrative agency, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Halici v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>180 Md.App. 238, 248, 949 A.2d 85 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Because no statute sets forth an express standard of review, we review MDE\u2019s decision under the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards. <em>See MDE v. Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. 88, 118-19, 134 A.3d 892 (2016). We are \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Halici, </em>180 Md.App. at 248, 949 A.2d 85 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cIn this context, substantial evidence, as the test for reviewing factual findings of adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>trative agencies, has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Tomlinson v. BKL York LLC, </em>219 Md.App. 606, 614, 101 A.3d 539 (2014) (quoting <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 568-69, 709 A.2d 749 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u201cWe have characterized the arbitrary and capricious standard of review as one that is \u2018extremely deferential.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. at 120, 134 A.3d 892 (quoting <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 299, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005)). \u201cOur review of the agency\u2019s factual findings entails only an appraisal and evaluation of the agency\u2019s fact finding and not an independent decision on the evidence.\u201d <em>Tomlinson, </em>219 Md.App. at 614, 101 A.3d 539 (quoting <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc., </em>349 Md. at 568-69, 709 A.2d 749). The paramount question we consider is \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. at 120, 134 A.3d 892 (quoting <em>Najafi v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>418 Md. 164, 173, 12 A.3d 1255 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">This Court reviews, <em>de novo, </em>the agency\u2019s conclusions of law, <em>see Schwartz v. Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168 (2005); however, \u201ca degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Assateague Coastkeeper v. MDE, </em>200 Md.App. 665, 690, 28 A.3d 178 (2011) (quoting <em>Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 173-74, 12 A.3d 1255). An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We review an agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency, because \u201cits decisions are prima facie correct and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 716, 732, 944 A.2d 538 (2008) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 213, 623 A.2d 198 (1993)); <em>see also Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. at 120, 134 A.3d 892 (quoting <em>Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 173, 12 A.3d 1255) (\u201c[W]e shall review the agency\u2019s decision \u2018in the light most favorable to it.\u2019 \u201d). Additionally, the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>challenging an administrative agency decision bears the burden of establishing that the agency\u2019s decision was incorrect. <em>Assateague Coastkeeper, </em>200 Md.App. at 690, 28 A.3d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Specific to the Environment Article, certain limitations exist on the issues properly before the court on a petition for judicial review of a refuse disposal system permit. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 1-601. In order to file a petition for judicial review, the party must have standing under federal law and be either the applicant for the permit or have \u201cparticipated in a public participation process through the submission of written or oral comments, unless an opportunity for public participation was not provided.\u201d EN \u00a7 l-601(c). Section l-605(c) of the Environment Article provides, \u201cJudicial review shall be on the administrative record before the Department and limited to objections raised during the public comment period, unless the petitioner demonstrates that: (i) the objections were not reasonably ascertainable during the comment period; (ii) or grounds for the objections arose after the comment period.\u201d EN \u00a7 l-601(d)(l). Most importantly, a party to an action for judicial review may challenge only whether MDE complied with the requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3), and \u201cmay not challenge the applicant\u2019s compliance with zoning and land use requirements .... \u201d Thus, our review is limited to whether MDE complied with EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i), and not whether the Tolson site complied with local county zoning and land use requirements at any point during the application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">II. Maryland Department of the Environment Did Not Err When It Determined That The Requirements of Environment Article \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) Were Met and, Relying on the Satisfaction of this Requirement, Approved the Tolson Rubble Landfill Permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Piney Orchard claims in its appeal that \u201csection 9-210(a)(3)(i) requires that MDE make the factual finding that the proposed [rubble landfill] \u2018[m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements.\u2019 \u201d Because the verb \u201cmeets\u201d is in the present tense, Piney Orchard argues, \u201csection 9-210(a)(3)(i) required MDE to make the factual finding that the proposed [rubble landfill] complied with local zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>and land use laws when MDE issued the permit <em>in 2014\u201d </em>when MDE issued the permit. Tolson contends, as they did below, that \u201c[t]he statute does not require\u2014nor authorize\u2014MDE to seek recertification of the application\u2019s compliance with local land use and solid waste planning requirements at any other stage in the process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Section 9-210 of the Environmental Article provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">(a) In general.\u2014Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may not issue a permit to install, materially alter, or materially extend a refuse disposal system regulated under \u00a7 9-204(a) of this subtitle until the requirements set forth in this subsection are met <em>in the following </em>sequence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">(1) Except for the opportunity for a public informational meeting, the Department has completed its preliminary phase 1 technical review of the proposed refuse disposal system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">(2) The Department has reported the findings of its preliminary phase 1 technical review, in writing, to the county\u2019s chief elected official and planning commission of the county where the proposed refuse disposal system is to be located; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">(3) <em>The county </em>has completed its review of the proposed refuse disposal system, and <em>has provided to the Department </em>a written statement that the refuse disposal system:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">(i) <em>Meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">(ii) Is in conformity with the county solid waste plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">(b) Completion of requirements.\u2014Upon completion of the requirements of subsection (a)(1) and (2) of this section, <em>the Department shall cease processing the permit application until the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">ER \u00a7 9-210 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Tolson and MDE argue that the statute\u2019s plain meaning provides a clear series of steps that must be satisfied sequen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>tially, after which MDE may grant the permit. One such step is MDE\u2019s receipt of a written statement from the County stating the facility\u2019s compliance with county zoning and land use regulations during Phase 1 of the permit approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Notably, Piney Orchard does not address whether the record contains substantial evidence to support MDE\u2019s decision that Tolson\u2019s application for a rubble landfill permit met all statutory requirements and, therefore, to issue the permit. An agency\u2019s decision carries with it the presumption of validity, and it is the appellant\u2019s burden when challenging an administrative agency decision to establish that no \u201creasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. at 120, 134 A.3d 892 (quoting <em>Najafi, </em>418 Md. at 173, 12 A.3d 1255); <em>see also Assateague Coastkeeper, </em>200 Md.App. at 699, 28 A.3d 178. Similarly, Piney Orchard carries the burden of demonstrating that MDE\u2019s decision was not \u201crationally supported by the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>See Travers v. Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t, </em>115 Md.App. 395, 419, 693 A.2d 378 (1997) (citing <em>Dep\u2019t of Econ. &amp; Emp\u2019t Dev. v. Lilley, </em>106 Md.App. 744, 754, 666 A.2d 921 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Piney Orchard has argued that \u00a7 9-210(a)(3) requires MDE, upon issuance of the permit, to \u201carticulate\u201d how a proposed landfill \u201c[m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements.\u201d Our review is limited to determining whether MDE relied on substantial evidence in the record in finding that it had received a statement from the County meeting the requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). As explained above, we hold that \u00a7 9-210(a)(3) places no requirement on MDE to make any determination regarding a facility\u2019s status of compliance with local zoning and land use codes, except that it must receive a letter from the County stating its compliance before MDE may continue through the remaining phases of the process. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In its Notice of Final Determination published in the <em>Maryland Gazette </em>and <em>Capital </em>newspapers, MDE noted that it \u201cfound the application to be technically complete\u201d and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>decision was \u201cbased upon the review of the permit application and supporting documents submitted by the applicant, and upon testimony and evidence presented at the public hearing held on August 18, 2011 .... \u201d The record contains the written statement from the Anne Arundel County Executive and the Department of Public Works, dated August 28, 2002, which provides that \u201cthis letter serves as confirmation that Tolson and Associates, L.L.C. proposed Rubble Landfill in the Crofton Area of Anne Arundel County meets all applicable zoning requirements and conforms to the current Solid Waste Management Plan.\u201d Additionally, MDE\u2019s Response to Comments is replete with explanations of the evidence MDE relied on in finding that the Tolson application satisfied the requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3). For example, in response to a question regarding whether Tolson had supplied a statement from the appropriate local government agency concerning the consistency of the facility with the approved county comprehensive Solid Waste Management Plan, MDE described the requirement under EN \u00a7 9-210(a) and how Tolson\u2019s application satisfied that requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">Section 9-210 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that the local county provide the Department with a statement that the proposed landfill meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements, and the landfill is in conformance with the county solid waste plan. The Department received a letter from the Anne Arundel County Department of Public Works on August 28, 2002, stating that the proposed rubble landfill meets all applicable zoning requirements and conforms to the current Solid Waste Management Plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In response to another question regarding the impact the rubble landfill could have on new development in Anne Arundel County, MDE explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">Decisions regarding the appropriateness of a proposed land use relative to surrounding land uses are strictly within the province of the local zoning and land use authority except those environmental issues addressed in the State\u2019s permitting process. Anne Arundel County has supplied the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>quired documentation that local land use rules have been satisfied. This in turn satisfies the-requirement of Environment Article \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i), which is a precondition for permit issuance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Our review of the record, including the County\u2019s written statement, MDE\u2019s Final Determination, and MDE\u2019s comprehensive Response to Comments demonstrate that MDE relied on substantial evidence in determining that the Tolson application satisfied the requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Section 9-210(a)(3)(i) makes clear that MDE\u2019s only responsibility with regard to the written statement from the County is to confirm that it received a letter from the County stating that \u201cthe refuse disposal system ... [m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements\u201d prior to continuing the permit approval process. EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). The record, therefore, demonstrates that the County completed its review of Tolson\u2019s proposed rubble landfill and that MDE received a written statement from the County that the Tolson site \u201c[m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements\u201d at the point at which it was required by statute. Accordingly, we hold that MDE did not err in determining that Tolson\u2019s application complied with EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i), or, in relying in part on the completion of this step in its decision to approve the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">A. The Plain Language of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) Demonstrates That MDE was Not Required to Make a Finding of Fact That the Tolson Site Met All Applicable County Zoning and Land Use Requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation, and specifically, the statute\u2019s plain language. The primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the intention of the Legislature. <em>Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>442 Md. 254, 265, 112 A.3d 408 (2015); <em>see also Marriott Emps. Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996)). To ascertain that intention, \u201cthe very language of the statute serves as the primary source of the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Kona Properties, LLC v. W.D.B. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Corp., </em>224 Md.App. 517, 561, 121 A.3d 191 (2015). When the language of the statute is clear, we need not look any further to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Baltimore Cnty. v. Balt. Cnty. Frat. Order of Police, </em>439 Md. 547, 572, 96 A.3d 742 (2014) (quoting <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613, 937 A.2d 242 (2007), The goal of effectuating the intent of the legislature is accomplished \u201cby construing \u2018the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language.\u2019 \u201d <em>McHale v. DCW Dutchship Island, LLC, </em>415 Md. 145, 171, 999 A.2d 969 (2010) (quoting <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury Clements, </em>412 Md. 308, 314-15, 987 A.2d 48 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We must also be careful not to expand the scope of what the legislature intended. \u201cThe Court may not insert or omit terms to make a statute express an intention not reflected in the statute\u2019s original form,\u201d <em>Marriott Emps., </em>346 Md. at 444-45, 697 A.2d 455; <em>see also Thompson v.

State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003)). On the other hand, we read the statute \u201cas a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered meaningless.\u201d <em>Bourgeois v.

In announcing its decision, the circuit court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">Petitioners[\u2019] frustration and contention is that the County\u2019s certification letter, written in 2002, and relied on by MDE is stale .... Contrary to [Appellants\u2019] contentions, the statute does not require the County to re-certify the site\u2019s compliance with local land use requirements at any other stage in the process. Simply put, the statute contemplates first that MDE receive certification from the County. While waiting for certification, MDE temporarily stops processing the application. Upon receipt from the County that local zoning and land use requirements are satisfied, MDE is satisfied and continues the phase review of the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">Here, the record is clear that MDE received a written statement from the County indicating that local zoning and land use requirements were satisfied. MDE\u2019s receipt of this letter satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 9-210(a). MDE proceeded to complete the remaining steps in the permitting and review process. Granted, the process took many years. However, the statute does not require that MDE receive a similar letter from the County after a certain number of years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Again, the statute requires only that the County has evaluated the facility and \u201cprovided to the [MDE] a written statement that the refuse disposal system ... [m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements.\u201d EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). MDE ceases reviewing the application for compliance with applicable state regulations until it has received a statement from the County regarding county zoning regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tions. Thereafter, MDE completes Phases 2 and 3 of the process. Throughout these distinct phases, MDE and the County maintain separate and distinct roles. Notably, the plain language of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3) does not require or permit MDE to evaluate a facility\u2019s compliance with local zoning and land use codes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No evaluation or factual determination on the part of MDE is required by the statute, except to determine whether it has received the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">B. Section \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) of the Environment Article Does Not Require MDE to Receive an Updated Written Statement of Compliance from the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Piney Orchard argues that because EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) uses the term \u201cmeets,\u201d which is in the present tense, \u201c[\u00a7 ] 9-210(a)(3) require[s] MDE to make the factual finding that the proposed [rubble landfill] complied with local zoning and land use laws when MDE issued the permit <em>in 2014. \u201d </em>(emphasis added). In other words, Piney Orchard argues that MDE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>never received an adequate written statement from the County certifying that the Tolson Landfill \u201c[m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements\u201d at all, because the County\u2019s letter did not confirm that the Tolson site complied with local zoning and land use requirements at the time MDE issued the permit. EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Piney Orchard, however, provides no authority to support this interpretation, and fails to demonstrate why the present-tense form \u201cmeets,\u201d under these or similar circumstances, is inconsistent with MDE\u2019s interpretation\u2014that \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) requires a statement from the County about a facility\u2019s compliance when the County performs its evaluation of the site when required by EN \u00a7 9-210.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We are not persuaded by Piney Orchard\u2019s interpretation of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(i). The County\u2019s written statement is based on the state of a facility\u2019s compliance with local zoning and land use codes at the time the County is required to evaluate the facility and send the written statement to MDE. To hold otherwise would render meaningless the statute\u2019s requirement that each step be completed in sequence, especially when considered in conjunction with EN \u00a7 9-210(b), which requires MDE to stop processing the application until it receives the written statement from the County. EN \u00a7 9-210(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The point at which a written statement from the County is required is an important and defined moment in the series of required steps, because MDE must stop processing a particular application until the statement is received. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(b). Two additional phases, and many other time-consuming steps, follow MDE\u2019s receipt of the County\u2019s written statement of compliance with local zoning codes. The statute further prohibits MDE from progressing any further through the process until it receives the letter from the County at this point. Moreover, Piney Orchard cannot point to any deadline or \u201cexpiration date\u201d in the statute, after which a written statement from the County becomes \u201cstale\u201d and no longer meets the statutory requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3). We, therefore, hold that the statute does not require MDE to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>obtain the County\u2019s written statement within a certain proximity of time to the date it approves the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The statute does not require MDE to \u201creevaluate\u201d a facility\u2019s compliance with local codes at the time or within some defined period within which it issues the permit. As part of the application approval process, EN \u00a7 9-210(a) requires MDE to complete three steps in a defined sequence. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(a). Part of the third step in this process, and the provision that Piney Orchard holds out as support for the error in MDE\u2019s approval of the permit, is that the County must \u201ccomplete[ ] its review of the proposed refuse disposal system, and ... provide[ ] to the [MDE] a written statement that the refuse disposal system: (i) Meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements ....\u201d EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Indeed, under \u00a7 9-210(b), after the first two requirements under \u00a7 9-210(a) are met, MDE must stop processing the application until it receives this written statement from the County pursuant to \u00a7 9-210(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Piney Orchard implies that we must read into the statute a certain proximity of time to MDE\u2019s issuance of the permit during which it must receive the County\u2019s statement certifying compliance with local zoning and land use codes. Piney Orchard does not explain, however, whether this should be accomplished by requiring MDE to obtain multiple statements from the County confirming the Tolson Landfill\u2019s compliance with local zoning codes at various points throughout the application process. For MDE to comply with the procedural requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) <em>and </em>Piney Orchard\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cmeets,\u201d however, MDE would either have to receive a letter from the County during Phase 1 that predicts the site\u2019s future compliance at the end of the application process, or request an updated statement from the County just before issuing a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">To the extent Piney Orchard argues that MDE should have received an updated statement from the County, Section \u00a7 9-210 does not require, either explicitly or implicitly, a second or \u201cfollow up\u201d statement from the County. The statute requires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>instead, that MDE follow a particular sequence of steps and mentions the written statement of compliance from the County only once\u2014near the end of Phase 1. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Based on the plain language of the statute, MDE\u2019s sole obligation during Phase 1 of the permit application process regarding any duty to ensure compliance with local zoning and land use regulations is to receive a statement from the County certifying that the particular facility meets the local requirements. Only then may the MDE continue to process the application. If the General Assembly had intended to require MDE to receive an updated written statement from the County at that later date, it could have included that requirement in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Following Piney Orchard\u2019s interpretation of EN \u00a7 9-210 would violate our canon of statutory construction that we must not \u201cinsert or omit terms to make a statute express an intention not reflected in the statute\u2019s original form.\u201d <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 524, 636 A.2d 448. Nothing in the statute requires MDE to receive the written statement, or an updated statement, from the County just before issuing the permit. Moreover, this reading of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)\u2014that MDE must receive the written statement from the County that confirms a facility\u2019s compliance with local zoning codes at a later time than when the statute itself requires it during the approval process\u2014defies common sense. <em>See Marriott Emps., </em>346 Md. at 444-45, 697 A.2d 455 (\u201cCommon sense must guide us in our interpretation of statutes .... \u201d). Particularly when the statute is read as a whole, Piney Orchard\u2019s interpretation contradicts the clear mandate for MDE to stop processing the application until it receives the written statement from the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As the circuit court acknowledged, there is no debate over the fact that \u201cthe process for applying and eventually obtaining a permit is time consuming\u201d and \u201con average ... takes between three (3) and five (5) years.\u201d In this case, the total time from the date of Tolson\u2019s permit application until it was finally approved took more than twelve (12) years. The rubble landfill permit approval process is clearly a long and complex endeavor. Nevertheless, the requirements of MDE under EN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) are clear. The MDE is not required to request an updated written statement of compliance from the County after a certain period of time prior to issuing the permit. For these reasons, MDE did not err when it determined that the Tolson application complied with the requirements of EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) and approved the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">IV. The Circuit Court Did Not Err When It Found That Anne Arundel County Bills 21-14 and 34-03 Did Not Apply Retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The second dispute in this case concerns whether the circuit court erred in finding that two Anne Arundel County zoning ordinances\u2014Bill 21-14 and Bill 34-03\u2014did not apply to the Tolson Landfill. Piney Orchard argued that the passage of the two bills supported their contention that the County\u2019s letter did not comply with EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). As a result, Piney Orchard contended that it was error for MDE to issue the permit for the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The two bills concern local zoning laws that relate to landfills within Anne Arundel County. Bill 21-14 precludes the grant of new special exceptions for rubble and land-clearing debris landfills in residential districts within Anne Arundel County. Bill 21-14, subsequently codified as A.A.C. \u00a7 18-4-106, took effect on January 1,2015. Relevant to the application of Bill 21-14 is A.A.C. \u00a7 18-2-101(b)(1), which provides that \u201can application for a special exception or variance filed on or before April 4, 2005 shall be governed by the law as it existed prior to May 12, 2005 for the special exception or variance as approved.\u201d A.A.C. \u00a7 18-2-101(b)(1) (emphasis added). As explained above, the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals issued a special exception for the Tolson site in 1993, twelve years prior to 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Bill 34-03<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides certain requirements for both rubble and land-clearing debris landfills and addresses vehicular ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>cess to the site. Specifically, Bill 34-03 sets forth requirements for rubble landfills within residential districts, and expressly provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">[A]ll vehicular access to the site is provided from a collector street, an arterial roadway, a major highway, or a local road that serves only industrially-zoned or commercially-zoned property between the facility entrance and the first intersecting collector street, arterial roadway, or major highway in all directions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A.A.C. \u00a7 12-241.1(2),</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Piney Orchard argued below that the Tolson site did not comply with this vehicular access requirement. A central point of contention regarding the applicability of Bill 34-03 to the Tolson site was that the special exception, granted in 1993, allowed for the mined areas of the site to be used as a rubble landfill for construction and demolition waste and provided specific access requirements. In their original complaint, Piney Orchard conceded that a special exception was granted to the Tolson site and that the special exception authorized a rubble landfill. Critical to the applicability of Bill 34-03, the special exception required vehicular access to be restricted to Capital Raceway Road (referred to as \u201cRacetrack Road\u201d in 1993). The special exception became final on December 8, 1993. The circuit court ultimately found that neither bill raised by Piney Orchard applied to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Piney Orchard argues that the circuit court\u2019s discussion of the Landfill\u2019s compliance with Bills 21-14 and 34-03 is mere <em>dicta, </em>\u201cwas not essential to the lower court\u2019s judgment,\u201d and \u201cconflicted with Maryland law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For its part, Tolson argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that the circuit court\u2019s finding that Bills 21-14 and 34-03 do not apply to the Tolson Landfill was legally correct and fully disposed of the issue. We, therefore, address whether the circuit court\u2019s finding that the two zoning ordinances did not apply to the Tolson site was legally correct. Ultimately, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in its, finding that County Bills 21-14 and 34-03 do not apply to the Tolson site. We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">A. The Circuit Court\u2019s Conclusion that Bills 21-14 and 34-03 Do Not Apply to the Tolson Site Is Not <em>Dicta </em>and Fully Disposed of the Issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In an effort to avoid the consequence of the circuit court\u2019s findings that the two county bills do not apply to the Tolson site, Piney Orchard insists that the court\u2019s analysis is mere <em>dicta</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that the applicability of the bills to the Tolson site was not essential to the circuit court\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When a party raises a legal issue properly before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>court, and that court gives a \u201cdeliberate expression of its opinion upon that question, such opinion is not to be regarded as <em>obiter dictum, although the final judgment in the case may be rooted in another point also raised </em>by the record.\u201d Bowers, 227 Md.App. at 321-22, 133 A.3d 1254 (quoting <em>Schmidt, </em>366 Md. at 551, 784 A.2d 1112 (2001)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Piney Orchard arg-ues that, because the Court found that MDE was not required to look into whether the two bills applied, the Court\u2019s finding that the bills did not apply retroactively to the Tolson site was \u201cnot essential to the lower court\u2019s judgment that \u2018the County\u2019s certification letter, written in 2002, and relied on by MDE\u2019 was not stale.\u201d Indeed, Piney Orchard\u2014not Tolson\u2014raised Tolson\u2019s noncompliance with the two zoning ordinances in support of its argument that the County\u2019s written statement was \u201cstale.\u201d Despite raising this issue and the circuit court\u2019s express findings, Piney Orchard now argues that the circuit court erred in deciding both bills were not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Notably, the relevance of whether the two bills apply to the Tolson Landfill below related to Piney Orchard\u2019s argument that changes to local zoning laws made the County\u2019s written statement invalid. Piney Orchard argued that MDE should not have issued the permit because it did not have a valid \u201cwritten statement\u201d from the County certifying that the Tolson site \u201c[m]eets all county zoning and land use requirements\u201d when MDE issued the permit. EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). As discussed above, the circuit court found\u2014and we agree\u2014that MDE had no responsibility to determine whether a site continued to meet all county zoning and land use requirements. Once MDE received the written statement from the County, MDE\u2019s requirements under EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i) were satisfied. Nevertheless, because Piney Orchard presented its staleness argument, the circuit court addressed the applicability of the two bills raised by Piney Orchard. The circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Petitioners contend that a twelve year old County certification letter, in this case, is too long because in the intervening years, zoning in Anne Arundel County has changed, thus, the certification letter from 2002 is no longer reflective of the actual zoning requirements of 2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Piney Orchard, therefore, raised the question of whether the two county ordinances applied to the Tolson site as part of its argument that MDE failed to comply with EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Although we look through the circuit court\u2019s decision, the issue was briefed, argued and decided by the trial court. We review the circuit court\u2019s determination on this issue, as it \u201cplainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131. The question of whether the two bills apply to the Tolson site was \u201c \u2018directly involved in the issues of law ... and the mind of the Court was directly drawn to, and distinctly expressed upon the subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowers, </em>227 Md.App. at 322, 133 A.3d 1254 (quoting <em>Schmidt, </em>366 Md. at 552, 784 A.2d 1112).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There is no dispute that MDE received the written statement from the County at the point in the process required by the statute. Changes to the zoning laws after the County issues its written statement to MDE do not invalidate the County\u2019s written statement. The circuit court\u2019s rejection of Piney Orchard\u2019s argument was essential to the court\u2019s finding that the County\u2019s letter to MDE was valid and complied with EN \u00a7 9-210(a)(3)(i). Simply put, Piney Orchard\u2019s argument was rejected by the circuit court for many reasons, only one of which was that the two zoning bills did not apply retroactively to the Tolson site. Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s finding on this issue does not render the court\u2019s analysis on the issue of retroactivity <em>dicta </em>or leave the issue undecided.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">B. The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Finding that Bills 21-14 and 34-03 Do Not Apply to the Tolson Rubble Landfill Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Piney Orchard admits in its original complaint in this case that a special exception was in effect for the Tolson site at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>time MDE issued the permit. Piney Orchard offers little explanation for its contention that the two bills apply to the Tolson site. Indeed, Piney Orchard merely implies that there is a presumption of retroactivity applicable in this case; therefore, any subsequent zoning law applicable to rubble landfills must apply to the Tolson site. The circuit court considered the applicability of each bill specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">First, bill 21-14 applies to new special exceptions. The bill did not contain a retroactivity clause. MDE granted the permit to Tolson in 2014, prior to the effective date of bill 21-14 of January 1, 2015. The access road issue also fails for a similar reason. First, the change to the access road requirements occurred in 2003. A change in the zoning from 2003 does not automatically invalidate a previous and properly issued special exception. Here, the special exception was properly obtained in 1993. Any changes in zoning after the special exception was obtained, without a retroactivity clause, apply prospectively. The Court is also mindful of the fact that the Board of Appeals when it granted the special exception in 1993 imposed conditions on the rubblefill site to ensure that access to the site complied with the applicable zoning and land use laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in its determination that neither Bill 21-14 nor Bill 34-03 apply to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">1. Bill No. 21-14 Does Not Apply to the Tolson Site.</p>\n<p id=\"A31\">Piney Orchard argued below that Bill 21-14 operated to essentially invalidate the special exception granted to the Tolson site. More accurately, Bill 21-14 altered the County Code to prohibit new special exceptions from being granted in certain zoning categories after January 1, 2015. Not only did the bill become effective after MDE\u2019s issuance of a rubble landfill permit to Tolson on November 24, 2014, but the bill became effective many years after the County granted the special exception to the Tolson site. The bill does not contain a retroactivity clause and does not apply to special exceptions issued prior to January 1, 2015. Indeed, Bill 21-14 expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>provides that it prohibits only new special exceptions within certain zoning districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Moreover, had the City Council intended the ordinance to apply retroactively, it could have included a retroac-tivity clause in the bill. Amendments to the zoning code that prohibit new special exceptions for rubble landfills do not apply retroactively, unless provided. <em>See MDE v. Days Cove Reclamation, </em>200 Md.App. 256, 260, 27 A.3d 565 (2011). Special exceptions, in Maryland, are governed by the law at the time the special exception became final. <em>Richmarr Holly Hills v. American PCS, </em>117 Md.App. 607, 643-44, 701 A.2d 879 (1997). Here, the special exception became final in 1993. Bill 21-14, therefore, does not apply to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Other provisions of Article 18 of the Anne Arundel County Code support our conclusion that Bill 21-14 does not apply in this case. Pursuant to A.A.C. \u00a7 18-2-101, \u201c[a]n application for a special exception ... filed on or before April 4, 2005 shall be governed by the law as it existed prior to May 12, 2005 for the special exceptions ... as approved.\u201d If the General Assembly intended Bill 21-14 to apply to previously issued special exceptions, it would not only have included a retroactivity clause, but it also would have needed to amend A.A.C. \u00a7 18-2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">By its express terns, Bill 21-14 applies to new special exceptions. As such, it does not act to retroactively invalidate the previously issued special exception for the Tolson site. Here, Tolson had applied for\u2014and been granted\u2014a special exception for its site. As the circuit court correctly held, the special exception was properly obtained in 1993. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in determining that Bill 21-14 did not apply to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">2. Bill No. 34-03 Does Not Apply to the Tolson Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Bill 34-03 provided specific vehicular access requirements for rubble landfill special exceptions issued after 2003. It is undisputed that the County granted a special exception to the Tolson site, which became effective in 1993, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>special exception required that \u201c[a]ll truck traffic entering or exiting the site shall be restricted to Race Track [later renamed Capital Raceway Road].\u201d Piney Orchard conceded below that a special exception was granted for the Tolson site for the operation of a rubble landfill. Nevertheless, Piney Orchard maintains that the site failed to comply with the requirements of Bill 84-03 based on the site\u2019s access through Capital Raceway Road. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Critically, when the County granted the special exception to the Tolson site in 1993, the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals expressly considered the access to the site, the applicable county zoning and land use laws, and imposed express conditions on the Tolson site based on those considerations. More specifically, the special exception that was granted in 1993 expressly required that all truck traffic entering or exiting the site shall be restricted to the Capital Raceway Road. As such, the circuit court did not err when it found that Bill 34-03 did not apply to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We agree with the circuit court that neither Bill 21-14 nor Bill 34-03 applies to the Tolson site.. Neither bill operated to invalidate the special exception or applied to the Tolson site retroactively. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in its determination that Bill 21-14 and 34-03 do not apply to the Tolson site.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">. Appellant, Piney Orchard Community Association, represents a group of concerned citizens, who participated in the public comment process for the Tolson permit. Co-Appellants include Earthreports, Inc. (dba Patuxent Riverlceeper), and eight Maryland residents: Jeffrey R. An-drade, Louise H. Keister, Peter Hanan, Robert Bochar, Kirsten Whitley, Michael C. Davie, Erika Garrett, and Robert Garrett.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\">. Piney Orchard has initiated two other related cases, including an administrative challenge to Appellees\u2019 request for a temporal variance to allow time to finish constructing the landfill, and a third case in the circuit court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, which is currently on appeal in this court <em>(Piney Orchard Comty. Ass'n v. Maryland Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t., </em>Case No. 1824, Sept. Term 2015). MDE is not a party to Case No. 1824, which arises from an action filed by Appellants against other Appellees in this appeal. On January 20, 2016, this Court denied Appellants\u2019 motion to consolidate this appeal with Appellants\u2019 separate appeal in Case No. 1824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">. Appellant, Piney Orchard, presented the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">1. Whether MDE\u2019s decision to approve the rubblefill permit adequately articulated how the proposed rubblefill satisfied the requirement in Env't Art., section 9-210(a)(3)(i) that the rubblefill \"meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">2. If MDE adequately articulated how the proposed rubblefill satisfied Env\u2019t Art., section 9-210(a)(3)(i), did the lower court err when it stated in <em>dicta </em>that Bill 21-14 and Bill 34-03 had no retroactive effect.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">. MDE found that all requirements had been satisfied, \"with the exception of the submittal of a surety bond,\u201d which Tolson later satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">. Bill No, 21-14, which is now codified as A.A.C. \u00a7 18-4-106, became effective January 1, 2015.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\">. During oral argument, however, Piney Orchard acknowledged that the statute provides no deadline after which MDE must receive a new or updated letter from the County stating that the site is in compliance with all zoning and land use laws currently in force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\">. Piney Orchard argues in its Reply Brief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\"Citizen-Petitioners' [sic] do not argue that the applicable law required MDE itself to analyze whether the rubblefill meets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements. Rather, Citizen-Petitioners argue that the law required MDE to articulate that it had received from the County \"a written statement\u201d that the rubblefill \u2018\u2018[m]eets all applicable county zoning and land use requirements\u201d in 2014, when it issued the permit.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b122-6\">. We do not typically delve into the legislative history of a statute when our review of the plain language reveals no ambiguity. <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Swedo, </em>439 Md. 441, 453-54, 96 A.3d 210 (2014) (citing <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003)). We note, however, that even the legislative history behind EN \u00a7 9-210 supports our interpretation that its plain language places any responsibility to evaluate the proposed site with the County and not MDE. Prior to 1988, the statute did require MDE to confirm, prior to \"issuing] a permit to install, materially alter, or materially extend a landfill ...\" that a proposed landfill \"meets all zoning and land use requirements of the county where the landfill is or is to be located ....\u201d <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210 (1987); <em>see also Maryland Reclamation v. Harford County, </em>414 Md. 1, 38, 994 A.2d 842 (2010). The General Assembly removed any responsibility of MDE to ensure compliance with local codes from the statute when it was amended in 1988 to require, instead, a written statement from the applicant that the proposed landfill \"meets all applicable zoning and land use requirements.\" <em>See, e.g., </em>EN \u00a7 9-210 (1988). In 1992, the statute was amended again to a form similar to the current language of EN \u00a7 9-210, and it now requires the County to review the site and provide MDE with a written statement confirming the site\u2019s compliance with local zoning and land use requirements. <em>See </em>EN \u00a7 9-210 (1992). Thus, the legislative history demonstrates that the General Assembly intended to eliminate from the province of MDE any duty to evaluate a proposed site for its compliance with local county zoning and land use requirements and to maintain the separate and distinct roles of MDE and the County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. Bill 34-03 was codified as A.A.C. \u00a7 12-241.1(2) at the time the Tolson site was granted a special exception in 1993; it was recodified in 2005 as A.A.C. \u00a7 18-11-150(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\">. The significance of whether the circuit court disposed of the issue of the applicability of the two zoning ordinances relates to another case filed by Piney Orchard on appeal to this court (Case No. 1824, Sept. Term 2015). In Case No. 1824, Piney Orchard originally sought an injunction and declaratory judgment based on the applicability of the county ordinances on the Tolson Landfill. There, in an alternative ruling, the circuit court found that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred Piney Orchard from raising the issue of whether the two county bills applied to the Tolson Landfill site. That Court concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>circuit court in the present case (Case No. 1124, Sept. Term 2015) had already decided the same issue. In this appeal, Piney Orchard requests that, if we determine that MDE did not err in granting the permit to Tolson, we \"clarify that [we] do not base any affirmation of the [Landfill] permit on the lower court\u2019s <em>dicta </em>that Bill 21-14 and Bill 34-03 had no retroactive effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">.

A court's analysis of a question that was \u201cdirectly involved in the issues of law,\u201d that \"the mind of the court was directly drawn to, and distinctly expressed upon the subject\u201d is not mere <em>dicta.
