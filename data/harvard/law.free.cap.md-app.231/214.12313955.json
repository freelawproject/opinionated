New Jersey, </em>385 U.S. 493, 500, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A grand jury sitting in Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) subpoenaed the County government to produce records, including employee interviews, that the County\u2019s Fire/Emergency Medical Services Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) collected during an investigation into certain, potentially criminal, acts of its employees. The County moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that producing those records would violate the employees\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights because employees implicated in the investigation made statements to investigators that were coerced under a Department policy that requires employees to cooperate with internal investigations under threat of losing their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">After a hearing, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County issued an order denying the County\u2019s motion to protect the videos, dispatch calls, and witness statements, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>granting the County\u2019s motion to protect the firefighters\u2019 coerced statements and the Department\u2019s investigation report. The State appealed and presents the single question: \u201cDid the circuit court erroneously quash that part of the grand jury subpoena seeking the involved firefighters\u2019 statements and the County Fire Department\u2019s investigatory report?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On October 21, 2016, the State filed a motion for expedited decision, alerting this Court that the statute of limitations on any possible indictment for assault would run December 8, 2016. After hearing the appeal on November 7, 2016, this Court issued a <em>per curiam </em>order on November 23, 2016, reversing that part of the circuit court\u2019s April 12, 2016 order that granted the County\u2019s motion for protective order. This opinion explains that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We hold that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not prohibit a grand jury from compelling the production of a public agency\u2019s internal investigative reports containing coerced self-incriminating statements of its employees. The employees may, however, move to suppress the evidence and its fruits if the government seeks to use them against the employees in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">At the outset, we caution that by virtue of the secrecy historically afforded to grand jury investigations, the facts that form the crux of this grand jury\u2019s inquiry are largely unknown to this Court and are under seal. Our factual recitation is based exclusively on the publicly available transcript of the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">On behalf of the State of Maryland, the grand jury in Prince George\u2019s County served a subpoena duces tecum on the Office of the County Attorney, as counsel for the Department. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>subpoena requested the Department produce \u201cany and all documents related to an investigation into an assault that took place on December 8, 2015 at 5409 75th Avenue, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, during a fire at said location to include but not limited to videos, dispatch calls, witness and respondent statements and police reports.\u201d The County filed for a protective order in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County asking the court to quash the subpoena: (1) because it contained employee personnel records; and (2) because the County claimed that the report contained a number of \u201cGarrity-related statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">At the hearing on April 11, 2016, the County explained that two career firefighters filed with the Department a statement of charges against two volunteers involved in the alleged assault at 75th Avenue. In response, Department Battalion Chief Ava C. Hagood conducted an investigation and issued a report based on emails, photographs, a video clip, and a number of witness interviews. The County Attorney proffered that about a dozen of the witness statements\u2014including a written statement from each of the firefighters involved in the altercation\u2014were compelled under a Department policy that requires an employee to cooperate with internal investigations or lose his or her job. The County offered the investigation report for <em>in camera </em>review, but the court declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">After taking the parties\u2019 arguments under advisement, the circuit court issued a protective order with respect to \u201cthe compelled statements of the respondent firefighters and the report proposed by the Fire Department\u2019s investigation[,]\u201d but denied the protective order \u201cas to videos, dispatch calls, and witness statements.\u201d The State noted its timely appeal to this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We distill from the State\u2019s contentions of error three distinct challenges to the court\u2019s order. First, the State presents the unpreserved argument that, because the Fifth Amendment is a personal right, the Department lacked standing to assert the privilege on behalf of individual firefighters. Second, the State\u2019s central argument is that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated when a grand jury subpoenas and reviews documentary evidence containing potentially incriminating statements, even when the government has \u201ccoerced\u201d the statements from its employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And third, the State argues that, should we find for the County on the first two points, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>proper disposition is to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing in the circuit court to determine whether the Department actually compelled the firefighters\u2019 statements\u2014an issue the circuit court accepted based only on the County Attorney\u2019s proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">We first address the State s contention that the County does not have standing to assert a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of its employees. The State admits that it did not raise the standing issue below, but asks this Court to consider it regardless of the fact that it was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In response, the County attempts to pivot away from the idea that it is protecting the employees\u2019 individual Fifth Amendment rights, by asserting that it has standing based on the \u201cright of a public employer to insist that its employees answer job-related questions.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. </em>Shockley, 142 Md.App. 312, 324, 790 A.2d 73 (2002). The County claims that the subpoena in question interferes with the County\u2019s\u2014and more generally, the public\u2019s\u2014legitimate interest in public employees complying with job-related questions. The County\u2019s diversion to its own right to require employees to answer job-related questions does not, however, remove the Fifth Amendment underpinning of its challenge to the subpoena and the requirements for standing to assert a Fifth Amendment claim on behalf of another. Nevertheless, we decline to address the standing issue because it was not preserved<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and because it implicates a constitutional question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that is not necessary to decide today.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 171, 638 A.2d 93 (1994) (\u201cWe have long adhered to the policy of not deciding constitutional issues unnecessarily.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The State asserts that the grand jury is entitled to subpoena the Department\u2019s report and witness statements because the Fifth Amendment only prohibits the grand jury from directly and actively violating the constitutional rights of the target(s) of its investigation\u2014leaving the grand jury free to consider evidence that is already tainted at the time of production. According to the State, this is because the grand jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>historical role as an investigator, rather than an adjudicator, requires that courts afford the grand jury broad power to consider all available evidence regardless of that evidence\u2019s competency or admissibility at trial. The State adduces this argument from two progenies of Supreme Court decisional law: one holding that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule is inapplicable to grand jury proceedings; and one holding that a court should not dismiss an indictment because the grand jury based its decision on tainted evidence, the admission of which at trial would violate the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The County responds that the cases on which the State relies are inapposite. First, the County distinguishes those cases upholding an indictment based on tainted evidence on the ground that in each case, the court\u2019s decision was <em>ex post </em>rather than <em>ex ante </em>actively permitting a grand jury to bypass an individual\u2019s constitutionally protected rights. Second, the County argues that the State\u2019s reliance on the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule\u2014which weighs the harm of allowing in the evidence against the benefits of deterring similar future police misconduct\u2014is inapplicable because there is no state misconduct involved in compelling work-related incident statements from public employees. The County urges that rule articulated in <em>Garrity v. New </em>Jersey\u2014that public employees\u2019 compelled statements may not be used in any criminal proceedings\u2014applies to the grand jury proceedings in this case. 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616. The County also directs us to a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, <em>In re Grand Jury, John Doe No. G.J. 2005-2, </em>478 F.3d 581, 588 (4th Cir. 2007) <em>(\u201cJohn Doe\u201d), </em>in which that court affirmed a district court\u2019s decision to quash a subpoena after considering, in similar circumstances, the subpoena\u2019s Fifth Amendment implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Because the court\u2019s order involves the interpretation and application of constitutional and decisional law, we undertake a <em>de novo </em>review in determining whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions were legally correct. <em>In re Nick H., </em>224 Md.App. 668, 681, 123 A.3d 229 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>A. The Fifth Amendment Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d Similarly, Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides that \u201cno man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cIt is important, in applying constitutional principles, to interpret them in light of the fundamental interests of personal liberty they were meant to serve.\u201d <em>Couch, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 336, 93 S.Ct. 611. The Fifth Amendment protects a claimant from \u201c \u2018the cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury or contempt[,]\u2019 \u201d based, in part, on \u201c \u2018our fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 93 S.Ct. 611 (quoting <em>Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n of N.Y. Harbor, </em>378 U.S. 52, 55, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964)). The privilege against self-incrimination does not, however, grant speakers a liberty interest in being free from inquiry. <em>Smith v. State, </em>394 Md. 184, 212, 905 A.2d 315 (2006) (citations omitted). \u201cFor the history of the privilege establishes not only that it is not to be interpreted literally, but also that its sole concern is, as its name indicates, with the danger to a witness forced to give testimony leading to the infliction of penalties affixed to the criminal acts[.]\u201d <em>Ullmann v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 422, 438-39, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956) (footnote, citation, and internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>omitted); <em>see also Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (explaining that the purpose of offering derivative use immunity to witnesses testifying before a grand jury is to ensure \u201cthat the testimony cannot lead to the infliction of criminal penalties on the witness\u201d). Further, the Supreme Court has directed that \u201c[t]he central standard for the privilege\u2019s application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d <em>Marchetti v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 39, 53, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">In determining whether the State has violated an individual\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, we are mindful of the scope of the constitutional right as well as the rules courts have created to help safeguard the right. Although the privilege against self-incrimination is fundamentally a <em>\u201ctrial right </em>of criminal defendants!!,]\u201d <em>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, </em>494 U.S. 259, 264, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990) (emphasis added), the Supreme Court has found it \u201cnecessary to allow assertion of the privilege prior to the commencement of a \u2018criminal case\u2019 to safeguard the core Fifth Amendment trial right.\u201d <em>Chavez v. Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 771, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003); <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 444-45, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (reasoning that an individual may assert the privilege \u201cin any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory; and it protects against any disclosures which the witness reasonably believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used\u201d). Prophylactic rules and grants of immunity in non-criminal cases help further \u201cpreserve!! ] the core Fifth Amendment right from invasion by the use of that compelled testimony in a subsequent criminal case[,]\u201d but \u201cviolations of judicially crafted prophylactic rules do not violate the constitutional rights of any person.\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>538 U.S. at 771-72, 123 S.Ct. 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>In sura, the claimant must face a substantial, non-speculative risk of criminal sanction resulting from the government\u2019s use of the coerced statement in a criminal proceeding. At the threshold of our analysis, then, we determine whether a grand jury investigation is a \u201ccriminal case\u201d or \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">1. No Criminal Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The County relies principally on <em>Garrity, supra, </em>in leveling its challenge to the grand jury subpoena\u2019s request for records containing statements by public employees that were coerced by the government. In <em>Garrity </em>the central issue was whether the State of New Jersey violated the Fifth Amendment rights of certain police officers by coercing statements from those officers during an internal affairs investigation and then using the statements against the officers in subsequent prosecutions. 385 U.S. at 494-95, 87 S.Ct. 616. The Supreme Court held that the State had violated the officers\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights because the privilege against self-incrimination \u201cprohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 87 S.Ct. 616. As this Court summarized the <em>Garrity </em>rule: \u201c\u2018The public employer has a choice between either demanding a statement from an employee on job-related matters, in which case it can not use the statements in a criminal prosecution, or prosecuting the employee, in which case it cannot terminate the employee for refusing to give a statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shockley, supra, </em>142 Md.App. at 322, 790 A.2d 73 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>739 F.Supp. 1504, 1514-15 (S.D. Fla. 1990)). Under <em>Garrity, </em>there is no constitutional injury when the government compels from its employees statements against the employees\u2019 self-interest unless and until the government uses those statements in a \u201ccriminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Chavez, </em>538 U.S. at 769, 123 S.Ct. 1994 (\u201cOur holdings in these cases demonstrate that ... mere coercion does not violate the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause absent use of the compelled witness statements in a criminal case against the witness.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The question then becomes whether or not a grand jury investigation is a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d within the meaning of <em>Garrity. </em>We begin by reviewing the grand jury\u2019s role and function in history.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">a. The Grand Jury\u2019s Historical Role as an Investigative Body</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Nearly a century ago, the Supreme Court observed that the grand jury \u201cis a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation <em>and inquisition, </em>the scope of whose inquiries is not limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime.\u201d <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 282, 39 S.Ct. 468, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919) (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals observed then that \u201c[t]he institution known as the grand inquest, or the grand jury, is of ancient origin[,]\u201d dating back at least to the rule of Henry III in the early Thirteenth Century. <em>In re Report of Grand Jury Appeal of Perring, </em>152 Md. 616, 619, 137 A. 370, 372 (1927) <em>(\u201cPerring\").</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The grand jury\u2019s \u201chistoric office has been to provide a shield against arbitrary or oppressive action, by insuring that serious criminal accusations will be brought only upon the considered judgment of a representative body of citizens acting under oath and under judicial instruction and guidance.\u201d <em>United States v. Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. 564, 571, 96 S.Ct. 1768, 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>L.Ed.2d 212 (1976). In this way the proceeding acts as a \u201cbuffer\u201d between the government and the citizenry. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>504 U.S. 36, 47, 112 S.Ct. 1735, 118 L.Ed.2d 352 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Judge Digges, writing for the Court of Appeals in 1927 in <em>Pemng, </em>expounded on the long revered efficacy of the grand jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">At common law, just as no man may be convicted and punished of a felony without the unanimous verdict of twelve of his peers, constituting the petit jury, neither can he be put to his trial for any such offense except upon the presentment or indictment by at least twelve of his fellow citizens, constituting the grand jury. This is true in Maryland, in the federal courts, and in most of the states of the Union, .... So jealously have the people generally regarded this requirement as a safeguard to liberty that it is embodied in some form in most, if not all, of the Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avn\"><em>Perring, </em>152 Md. at 621, 137 A. at 372. In Maryland, that safeguard is found in Article 21 of Maryland\u2019s Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">To ensure that the grand jury may fully investigate potential wrongdoing, while protecting the public from crime and the accused from unfounded prosecutions, courts have tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tionally accorded the grand jury \u201cwide latitude to inquire into violations of criminal law.\u201d <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). That is because \u201c[a] grand jury proceeding is not an adversary hearing in which the guilt or innocence of the accused is adjudicated. Rather, it is an ex parte investigation to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether criminal proceedings should be instituted against any person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>343-44, 94 S.Ct. 613; <em>see also Bartram v. State, </em>280 Md. 616, 627, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977) (citations omitted) (\u201c \u2018The grand jury is an accusing body, and not a judicial tribunal.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The grand jury\u2019s authority \u201cto require the production of evidence\u201d is \u201c[indispensable to the exercise of its power.\u201d <em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 571, 96 S.Ct. 1768 (citations omitted). As far back as 1891, the Court of Appeals emphasized the importance of this function, reasoning that without the power of inquest, the grand jury would be limited \u201cto the investigation only of cases laid before them or falling under their own personal knowledge or observation.\u201d <em>Blaney v. State, </em>74 Md. 153, 155, 21 A. 547, 547 (1891). The Supreme Court of the United States more recently reiterated that the sources of evidence into which the grand jury may inquire are \u201cwidely drawn, and the validity of an indictment is not affected by the character of the evidence considered.\u201d <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 344-45, 94 S.Ct. 613. Its \u201cinvestigative power must be broad if its public responsibility is adequately to be discharged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 94 S.Ct. 613 (citations omitted). For this reason, the Court of Appeals has repeatedly described the grand jury\u2019s inquisitorial powers as \u201cplenary.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lykins v. State, </em>288 Md. 71, 82, 415 A.2d 1113 (1980); <em>Perring, </em>152 Md. at 621, 137 A. at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Commensurate with the grand jury\u2019s plenary inquisitional authority is the \u201cobligation of every person to appear and give his evidence before the grand jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 10, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973). Like the grand jury itself, this duty stems from common law roots. The Supreme Court has remarked that it is unclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>when grand juries began compelling witnesses to testify, but the power seems to have existed by 1612 when Lord Bacon declared: \u201c \u2018All subjects, without distinction of degrees, owe to the King tribute and service, not only of their deed and hand, but of their knowledge and discovery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blair, </em>250 U.S. at 279-80, 39 S.Ct. 468 (citing <em>Countess of Shrewsbury\u2019s Case, </em>2 How. St. Tr. 769, 778 (K.B. 1612)). \u201cThe personal sacrifice\u201d of those subpoenaed by the grand jury \u201cis part of the necessary contribution of the individual to the welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 39 S.Ct. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">b. Secrecy and Independence</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Recognizing the sensitive and fluid nature of a preliminary investigation, the Court of Appeals has long mandated that grand jury proceedings remain secret. <em>Elbin v. Wilson </em>33 Md. 135, 144 (1870); <em>see also In re Criminal Investigation No. 437 in Circuit Court for Baltimore City, </em>316 Md. 66, 76, 557 A.2d 235 (1989) (\u201cSecrecy is the lifeblood of the grand jury.\u201d). Secrecy protects the grand jury\u2019s freedom of inquiry as well as the privacy of the innocent persons who bear witness before it. <em>Coblentz v. State, </em>164 Md. 558, 566-67, 166 A. 45 (1933). Maintaining secrecy is an \u201cinflexible requirement,\u201d <em>id. </em>566-67, 166 A. 45, which ensures the grand jury furthers public justice by remaining free from inducement and outside influence. <em>Jones v.

No Criminal Proceeding until the Grand Jury Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As early as 1896, the Supreme Court determined that a grand jury is not a criminal proceeding. In <em>Post v. United States, </em>a criminal defendant asked the Supreme Court to demur his indictment based on a new, prospective state law that required the state to institute \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d in the judicial district in which the alleged offense occurred. 161 U.S. 583, 584-86, 16 S.Ct. 611, 40 L.Ed. 816 (1896). A federal district convened a grand jury before the new law took effect, but the grand jury did not indict the defendant until after that date. <em>Id. </em>The Court, therefore, had to determine whether a grand jury is a criminal proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 16 S.Ct. 611. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">Criminal proceedings cannot be said to be brought or instituted until a formal charge is openly made against the accused, either by indictment presented or information filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in court, or, at the least, by complaint before a magistrate. The submission of a bill of indictment by the attorney for the government to the grand jury, and the examination of witnesses before them, are both in secret, and <em>are no part of the criminal proceedings </em>against the accused, but are merely to assist the grand jury in determining whether such proceedings shall be commenced. The grand jury may ignore the bill, and decline to find any indictment; and it cannot be known whether any proceedings will be instituted against the accused until an indictment against him is presented in open court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 587, 16 S.Ct. 611 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Virginia v. Paul, </em>148 U.S. 107, 119, 13 S.Ct. 536, 37 L.Ed. 386 (1893) (ruling that there was no criminal proceeding before the state returned an indictment or initiated proceedings in the court). Similarly, the Court of Appeals has declared that a criminal case does not begin until the grand jury acts. <em>Reddick v. State, </em>219 Md. 95, 100, 148 A.2d 384 (1959) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that the grand jury unreasonably delayed presenting appellant\u2019s indictment, the Court held that \u201c[ujntil the Grand Jury acted there was no case to be tried.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In fact, the grand jury\u2019s entire function is determining \u201cwhether criminal proceedings <em>should be instituted </em>against any person.\u201d <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. 613 (emphasis added). Logically, to brand a grand jury investigation a criminal proceeding would diminish the fundamental precept of American criminal law that one is innocent until proven guilty. Indeed, \u201cthe identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury\u2019s labors, not at the beginning^]\u201d <em>Blair </em>250 U.S. at 282, 39 S.Ct. 468 (citing <em>Hendricks v. United States, </em>223 U.S. 178, 184, 32 S.Ct. 313, 56 L.Ed. 394 (1912)), and a grand jury investigation may never actually result in a criminal proceeding. <em>Cf. Chavez, supra, </em>538 U.S. at 766, 123 S.Ct. 1994 (stating that it \u201cneed not decide today the precise moment when a \u2018criminal case\u2019 commences[,]\u201d but reasoning that \u201c[i]n our view, a \u2018criminal case at the very least requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the initiation of legal proceedings\u201d). The overwhelming number of courts to address this issue reached the same conclusion we do here: a grand jury is an investigative and inquisitorial proceeding, not a criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">d. A Body of Laypersons</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Our conclusion that a grand jury is not a criminal proceeding is consistent with the grand jury\u2019s historical structure. We hesitate to create rules that would exclude evidence from a grand jury\u2019s consideration because, \u201cin this Country as in England of old[,] the grand jury has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules[.]\u201d <em>Costello v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 359, 362, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956). As laypersons, the grand jurors, \u201cdo not know and cannot be expected to know, the technical rules of evidence; and while, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>no doubt, it is the duty of the prosecutor to give them such as he may in that respect, he has no control over them.\u201d <em>Bartram, supra, </em>280 Md. at 625, 374 A.2d 1144. To permit the subject of a grand jury\u2019s investigation to challenge the competency of evidence the grand jury considers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao7\">would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change. In a trial on the merits, defendants are entitled to a strict observance of all the rules designed to bring about a fair verdict. Defendants are not entitled, however, to a rule which would result in interminable delay but add nothing to the assurance of a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABG\"><em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 364, 76 S.Ct. 406. Accordingly, affirming the lower courts\u2019 refusal to dismiss an indictment on the ground that the only evidence before the grand jury was hearsay, the Supreme Court in <em>Costello </em>instructed that \u201cneither the Fifth Amendment nor any other constitutional provision prescribes the kinds of evidence upon which grand juries must act.\u201d <em>Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 362, 76 S.Ct. 406; <em>cf. In re: Special Investigation No. 228, </em>54 Md.App. 149, 183, 458 A.2d 820 (1983) (citing <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 351-52, 94 S.Ct. 613) (\u201cEven to vindicate the loftiest constitutional ideals, we do not suppress evidence at the grand jury level.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">That does not mean, however, that a person brought before a grand jury is without Fifth Amendment protection. For example, the Supreme Court has established that a witness may not ignore a grand jury subpoena, <em>Mandujano, </em>425 U.S. at 573, 96 S.Ct. 1768 (\u201cUnder settled principles, the Fifth Amendment does not confer an absolute right to decline to respond in a grand jury inquiry.\u201d), but after doing so is free to assert the privilege against self-incrimination unless the government offers the witness derivative use immunity, <em>see Kastigar, supra, </em>406 U.S. at 462, 92 S.Ct. 1653. The Court of Appeals has suggested that the distinction lies somewhere between a grand jury\u2019s consideration of incompetent evidence and a grand jury forcing an individual to bear witness before the grand jury \u201cbrowbeaten and maltreated.\u201d <em>Bartram, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>280 Md. at 625-26, 374 A.2d 1144. We believe the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Calandra </em>offers a useful analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">2. A Grand Jury May Not Actively Coerce Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The State argues that, under <em>Calandra, </em>a grand jury is free to consider tainted evidence so long as it does not taint the evidence itself. The County responds that Calandra\u2014a case that dealt with the Fourth Amendment\u2019s applicability to grand juries\u2014is inapplicable because the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule involves a different calculus than the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege. While the County\u2019s distinction is correct, the County misses Calandra\u2019s broader, central teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>a federal grand jury, which was convened to investigate loansharking, subpoenaed a witness to testify based on receipts tending to indicate the witness was a loanshark. 414 U.S. at 340-41, 94 S.Ct. 613. The witness sought and was granted leave to move the federal district court to suppress use of the receipts as evidence on the grounds that the police seized them from his home while executing an unrelated search warrant, the scope of which did not include the receipts. <em>Id. </em>The district court granted his motion, finding that the search warrant was not founded on probable cause and the police exceeded the warrant\u2019s scope. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 94 S.Ct. 613. In affirming the district court, the Sixth Circuit ruled that the Fourth Amendment \u201cexclusionary rule may be invoked by a witness before the grand jury to bar questioning based on evidence obtained in an unlawful search and seizure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider whether the Sixth Circuit erred in applying the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to a grand jury proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 346, 94 S.Ct. 613. After setting out the grand jury\u2019s historical role and function, the Court ruled that a grand jury \u201cmay consider incompetent evidence, but it may not itself violate a valid privilege, whether established by the Constitution, statutes, or the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 94 S.Ct. 613. The Court used the Fifth Amendment to illustrate this distinction: \u201cAlthough, for example, an indictment based on evidence obtained in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege is nevertheless valid, the grand jury may not force a witness to answer questions in violation of that constitutional guarantee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Court concluded that the judiciary should only intervene if the grand jury subpoena \u201cis far too sweeping in its terms to be regarded as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Although the <em>Calandra </em>Court also stated that \u201ca grand jury may not compel a person to produce books and papers that would incriminate him[,]\u201d <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 346, 94 S.Ct. 613, the Court has since narrowed the scope of this pronouncement. In a series of cases beginning with <em>Couch v. United States, </em>followed by <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court explained that the Fifth Amendment is implicated only when the actual act of producing the books or papers would incriminate the subpoenaed individual. <em>Couch, </em>409 U.S. 322, 329, 93 S.Ct. 611, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1976); <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. 391, 410-14, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976). In other words, the Fifth Amendment is implicated only where the act of producing the record is testimonial, or where the grand jury forced the speaker to \u201crestate, repeat, or affirm the truth of [the records\u2019] contents.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>465 U.S. 605, 612, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984). The Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c[a]fter <em>Fisher, </em>the focus of the Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to records and documents became not the actual documents, but instead the act of producing the documents.\u201d <em>Unnamed Att\u2019y v. Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>349 Md. 391, 405, 708 A.2d 667 (1998); <em>see also Curran v. Price, </em>334 Md. 149, 175, 638 A.2d 93 (1994) (\u201c[I]t is only the testimonial nature of the act of production for which the privilege may be asserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In <em>Steffey v. State, </em>this Court analyzed <em>Calandra </em>and applied its rule to a grand jury\u2019s consideration of allegedly coerced statements contained within a police department\u2019s internal affairs report. 82 Md.App. 647, 649, 651-52, 657-58, 573 A.2d 70 (1990). Although the posture of the case was an already-indicted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, rather than the motion to quash a subpoena at issue here, our analysis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Steffey </em>is still germane. There, we interpreted <em>Calandra </em>as standing for the proposition that courts should not dismiss indictments based on \u201cthe evidence <em>presented </em>to grand juries and thus <em>used </em>during grand jury proceedings. Rather, <em>Calan-dra </em>simply pointed out which actions by the grand juries themselves would not be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 573 A.2d 70 (emphasis in original). Applying this distinction to the grand jury\u2019s subpoena of internal affairs documents containing previously-coerced statements, we did not find a violation of the claimant\u2019s constitutional rights and held that the defendant was not entitled to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 658-59, 573 A.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">These cases make clear that \u201c[i]t is extortion of information from the accused himself that offends our sense of justice,\u201d and a claimant cannot sustain a Fifth Amendment claim based on a grand jury subpoena if \u201cthe ingredient of personal compulsion against an accused is lacking.\u201d Couch, 409 U.S. at 328-29, 93 S.Ct. 611. Here, the grand jury is not compelling the County to speak; nor is it compelling the County to restate or affirm the truth of the investigation report\u2019s contents. <em>See Doe, </em>465 U.S. at 612, 104 S.Ct. 1237. Instead, the grand jury is merely requesting that the County produce documents that the County freely admits are in its possession. Consequently, the County\u2019s act of producing those documents would be non-testimonial and, therefore, would not implicate the Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">3. Protecting Grand Jury Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We have established that the grand jury acts independently of the judiciary, and the County offers no grounds that justify the circuit court\u2019s intervention in this case. <em>See Williams, supra, </em>504 U.S. at 47, 112 S.Ct. 1735. In <em>Calandra, </em>the Supreme Court cautioned that \u201c[permitting witnesses to invoke the exclusionary rule before a grand jury would precipitate adjudications of issues hitherto reserved for the trial on the merits and would delay and disrupt grand jury proceedings.\u201d 414 U.S. at 349, 94 S.Ct. 613. Calandra\u2019s concern is consistent with the rationale behind the Supreme Court\u2019s oft-repeated rule that a defendant may not challenge an indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ment solely on the ground that the grand jury considered incompetent evidence. <em>See, e.g., Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 339, 348-50, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); <em>Costello, supra, </em>350 U.S. at 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406; <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U.S. 245, 247-48, 31 S.Ct. 2, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910). The Court of Appeals similarly warned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">[I]f, on a motion to quash, the competency of the evidence presented could be inquired into, the trial courts would be obliged to sit as courts of review, to examine into the correctness of every ruling made upon the evidence by the grand jurors. The obstructions to justice and the unnecessary and uncalled-for waste of time, and consequent expense to the state as well as to defendants, which will result from such a course, are too obvious to need comment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Bartram, supra, </em>280 Md. at 624-25, 374 A.2d 1144 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Allowing a claimant to challenge the evidence considered by the grand jury would permit abuses of criminal practice and \u201csaddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings [that] would assuredly impede its investigation and frustrate the public's interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.\u201d <em>Dionisio, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 17, 93 S.Ct. 764; <em>see also Costello, </em>350 U.S. at 363, 76 S.Ct. 406 (\u201cThe result of such a rule [permitting indictments to be challenged on the competency of evidence] would be that before trial on the merits a defendant could always insist on a Mnd of preliminary trial to determine the competency and adequacy of the evidence before the grand jury.\u201d); <em>cf. In re Special Investigation No. 227, </em>55 Md.App. 650, 654, 466 A.2d 48 (1983) (refusing to even consider the merits of petitioner\u2019s claim, because \u201cthe Fourth Amendment merits and the exclusionary rule ha[ve] no place at the grand jury stage of investigation[.]\u201d); <em>Bartram v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 115, 183, 364 A.2d 1119 (1976), <em>aff'd, </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977) (\u201cThe acid test of [the grand jury\u2019s] actions, however, will come when the petit jury renders its verdict upon the charges they have brought.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>In <em>United States v. Blue, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether or not the district court should have dismissed an indictment based on tainted evidence. 384 U.S. 251, 254-55, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966). Blue filed a pretrial motion to dismiss his indictment because it was based on incriminating statements that he made in petitions contesting certain jeopardy assessments against him by the Internal Revenue Service. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 86 S.Ct. 1416. Ultimately, the Court decided that the proper outcome was not to dismiss the indictment but to allow the defendant to \u201cpursue his Fifth Amendment claim through motions to suppress and objections to evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 86 S.Ct. 1416. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ake\">Even if we assume that the Government did acquire incriminating evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment, [the defendant] would at most be entitled to suppress the evidence and its fruits if they were sought to be used against him at trial. ... Our numerous precedents ordering the exclusion of such illegally obtained evidence assume implicitly that the remedy does not extend to barring the prosecution altogether. So drastic a step might advance marginally some of the ends served by the exclusionary rules, but it would also increase to an intolerable degree interference with the public interest in having the guilty brought to book.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABd\"><em>Id. </em>at 255, 86 S.Ct. 1416 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Clark v.

In <em>Rice, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that just because a motion, such as a motion to compel testimony, is filed in association with a criminal case, it does not follow that the proceeding arising from the motion must be criminal in nature. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that \"an appeal from an order issued by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction is not constrained by CJP \u00a7 12-302(c) if the relief sought is collateral to the underlying criminal case against the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618, 136 A.3d 720 (quoting <em>In re Special Investigation No. 231, 295 </em>Md. 366, 370, 455 A.2d 442 (1983)). This Court, in <em>In re Special Investigation No. 231, </em>declared that in a grand jury proceeding, &amp;e State may appeal from an order that \"settles the rights of the parties or concludes the cause.\u201d 295 Md. 366, 370, 455 A.2d 442. As explained <em>infra, </em>we conclude in this case that an investigation by a grand jury is not a \"criminal case,\u201d and the grand jury subpoena duces tecum \"bears none of the characteristics of a criminal case as that term is defined in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d <em>Rice, </em>447 Md. at 620, 136 A.3d 720. Consequently, the order adjudicating the County\u2019s motion for protective order is an appealable final judgment under CJP \u00a7 12-301 and is not limited by CJP\u00a7 12-302(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">.

The Supreme Court in <em>Garrity </em>held that \u201c[t]he option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain silent\u201d and, accordingly, constituted coercion within the ambit of the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b243-6\">. <em>See McGurk </em>v. <em>State, </em>201 Md.App. 23, 33, 28 A.3d 720 (2011) (citing Maryland Rule 8-131 (a)) (holding that \"by failing to raise the standing [to assert a Fourth Amendment] issue in the circuit court, the State waived the issue for appellate purposes\u201d because an appellate court will ordinarily only decide <em>jurisdictional </em>questions unpreserved at trial). The County here muddles arguments that pertain to jurisdictional standing requirements with the requirements for asserting the violation of a personal constitutional right. <em>See Dorsey </em>v. <em>Bethel A.M.E.

Addressing this same confusion in the federal context, the Supreme Court in <em>Rakas v. Illinois </em>attempted to extricate the standing doctrine nomenclature from the separate and distinct constitutional question of whether a party may successfully exclude evidence based on a claimed violation of a personal right. 439 U.S. 128, 138-40, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), The <em>Rakas </em>Court concluded that the inquiry \"is more properly placed within the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 99 S.Ct. 421. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Rigorous application of the principle that the rights secured by this Amendment are personal, in place of a notion of \"standing,\u201d will produce no additional situations in which evidence must be excluded. The inquiry under either approach is the same.

It is clear from <em>McGurk </em>and <em>Rakas </em>that the State\u2019s standing argument is non-jurisdictional and, therefore, we need not address it on appeal when it was not preserved below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">. There is robust jurisprudence holding that a private entity or its records custodian may not assert a Fifth Amendment claim on behalf of individual employees whose incriminating statements are contained within subpoenaed records.
