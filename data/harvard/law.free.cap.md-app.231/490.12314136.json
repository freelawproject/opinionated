The court sentenced appellant to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>term of 50 years imprisonment. Upon direct appeal of his convictions, a panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in an unreported opinion. <em>See Rahymeen J. Barber v. State of Maryland, </em>No. 2238, Sept. Term, 2010 (filed June 13, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Appellant thereafter filed a petition for post-conviction relief alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel seriously prejudiced him by failing to investigate the validity of the opinions of the State\u2019s expert witness and failing to present expert testimony to counter the State\u2019s expert witness who opined that the victim\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d genital examination was not inconsistent with the victim having been raped. After the circuit court denied his petition,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant sought leave to appeal, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">h-i</p>\n<p id=\"b517-1\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b517-2\">Set forth below is an excerpt from an unreported opinion by the panel of this Court that considered appellant\u2019s direct appeal. This excerpt provides a useful recap of some of the important evidence introduced at appellant\u2019s jury trial:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\">This case concerns the sexual abuse of a minor, G.S. [born June 3, 1998], that occurred between 2003 and 2009, when G.S. ranged in age from five to nine years old. At the time of trial, G.S. was twelve-years-old and lived on Jackson Street in Salisbury, Maryland. She testified that she knew appellant, her former stepfather, as \u201cPoppy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Appellant lived with G.S. for several years in different locations in the Salisbury area. The parties stipulated as follows: from June 10, 2003, until July 10, 2004, the family lived on Light Street; from July 11, 2004, to January 31, 2007, the family lived on Mitchell Street; and, from February 1, 2007, to April 30, 2009, the family lived on Tilghman Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">G.S.... testified to details of various sexual assaults inflicted upon her by appellant. On one occasion at the Light Street address, when G.S. was five-years-old, appellant called her into the living room and had her remove her pants and underwear. Appellant, who was lying on the couch and attired only in a shirt and boxer shorts, placed G.S. on top of him and started moving her around. G.S. testified that she felt appellant\u2019s private part on her vaginal area and testified that \u201c[w]hen he was putting it in me, it would hurt. It was hurting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">G.S.... recounted another incident, this time when appellant was living with the family on Mitchell Street. She testified that appellant asked her to lie down with him in bed, and then \u201che took my underwears [sic] off and everything and put his private part in my private part and did the same thing over again.\u201d She clarified that appellant\u2019s private part was his penis and her private part was her vagina. G.S. also testified that she felt something wet and noticed that it was white. G.S.\u2019s mother worked late at night and was not at home at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">After the family moved to Tilghman Street, another incident occurred when appellant picked G.S. up while they were in the kitchen and \u201cwas scooting me down by his private.\u201d Both were wearing clothes at the time, but G.S. testified that she \u201cfelt his private, like kind of like scoot\u2014 like sticking up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">* * \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">Dr. Jennifer Wehberg, accepted as an expert in pediatric medicine with an emphasis on child sexual abuse, examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>G.S. on July 2, 2009. At that examination, G.S. only described the initial incident that occurred on Light Street. G.S. had a normal physical exam, including her vaginal and rectal exam. Because the vaginal area may heal rapidly, Dr. Wehberg testified that \u201ca normal physical exam can be consistent with her disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pACn\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">Heather Sullivan, a social worker assigned to the Wicomi-co County Child Advocacy Center, testified that she first interviewed G.S. on May 19, 2009. G.S. described only the first incident of alleged sexual abuse that occurred when the family lived on Light Street. G.S. was re-interviewed on July 10 2009, and gave more details about this same, singular incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">Sullivan then testified that she interviewed G.S. a third time on January 28, 2010. At this time, G.S. informed Sullivan that there had been more than just the one incident on Light Street. G.S. described the incident on Mitchell Street when appellant had G.S. lie on top of him. G.S. also indicated that this incident included appellant instructing her to perform oral sex on him. G.S. also described another incident at the Mitchell Street address, and this one involved penetration and ejaculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">G.S. further informed Sullivan about a fourth incident at the Tilghman Street address when appellant had her he on top of him on the couch and \u201cagain moved her up and down, privates touching privates, genitals touching genitals.\u201d A fifth incident also occurred at Tilghman Street, when appellant pulled G.S. towards him and their genitals touched through their clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">Tahesha Barber, G.S.\u2019s mother, was married to appellant from 2004 to August 2010. G.S. first informed her mother about one incident of sexual abuse in May 2009, and Barber reported it to the Child Advocacy Center. Agreeing that G.S. disclosed information to her on two occasions, Barber testified that she was confused and \u201cI didn\u2019t want to believe it the first time she told me, you know.\u201d After this initial interview with the Child Advocacy Center, Barber and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>other children still had contact -with appellant. G.S. would be present on some occasions when appellant visited Barber and the other children. Barber also testified that G.S. was interviewed again at the Child Advocacy Center in January 2010, after making a second disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\"><em>i\\i </em>* #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">Appellant testified on his own behalf and denied that any of the incidents occurred. Appellant denied having intercourse, oral sex or any sexual relations with G.S. On cross-examination, appellant agreed he was the father-figure in the household, that he disciplined the children, and that the children loved him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Rahymeen J. Barber v. State of </em>Maryland, No. 2238, Sept. Term, 2010, slip op. at 1-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Concerning what G.S. said in regard to the force used when the second-degree rape occurred, the following exchange between appellant\u2019s trial counsel and G.S. is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">Q: So when you say, my private part, you mean your vagina, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">Q: You indicated in response when telling that story that Mr. Barber put his penis in your vagina on that occasion, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-14\">Q: You didn\u2019t tell that to Miss Heather [Sullivan] did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-15\">A: I told her that he put his private in my private.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-17\">Q: On both of those occasions, did you tell Miss Heather that Rahymeen put his penis in your vagina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-19\">\u215c \u215c \u215d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-20\">Q: You didn\u2019t tell her anything that happened. On the two occurrences on Mitchell Street, you indicated that Mr. Barber put his penis in your privates, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-21\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In recounting G.S.\u2019s disclosures, to her, Dr. Wehberg testified that G.S. \u201cstated that her stepdad put his thing into her,\u201d she also responded to the question \u201cG.S. disclosed penetration to you, is that right?\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">A: Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Similarly, Heather Sullivan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">A: She [G.S.] again reported that it occurred in Mr. Barber\u2019s bedroom. Again, the bottom part of her clothing were removed. He again laid her on top of him, and his penis was hard. At this point in time, she described that his penis did go inside of her,...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">She described his penis again as hard as it went inside of her, and that it was nasty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">Q: Did she indicate the force with which the defendant moved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">A. I mean, she described it going inside of her and using that force to make that occur, and that it was not comfortable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfS\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">Additional Trial Testimony ofJennifer Wehberg, M.D.,</p>\n<p id=\"ALGz\">Jennifer Wehberg, M.D.,a board certified pediatrician and a CHAMP (Child Abuse Medical Provider) physician, was called as an expert witness for the State during appellant\u2019s 2010 jury trial. She examined G.S. more than two years after the last incident of alleged rape. Dr. Wehberg testified that she conducted a physical examination of G.S.\u2019s vagina and rectum and that the results were \u201cnormal.\u201d She explained that a \u201cnormal finding means that she [G.S.] did not have any lacerations, cuts, redness, discharge, scarring, that there was no evidence of acute trauma, which means immediate trauma to the vaginal rectal area, and there was no evidence of scarring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Dr. Wehberg then opined that the \u201cnormal\u201d finding was not inconsistent with G.S.\u2019s disclosure that appellant had penetrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ed her vagina with his penis. She explained that \u201c[t]he vaginal area is very vascular and very elastic and can heal very rapidly. Often within a few days, if you have genital trauma, it can be healed to the point where you can\u2019t recognize it as trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On cross-examination of Dr. Wehberg by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Q: You examined as part of her genital examination, the presence or absence of a hymen, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Q: And you describe her hymen as crescentic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">A: Crescentic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Q: Crescentic. Can you tell me what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">A: A hymen is a thin membrane of tissue that covers the vaginal opening. When you\u2019re very young, your hymen is what we call, annular. It\u2019s circular in shape covering the vaginal opening. As you get more into young childhood, it becomes a crescent which is a half-moon shape. It goes over the hymen, and you can see a crescent of a thin membrane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">A: That hymen as you enter puberty again turns into an an[ ]ular hymen which is round.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">Q: The genital exam was perfectly normal, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">A: Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">Q: There was, according to the report, no scarring, no damage, is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">A: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">Q: Your opinion or your diagnostic impression is that it is a normal physical exam, cannot diagnose or exclude abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">Q: Is that another way of saying, I don\u2019t know, maybe, maybe not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>A: That s a way of saying, I can\u2019t tell by her physical exam whether there has been sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Q: Can\u2019t confirm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">Q: Can\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">A: Can\u2019t confirm it, can\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">Q: Exclude it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">A: \u2014deny it, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">On re-direct examination of Dr. Wehberg the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">Q: Are you ... familiar with the research regarding medical findings in the victims of substantiated child sexual abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">A: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">Q: What does the research say regarding a normal genital exam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">A: A normal genital exam can be consistent with penetrating sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">Q: Is there a percentage of cases in which there are\u2014sex abuse has been confirmed but it remains a normal genital exam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">A: It has been shown that you can have a normal vaginal exam with penetrating sexual abuse. I do not know the percentage off my head without the cited article in front of me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">POST CONVICTION PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The only crime of which appellant was convicted that required proof of penetration was second-degree rape. The flagship allegation made in appellant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief dealt with two criticisms: (1) that defense never consulted with an OBGYN or child sexual abuse specialist; and (2) no defense expert was called to refute the opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Dr. Wehberg that a normal genital exam can be consistent with penetrating sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In <em>Kackley v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 532, 493 A.2d 364 (1985) we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Penetration is a necessary element of the crime of second degree rape, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(3); <em>Smith v. State, </em>224 Md. 509, 168 A.2d 356 (1961); <em>Craig v. State, </em>214 Md. 546, 136 A.2d 243 (1957); and \u201cpenetration, however slight, will sustain a conviction .., but the proof thereof must sustain a <em>res in re; </em>that is, an actual entrance of the sexual organ of the male within the <em>labia (majora) </em>of the <em>pudendum </em>(the external folds of the <em>vulva) </em>of the female organ, and nothing less will suffice.\u201d <em>Craig v. State, supra, </em>citing 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law </em>(12th ed.), \u00a7 697.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">A brief description of the female genital area, referred to in <em>Craig, </em>is in order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">The <em>mons pubis </em>is the fat filled cushion over the anterior surface of the hair triangle. The <em>labia majora </em>consists of two rounded folds of adipose tissue extending downward and backward from the <em>mons pubis. </em>Within the <em>labia majora </em>are two flat, reddish folds of tissue that encase the clitoris; this tissue is clinically known as the <em>labia minora.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">The <em>pudenda, </em>or the external organs of generation, commonly designated as the <em>vulva, </em>includes all structures visible externally from the <em>pubis </em>to the <em>perineum </em>(the area bounded by the <em>mons </em>in front, the buttocks behind and the thighs laterally). <em>Williams Obstetrics, </em>16th Ed., Pritchard-McDonald (1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Thus, penetration into either the <em>labia minora </em>or the vagina is not required; invasion of the <em>labia majora, </em>however slight, is sufficient to establish penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The relevant genital features of a girl, before puberty, are shown on Exhibit A (attached). To prove penetration, it is not necessary to prove that the hymen was ruptured. <em>Craig, </em>214 Md. at 549, 136 A.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Testimony of Dr. Theodore Hariton</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">During the post-conviction petition hearing, appellant called Dr. Theodore Hariton, a board-certified OBGYN from Tucson, Arizona.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified that he had reviewed Dr. Wehberg\u2019s trial testimony, Heather Sullivan\u2019s deposition and trial testimony and G.S.\u2019s trial testimony. On direct-examination he testified, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Q: And after you reviewed it did you arrive at any conclusions regarding whether the medical evidence was consistent with penetration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">A: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Q: And what were those conclusions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">A: With reasonable medical certainty there\u2019s no medical evidence that penal [sic] vaginal penetration occurred at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Q: Okay, So would it be unusual for a six-year-old[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] or a very young girl to have no finding after an episode of nonconsensual penal [sic] vaginal penetration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">A: Yes, it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">Q: And what would you expect the history and physical findings to be that would be consistent with vaginal penetration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">A: Well, two things. First of all, the history, you should have pain and bleeding. If you go inside a hymen and tear a hymen in a little girl it will bleed and cause pain. The second thing is it will heal, all of them heal very nicely but it will heal with some physical change in shape that will tell you that something happened in this period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Q: And are both these findings important? 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Als\">Q: Yes. l</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdE\">Q: And why so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjK\">A: Well, the history of bleeding, pain and bleeding is one of the most consistent things in all the literature. &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUu\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABHK\">A: When you go through the findings you have the history of pain and bleeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaT\">Q: And were these present in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">A: No, there was no evidence\u2014I\u2019m sorry, there was nothing in this record that I found.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASKm\">Q: What would be the diameter of a vaginal opening in a girl this age?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVo\">Q: Hymenal opening in a girl in this age would be six or seven millimeters, like half the size of your little finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-q\">Q: And what\u2019s the average diameter of an erect male penis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A92\">A: 35 to 39 millimeters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFi\">A: It\u2019s about an inch and a half?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXC\">A: About an inch and a half, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">Q: Okay. So it's maybe an inch and a half trying to get into a quarter inch roughly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au5\">A:Roughly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aai\">Q: Now is the hymen stretchable or would it tear if it were penetrated? S</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALh\">A: It is not stretchable. When you examine a little girl, frequently you\u2019ll have to examine and get a specimen with a Q-tip. And if you touch the hymen with your Q-tip the kid jumps. It\u2019s very delicate and very thin. \u00ed&gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8U\">\u215c \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Q: Okay. Now what would a normal six-year-old vaginal area look like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">A: Well, the labia majora would be flat, the labia minora is very, very thin. The whole area is pinkish. It\u2019s a little redder than an adult because the tissue, the vessels are so close to the skin. It\u2019s very thin, two to three cells thick, it\u2019s not stretchable, it\u2019s very easy, it\u2019s not disten-sible because there\u2019s no rigi, it won\u2019t stretch. It\u2019s really vulnerable to any trauma or to infection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">Q: So what kind of medical evidence could be found after forceful penal [sic] vaginal penetration of a girl around six years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">A: What you should see is depending if it\u2019s a complete laceration or not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">Q: Could you speak a little bit slower?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">A: Okay, I\u2019m sorry. It depends on the depth of the penetration, how far it went. It doesn\u2019t fit so therefore it can\u2019t go very far. But it can tear. If it\u2019s a transection, which means it goes all the way through the hymen down to the vagina, then you\u2019ll see that the hymen is a circle like this, and would be a totally complete circle. If you tear, do a transection, it means you cut all the way through here, this would be the vagina, and when they heal it will still heal like this but it will heal with a section, there won\u2019t be any hymen here at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-13\">And if it\u2019s not totally sometimes you just have a very deep notch right in that area that\u2019s easy to see. It will all heal so it will be smooth, but it will be a change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-14\">Q: So there would be some kind of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-15\">A: Physical evidence, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-16\">Q: There would be some kind of result, some kind of evidence left\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-17\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-18\">Q: \u2014if this happened, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Is there anything in the reports that you read that suggests that there was actual penal [sic] vaginal penetration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-20\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-21\">Q: And you stated that you reviewed the testimony by Dr. Wehberg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-23\">A: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-24\">Q: Did you find any problems with her testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-25\">A: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-26\">Q: What were they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-1\">A: First and most important was she said that the hymenof a little girl is very vascular and elastic.

Appellant maintains that expert testimony countering Dr. Wehberg\u2019s opinion would have both helped present a valid defense to the rape charge, and also aid in counsel\u2019s attack of G.S.\u2019s credibility concerning whether any abuse occurred at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">A. Standard of Review and Generally Applicable Legal Principles Regarding Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Both the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee the right to effective assistance of trial counsel. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), ineffective assistance of counsel requires a two-prong analysis. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>303 Md. 685, 496 A.2d 1074 (1985). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, it is the petitioner\u2019s burden to demonstrate (1) that, under the \u201cperformance prong,\u201d counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., counsel committed serious attorney error, and (2) that, under the \u201cprejudice prong,\u201d counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30 (1996); <em>Williams v. State, </em>326 Md. 367, 373, 605 A.2d 103 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">To meet the requirements under the \u201cperformance prong\u201d and demonstrate \u201cserious attorney error,\u201d a petitioner must show that the acts or omissions of counsel were the result of unreasonable professional judgment and that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms. <em>Cirincione v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 471, 484, 705 A.2d 96 (1998). The \u201cperformance component\u201d requires a \u201cshow[ing] that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient [, and] ... counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Under the \u201cperformance prong,\u201d if counsel\u2019s acts constituted reasonable \u201ctrial strategy\u201d or \u201ctrial tactic,\u201d counsel\u2019s performance cannot be deemed \u201cineffective.\u201d <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 283, 681 A.2d 30; <em>Schmitt v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 1, 779 A.2d 1004 (2001). Thus, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">In assessing the performance prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the Sixth Amendment, a court will indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The court must be highly deferential in reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, in order to avoid second-guessing counsel\u2019s assistance. Until proven otherwise, the court presumes that counsel\u2019s representation was professionally competent, and that it derived not from error but from trial strategy. In <em>Strickland, </em>the Court explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>State v. Peterson, </em>158 Md.App. 558, 583-84, 857 A.2d 1132 (2004) (citation and quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Under the \u201cprejudice prong,\u201d a petitioner must show a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility\u201d that, but for the serious attorney error, the result would have been different. <em>Bowers v. State, </em>320 Md. 416, 426, 578 A.2d 734 (1990). A petitioner, however, \u201c \u2018need not show that counsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 578 A.2d 734 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052). Because the \u201cprejudice prong\u201d requires only a significant \u201cpossibility\u201d of a different result, the prejudice analysis \u201cshould not focus solely on an outcome determination, but should consider \u2018whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oken, </em>343 Md. at 284, 681 A.2d 30 (quoting, in part, <em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>506 U.S. 364, 369, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993)). \u201c \u2018The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>434 Md. 320, 331, 75 A.3d 916 (2013) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">When reviewing a post-conviction court\u2019s ruling on appeal, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The standard of review of the lower court\u2019s determinations regarding issues of effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact. We will not disturb the factual findings of the post-conviction court unless they are clearly erroneous. But, a reviewing court must make an independent analysis to determine the ultimate mixed question of law and fact, namely, was there a violation of a constitutional right as claimed. In other words, the appellate court must exercise its own independent judgment as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice, if any. Within the <em>Strickland </em>framework, we will evaluate anew the findings of the lower court as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and the prejudice suffered. As a question of whether a constitutional right has been violated, we make our own independent analysis by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. We will defer to the post-conviction court\u2019s findings of historical fact, absent clear error, but we will make our own, independent analysis of the appellant\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>State v. Jones, </em>138 Md.App. 178, 209, 771 A.2d 407 (2001) <em>aff'd, </em>379 Md. 704, 843 A.2d 778 (2004) (internal citations and quotations omitted, alterations from original).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In this case, the post-conviction court made no findings of \u201chistoric fact\u201d that are here material. The court, however, made various conclusions of law regarding trial counsel\u2019s performance using the test set forth in <em>Strickland. </em>Those conclusions of law, insofar as here pertinent, will be reviewed <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">B. Analysis of the Performance Prong</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The State asserts that trial counsel\u2019s decision to not consult with an expert was part of a legitimate trial strategy or tactic and that appellant failed to prove that the strategic decision was uninformed or unreasonable. The State points out, accurately, that trial counsel testified that he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">1) was familiar with literature reporting on the sexual abuse of young girls and had participated in other trials where experts had testified on the subject; 2) had reviewed Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Wehberg\u2019s report; 3) was aware of the results of her exam on G.S.; 4) had been a practicing attorney for fifteen[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] years with considerable experience representing defendants charged with all kinds of crimes; 5) had represented numerous defendants who had been charged with the sexual abuse of a child; 6) was, at one time, for a period of approximately four years, \u201cthe only one in the Public Defender\u2019s Office in Wicomico County litigating or handling these types of sex abuse cases\u201d; 7) was satisfied with Dr. Wehberg\u2019s conclusion that, based on her exam, G.S. may or may not have been abused; and 8) knowing Dr. Wehberg\u2019s opinion, chose to defend [appellant] against the charges by impeaching G.S. and arguing that, given Dr. Wehberg\u2019s opinion and G.S.\u2019s lack of credibility, the State had failed to prove [appellant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">According to appellant, his trial counsel did not meet the performance prong when he failed to consult with an expert because, had trial counsel done so, \u201che would have found a basis for challenging Dr. Wehberg\u2019s testimony about the consistency between her medical findings and G.S.\u2019s allegations.\u201d According to appellant, an expert, such as Dr. Hariton, could have disputed (1) that the hymen of a little girl is very vascular and elastic, and (2) Dr. Wehberg\u2019s claim that medical literature existed supporting her statement that penile vaginal penetration in a prepubertal girl can occur without any physical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Appellant further asserts that any strategy that did not involve investigating and/or countering Dr. Wehberg\u2019s conclusions was unreasonable. He argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">The one viable and in eliminable strategy in Mr. Barber\u2019s case was to discredit G.S., and challenging Dr. Wehberg\u2019s medical opinion that a normal finding could be consistent with G.S.\u2019s allegations could in no way have detracted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that strategy. The decision to forego any investigation along these lines was pointless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In support of the aforegoing argument, appellant, <em>inter alia, </em>quotes from <em>Pavel v, Hollins, </em>261 F.3d 210, 224 (2nd Cir. 2001) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">When a sex abuse case boils down to such a \u201ccredibility contest,\u201d physical evidence will often be important. Indeed, \u201cmany\u201d sex abuse cases are \u201cclose ... on the evidence,\u201d <em>Swofford v. Dobucki, </em>137 F.3d 442, 443 (7th Cir. 1998), and when a case hinges all-but-entirely on whom to believe, an expert\u2019s interpretation of relevant physical evidence (or the lack of it) is the sort of \u201cneutral, disinterested\u201d testimony that may well tip the scales and sway the fact-finder. <em>Williams, </em>59 F.3d at 682 (\u201cIn a credibility contest, the testimony of neutral, disinterested witnesses is exceedingly important.\u201d). Because of the importance of physical evidence in \u201ccredibility contest\u201d sex abuse cases, in such cases physical evidence should be a focal point of defense counsel\u2019s pre-trial investigation and analysis of the matter. And because of the \u201cvagaries of abuse indicia,\u201d such pre-trial investigation and analysis will generally require some consultation with an expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 224 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Appellant argues that the deficiency in his trial counsel\u2019s performance is confirmed by <em>Pavel. </em>In our view, the general rule espoused by <em>Pavel </em>is not necessarily applicable in all cases involving sex abuse of children. Its applicability, <em>vel non, </em>depends on: (1) what the prosecutor\u2019s expert is prepared to say; and (2) what trial counsel already knows about the subject of child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The trial strategy and tactics addressed in <em>Pavel </em>are quite different from those at issue in this case. Kenneth Pavel was accused of having anally sodomized his two sons, Matthew, age 7, and David, age 5. <em>Id. </em>at 214. According to the testimony of David and Matthew, their father anally sodomized them, at least once a week, for four months before they were examined by a physician and their father sodomized them even more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>frequently in the days leading up to an examination by a doctor. <em>Id. </em>at 224. In fact, David testified that he was sodomized at least three times in the twelve (12) day period before a doctor examined him. <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">At Mr. Pavel\u2019s trial, the State of New York did not call the physician who examined the two boys immediately after they reported that their father had anally sodomized them. Instead, the State called Dr. Celeste Madden, who, after reviewing the records of the physical exam of Matthew, testified that no relevant physical abnormalities were found by the examining doctor, while the records of David indicated only that he had a \u201cmild perianal [erythema],\u201d which Dr. Madden described as a \u201cdiscoloration of the skin, redness around the anal area.\u201d She further testified that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that diarrhea could cause such redness. Furthermore, she testified that David\u2019s \u201cdiscoloration\u201d was \u201cconsistent\u201d with his account of sexual abuse, and that Matthew may have been anally sodomized as he described it without any physical indication of the sodomy remaining after the fact. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At a post-conviction hearing, counsel for Pavel introduced an affidavit from Dr. Margaret McHugh, a physician with extensive experience in, among other things, evaluating and/or treating victims of child abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 228. In her affidavit, Dr. McHugh stated that the boys\u2019 medical condition was simply not \u201cconsistent\u201d\u2014as Dr. Madden had testified\u2014with them having been repeatedly anally sodomized with the frequency that they described. Her affidavit read, in material part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">I have reviewed the Grand Jury and trial testimony of Matthew and David Pavel....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u215c \u2021 \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the clinical findings regarding Matthew and David are inconsistent with their testimony. Repetitive sexual attacks of the nature described by the boys, by an adult male without the use of a lubricant and/or sedation would be expected to result in clinical evidence such as tearing inju-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>r\u00edes and abrasions to each child\u2019s anus and rectum which would [have been] apparent on gross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">I have also reviewed the testimony of Dr. Celeste Madden. Dr. Madden testified that the absence of any abnormal findings in Matthew\u2019s physical examination is not inconsistent with the crimes of sodomy and sexual abuse. Given the boys\u2019 testimony, however, it is highly improbable that such repeated attacks within five (5) days of the exam would leave no physical evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">... [As to David, on whom a \u201cmild perianal erythema\u201d was noticed,] \u201c[c]learly, the numerous acts of sodomy described by David would be expected to result in more than a mild erythema, <em>ie. </em>a slight red discoloration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 228 (emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Prior to Mr. Pavel\u2019s trial, his counsel was confident that at the close of the State\u2019s case the presiding judge would grant his motion to dismiss all charges. <em>Id. </em>at 216. Based on that optimistic forecast, Pavel\u2019s counsel decided \u201cnot to prepare a defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the trial judge denied Pavel\u2019s motion to dismiss, counsel called no witnesses except for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 217. If Pavel\u2019s counsel had elected to do so he could have called two lay witnesses, both of whom could have presented important testimony that would have been favorable to the defense. The <em>Pavel </em>court observed that counsel\u2019s failure to call any witnesses other than the defendant was \u201cstrategic\u201d in the sense that it related to a question of trial strategy, but that the decision was not taken, as it should have been, to serve the defendant\u2019s interest by providing the defendant with reasonably effective representation, rather it was taken to avoid work. <em>Id. </em>at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">In regard to the failure of trial counsel to call a medical expert, the <em>Pavel </em>court first noted that counsel\u2019s decision had \u201cnothing to do with serving Pavel\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. Second, counsel\u2019s decision not to call a medical expert was deficient \u201cbecause it was not based on pre-trial consultation with such an expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Pavel </em>court gave two reasons why counsel should have consulted an expert. The first was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>that there was no indication in the record that trial counsel \u201chad the education or experience necessary to assess relevant physical evidence, and to make for himself a reasonable, informed determination as to whether an expert should be consulted or called to the stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. That situation is not here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In regard to the second reason, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">[T]here is an obvious, common-sense mismatch-which Melt-zer [trial counsel] himself recognized before trial-between (1) Matthew and David\u2019s medical indications (nothing abnormal about Matthew, and mild \u201credness\u201d in David\u2019s anal area) and (2) the allegations against Pavel (that he anally sodomized the boys once a week for four months, and that he did so with even greater frequency in the days leadings up to the examination of the boys). But in the face of this glaring mismatch a reasonably professional attorney would not have sat on his hands, confident that his client would be acquitted. He would have consulted and been prepared to call an expert to drive this disparity home. <em>See generally Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1251-52 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that an attorney\u2019s investigation is not \u201creasonable\u201d within the meaning of <em>Strickland </em>when the facts of a case supply him with \u201cnotice\u201d that a particular line of pre-trial investigation may substantially benefit his client, and he does not pursue it).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 224-25 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">In <em>Pavel, </em>the court found three flaws in defense counsel\u2019s performance which were: (1) failure to prepare a defense; (2) failure to call important fact witnesses; and (3) failure to call a medical expert. <em>Id. </em>at 216-24. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">Because we conclude, that the <em>cumulative </em>weight of these flaws deprived Pavel of his Sixth Amendment rights, <em>see post </em>at 225, <em>see, e.g. Lindstadt [ v. Keane], </em>239 F.3d [191] at 199 [ (2001]) (holding that for Sixth Amendment purposes attorney errors must be considered \u201cin the aggregate\u201d), we do not consider whether <em>some </em>of these flaws\u2014standing alone, or in combination with one another\u2014could adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>support our conclusion that Meltzer\u2019s representation of Pav-el was constitutionally deficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In regard to the third reason the <em>Pavel </em>Court gave in finding deficient performance, failure to consult with or call an expert, the most important distinction between this case and <em>Pavel </em>is that here there was no equivalent \u201ccommon-sense mismatch\u201d between the physical evidence and the story of the victim inasmuch as, in the case at bar, more than two years elapsed between the last act of (alleged) rape and the examination by the State\u2019s expert. Moreover, as will be shown, Dr. Wehberg\u2019s testimony that a \u201cnormal genital exam can be consistent with penetrating sexual abuse\u201d was, in fact, backed up by pertinent peer reviewed medical literature. A competent trial lawyer, practicing in Maryland, would know that to prove second-degree rape the State did not have to prove that the child\u2019s hymen was ruptured and even Dr. Hariton seemed to agree that if the hymen was not ruptured there would be no evidence of rape when a physical exam is conducted two years after the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We turn now to the second case relied upon by appellant in support of his position that his trial counsel was deficient in failing to consult or call an expert: <em>Holsomback v. White, </em>133 F.3d 1382 (11th Cir. 1998). The facts in <em>Holsomback </em>were very similar to those in Pavel. Mr. Holsomback was convicted of first-degree sodomy of his son, Jeffrey. Jeffrey testified that between 1982, when he was four years old, until November 1987, his father regularly subjected him to anal intercourse during their bi-weekly weekend visitation. <em>Id. </em>at 1384. Jeffrey was examined by a Dr. Williams for signs of sexual abuse. The examination occurred approximately twelve (12) days after the last incident of alleged sodomy. Dr, Nolan, Jeffrey\u2019s family physician, was not called as a witness, nor was he interviewed by defense counsel. In fact, the only witnesses who testified at the trial were the defendant and his son even though Mr. Holsomback\u2019s trial counsel had been urged by his client to call Dr. Nolan as a witness. <em>Id. </em>at 1385. Moreover, although Holsomback\u2019s trial counsel knew that Jeffrey had been exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ined for signs of sexual abuse prior to trial by Dr. Williams, trial counsel made no effort to interview Dr. Williams or obtain Dr. Williams\u2019s medical records. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The <em>Holsomback </em>court held that defense counsel did not meet the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test by failing to contact Dr. Nolan or Dr. Williams prior to trial. In the words of the <em>Holsomback </em>court, \u201c[bjecause counsel never actually spoke with the physicians, he remained entirely unaware\u2014apart from his speculation that, at best, Dr. Williams would merely corroborate the lack of medical evidence\u2014of whether and to what extent their testimony might have helped Holsomback\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Dr. Nolan, an expert in family medicine, testified at the post-conviction hearing that the defendant and Jeffrey had been patients of his since Jeffrey was approximately two years old. <em>Id. </em>Although he examined Jeffrey two to three times per year, he never saw any signs of sexual abuse nor did \u201cJeffrey exhibit the behavior patterns of a child who had been sodomized[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Nolan further testified that, based on his review of both the medical report prepared by Dr. Williams and a review of the transcript of Jeffrey\u2019s trial testimony, he believed that Jeffrey\u2019s \u201caccount of the sexual abuse was medically impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In Dr. Nolan\u2019s view, \u201ccertain physical evidence of trauma to the anal area would be apparent to a doctor performing a rectal examination on a child who had been sodomized once within the previous ten days to two weeks or four times within the previous year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Nolan further testified that although Dr. Williams had examined Jeffrey approximately twelve (12) days after the last incident of alleged sodomy, the medical report from Dr. Williams showed \u201cno evidence of trauma or penetration of the anus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1389. From this, Dr. Nolan concluded that Jeffrey had not been subjected to anal intercourse twelve (12) days prior to the rectal examination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In the subject case, it was undisputed that prior to trial appellant\u2019s counsel did examine Dr. Wehberg\u2019s report and there was no other treating doctor whose report trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>could have reviewed prior to trial. Dr. Wehberg\u2019s trial testimony was in accordance with her report; unlike the situation in <em>Holsomback, </em>the record does not show that anything would have been gained by interviewing the examining doctor (Dr. Wehberg) prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">As part of appellant\u2019s argument, in regard to the performance prong, he contends that if appellant had consulted an expert (like Dr. Hariton) or the relevant literature, counsel would have found that a prepubertal girl, who is the victim of \u201cpenetrating sexual abuse\u201d could not have a normal genital exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Contrary to Dr. Hariton\u2019s testimony, there was ample medical literature from very reputable peer reviewed medical journals that supported Dr. Wehberg\u2019s opinion \u201cthat you can have penile vaginal penetration in a prepubertal girl without any physical findings.\u201d <em>See </em>Zitelli and Davis\u2019, <em>Atlas of Pediatric Physical Diagnosis </em>(6th ed. 2012), at 234 (stating that in \u201c(up to 96%) [of exams] either there are no physical findings specific for sexual abuse or the examination is completely normal\u201d and explaining that the \u201creasons for the absence of physical findings exist even when there is a confession of vaginal penetration by the perpetrator\u201d and include \u201cthe fact that penetration may only extend to the labia; the hymen being recessed from and internal to the labia; the delay in disclosure so common in young victims; the rapid healing of injuries involving the mucosa; the elasticity of hymenal tissue; the fact that hymenal tissue is capable of regrowth and that, with the onset of puberty and increased estrogen production, the hymen regrows and becomes more elastic\u201d); Kristine Fortin, MD, MPH <em>&amp; </em>Carole Jenny, MD, MBA, Pediatrics in Review (An Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics), <em>Sexual Abuse, </em>Vol. 33, Issue 1 (2012), page 23 stating that a normal physical exam \u201cdoes not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse or prior penetration\u201d and explaining that \u201c[m]ultiple research studies demonstrate a low prevalence of definitive physical findings among victims of sexual abuse\u201d (citing findings in a \u201ccase control study of close to 400 prepubertal children,\u201d and stating that \u201c[p]hysical findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>specific to previous genital trauma were found in only 2.5% of abused children\u201d) (footnotes omitted). In the medical literature just quoted, the authors cite from numerous studies and journal articles that reached a similar conclusion that were published before appellant\u2019s 2010 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Typical of conclusions arrived at in articles written in peer review journals prior to 2010, are those arrived at by Joyce A. Adams, Katherine Harper, Sandra Knudson, <em>&amp; </em>Juliette Revilla, <em>Examination Findings in Legally Confirmed Child Sexual Abuse: It\u2019s Normal to be </em>Normal, Pediatrics, 1994; 94: 310-17) (hereinafter \u201cAdams\u201d). Those authors concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">This study provides additional data that the majority of children with legally confirmed sexual abuse will have normal or nonspecific genital findings. Abnormal anal findings are very rarely found. The best predictors of abnormal genital findings in female victims are the time since the assault and a history that blood was reported or observed at the time of the molest. A history of vaginal penetration given by the child did not significantly correlate with abnormal genital findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAiK\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">This study also reaffirms that the history of the molest provided by the child is probably the most important evidence of sexual abuse. While widely accepted in the medical field, this fact is still not universally accepted in the legal arena. There are many reasons why a child\u2019s examination may be normal, as reviewed by Bays and Chadwick, and these reasons need to be reiterated to professionals involved in the assessment of children who have been molested, as well as those who are responsible for decisions regarding legal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 316 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Dr. Hariton wrote an article in 2012 titled: \u201cSexual assault in prepubertal girls: \u2018It is normal to be normal\u2019\u2014or is it? Evidence of vaginal penetration in prepubertal girls,\u201d Med. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Sci. Law, 62: 193-97 (2012) (hereafter \u201cHariton, Sexual Assault\u201d). In that article, he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">The result of the study both from review of the medical literature and an understanding of the anatomy and histology of the unestrogenized genitalia of the prepubertal girl makes it clear that if there has been forceful penile penetration of the hymen, there will be both a history of pain and bleeding and healed evidence of this forceful penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">As can be seen, Dr. Hariton\u2019s conclusion in the article he wrote is different from that set forth in the articles we have quoted. In his article Dr. Hariton acknowledges that these are pediatric journal articles that reach a conclusion contrary to his. In fact, from reading his article, it is evident that one of Dr. Hariton\u2019s primary purposes of writing the article was to criticize those articles that disagreed with him. For instance, he cites what he characterizes as the \u201ctwo most quoted articles\u201d that espouse the view \u201cthat there can be penetration without injury in prepubertal girls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195. The articles that he criticizes are: David L. Kerns &amp; Mary L. Ritter: \u201cMedical findings in Child Sexual Abuse Cases With Perpetrator Confessing,\u201d American Journal of Disease of Children (1992), Vol. 146, p, 494, and David Muram, \u201cChild sexual abuse: Relationship between sexual acts and genital findings,\u201d Child Abuse &amp; Neglect (1989), Vol. 13, Issue 2 pages 211-16. In Dr. Hariton\u2019s 2012 article, besides criticizing articles that essentially mirror Dr. Wehberg\u2019s view, he also cites articles in professional journals, written prior to 2010, that agree with his opinion that if the hymen is ruptured, the rupture will always be evident in any post-rape exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">A competent criminal defense lawyer representing a defendant in a case like this one, should, upon receipt of a report by a medical expert like Dr. Wehberg, consult an independent expert under some, but not all, circumstances. One of the circumstances where an expert should be consulted would be if the lawyer is unfamiliar with the medical literature concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>the issue about which the State\u2019s expert is prepared to testify. In this case, trial counsel testified that he was presently familiar with the relevant medical literature. But trial counsel was never asked about what he did know. Except for trial counsel\u2019s testimony, there was no other direct or circumstantial evidence on this subject. Because appellant failed to show that at the time of his 2010 trial his counsel was unfamiliar with the pertinent literature, the State was entitled to the benefit of the presumption that trial counsel\u2019s performance (insofar as it covered medical research) was professional and competent. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>158 Md.App. 558, 857 A.2d 1132 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We turn now to the closely related question of what trial counsel should have known in 2010, if he consulted the relevant literature. Appellant contends that trial counsel violated the performance standard because, if he had consulted the literature, he would have known that Dr. Wehberg was in error when she said that \u201cthe hymen of a little girl is very vascular and elastic.\u201d There is nothing in the record to show that what Dr. Wehberg said about the vaginal area was in error. So no matter how much research appellant\u2019s trial counsel had done, the State\u2019s expert could not have been effectively cross-examined on that point. Appellant takes a contrary view, which is based on Dr. Hariton\u2019s testimony. Dr. Hariton said that Dr. Wehberg was wrong when she said that \u201cthe hymen of a little girl is very vascular and elastic.\u201d But, contrary to what Dr. Hariton testified to, Dr. Wehberg never testified that the hymen is \u201cvery vascular\u201d and \u201celastic.\u201d She testified that the \u201cvaginal area is very vascular and very elastic and can heal very rapidly.\u201d As the State points out, appellant\u2019s argument is like comparing apples to oranges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Appellant\u2019s next criticism of the performance of his trial counsel is based on the assertion that \u201c[tjhere is no getting around the fact that G.S. alleged that [a]ppellant forcefully penetrated her vagina with his penis.\u201d Appellant goes on to argue that forceful penetration of the vagina \u201cnecessarily entails penetration of the hymen.\u201d Under such circumstances, according to appellant, trial counsel should have consulted with and called to the witness stand a witness who would have testified as Dr. Hariton did at the post-conviction hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In our view, G.S.\u2019s testimony did not make it clear that there was \u201cforceful penetration\u201d through the hymen. <em>See </em>Adams, <em>supra, </em>at 321. (\u201cYoung children have no concept of what is meant by the term in the vagina. A statement such as \u2018he put his thing in my privates may or may not mean that full penetration occurred.\u2019\u201d). If there had been forceful penetration into the vagina, as both Dr. Hariton and Dr. Wehberg agree, there would have been bleeding\u2014and G.S. did not report bleeding. As already pointed out, to prove second-degree rape in Maryland, proof of penetration through the hymen is not necessary. And, even Dr. Hariton does not contend that two years after the event that there would be signs of trauma, if the hymen is not ruptured. Under such circumstances, it is far from clear what would have been gained if appellant\u2019s counsel had found a doctor who would have contradicted Dr. Wehberg and said that if there is penetration of the hymen, there will be evidence of that penetration in a post-rape examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">As mentioned earlier, Dr. Hariton also testified that Dr. Wehberg was mistaken when she testified \u201cthat there\u2019s medical literature saying that she\u2019s right, that you can have pen[ile] vaginal penetration in a prepubertal girl without any physical findings.\u201d But in this regard, it is Dr. Hariton who is wrong and not Dr. Wehberg. The error on Dr. Hariton\u2019s part in this regard is shown by the article he wrote, i.e., Hariton, Sexual Assault. In that article he attempts to discredit the articles and studies written prior to 2010 that reached the same conclusion as did Dr. Wehberg, i.e., that in a prepubertal girl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>you can have vaginal penetration without any physical findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In considering the contention that trial counsel\u2019s failure to consult with or call an expert to counter the State\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony, we are cognizant of the principle that it is presumed \u201cthat the acts or omissions of counsel [were] the product of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d Cirincione, 119 Md.App. at 486, 705 A.2d 96. The <em>Cirincione </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anl\">Where a decision of counsel is based upon a merely partial investigation, the resulting tactical decision remains presumptively reasonable \u201cprecisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. at 2066. In other words, counsel\u2019s assistance is not ineffective if he either makes reasonable investigations or makes \u201ca reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even a decision not to investigate is entitled to \u201ca heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">As earlier mentioned, trial counsel testified that, in his analysis, there are three factors that can make for a successful defense in a child abuse case: (1) a reason for the victim to fabricate; (2) lack of physical evidence to support the victim\u2019s allegations; and (3) an articulate criminal defendant who can testify. According to trial counsel\u2019s unrebutted testimony, appellant\u2019s case contained all those factors. In other words, trial counsel articulated a thoughtful basis for arriving at his trial strategy. He decided to focus on G.S.\u2019s lack of candor during her interviews with the police, in her statements to Dr. Wehberg, and in her disclosures to Heather Sullivan, the social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">It would not, of course, be considered sound trial strategy to not consult with a physician if something said in Dr. Weh-berg\u2019s report was manifestly in error or that she held an opinion that a reasonably competent lawyer, familiar with the relevant literature, should have recognized as invalid. As shown, it is far from clear that any opinion Dr. Wehberg gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>was in error. At the time of trial (and presently) some, but not all, experts in her field agreed with Dr. Wehberg that a normal physical exam does not exclude the possibility of past penile penetration of the hymen. Because of a significant number of journal articles supporting Dr. Wehberg\u2019s views, calling an OBGYN who shared Dr. Hariton\u2019s opinions would be risky inasmuch as such opinion could be contradicted, or at least undermined by the literature discussed, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Because trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call an expert (like Dr. Hariton) is entitled to \u201ca heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgment,\u201d <em>Cirincione, </em>119 Md.App. at 486, 705 A.2d 96 (citation and quotation marks omitted), and because there is nothing in the record before this Court to demonstrate that trial counsel lacked the knowledge, training or skill to make that decision, appellant has failed to carry his heavy burden to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s conduct did not fall \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Because we hold that appellant has failed to prove that the performance of his trial counsel was deficient, it is unnecessary for us to consider the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>standard,</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMI-CO COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Exhibit A</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-4\">. The circuit court granted appellant partial post-conviction relief by allowing him to belatedly file both a motion for modification or reduction of sentence pursuant to Md.

Dr. Hariton\u2019s testimony that the hymen of a prepubertal girl is not elastic may not always be true. Dr. Hariton said in his testimony that an article by Felicity Goodyear-Smith and Tannis M. Laidlaw, entitled <em>\u201cWhat is an Intact Hymen? A Critique of the Literature,\" </em>Med. Sci. Law (1998) Vol. 38, No. 4 at 290 was authoritative.
