Did the court err in applying the provisions of Md. Code (2015 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 11-304 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) and admitting evidence of J.J.\u2019s out-of-court statement to a licensed clinical social worker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">2. Did the court err in finding the children CINA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">3. Did the court properly suspend Mr. J.\u2019s visitation with the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">4. Did the court properly extend the children\u2019s shelter care and postpone adjudication beyond the 30-day time period provided for in Md. Rules 11-112 and 11-114?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">J.J., age 9 at the time of the proceedings below (DOB: 4/11/06), and D.J., age 3 (DOB: 12/1/11), are the children of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Ms. B. and Mr. J. In August 2015, J.J. and D.J. were living with Mr. J.; Ms. B. was incarcerated. On August 30, 2015, the Department became involved after J.J. reported that Mr. J. had sexually abused her. J.J. reported to a child protective services forensic investigator, Tiffany Gattis, that Mr. J. had rubbed his \u201cwee-wee\u201d on her \u201cprivate part\u201d and made her \u201csuck his wee-wee.\u201d The Department removed the children from Mr. J., which led to the CINA determination at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Events Leading to the September 2015 Shelter Care Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Ms. B. and Mr. J. had three children together\u2014J.J., D.J., and Ja.J. Ms. B.\u2019s oldest daughter, N.R., was sixteen years old at the time of the disposition hearing and lived with a maternal aunt. Ms. B.\u2019s youngest daughter, T.S., was six years old and lived with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The Department, as set forth in its report to the court, had a long history with the family. In 2008, the Department received a child welfare referral based on a report that a former tenant of the family\u2019s home had used his key to enter the home without the family\u2019s consent and was discovered masturbating while standing over N.R.\u2019s bed as she slept. Mr. J. declined to be interviewed by police, and the case was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">In December 2011, after D.J. was born prematurely, Ms. B. tested positive for marijuana. On February 28, 2012, the Department received a report that, although D.J.\u2019s pediatrician determined that he needed a follow-up with a specialist in retinopathy of prematurity, Ms. B. missed several appointments. There also were concerns that Ms. B. was not giving her other children medications as prescribed, Ms. B. had problems with marijuana and alcohol, there was no food in the home, there were too many people living in the home, and Ms. B. was hitting the children with a belt and cursing at them. The Department\u2019s investigation indicated Ms. B. for neglect, and she was arrested for medical neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>In April 2012, the Department offered Ms. B. family preservation services. Ms. B. signed a service plan to enroll in drug treatment, follow all recommendations, maintain all of the children\u2019s appointments, and enroll in GED classes. She did not follow through with these tasks. Ms. B. denied that she had a substance abuse problem, and she did not believe she needed treatment. Mr. J. had not been a consistent parent to his children; he had been in and out of Ms. B.\u2019s life due to domestic violence and incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Between September 2012 and September 2014, the Department worked intensively with the parents \u201cto try to help them address their drug use, the domestic violence in [their] relationship [and] to help them get and maintain housing.\u201d Both parents, however, continued to abuse alcohol and marijuana, and domestic violence was an ongoing issue. The Department offered Mr. J. mental health services, but it was never able to satisfactorily address his issues because his engagement was sporadic.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In June 2012, Ms. B. reported to police that N.R. was a runaway or had been kidnapped. The Department determined, however, that Ms. B. had allowed N.R. to visit her family, and N.R. did not want to return to Ms. B.\u2019s home. The police contacted the Department regarding the condition of Ms. B.\u2019s home, and the Department worked \u201cintensively\u201d with Ms. B. and her children throughout July 2012, when the family moved to Florida, without notifying the Department or extended family.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In August 2012, while the family was living at a motel in St. Petersburg, Florida, Ja.J., then five years old, drowned in the motel pool. N.R., who was then 13 years old, had been left in charge of her younger siblings, ages 6, 5, and 2. When Ja.J. was discovered at 9:40 p.m., Ms. B. and Mr. J., were in the hotel room. Child neglect allegations were indicated for both Ms. B. and Mr. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In September 2012, the family returned to Wicomico County. They resided with family members, and when the Department\u2019s social worker visited, all of the children, except N.R., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>were sleeping on the floor. N.R. reported that, when they arrived, Ms. B. had pulled her out of the backseat of the car by her hair, pulled her hair, and punched her in the eye. This incident occurred in front of Mr. J., who did nothing to stop it. Ms. B. was removed from the scene in handcuffs, and all of the children were placed in respite care. Ms. B. was convicted of physical abuse and sentenced to serve fifteen weekends in the local detention center. Mr. J. was indicated for neglect and Ms. B. was indicated for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">On January 25, 2013, the Department initiated a sexual abuse investigation to assess allegations reported by then six-year-old J.J., who had disclosed abuse by Mr. J. During an audio and video recorded forensic interview, J.J. stated that, when she and Mr. J. were alone in the master bedroom of the family\u2019s former residence, Mr. J. had touched her on her vaginal area and on her buttocks. She could not give an approximate date or time, but she stated that the touching occurred more than once, and there were no witnesses. Mr. J. and Ms. B. denied all allegations of sexual abuse, and the allegation was found to be unsubstantiated, although not ruled out, as J.J. remained consistent with her statements for more than a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">In March 2013, during a forensic interview in an unrelated case, J.J. disclosed sexual abuse by a 17-year-old male cousin, B.J., while she was residing with a maternal great-aunt for several months. J.J. stated that B.J. had touched her vagina and buttocks. The Department found the abuse indicated after B.J. admitted to touching J.J. on her vaginal area and having her masturbate him. B.J. was criminally charged with child abuse and sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On July 7, 2013, police were called to the family home due to a domestic violence incident. Mr. J. and Ms. B. were drinking and fighting with each other in the street while Mr. J. held baby D.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In July 2014, CINA petitions were dismissed for all of the children, and the Department continued to provide family support services. On October 22, 2014, Ms. B. filed for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>protective order against Mr. J,, but she failed to appear for the final protective order hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">On October 27, 2014, the Department again received a referral, which alleged that J.J. had been sexually abused by Mr, J. During the forensic interview, J.J. reported that Mr. J. licked her vagina, which she referred to as a \u201cYorkie,\u201d for 20 minutes. J.J. stated that Mr. J. had never touched her sexually or licked her in the past. She also reported that, on the same weekend, she witnessed Mr. J. kicking Ms. B. out of the home, resulting in a domestic dispute that she witnessed. Ms. B. subsequently returned to the house, but Mr. J. had another woman in the home, who was \u201csucking [Mr. J.\u2019s] \u2018do\u2014do.\u2019 \u201d J.J. could not explain, however, what that meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">On November 10, 2014, Mr. J. and Ms. B. were interviewed separately by the Wicomico Child Advocacy Center. Mr. J. stated that J.J. told him \u201cthat she was instructed by her grandmother to make the statements related to sexual abuse.\u201d Ms. B. stated \u201cthat she fabricated the abuse allegation because she was angry\u201d at Mr. J. for cheating. Based on inconsistent information and evidence of coaching, the final disposition was unsubstantiated for sexual abuse. Because the Department could not determine whether the abuse did or did not occur, the determination of unsubstantiated sexual abuse \u201cappeared to be most appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">On December 22, 2014, a warrant issued for Ms. B.\u2019s arrest. She subsequently was incarcerated for violating her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">On August 30, 2015, while Ms. B. was still incarcerated, the Department was contacted by the Fruitland Police Department, which had received a complaint regarding the alleged sexual abuse of J.J. The Department, along with the police and the Wicomico Child Advocacy Center, conducted a joint investigation. J.J. disclosed that, on August 27 and August 29, 2015, Mr. J. \u201chad sexual intercourse with her and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\u201d A SAFE exam was performed,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>but J.J. had brushed her teeth, showered, urinated, and defecated prior to the exam. The preliminary results indicated that J.J. had a possible \u201cnotch\u201d to her vaginal opening that could be indicative of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On August 31, 2015, the children were placed in shelter care.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">September 2, 2015, Shelter Care Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">At the September 2, 2015, shelter care hearing, Mr. J. and Ms. B. agreed to placement of the children in shelter care for 30 days pending the adjudicatory hearing. The adjudication hearing was scheduled for October 7, 2015. Mr. J. was scheduled to have one supervised visit with D.J. between the shelter care hearing and the next hearing, but the court ordered that there would be \u201cno visitation with [J.J.] at this time given the circumstances that have been presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Postponements</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>there were a couple of postponements prior to the ultimate adjudicatory hearing. At a November 18, 2015, status conference, the court was advised regarding the status of Mr. J.\u2019s visitation with the children. Although the Department had provided Mr. J. with transportation, he had missed one scheduled visitation with D.J. and arrived late on two other occasions. Counsel informed the court that J.J. had begun seeing two therapists: one to address the trauma that she had experienced, and one to address her issues with food and weight gain. Danielle Brennan, a foster care worker for the Department, reported that the trauma therapist was \u201csupportive\u201d of J.J.\u2019s request to have no contact with Mr. J. Additionally, the therapist supported only supervised visitation between J.J. and Ms. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>CP \u00a7 11-304 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">On November 30, 2015, the court held a hearing pursuant to Md. Code (2015 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 11-304 of the Criminal Procedure Article (the \u201cCP \u00a7 11-304 hearing\u201d) to address the admissibility of an out-of-court statement that J.J. made to a member of the Department. During the time period from May to August 2015, Mr. J. lived alone with J.J. and D.J. Ms. B. was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Ms. Gattis, a social worker who had been a member of the Department for eight years, and the Child Advocacy Center for seven years, testified regarding her interview of J.J. on August 30, 2015. She explained that the Child Advocacy Center takes a \u201cholistic approach to investigating and assessing reports of abuse and/or neglect\u201d under a system called RATAC, which is an acronym for \u201crapport, anatomy, touch, abuse and closure,\u201d a \u201cnationally recognized forensic interviewing process.\u201d Under the RATAC approach, non-biased, non-leading questions are asked when interviewing children who may have been sexually abused. Ms. Gattis underwent \u201csubstantial training to become certified in the RATAC process,\u201d including passing a written examination after attending 40 hours of training. She also attended the \u201cadvanced RATAC protocol training,\u201d which includes a three-day session, after which she was required to submit a video of interviews for critique.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On August 30, Ms. Gattis received a report from Trooper Donna Hale, indicating that J.J. had alleged that Mr. J. had sexually abused her. The forensic interview took place that evening, between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m., in a treatment room in the emergency room. Trooper Hale was present, and the interview was audio recorded; video recording equipment was not available at the hospital. The audio tape was admitted at the motions hearing without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Ms. Gattis previously had interviewed J.J. concerning an investigation that ended in December 2014, but they had no contact in the interim. J.J. answered truthfully the general questions Ms. Gattis asked about where she attended school. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>She understood the concept of days of the week. Given J.J.\u2019s age, Ms. Gattis tried to gauge J.J.\u2019s developmental level and asked questions that she could answer appropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">When J.J. first saw Ms. Gattis, she appeared \u201chappy to see a familiar face.\u201d Ms. Gattis stated that J.J. is \u201cvery outspoken and speaks with volume.\u201d At the beginning of the interview, she was \u201csitting upright.\u201d As the issue of abuse arose, however, \u201cher voice became lower in volume,\u201d she began \u201cto cave in upon herself,\u201d and her \u201cshoulders began to hunch over.\u201d She also \u201cbegan chewing on a strap that she had in her hand off of her sleeve.\u201d J.J. \u201cbecame distant\u201d and \u201cdid not maintain eye contact.\u201d She \u201cpeered down\u201d and \u201cstarted to make noises to avoid answering\u201d Ms. Gattis. She \u201cbegan asking questions about things that were not relevant to the interview,\u201d was \u201cvery distracted with wanting to eat ... and asking ... about when her next meal would come,\u201d and asked to stop the interview. Prior to that, she had been \u201cvery engaged\u201d and \u201cvery observant about what was going on with\u201d Ms. Gattis.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">J.J. also drew a picture of Mr. J.\u2019s penis, and she used her hands to demonstrate how long and wide it was prior to drawing the picture.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The picture was consistent with what J.J. demonstrated with her hands. J.J. became upset when she made spelling mistakes and scribbled out some of the words on the picture. She had written the statement that \u201cmy dad made me suck his wee wee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Ms. Gattis described how grotesque it was to see a nine year old child demonstrate \u201cwhat happens when you have to suck someone\u2019s wee wee.\u201d J.J. performed an act with a pen that can be heard as clicking during the interview \u201cdisplaying what sucking a wee wee would look like.\u201d J.J. also made a \u201cvery spontaneous\u201d comment that D.J. had been upstairs in the bathtub \u201cmaking a whole bunch of noise\u201d during the abuse. Ms. Gattis addressed J.J.\u2019s prior disclosure of abuse, and she explained that a child who previously had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>sexually abused would not necessarily have a more graphic understanding of sex than a child who had not been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">After she concluded the forensic interview, Ms. Gattis and Trooper Hale went to the police department, where she interviewed Mr. J. and D.J. Mr. J. stated that J.J. and D.J. had gone to visit their maternal family on Wednesday and returned to his care on Saturday evening. He denied J.J.\u2019s allegations, stating that \u201che would consider not fighting for his children because it was becoming an old and tiring process to be accused of sexual abuse.\u201d He stated that J.J. was \u201cstarting [a] mess, again,\u201d and \u201che should have never allowed her to visit [Ms. B.\u2019s] mother, visit her family because they were filling her head with nonsense.\u201d Ms. Gattis spoke with D.J., but given his age and maturity level, D.J. did not have any information.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">During the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, Ms. B. and Mr. J. challenged the indicated findings of abuse. The court explained, however, that the \u201creal question\u201d at that hearing was \u201cwhether or not this interview was conducted appropriately, and there is guarantees of trustworthiness in light of the questioning and responses in this interview.\u201d The court further explained that the out-of-court statement would not \u201cnecessarily ... [be] inadmissible because it is subject to being impeached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Adjudicatory Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">At the adjudicatory hearing, Ms. Gattis\u2019 testimony was similar to her prior testimony. Barbara Flatly, an in-home services supervisor for the Department, testified to the Department\u2019s history with the family and the attempt to provide services. The court also listened to the audiotape of J.J.\u2019s interview while reading the transcript.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the court found J.J.\u2019s interview and her statements \u201cto be entirely credible.\u201d It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>further stated that \u201c[n]othing has refuted those statements,\u201d and therefore, \u201cthe allegations have been sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The court found that there was credible evidence that J.J. disclosed sexual abuse on \u201c8-27-2015 and 8-29-2015,\u201d that J.J. was diagnosed with a possible vaginal notch that could be indicative of sexual abuse, that J.J. provided a description of Mr. J.\u2019s penis and drew a picture of it for Ms. Gattis, and J.J. had disclosed to Ms. Gattis that Mr. J. rubbed his penis on her body and had her suck his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The court sustained the following allegations in the CINA petition: paragraph 8(b), that \u201cboth parents have extensive histories of being unable to properly care for the children\u201d; 8(c), that Ms. B. \u201cwas indicated for neglect for failing to seek medical treatment for\u201d D.J.; 8(d), that Mr. J. and Ms. B. were indicated for neglect in the drowning death of Ja.J. by the State of Florida; 81, that Ms. B. was indicated for abuse and criminally convicted of assaulting N.R., and Mr. J. \u201cwas indicated for neglect for the same incident for not intervening on N.R.\u2019s behalf\u2019; 8(g), that Mr. J. and Ms. B. \u201chave a history of domestic violence in the home in the presence of the children\u201d; and, 8(i), that Mr. J. \u201csexually abused [J.J.] on more than one occasion.\u201d The court did not sustain paragraph 8(f), that Ms. B. \u201cadmits to using alcohol and marijuana as a stress management tool and has not maintained regular participation in a recovery program.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">At the disposition hearing, the Department recommended that visitation with the children be suspended for both parents until they engaged in the services needed. With respect to Ms. B., the Department was concerned that she did not believe J.J.\u2019s statements regarding the abuse, and she was not trying to help J.J. through her trauma. At visits, Ms. B. focused her attention on D.J., and was unable to \u201cfully engage\u201d with J.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Ms. B. often would make derogatory remarks about J.J.\u2019s hair and appearance, she chastised J.J. for her clothing, and she was critical of J.J.\u2019s attempts to impress her. Ms. B. did not appear to reciprocate J.J.\u2019s attempts at affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Although Ms. B. had advised that she would go to a shelter or live with her family, rather than move in with Mr. J., the Department had not been able to verify that Ms. B. lived anywhere other than with Mr. J. When the Department transported Ms. B. to and from appointments or visitation, she was at Mr. J.\u2019s home, and when dropped off, Ms. B. had a key and let herself into the house. The Department reported that Ms. B. appeared to want to continue to have a relationship with Mr. J., \u201cputting that need above the needs of her children.\u201d Despite a no-contact order, Ms. B. had J.J. call Mr. J. during a visit to tell him that she loved him and missed him while a staff person was taking D.J. to the restroom. The Department believed that anxiety and depression, combined with substance abuse, were ongoing issues with Ms. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">With respect to Mr. J., Ms. Brennan, a foster care worker at the Department, testified that he threatened to file assault charges against a child protective services worker who had tapped him on the shoulder. He was non-compliant with program services, including a recommendation for intensive outpatient addiction treatment. Mr. J. also became verbally aggressive with D.J.\u2019s foster parents. During visitations, Mr. J. took D.J. to the bathroom unattended on numerous occasions, despite the Department\u2019s instructions that he was not to do so. At \u201c[p]retty much every visit\u201d with Mr. J., there was \u201csome kind of event.\u201d He complained that D.J.\u2019s hair needed to be cut, that he had not been fed, and that he was being hurt by another child in the foster home. He repeatedly asked D.J. where he was sleeping and who was sleeping with him in his bed, and he refused to accept D.J.\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Department wanted Mr. J. to have psychological testing to determine whether sexual abuse was likely to reoccur, but this had not yet been accomplished. D.J. had begun displaying sexualized behaviors, which caused \u201cserious concerns\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Department regarding what he \u201cmay have seen or witnessed or been exposed to.\u201d Mr. J. also refused to sign a service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At the conclusion of the disposition hearing, the court adjudicated the children CINA, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">I do find that the children are in need of the [cjourt\u2019s intervention.

In support, he argues that J.J.\u2019s interview \u201cdid not demonstrate that she possessed the capacity to be a reliable witness,\u201d stating that, in \u201cthe absence of evidence that J.J. could appreciate the difference between a lie and truth, and the ability to recall past events, the court could not conclude\u201d that she was competent to testify, Mr. J. further asserts that J.J.\u2019s statements were not trustworthy because she previously had made unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse, her responses to questions \u201cended with an inflection, as if she were responding with a question,\u201d she did not like Mr. J. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>therefore had a motive to fabricate, her statements were not spontaneous, but were made in response to questions from Ms. Gattis, she had knowledge of sex acts due to sexual abuse by a cousin, and there \u201cwere other reasons why J.J.\u2019s statements were unreliable,\u201d including \u201cinner inconsistencies.\u201d Mr. J. asserts that, because Ms. Gattis\u2019 interview \u201cdid not demonstrate that J.J.\u2019s statements .., contained reasonable particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d they should not have been admitted to prove that he sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Department contends that \u201cthe juvenile court complied with the requirements of [CP] \u00a7 11-304 when it admitted the audio-recording of J.J.\u2019s statements made during a forensic interview.\u201d It argues that the question before the juvenile court did not require a determination of J.J.\u2019s competence as a witness, but rather, the issue was \u201cwhether her August 30, 2015 audiotaped statements were sufficiently reliable to be admissible evidence.\u201d The Department asserts that the court played the audiotape at the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, heard testimony, considered the evidence, and then addressed each statutory factor to \u201cestablish that J.J.\u2019s statements possessed reasonable particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d The children similarly argue that the court\u2019s finding, that J.J.\u2019s statement \u201cwas accurate and trustworthy, was not clearly erroneous, and the court properly admitted the statement into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Mr. J. is correct that, pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-304, \u201ca trial judge must make a preliminary determination of whether the young child\u2019s statement is sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>P.F., </em>137 Md.App. at 272, 768 A.2d 112. \u201cThe statute directs that such hearsay \u2018may be admissible ... only if the statement possesses particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In that regard, the court must determine whether \u201cthe totality of the circumstances that surround the making of the statement ... render the declarant particularly worthy of belief,\u201d i.e., \u201cwhether the child was likely to be telling the truth when making the statements.\u201d <em>Prince v.

Morgan Chase Bank, </em>424 Md. 333, 351, 36 A.3d 399 (2012) (parallel citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The parties do not cite, and we have not found, any Maryland appellate court case specifically analyzing the argument that a court must consider a child\u2019s competency to testify prior to admitting an out-of-court statement pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-304. Other courts, however, have addressed the issue and rejected this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Walter, </em>625 Pa. 522, 93 A.3d 442, 451 (2014), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held that a competency determination is not a prerequisite to the admission of hearsay statements under Pennsylvania\u2019s tender years statute, noting that there was no such requirement listed in the statute. Moreover, the court explained the differences between the concerns underlying the requirement that a child is competent to testify and the concerns implicated by the admissibility of a child\u2019s out-of-court statements under the tender years statute. <em>Id. </em>at 452. One of the primary concerns addressed by the requirement that a child -witness be competent to testify is \u201ca child\u2019s ability to perceive and remember events about which the child later testifies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether out-of-court statements of a child contain particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, by contrast, the court looks to the circumstances under which the statements were made and focuses on the truthfulness of the statement, which is assessed by considering the factors set forth in the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53. Accordingly, the court held \u201cthat a child need not be deemed competent to testify as a witness in order for the trial court to admit the child\u2019s out-of-court statements into evidence pursuant to the [tender years statute],\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453. <em>See also State v. Silverman, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 581, 906 N.E.2d 427, 432 (2009) (rule providing exception to child hearsay statements does not require competency finding); <em>State v. C.J., </em>148 Wash.2d 672, 63 P.3d 765, 770 (2003) (en banc) (child hearsay exception statute does not contain \u201cany requirement that a declarant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>must be shown to have possessed testimonial competency at the time of the out of court statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to Maryland\u2019s tender years statute. CP \u00a7 11-304 imposes multiple conditions that must be satisfied prior to the admission into evidence of an out-of-court statement of a child under the age of 13. The statute, however, does not contain any requirement that the court first conduct a preliminary competency determination. In the absence of such a provision, this Court cannot read this requirement into the statute. <em>See State v. Adams-Bey, </em>449 Md. 690, 702, 144 A.3d 1200 (2016) (\u201c (We neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 350, 958 A.2d 356 (2008)). Rather, pursuant to the plain language of CP \u00a7 11-304, a competency determination is not a component of the analysis required prior to admitting a child victim\u2019s out-of-court statement. Given the plain language of CP \u00a7 11-304, as well as the different concerns regarding the competency of a child witness to testify and the admissibility of a prior out-of-court statement by an abused child, we hold that a court need not make a competency determination prior to admitting a prior statement pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Statutory Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We thus turn to review whether the court\u2019s ruling complied with the requirements of CP \u00a7 11-304. It clearly did.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court first found that there was \u201ccorroborative evidence that the alleged offender had the opportunity to commit the alleged abuse or neglect.\u201d <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 ll-304(d)(2)(ii). This finding is not challenged; Mr. J. admitted that he and J. J. were living together at the time of the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The court then addressed each of the 13 statutory factors to be considered in determining whether there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[ (i) the child victim\u2019s personal knowledge of the event]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Y\">The child has great personal knowledge of the event. She talks about it in detail about\u2014there is no confusion about what happened in the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">[ (ii) the certainty that the statement was made]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">It was clearly made. It was tape-recorded. We all heard it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agu\">[ (iii) any apparent motive to fabricate or exhibit partiality by the child victim, including interest, bias, corruption, or coercion]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[S]he, in 2013, I think a little more than a year and a half before this incident made the statements about her father and wanted to get the gun and shoot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">And in addition, there was testimony that the recurrence of this occurs that she may [have been] coerce[d] somewhat by her maternal relatives. So there does exist an apparent motive to exhibit partiality by the child, and there was some testimony about possibility of coercion, although nothing specific under that factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">[ (iv) whether the statement was spontaneous or directly responsive to questions]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">There was some spontaneity in the answers. Most of them were directly responsive to questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">[ (v) the timing of the statement]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">The timing of the statement is very proximate to the most recent abuse which was the night before. So at least with regard to that, it\u2019s very proximate. And then if you go back to Tuesday and Thursday, it was close in time to those, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au4\">[ (vi) whether the child victim\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child victim fabricated the statement that represents a graphic, detailed account beyond the child victim\u2019s expected knowledge and experience]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">Well, she is 9 years old now, right? Am I right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">And what she described would be beyond the child victim\u2019s expected knowledge and experience except for, unfor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>tunately, for this child victim, she is a prior victim of sex abuse. So she may have and in all likelihood does have much more knowledge and experience. So it was an age appropriate statement for a 9-year-old in the sense of, I mean, it was a believable. statement in the sense that she wouldn\u2019t have that knowledge. We don\u2019t know how much knowledge she has if any as a result of having been sexually abused before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">Now, I will talk more about how I\u2019m evaluating that factor when I make my final ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">[ (vii) the appropriateness of the terminology of the statement to the child victim\u2019s age]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">It was completely appropriate using the terms of wee wee and private parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">(viii) the nature and duration of the abuse or neglect)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">She talked about the three specific days that she said. And then she said Tuesday and last night, but also that it started, I think it was three weeks after she went to see Miss Christine I think we figured out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">[ (ix) the inner consistency and coherence of the statement]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">There are things that are inconsistent in this statement. First, there\u2019s no clothes on. Then there\u2019s clothes on. Where she is during this? But when I look at, and then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAUKk\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">She is not being led in that part, and she is giving it graphically. Then she draws a picture\u2014I mean, she writes a note about the suck. And uses her finger to go in and out of her mouth, I believe, later on when we get through there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">So there is nothing about that that is inconsistent or incoherent. And those are the two\u2014the discussion of the actual events or whatever\u2014the meat of the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYq\">[ (x) whether the child victim was suffering pain or distress when making the statement]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">She was, obviously\u2014according to the testimony of Ms. Gattis in some distress, the stress not inconsistent with a 9-year-old making those statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>[ (xi) whether extrinsic evidence exists to show the defendant or child respondent had an opportunity to commit the act complained of in the child victim\u2019s statement]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">In the child victim\u2019s statement, there is extrinsic evidence. How convinced the trier of fact will be in light of other evidence does negate the fact that there is extrinsic evidence, and that is his statement against interest to [the Department] and/or the law enforcement officer. I don\u2019t know who he made that to exactly, the fact that they all live together in that house. And I don\u2019t know what other evidence will come in at trial. But there is extrinsic evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZO\">[ (xii) whether the statement was suggested by the use of leading questions]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">There were a lot of leading questions in here. I\u2019m not sure with the social work background that Ms. Gattis has the same understanding of what a leading question is as people with a legal background. But as I was just reading through that part, which I call the meat of the statement, those weren\u2019t leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">I do not find that the salient parts of this statement were suggestive by the use of leading questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">[ (xiii) the credibility of the person testifying about the statement)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">Ms. Gattis was a credible witness. I didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, it looked to me\u2014I mean, from my evaluation, she was trying just to evaluate this statement. She did know in the back of her mind that there had been earlier allegations. But I don\u2019t find that that influenced the way she conducted the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">Now, whether that had any influence with their finding of indicated or\u2014I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s not for me to decide here and now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">After considering all these factors, the court, pursuant to the statute, made its ultimate decision on the admissibility of the statement. It ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>So I find that there are particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and so I will determine that the statement is admissible as far as the statute goes. But, again, I think it\u2019s unclear to me whether at trial, additional evidence on the issue of opportunity might become relevant, but at this point I find it to be admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As the above illustrates, the court did what it was required to do by specifically addressing the 13 factors as set forth in CP \u00a7 11-304. After doing that, it found that J.J.\u2019s statement possessed \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Although Mr. J. may disagree with the court\u2019s findings, we are not persuaded that they were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Ms. B. asserts that the court erred in failing to require the Department to follow the notice requirement of CP \u00a7 11-304(d)(3), which required the Department to provide notice of its intent to introduce J.J.\u2019s out-of-court statement within a reasonable time before the proceeding. The Department and the children disagree. They assert that the statute requires only that notice of the statement be provided to the parties \u201cwithin a reasonable time before the juvenile court proceeding,\u201d and the court properly concluded that the parties and their counsel had advance knowledge of the statements and were not prejudiced by proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">CP ll-304(d)(3) requires that the State give notice of the intent to introduce a child\u2019s out-of-court statement \u201cwithin a reasonable time before the juvenile court proceedings.\u201d In this case, the Department filed a CP \u00a7 11-304 notice of intent to introduce J.J.\u2019s out-of-court statement on September 28, 2015, attaching a transcript of Ms. Gattis\u2019 August 31, 2015 forensic interview of J.J. An adjudicatory and disposition hearing was scheduled for October 7, 2015. On October 6, 2015, the Department filed a motion to postpone the adjudicatory and disposition hearing because counsel discovered that she previously had represented Mr. J. Both parents consented to the postponement, and the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing was scheduled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>October 28, 2015, with the adjudication hearing postponed until November 18, 2015. At the October 7 postponement hearing, the Department also provided \u201cto all counsel\u201d the audio tape of the forensic interview, \u201cwhich is part of the line which was filed by the Department on September 28th, which coincides with the transcription that was previously provided to counsel pursuant to that line.\u201d All counsel agreed that they had received the transcript and the audio tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The proceedings again were postponed, and the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing took place on November 30, 2015. At the start of the hearing, counsel for Mr. J. noted an objection, stating that, although CP \u00a7 11-304 requires the attorney for the prosecution to \u201cserve on the defendant child responder or alleged offender and the attorney for the defendant within a reasonable time,\u201d the State\u2019s intention to introduce a statement and the audio recording of the statement was served only on counsel, not Mr. J.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">After counsel for Ms. B. stated that she had the same argument, the court noted that both parties had been present in court for a status conference two weeks earlier, where \u201c[w]e had a great long discussion about this very matter.\u201d The court stated: \u201cI find zero, and I mean zero prejudice to either of these parties as a result of that failure. Their counsel were notified. We had an open court proceeding.... The notice wouldn\u2019t have told them anything they didn\u2019t already know. The motion is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The hearing then proceeded. The audio tape was played for the court, and the official transcript of JJ.\u2019s statement was admitted as an exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Ms. B. asserts that she was prejudiced because she \u201cnever waived her right to proper CP \u00a7 11-304 notice at the October 7, 2015 adjudicatory hearing,\u201d and \u201c[h]ad the court not granted [the Department\u2019s] postponement of the adjudication for not timely discovering their counsel\u2019s conflict of interest,\u201d the Department \u201cwould not have been in compliance with CP 11-304 and the request to use the out of court statement of the child would have been denied.\u201d She argues that the Department\u2019s \u201cuntimely discovery of a conflict to negate the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>provisions of CP \u00a7 11-304 is not what the legislature intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Ms. B.\u2019s argument is not persuasive. To warrant reversal in a civil case, an appellant must show both error and prejudice. <em>See Barksdale v. Wilkowsky, </em>419 Md. 649, 660, 20 A.3d 765 (2011) (\u201c[T]he burden to show error in civil cases is on the appealing party to show that an error caused prejudice.\u201d); <em>Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007) (\u201cPrejudice can be demonstrated by showing that the error was likely to have affected the verdict below; an error that does not affect the outcome of the case is harmless error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Here, although the statute requires notice of the statement within a reasonable time before the CP \u00a7 11-304 proceeding, Ms. B. was provided with notice well in advance of the proceeding, and the circuit court properly found that any technical failure to comply with the notice required did not prejudice Ms. B. Ms. B. states no claim for relief in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">DNA Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Ms. B. next argues that the court erred in failing \u201cto compel discovery concerning DNA evidence.\u201d Specifically, she asserts that the court erred in failing to compel the Department to produce DNA evidence prior to the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">At the November 30, 2015, CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, Mr. J.\u2019s counsel objected to the hearing taking place, stating that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>was \u201cpremature\u201d because they were waiting for the results of the DNA analysis. Counsel asserted that Trooper Hale had been subpoenaed \u201cdue to her involvement in the investigation,\u201d stating that she \u201cmight perhaps be able to tell us what the status is of the results, if there were any preliminary results.\u201d Counsel for Ms. B. \u201cnote[d] the same objection,\u201d stating that the DNA results would be dispositive because \u201cif they came back positive, then there would be no need for this hearing. If they came back negative, I believe that would be further support for the non-admissibility of the statements.\u201d The court stated that the DNA was not germane to the hearing, \u201c[w]hich goes solely to the procedural issue of whether or the not the statement\u2014the requirements for admissibility have been met.\u201d Noting that \u201cwe are working on a very statutorily mandated timeframe for these CINA cases,\u201d and \u201c[t]he absence of DNA doesn\u2019t necessarily disprove abuse,\u201d the court overruled the objection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Ms. B.\u2019s Discovery Request Was Not Applicable to CP \u00a7 11-304 Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Finally, Ms. B. asserts that the court \u201cseemed to have no problem using the CINA timeframes as a sword against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>parents in their pursuit of a fair trial but ignored them for less important reasons such as potential conflicts.\u201d Ms. B. is wrong on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Ms. B. sets forth the rules relating to discovery and discovery violations in juvenile cases, the statute regarding time limits for the completion of joint investigations in child sexual abuse cases, and cites case law regarding constructive possession of records. She does not explain, however, how any of this is relevant to a CP \u00a7 11-304 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">As previously explained, the court in a CP \u00a7 11-304 proceeding is required to apply 13 statutory factors to make a determination whether a child\u2019s out-of-court statement has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. The court properly applied the factors, and found that the statement did possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Under the facts of this case, DNA test results were not relevant to whether J.J.\u2019s prior out-of-court statements to Ms. Gattis was sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The circuit court did not err in denying the request for DNA evidence prior to the CP \u00a7 11-304 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Quashed Subpoena</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Mr. J. contends that \u201cthe court erred by quashing the subpoena for Trooper Hale.\u201d Although he now states that he could have examined Trooper Hale about her observation of JJ.\u2019s demeanor, he did not make this argument below, and therefore, it is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 640, 598 A.2d 187 (1991) (argument not made to the trial court is not properly before the appellate court); <em>Leake v. Johnson, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 406, 40 A.3d 1127 (2012) (\u201cOrdinarily, an appellate court will not decide an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u2018unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>General Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 362, 879 A.2d 1049 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Mr. J.\u2019s argument below was that he wanted Trooper Hale to testify regarding preliminary results of DNA testing. The court, after concluding that the DNA evidence was not relevant to the CP \u00a7 11-304 proceedings, stated that Trooper Hale\u2019s testimony regarding the issue would not be helpful, and therefore, \u201cthe motion for the subpoena is quashed.\u201d As indicated, we agree that the DNA evidence was not relevant to the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in quashing the subpoena for Trooper Hale to testify at the hearing about the preliminary DNA results.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Examination of J.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">CP \u00a7 ll-304(g) provides that, in determining whether a child\u2019s out-of-court statement had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, the court \u201cshall examine the child victim,\u201d except in certain circumstances, including where \u201cthe court determines that an audio or visual recording of the child victim\u2019s statement makes an examination of the child victim unnecessary.\u201d CP \u00a7 11\u2014304(g)(l)(ii). Here, the circuit court decided not to interview J.J., stating \u201cthat the audio recording of the child makes an examination of the child victim unnecessary in this case. I don\u2019t think it would add to my ability to determine whether that statement made back [in August] in light of the questioning had particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Ms. B. contends that the court\u2019s failure to interview J.J. in person was \u201cclearly an error and violation of CP \u00a7 11-304.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">As the Department notes, Ms. B.\u2019s assertion \u201cis in direct conflict with the plain terms of the statute.\u201d The statute provides that if, as here, an audio recording of a child\u2019s statement exists, the court is not required to conduct an in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>chambers examination. Ms. B.\u2019s contention in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Cross-Examination of Department\u2019s Social Worker</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Ms. B. asserts that the court erred in denying her the right to cross-examine the Department\u2019s social worker, Ms. Gattis, regarding J.J.\u2019s statements, listing four specific occasions. The Department and the children contend that the court properly sustained the objections because the area of questioning went to the weight to be given the statement, not its admissibility pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-304, and the proper forum to impeach J.J.\u2019s statement was the adjudication hearing, at which time appellants were able to cross-examine Ms. Gattis.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201cControl over the scope of cross-examination has traditionally been left to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>B.H. v. Anne Arundel Cty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>209 Md.App. 206, 221, 58 A.3d 533 (2012) (quoting <em>Comm\u2019n on Med. Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 422, 435 A.2d 747 (1981)). Trial judges have \u201c \u2018wide latitude ... to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues ... or interrogation that is ... only marginally relevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990) (quoting <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)). We generally do not disturb a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, unless there has been an abuse of the court\u2019s broad discretion. <em>Churchfield v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 668, 682, 769 A.2d 313, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 536, 774 A.2d 409 (2001). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 552, 39 A.3d 105 (quoting <em>Brass Metal Prods. v. E-J Enters., </em>189 Md.App. 310, 364, 984 A.2d 361 (2009)), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 306, 55 A.3d 908 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Here, at the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, counsel for Ms. B. was permitted to cross-examine Ms. Gattis. We will address, in turn, each of the four instances in which she alleges that the court improperly restricted cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Ms. B. first contends that she \u201cwas not permitted to question [Ms. Gattis] about prior inconsistent statements made by [J.J.] to other medical professionals.\u201d She asserts that these prior inconsistent statements went to J.J.\u2019s \u201ctrustworthiness and [were] required to be considered by the trial court when deciding whether to admit [her] audio taped hearsay statement to the social worker.\u201d At the hearing, counsel for Ms. B. asked Ms. Gattis about the report of Dr. Jennifer Wehberg, the doctor who had conducted a second SAFE examination on J.J., and to whom J.J. had given another statement. Counsel noted that she was referring to Dr. Wehberg\u2019s report because JJ.\u2019s statement to Dr. Weh-berg was a \u201cslightly different version.\u201d The Department objected, stating that the proceeding was to assess the admissibility of J.J.\u2019s statement to Ms. Gattis, and Ms. B. was seeking to introduce other alleged inconsistent statements for impeachment purposes, which was appropriate for the CINA adjudication proceeding, not \u201cthe 11-304 analysis.\u201d When the court asked counsel for Ms. B. how these other statements would be relevant to the \u00a7 11-304 factors, counsel stated that they were relevant to the factors of \u201c[t]he inner consistency and coherence of the statement\u201d and the \u201c[t]he timing of the statement.\u201d The court disagreed and sustained the Department\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">On appeal, Ms. B., for good reason, does not argue that the statements to another doctor were relevant to the \u201cinner consistency\u201d of J.J.\u2019s statement to Ms. Gattis or the timing of the statement, Rather, she merely states, without explanation, that this other statement went to J.J.\u2019s trustworthiness. We are not persuaded, and we perceive no abuse of discretion by the circuit court in precluding cross-examination in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The second area in which Ms. B. asserts that the court improperly denied cross-examination involved \u201cprior unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse.\u201d In particular, counsel for Ms. B. questioned Ms. Gattis about a 2014 sexual abuse allegation made by J.J. against Mr. J. After Ms. Gattis testified, based on her reading of a document, that J.J. previously \u201cdisclosed that her father instructed her to lay on the bed, and then he licked her yorkie,\u201d referring to her vagina, the Department objected to the relevance of this line of questioning. Counsel for Ms. B. stated that it was relevant to the factor of age appropriateness, stating: \u201c[I]t talks about the appropriateness of the terminology of the statement to the child victim\u2019s age, whether the child victim\u2019s young age makes it unlikely that the child victim fabricated the statements that represents a graphic detail account beyond the child victim\u2019s expected knowledge and experience.\u201d Counsel also stated that it went to \u201cher truthfulness that there were two prior allegations against Dad which were unsubstantiated.\u201d The court stated that \u201c\u201cthe real question is whether or not this interview was conducted appropriately, and there is guarantees of trustworthiness in light of the questioning and responses in this interview,\u201d and it sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Ms. B. contends that testimony about prior allegations of sexual abuse that the Department found unsubstantiated \u201cgoes generally to the child\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whether the Department found corroboration of her prior allegations, however, does not bear on the issue presented at the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, i.e., whether J.J.\u2019s statements on August 30, 2015, had guarantees of trustworthiness. To make that determination, the circuit court properly looked, pursuant to the statute, to the circumstances surrounding the giving of that statement and the content of the statement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Ms. B.\u2019s third assertion of error involves counsel s question whether Ms. Gattis had \u201cany discussions with [J.J.] after August 30th about anything of a sexual nature.\u201d Ms. Gattis responded in the affirmative, and the court sustained the Department\u2019s objection. Ms. B. asserts that this testimony was required to assess the appropriateness of the terminology of the statement to J.J.\u2019s age, or whether the statement represented a graphic detailed account beyond the child victim\u2019s experience and knowledge. It is unclear to us how discussions <em>after </em>August 30, the date the statement was made, would be relevant to the trustworthiness of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Ms. B.\u2019s final contention involves counsel\u2019s attempt to cross-examine Ms. Gattis regarding J.J.\u2019s prior statement to an officer at the Fruitland Police Department before she was taken to the emergency room. The Department again objected on the ground that this was an attempt to use extraneous statements to impeach the statement, which would be relevant at the adjudicatory proceeding, but not at the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing. The court sustained the objection. Ms. B. asserts that this ruling was erroneous because the evidence \u201cwould have shown additional inconsistent statements made by [J.J.] to the\u201d police. As with the statement to Dr. Wehberg, J.J.\u2019s statement to police was not relevant to the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing. The circuit court did not err in sustaining the objection to this question. Rather, it properly exercised its discretion in controlling the scope of cross-examination during the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"pAqnp\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">CINA Adjudication</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Mr. J. and Ms. B. contend that the court\u2019s CINA finding was clearly erroneous, for several reasons. They both argue that the court erred in concluding that Mr. J. had sexually abused J.J., asserting that J.J.\u2019s statements were unreliable and insufficient to sustain a CINA finding. Ms. B. further argues that the court erred in finding that she was unable to give proper care and attention to J.J., suggesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that the position she took at the hearing, that it was not clear that J.J. was abused by her father, was supported by the evidence. Ms. B. asserts that, because she no longer was incarcerated at the time of the disposition hearing, wanted the children returned to her, had not abused or neglected them, and was willing to abide by Department recommendations, the court should not have \u201ctaken the drastic measure of removing both of the children from her care and committing them to\u201d the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The Department and the children contend that the court properly exercised its discretion in finding that the children were CINA. They note that the court found that Mr. J. sexually abused J.J., which created a substantial risk of harm to both J.J. and D.J., and the court also considered Mr. J.\u2019s and Ms. B.\u2019s \u201clong histories of neglect,\u201d which provided an \u201cample evidentiary basis\u201d to declare the children CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Allegations in support of a CINA petition must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>In re Nathaniel A., </em>160 Md.App. 581, 595, 864 A.2d 1066, <em>cert. denied, </em>386 Md. 181, 872 A.2d 47 (2005); Md. Code (2011 Supp.) \u00a7 3-817(c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). When this Court reviews a CINA finding, we assess whether the circuit court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court applied the correct legal standards. <em>In re Shirley B., </em>419 Md. 1, 18, 18 A.3d 40 (2011). \u201c[W]hen the appellate court views the ultimate conclusion of the [circuit court] founded upon sound legal principles and based upon factual findings that are not clearly erroneous, the [circuit court\u2019s] decision should be disturbed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030 (2003) (emphasis added). A decision will be reversed for an abuse of discretion only if it is \u201c \u2018well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 819 A.2d 1030 (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>As indicated, a child is determined to be a CINA upon a finding by the court that the child \u201cis in need of judicial intervention because he or she has been abused or neglected, and whose parents or guardian either cannot or will not adequately care for the child.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-801(f). Abuse includes \u201c[p]hysical or mental injury of a child under circumstances that indicate that the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or is at substantial risk of being harmed,\u201d including sexual abuse. CJP \u00a7 3-801(b)(2). Neglect is defined as failure to \u201cgive proper attention to a child,\u201d placing the child at \u201csubstantial risk of harm.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-801(s). In evaluating whether such a risk exists, the court has \u201ca right\u2014and indeed a duty\u2014to look at the track record, the past, of [a parent] in order to predict what her future treatment of the child may be.\u201d <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 735, 614 A.2d 999 (1992), <em>cert. </em>denied, 329 Md. 480, 620 A.2d 350 (1993). That track record includes evidence that the parent has neglected the child\u2019s sibling. <em>See William B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 77, 533 A.2d 16 (1987) (\u201cThe parents\u2019 ability to care for the needs of one child is probative of their ability to care for other children in the family.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 719, 537 A.2d 272 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Here, the court found that Mr. J. abused J.J. by \u201crubb[ing] his penis on her body and ha[ving] her suck his penis.\u201d It also found that both parents had \u201cextensive histories of being unable to properly care for the children.\u201d As set forth in detail, <em>supra, </em>these findings were supported by the evidence presented. The court did not err in finding the children to be CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"A-W\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-1\">Suspension of Mr. J.\u2019s Visitation</p>\n<p id=\"b368-2\">Mr. J. next challenges the court\u2019s order denying him all visitation with the children. He contends that this order, which he asserts was based on the Department\u2019s complaints about his conduct during visits, was \u201coverly sweeping, and thus it was an abuse of discretion.\u201d In support, Mr. J. argues that the finding that he sexually abused J.J. \u201cin and of itself does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>justify the complete denial of contact, particularly\u201d with respect to D.J., and he \u201cshould have been permitted to have some form of visitation\u2014supervised visits, telephone calls, or Skype visits\u2014with at least [D.J.], if not both children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">During oral argument, counsel for the parties agreed that, at that time, Mr. J.\u2019s visitation with D.J. had resumed, and the issue of visitation with D.J., is moot. We agree. <em>See Frazier v. Castle Ford, Ltd., </em>430 Md. 144, 162, 59 A.3d 1016 (2013) (an issue \u201cis moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy that the court can provide\u201d). <em>See also In re Prince S., </em>355 Md. 227, 230, 734 A.2d 210 (1999) (holding that appeal was moot where \u201c[tjhere is no effective relief that this Court could provide to appellant, even if we were to agree with her position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">With respect to J. J., however, Mr. J. argues that the issue is not moot because Mr. J.\u2019s visitation is still suspended. We will consider this issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In determining visitation, the trial court is required to consider the best interests of the child, and therefore, visitation may be restricted or denied when the child\u2019s health or welfare is threatened. <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 566-67, 819 A.2d 1030. \u201cWhere the child has been declared a child in need of assistance because of abuse or neglect, the trial court is constrained further by the requirements of\u2019 Md. Code (2015 Supp.) \u00a7 9-101 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). <em>In re Billy W., </em>387 Md. 405, 447, 875 A.2d 734 (2005). This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(a) <em>Determination by </em>court.\u2014In any custody or visitation proceeding, if the court has reasonable grounds to believe that a child has been abused or neglected by a party to the proceeding, the court shall determine whether abuse or neglect is likely to occur if custody or visitation rights are granted to the party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">(b) <em>Specific finding </em>required.\u2014Unless the court specifically finds that there is no likelihood of further child abuse or neglect by the party, the court shall deny custody or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>visitation rights to that party, except that the court may approve a supervised visitation arrangement that assures the safety and the physiological, psychological, and emotional well-being of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">FL \u00a7 9-101. We review a circuit court decision on visitation for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re: Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 704, 782 A.2d 332 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Here, the court had before it testimony indicating that J.J. had been sexually abused by Mr. J., and the court did not specifically find that \u201cthere was no likelihood of further abuse.\u201d There was evidence that J.J. did not want to have contact with Mr. J., and J.J.\u2019s trauma therapist was \u201csupportive\u201d of this request. Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that Mr. J. not have visitation with J.J.</p>\n<p id=\"AkH\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Extension of Shelter Care</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Ms. B. asserts that the court violated the provisions of the Maryland Rules by extending shelter care and continuing to postpone adjudication beyond the time limits proscribed by those rules. The Department contends that Mr. J. and Ms. B. waived the timeframes provided in the rules, and the court properly exercised its broad discretion to keep the children safe during the review of the \u201cserious abuse allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Shelter Care</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Maryland Code (2015 Supp.) \u00a7 3\u2014815(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides that, after a child is placed in shelter care, the court may continue shelter care beyond emergency shelter care only if the court finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">(1) Return of the child to the child\u2019s home is contrary to the safety and welfare of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(2)(i) Removal of the child from the child\u2019s home is necessary due to an alleged emergency situation and in order to provide for the safety of the child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(ii) Reasonable efforts were made but were unsuccessful in preventing or eliminating the need for removal of the child from the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Maryland Rule 11-112(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">1. Finding. Detention or shelter care may not be continued beyond emergency detention or shelter care unless after a hearing the court finds that one or more of the circumstances stated in Section 3\u2014815(b) of the Courts Article exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">2. Maximum Period of Detention or Shelter Care. Continued detention or shelter care pending the adjudicatory or waiver hearing may not be ordered for a period of more than thirty days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Maryland Rule 11-114(a) and (b) provide, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">Adjudicatory hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">a. Requirement. After a juvenile petition has been filed ... the court shall hold an adjudicatory hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-12\">b. Scheduling of hearing. 1. Adjudicatory hearing. An adjudicatory hearing shall be held within sixty days after the juvenile petition is served on the respondent .... However, upon motion made on the record within these time limits by the petitioner or the respondent, the administrative judge of the county or a judge designated by him, for extraordinary cause shown, may extend the time within which the adjudicatory hearing may be held. The judge shall state on the record the cause which requires an extension and specify the number of days of the extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-13\">2. Prehearing ... shelter care. If the respondent is in ... shelter care, the adjudicatory hearing shall be held within thirty days from the date on which the court ordered continued detention or shelter care. If an adjudicatory hearing is not held within thirty days, the respondent shall be released on the conditions imposed by the court pending an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>adjudicatory hearing which hearing shall be held within the time limits set forth in subsection 1 of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Here, shelter care was granted on September 2, 2015, by agreement of the parties. The parents consented to an extension of shelter care to obtain discovery, and the adjudicatory hearing was set for October 7, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">On October 7, 2015, the Department\u2019s counsel informed the court that she had a conflict because she had discovered that Mr. J. was a former client, and Mr. J. declined to proceed with her as counsel for the Department. Both Mr. J. and Ms. B. agreed to continue shelter care until the adjudicatory hearing. The court found extraordinary circumstances to postpone the adjudicatory hearing until November 18, 2015, and it continued shelter care for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">On October 28, 2015, the scheduled date for the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing, Mr. J.\u2019s new attorney disclosed a conflict, stating that his daughter was one of J.J.\u2019s teachers. Although Mr. J. stated that he did not have an issue with his attorney\u2019s representation of him, counsel for Ms. B. proffered that, although the case could move forward, it would be \u201cmore fair\u201d to Mr. J. if he had the same counsel represent him throughout the CP \u00a7 11-304 and adjudication proceedings. The court stated that Mr. J.\u2019s interests would be best served if he had the \u201csame lawyer handle the motion as handles the trial,\u201d and counsel for the parents indicated that, although the parents were upset about the delay, there did not seem to be another solution. The court noted that the time deadline for the adjudicatory hearing had already been waived by the parents, and it further found extraordinary cause to continue the case. The court additionally found \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d to continue the children in shelter care, stating that it was \u201ccontrary to their welfare to return home at this time for the same reasons set out in the previous Shelter Care Order.\u201d The court then scheduled the CP \u00a7 11-304 hearing for November 30, 2015, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and the adjudication hearing for December 16, 2015. The court also scheduled a status conference for November 18, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">At the status conference, Ms. B., who was still incarcerated, but \u201cadamant\u201d that she was going to be released \u201con Friday,\u201d was represented by counsel, who requested that the children be returned to Ms. B.\u2019s care. Both parents objected to continued shelter care, but the court continued the shelter care order until the scheduled adjudicatory hearing in December.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Although Ms, B. contends on appeal that the court erred in continuing \u201cshelter care beyond the 30 day limit,\u201d the record reflects that Ms. B. consented to postponements of the adjudicatory hearing, and the continuation of shelter care until that time, on several occasions. It was not until the November 18, 2015, status conference, after the adjudicatory hearing had already been moved to December 16, 2015, and while Ms. B. still was in jail, that she objected to continued shelter care for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">We are inclined to agree with the Department that Ms. B., by consenting to continued shelter care, waived the right to insist on the time requirements for placement in shelter care, and that the court properly exercised its discretion to keep the children in shelter care for their own safety. We need not, however, address Ms. B.\u2019s contention regarding the propriety of the continuation of placement in shelter care because the issue has been rendered moot by the court\u2019s subsequent order finding the children to be CI\u00d1A and committing them to the care of the Department for placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">As indicated, an issue, \u201cis moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy that the court can provide.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>430 Md. at 162, 59 A.3d 1016, Here, even if, arguendo, we determined that the court erred in extending the children\u2019s placement in shelter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>care, the Department would still retain custody of the children pursuant to the court\u2019s findings at the disposition hearing. Thus, there is no relief that this Court can provide to Ms. B. The issue raised regarding violation of the time requirements for shelter care is moot, and we will not address it.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WI-COMICO COUNTY AFFIRMED.
