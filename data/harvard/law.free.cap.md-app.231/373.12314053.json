This ancient metaphor, conceived originally as a mock example used to discredit medieval scholastic philosophy, but deployed here with non-satirical intent, is an apt segue into this opinion. Based on the parties\u2019 positions regarding the flagship question in the present case, we imagine the answer Appellants would give to the philosophical query would be \u201cone,\u201d while Appel-lees would respond likely with \u201ca lot more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Appellees, Eugene B. Casey Foundation (Casey) and Frederick County, Maryland (the County), entered into a Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement (DRRA) in October 2014, following its approval by the Board of County Commissioners for Frederick County (BOCC), to facilitate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>development of Casey\u2019s 634 acre property in Frederick County. Concurrent with the approval and execution of the DRRA, the BOCC approved Casey\u2019s rezoning application, changing the zoning of the property from agricultural to planned unit development (PUD).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Appellants, led by Cleanwater Linganore, Inc. (CLI),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal these BOCC actions. CLI argues first that the DRRA includes unlawfully broad language that purports to \u201cfreeze\u201d local laws beyond those authorized by Md. Code, Land Use Art. (LU), \u00a7 7-304 (2012, 2016 Supp.), which describes the field as \u201cthe local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement.\u201d Second, CLI contends that the BOCC approved erroneously Casey\u2019s rezoning application because it failed to make certain of the supporting factual findings required for the PUD zone by the Frederick County Code (FCC). We conclude that the General Assembly intended a broader interpretation of the DRRA Act\u2019s \u201cfreeze\u201d provision than CLI imagines and that the BOCC made all required factual findings to justify granting the rezoning. Accordingly, we hold that the BOCC\u2019s approval, and the County\u2019s execution, of the DRRA, and the BOCC\u2019s grant of the rezoning, are supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Facts and Legal Proceedings<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Casey property consists of 634 acres located in Frederick County\u2019s New Market Planning Region (NMPR). From 1972 to 2008, the property was zoned for Planned Unit Development (PUD), designated for low density residential (LDR) development, and located in a community growth area (CGA). In 2008, the then-members of the BOCC downzoned much of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the NMPR, including the Casey property, to the Agricultural Zoning District. Additionally, it removed the Casey property\u2019s CGA status as well as its recommended LDR designation on the County\u2019s Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map, replacing the latter with a designation for agricultural land use.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In 2012, as a part of a Comprehensive Planning and Zoning Review, a newly-constituted BOCC restored the Casey property\u2019s CGA status and amended the Land Use Map to reinstate its recommended LDR designation. Because a PUD is a floating zone for which no individual rezoning application had been filed or prosecuted yet to the degree required by the zoning ordinance, the BOCC could not approve at that time Casey\u2019s desired rezoning during its Comprehensive Plan and rezoning process. Accordingly, Casey submitted a piecemeal rezoning application for the PUD zone, pursuant to FCC \u00a7\u00a7 1-19-3.110, Zoning Map Amendments, and 1-19-10.500, Planned Development Districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The County Planning Commission reviewed Casey\u2019s rezoning application and recommended approval to the BOCC, The BOCC considered the application at a public hearing on 15 July 2014. The Planning Staff Report (Staff Report) opined that, in the staffs view, the application conformed to all applicable legal standards. Casey presented several expert witnesses who testified to the rezoning application\u2019s consistency with the Staff Report and the Comprehensive Plan. During the hearing, Appellants\u2019 counsel argued that the rezoning application relied on land use maps adopted improperly and that the BOCC failed to contemplate adequately population projections. The BOCC rejected these arguments and approved the rezoning by Ordinance No. 14-20-675 on 23 October 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As a companion matter, Casey petitioned the BOCC, anticipating hoped-for favorable action on its rezoning application, for the negotiation of a DRRA between itself and Frederick County. DRRAs generally are bargained-for agreements between property owners/developers and local jurisdictions that, among other things, provide for \u201cfreezing,\u201d as of the date of the agreement, the application of certain extant local laws and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>regulations during a fixed period of time coinciding typically with the estimated build-out of the proposed development, as long as the period does not exceed the statutory \u201ccap.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Obtaining forbearance of the application of subsequent changes in relevant local laws provides certainty and stability to developers, whose projects may take many years to complete and/or sell-off or lease. Local governments derive, in return, negotiated greater public benefits than may be attained through typical governmental exactions or conditions of development approvals. To determine whether to approve the Casey-County DRRA, the BOCC held a public hearing on 21 August 2014. Casey presented expert testimony in support of the DRRA. The Board voted to approve of the DRRA, which was executed on 23 October 2014 and recorded in the County land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">CLI petitioned the Circuit Court for Frederick County for judicial review of the BOCC\u2019s approval, and the County\u2019s execution, of the DRRA and the rezoning. Finding both actions legal and supported by substantial evidence in the record, the court affirmed the actions on 9 October 2015.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CLI appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Appellants present essentially two questions for appellate review:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>1. Did the Casey DRRA freeze a broader scope of local laws than permitted legally, thereby rendering the BOCC\u2019s approval and the County\u2019s execution unlawful in whole or in part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">2. Did the BOCC fail to make certain factual findings required to rezone lawfully the Casey property for the PUD zone?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">When reviewing the piecemeal zoning decision of a local zoning body, \u201c[o]ur role is \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grasslands Plantation, Inc. v.

Regarding the BOCC\u2019s rezoning of the Casey property, CLI argues that the BOCC failed to make requisite factual findings regarding design and building siting, compatibility with neighboring land use and plans, and population growth. Appellee Casey answers, regarding the DRRA, that: State and Frederick County laws permit DRRAs to freeze the range of local laws provided in the Casey DRRA; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>parties to a DRRA may negotiate which local laws governing \u201cuse, density, or intensity\u201d will be frozen; and, execution of the DRRA, in light of recent amendments to implicated County laws, does not operate to usurp County police powers as reflected in the amended laws. On the rezoning question, Casey contends that the BOCC made all of the factual findings necessary to rezone the Casey property.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">I. The BOCC approved, and the County executed, the Casey DRRA based on substantial evidence and without legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A. The statutory interpretation question regarding the DRRA\u2019s freeze provision is ripe for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">CLI contends that its statutory interpretation contention <em>vis-a-vis </em>the scope of the \u201cfreeze\u201d provision of the DRRA is ripe for judicial review because the County amended the substantive requirements, since the execution of the DRRA, of several local laws implicated by the freeze provision in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">A controversy is ripe when there are interested parties asserting adverse claims <em>upon a state of facts which must have accrued </em>wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded. The declaratory judgment process is not available to decide purely theoretical questions or questions that may never arise, or questions which have become moot, or merely abstract questions. Nor should it be employed where a declaration would not serve a useful purpose or terminate a controversy. To address issues which are non-justiciable because they are not ripe would place courts in the position of rendering purely advisory opinions, a long forbidden practice in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Hickory Point P\u2019ship v. Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>316 Md. 118, 129-30, 557 A.2d 626 (1989) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">As discussed in greater depth <em>infra, </em>the Casey-County DRRA purported to freeze a variety of specific Frederick County local ordinances or fields of regulation, i.e., laws, rules, regulations, and policies related to \u201cdevelopment, subdivision, zoning, comprehensive planning, moderately priced dwelling units, growth management, impact fees, water, sewer, storm-water management, environmental protection, land planning and design, adequate public facilities laws[,] and architecture.\u201d Casey DRRA, Art. VIII \u00a7 8.I.B. Because, since the Casey DRRA\u2019s execution, the County amended, among other laws, its ordinance regulating developments near waterbodies, CLI argues that its challenge to the scope of the freeze provision is ripe for judicial review:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">Frederick County has amended a number of County laws that are directly implicated by the DRRA\u2019s freeze provision, including an amendment to the County\u2019s Waterbody law limiting imper[v]ious development within the waterbody buffers. ... [T]he Waterbody amendments would be direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ly applicable to the impervious structures allowed on the Casey property, which is heavily traversed by waterbodies. Several tributaries to Linganore Creek and Lake Linganore originate or flow through the Casey Property. Lake Linga-nore provides drinking water to Frederick County and Frederick City Residents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">FCC \u00a7 1-19-9.400, amended in 2015, mandates' waterbody buffer requirements for \u201c[a] parcel, lot, or tract of land submitted to Frederick County for subdivision or resubdivision review and approval,\u201d and applies \u201cto applications for subdivision or resubdivision approved after November 10, 2013.\u201d The ordinance regulates generally the development activities that may transpire permissibly in proximity to a waterbody, and the amended portion, \u00a7 1-19-9.400(D), governs specifically the construction of \u201cbuildings, structures, or impervious surfaces\u201d and other \u201cactivities requiring clearing or grading over 5,000 square feet\u201d in waterbody buffers. Home to \u201cstream corridors\u201d and \u201cstream valleys designated as Natural Resources,\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 4, 6, the Casey property contains \u201c[s]everal tributaries to Linganore Creek / Lake Linganore [that] originate or flow through the <em>Casey Foundation </em>... property].\u201d Envirens Inc., Assessment op Potential Occurrence\u2014Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species 4 (Aug. 20, 2014). The presence of streams and tributaries on the property catalyzes the need for Casey to consider and meet the requirements of FCC \u00a7 1-19-9.400 as amended, unless the DRRA in this case \u201cfreezes\u201d this area of regulation as of the effective date of the DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We agree with CLI that its challenge to the scope of the freeze provision of the Casey DRRA is ripe for review. The amendment of the aforementioned local provision constitutes an accrued state of facts, beyond the theoretical, that bears directly on the justiciable question of whether the DRRA froze properly a wide range of laws, implicating, at a minimum, the ordinance regulating developments near waterbodies that was amended subsequent to the execution of the DRRA and would otherwise apply to development of the Casey property.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>B. The DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history and purpose suggest an intent to freeze a broader range of local laws than merely the local zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Each side posits facially reasonable arguments regarding interpretation of the scope of \u201clocal laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to [a DRRA].\u201d LU \u00a7 7-804. Appellants read \u201cuse,\u201d \u201cdensity,\u201d and \u201cintensity\u201d as zoning terms of art (not science) and advocate a narrow interpretation that limits a DRRA\u2019s freeze provision to the local zoning ordinance. Appellees Casey and the County urge, on the other hand, a broader reading that encompasses the several regulatory domains listed in its DRRA: \u201c[cjontrary to Appellants\u2019 assertions, the laws, rules, regulations, and policies \u2018frozen\u2019 in \u00a7 8.1.B of the Casey DRRA do affect the use, density[,] or intensity of the project. For example, subdivision regulations necessarily affect the density of a development because platting and other requirements determine the number of lots that can be created on any given parcel. The same is true for stormwater regulations, since these requirements can affect where the development is ultimately located.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">LU \u00a7 7-304 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement shall be the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies in force at the time the parties execute the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(b) If the local jurisdiction determines that compliance with local laws, rules, regulations, and policies enacted or adopted after the effective date of an agreement is essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare, an agreement may not prevent a local government from requiring a person to comply with those local laws, rules, regulations, and policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Article VIII \u00a7 8.1 of the Casey-County DRRA identifies the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies subject to its freeze provision as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">8.1 <em>Effect of Agreement</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">B.

The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.

If the language of the statute is ambiguous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>we resolve the ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, considering the legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose. We consider both the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute and how that language relates to the overall meaning, setting, and purpose of the act.

State, </em>395 Md. 213, 224, 909 A.2d 1020, 1026 (2006)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">We conclude to be ambiguous on its face the intended scope of \u201cthe local laws, rules, regulations, and policies\u201d that \u201cgovern[] the use, density, or intensity\u201d of real property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cGovern,\u201d according to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, means \u201cto control a point in issue.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>810 (10th ed. 2014). Zoning laws control unmistakably the use, density, or intensity of real property, but laws regulating, for example, subdivision, architecture, public utility requirements, and environmental protection may do so as well. Somewhat more attenuated in their potential for \u201ccontrol\u201d of \u201cuse, density, or intensity\u201d are impact fees and stormwater management requirements. We turn, therefore, to the legislative history and purpose of the DRRA Act to seek aid in pursuit of identifying the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>1. The DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history indicates that the Maryland General Assembly contemplated that DRRAs may freeze a broader range of local laws than just zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Our review of the DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history unearthed two significant documents. First, the Fiscal Note for HB 700, the original bill that became the Act in 1995, discussed some of the types of local laws implicated by the DRRA in dispute here. With specific reference to local revenues, the Fiscal Note stated that \u201c[a] local jurisdiction opting to enact such an [implementing] ordinance and enter into agreements could be affected to the extent that during the period of an agreement it could not effect changes in impact fees, permit fees, water and sewer hookup fees, etc. applicable to development. Thus, there could be a loss in revenues, of an indeterminate amount, to the local governments.\u201d Md. Gen. Assemb. Dep\u2019t of Fiscal Servs., Fiscal Note, H.B. 700, at 1 (1995) (emphasis added). Moreover, regarding local expenditures, \u201c[t]he Department of Fiscal Services points out that increases in the costs of paving, storm drains, water and sewer hookups, etc. would have to be absorbed by the local jurisdiction unless an agreement accounts for cost increases otherwise (depending on applicable development policies).\u201d Fiscal Note at 2 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee Floor Report for HB 700 stated, in reference to the bill\u2019s local fiscal impact, \u201c[r]evenues may decrease by an indeterminate amount due to the inability of a local jurisdiction to make changes to development fees, for example, impact fees, permit fees, water and sewer hookup fees, during the period of an agreement.\u201d S. Econ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>and Envtl, Affairs Comm,, Floor Report, H.B. 700, at 2 (Md. 1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">These statements demonstrate that the General Assembly was aware of, and contemplated presumably, the DRRA Act\u2019s freeze provision to embrace more than merely zoning ordinances, including something as seemingly attenuated as a variety of fees related to development. The use of \u201cetc.\u201d in both passages from the Fiscal Note, and \u201cfor example\u201d in the Floor Report, suggest that the General Assembly anticipated that the freeze provision would impact fiscally local jurisdictions via the suspended application of increases in existing fees or the creation of new kinds of fees, and even more kinds of laws than fee schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It is patent that local zoning ordinances govern most directly the \u201cuse, intensity, or density\u201d of real property. Subdivision ordinances and regulations, as well as many environmental and public facility or utilities laws (enforced typically during the subdivision process) are to like effect. Costs and fees associated with public facilities impacts, permits, and water and sewer hookups, on the other hand, seem at first glance rather more attenuated from direct governance of a property\u2019s \u201cuse, intensity, or density.\u201d And yet, the DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s contemplated inclusion of them as well as among reachable local laws for purposes of LU \u00a7 7-304(a). Viewing relevant local provisions on a continuum from the most direct governance to the least contemplated by the freeze provision, zoning and subdivision would be located at one end and fees at the other. Assuming these outer limits for purposes of the DRRA in the present case, the freeze provision must contemplate, axiomatically, local laws, rules, regulations, and policies that might fit between these poles. Local provisions related to development, comprehensive planning, moderately-priced dwelling units, growth management, environmental protection, land planning and design, adequate public facilities laws, and architecture govern more clearly \u201cuse, intensity, or density\u201d than do, for example, impact and permit fees. We conclude, therefore, that the Maryland General Assembly intended the DRRA Act\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>freeze provision to contemplate each of the genres of local laws listed in Article VIII \u00a7 8.1 .B of the Casey-County DRRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">2. Restricting the DRRA Act\u2019s freeze provision to only zoning laws would undermine its statutory purpose.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">However fictional the notion of institutional intent may sometimes be, it is fair to say that legislation usually has some objective, goal, or purpose. It seeks to remedy some evil, to advance some interest, to attain some end. If we characterize the search for legislative intent as an effort to seek to discern some general purpose, aim, or policy reflected in the statute, we state the concept more accurately and avoid the fiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\"><em>Kaczorowski v.

In 1993, the Court of Appeals held that a developer\u2019s rights in the development of a property vest only upon a level of visible commencement of lawful construction. <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty., Md. v. Sunrise Dev. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>330 Md. 297, 623 A.2d 1296 (1993). This opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>recognized that local governments may \u201cchange a permissible land use ... very late in the land use approval process. In fact, a change could occur after the issuance of a building permit.\u201d Bill Analysis at 3. The purpose of the DRRA Act, therefore, was to strike a balance between the interests of developers and local governments to \u201csolve the vesting problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The House Commerce and Government Committee explained such a balance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Development agreements can provide benefits for both developers and local governments. For the developer, a development agreement establishes the rules and regulations which will govern the project throughout its construction, and perhaps beyond. For the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Bill Analysis at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">What would achieve best the legislative purpose of balancing a developer\u2019s interest in legal stability against a local government\u2019s interest in certainty and obtaining enhanced public benefits: limiting, for example, the Casey DRRA\u2019s freeze provision to subsequent changes in the zoning code only, as urged by CLI, or allowing it to apply to the expansive list of local provisions in the negotiated DRRA as written? If the DRRA Act only allowed DRRAs to freeze the application of local zoning ordinance provisions, a local government could undermine still the legal and financial stability of an on-going development project by changing the laws related to, for example, development or site plans, subdivision, or planning compliance. Where a developer assumed that its project could be thwarted by a last-minute or mid-stream change to any of these non-zoning laws, it would be less likely to undertake a substantial development at all in a jurisdiction. This, in turn, would frustrate the local government\u2019s interest in obtaining greater public benefits through negotiation of a DRRA\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>We conclude that, like its statutory history, the purpose of the DRRA Act suggests a more expansive reading of the local laws eligible for inclusion in a DRRA\u2019s freeze provision, beyond merely the local zoning ordinance, that includes the local laws and regulations falling into the categories listed in the Casey-County DRRA. Accordingly, the BOCC\u2019s approval (and the County\u2019s execution) of the DRRA, including its expansive and specific freeze enumeration in Article VIII \u00a7 8.1.B, does not expand impermissibly the statutorily-allowed scope of local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing use, density, or intensity beyond that contemplated by LU \u00a7 7-804(a),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">C. The parties to the Casey DRRA did not negotiate impermissibly the freeze provision, nor does the DRRA interfere with local police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Because we find permissible the BOCC\u2019s and the County\u2019s interpretation and application of the DRRA Act\u2019s freeze provision as reflected in the Casey-County DRRA, we reject also CLI\u2019s argument that the parties to the agreement attempted to negotiate the freeze of local laws beyond those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>governing \u201cuse, density, or intensity.\u201d Certainly the Casey-County DRRA freezes a panoply of laws beyond zoning, but the DRRA Act\u2019s legislative history and purpose support a broader interpretation of what provisions govern use, density, or intensity beyond zoning alone. We reject further CLI\u2019s contention that the Casey-County DRRA\u2019s expansive manifestation of the freeze provision interferes with the proper exercise of local police powers. Regardless of the scope of laws a given DRRA freezes, LU \u00a7 7\u2014304(b) allows a local government to enforce any \u201clocal laws, rules, regulations, and policies enacted or adopted after the effective date of an agreement\u201d if compliance with the new laws \u201cis essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare.\u201d Article VIII \u00a7 8.1.C of the Casey DRRA provides exactly for that potentiality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">II. The BOCC\u2019s rezoning decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Appellants argue that the BOCC rezoned the Casey property without making the factual findings required by the Frederick County Code and State law regarding design and building siting, compatibility with neighboring land uses, and population growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A. Zoning Ordinance No. 14-20-675 satisfies FCC \u00a7 1\u201419\u2014 10.500.3(B)\u2019s requirement of a finding that design and building siting accord with the Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In Zoning Ordinance No. 14-20-676, the BOCC set-out its factual findings with respect to the requirements of the FCC. FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(B) requires a finding that \u201c[t]he proposed development design and building siting are in accordance with the County Comprehensive Plan, and any applicable community and corridor plans[.]\u201d CLI argues that the BOCC made no findings relative to this provision, and that, in any event, such factual findings could not possibly be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>because \u201cthe 2010 Comprehensive Plan Map did not contemplate that the Casey Property would be eligible for PUD zoning.\u201d Casey counters that the BOCC made indeed the requisite factual findings regarding the compatibility of its property\u2019s design and building siting with the Comprehensive Plan, albeit scattered throughout the Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">It must be conceded that the BOCC listed no factual findings pursuant to FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(B) on the page of the Rezoning Ordinance where such a heading appears. Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 17. According to Casey, however, a more nuanced reading of the entire Rezoning Ordinance is required because of the overlap of findings required by State and County law. The BOCC, according to Casey, structured intentionally the Ordinance to address FCC \u00a7 1\u201419\u2014 10.500.3(B) in a piecemeal fashion scattered throughout the document under other headings, Casey notes that the Court of Appeals condoned such an approach. <em>Critical Area Comm\u2019n for Chesapeake &amp; Atl. Coastal Bays v. Moreland, LLC, </em>418 Md. 111, 134, 12 A.3d 1223, 1237 (2011) (\u201cWe can discern no statutory or jurisprudential basis for the conclusion that summarizing the evidence in a separate section deprived the Board\u2019s conclusory findings of adequate evidentiary support. Semantically, on this record, to find the organizational structure of the Board\u2019s written decision defective or incomprehensible would be to elevate form over substance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">With respect to design and the siting of buildings, the BOCC described the development as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">The overall plan for the development delineates six distinct residential land bays, a school site, and a commercial site. These areas are located on land with minimal environmental and physical obstructions. The lands outside of these areas include stream corridors, forested land, steep slopes, and floodplains. The concept for development of this property is to allow the existing environmental features of the property to establish the overall layout.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">A proposed arterial road runs continuously through the Site from south to north, connecting the various land bays. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Frontage along this central spine road alternates between development bays and natural open space areas, creating a system of access that intertwines the natural environment and the built environment. A hiking and biking trail along the spine road provides an additional access network between the open space and the development bays and enhances interconnection between them by branching into the open space areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In a subsequent section of the Ordinance entitled \u201cConsistency with the Comprehensive Plan,\u201d the BOCC stated that, because of the Casey property\u2019s LDR designation and location in the Linganore CGA, \u201cit is identified as an area that has been targeted for growth and development and is therefore consistent with the general policy in the Comprehensive Plan that supports the location of growth within growth areas.\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 6. The BOCC found also that rezoning the Casey property to PUD \u201cis consistent with the current County Comprehensive Plan,\u201d and that the proposed development accords with the Plan\u2019s \u201coverall community development principles such as encouraging higher density development, a mix of land uses, providing distinctive design that contributes to a distinctive community character, efficiency of layout relative to public infrastructure, and general accessibility through multiple modes of transport as well as interconnectedness of the transportation network.\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It appears to us that the BOCC made adequate findings supporting a favorable conclusion relative to the factors in FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">B. Zoning Ordinance No. 14-20-675 satisfies FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(C)\u2019s requirement of a finding that the proposed development is compatible with surrounding land uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(C) requires factual findings that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">The proposed development is compatible with existing or anticipated surrounding land uses with regard to size, build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ing scale, intensity, setbacks, and landscaping, or the proposal provides for mitigation of differences in appearance or scale through such means as setbacks, screening, and landscaping; or other design features in accordance with the County Comprehensive Plan, and any applicable community or corridor plans[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">CLI argues that \u201c[wjhile the BOCC makes compatibility findings in connection with land uses that abut the outer perimeter of the Casey Property, it entirely omits any findings in connection with Hall[\u2019]s Choice Farm.\u201d As with the BOCC\u2019s design and siting findings discussed <em>supra, </em>here, the BOCC appears to have addressed appropriately Hall\u2019s Choice Farm elsewhere in the Ordinance. First, the BOCC described the property: \u201c[t]he Site surrounds an existing horse farm, Hall\u2019s Choice Farm, which is a 35 acre sales, breeding, and training facility for Hanoverian horses. This property is not a part of this PUD application, though it is designated Low Density Residential and is part of the growth area.\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 14. Further along in the Ordinance, the BOCC examined the Casey developments\u2019 compatibility with the use of the farm: \u201c[ljandscape buffers between the project and Hall[\u2019]s Choice Farm, the Audubon Property, and the Swanby Property will effectively mitigate potential inconsistencies between the project and the existing uses on those properties.\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">C. Zoning Ordinance No. 14-20-675 includes the requisite finding regarding population growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">CLI maintains that, even if rezoning the Casey property accords with the Comprehensive Plan, the BOCC failed to engage in new population growth studies, necessitated by the fact that the Plan\u2019s \u201cpolicies, visions[,] and goals (not to mention the land use and zoning maps) were predicated upon\u201d now-outdated population projections. In the Rezoning Ordinance, however, the BOCC calculated the population increase expected to result from developing the Casey property, based on 2010 U.S. Census data, finding that \u201c[t]he potential additional population change as a result of the proposed 1,017 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>units equates to 2,746 persons, based on 2.7 persons per household.\u201d Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 15. Speculating that, \u201c[a]s a matter of public policy,\u201d LU \u00a7 4-204(b)(l)(i)\u2019s requirement that a population finding accompany a zoning-changing map amendment must entail more than \u201ca mere mathematical equation devoid of any planning or growth analysis,\u201d CLI asserts that the BOCC \u201cfail[ed] to make a meaningful finding in connection with \u2018population.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">As to the BOCC\u2019s approach to addressing the findings regarding design and the siting of buildings, compatibility with neighboring land uses, and population growth, we must defer to the expertise of the BOCC. \u201cThe scope of judicial review of administrative fact-finding is a narrow and highly deferential one,\u201d and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the BOCC. <em>Trinity Assembly of God of Baltimore City, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty., </em>407 Md. 53, 78, 962 A.2d 404, 418 (2008). Accordingly, for all three instances of allegedly missing or defective findings, we hold that the BOCC had before it substantial evidence upon which it based its findings and ultimate rezoning decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We shall condense and paraphrase CLI's questions for clarity and brevity. In full, CLI presented originally six questions, one of which was withdrawn before the case was heard by this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>A. Is the freeze provision of the DRRA overly broad given the sworn testimony of the County's Expert Planning Director establishing that most of the County laws referenced in the DRRA's \"freeze\u201d provision do not \"govern\u201d use, density!,] or intensity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">B. Is the scope of the freeze provision now ripe for judicial review given Frederick County\u2019s recent amendments to its waterbody law, its MPDU law, and its building, electrical, and plumbing laws, all of which explicitly or implicitly fall within the DRRA's definition of \u201cdevelopment laws\u201d and thereby fall within the \"freeze\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">C. Does a statutory analysis of the DRRA law confirm that the freeze is limited to laws governing use, density!,] or intensity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">D. Is the BOCC\u2019s rezoning action ultra vires and void because the 2012 Land Use Map provides no legal basis for the PUD floating zone application? [Appellants filed a \u201cNotice of Appellants' Withdrawal of Question D\u201d on 11 July 2016.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">E. Is Rezoning Ordinance No. 13-14-642 unsustainable because it lacks any finding that the proposed development design and building site are in accordance with the County Comprehensive Plan under Zoning Ordinance Section 10-19-10.500.3(B)? [CLI intended presumably to refer to Ordinance No. 14-20-675 because Ordinance No. 13-14-642 pertains to an irrelevant property-]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">F. Should the rezoning action be reversed because it is not consistent with the County's Comprehensive Plan?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. CLI advances pre-emptively this argument because, in a 2015 unreported opinion involving a similar appellant and the County as one of the appellees, this Court declined to consider fully, as unripe, the scope of laws frozen by an unrelated DRRA because, at the time of judicial review, no implicated local laws changed since the contested DRRA\u2019s execution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">. CLI points also to amendments in the County's electrical, building, and plumbing codes that became effective after the execution of the Casey DRRA. It is debatable whether these ordinances were frozen under \u00a7 8.1.B of the Agreement or that they govern use, density, or intensity, as that phrase is understood according to our statutory analysis <em>infra. </em>Because amendment of the local ordinance regulating developments near waterbodies implicated clearly several of the regulatory fields embraced by \u00a7 8.l.B of the DRRA (e.g., water, environmental protection, and land planning and design), we need go no further in overcoming the ripeness threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We note in passing that, even if post-Agreement amendments to the building, electrical, and plumbing codes were considered in the analysis of whether the ripeness requirements are satisfied here, these sorts of highly technical codes are amended frequently to conform to evolving national, State, or industry standards, some of which amendments are relatively mundane and others may reflect significant public safety considerations (e.g., requiring sprinklers in dwellings). It is problematic whether the more mundane changes in such codes, which may fall outside the intended scope of the \"freeze\u201d provision in the DRRA enabling statute and/or the Casey Agreement in any event, would satisfy the common law ripeness standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\">. Although the opposing reasonable interpretations advanced by the parties here would be sufficient alone for us to conclude the statute to be ambiguous on its face, we shall delve further into why we are persuaded to that end. <em>Montgomery Cnty. v.

We do not decide here whether local legislative fields of regulation, other than those listed specifically in Art.

Casey (or its successors/assigns), for example, will confront many additional and necessary governmental development processes, at which times the appropriate governmental body may confront questions regarding whether a law, regulation, or policy is frozen or not. Even if the specific regulatory rule then under examination is deemed covered by the Agreement (and comes within the intent of LU \u00a7 7-304(a)), the local government may unfreeze the rule by exercising its prerogative under Art.
