(\u201cNCS\u201d), as that agreement was later incorporated by reference into a subcontract between Schneider Electric and NCS, which was thereafter incorporated by reference into a performance bond issued by Western Surety on behalf of NCS for work it was to perform for Schneider Electric.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">The aforementioned agreement between Schneider Electric and NCS, containing the arbitration clause at issue, in this appeal, was entitled the \u201cMaster Subcontract Agreement.\u201d Its purpose was to enable Schneider Electric, \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d to \u201cengage the services of [NCS] to provide labor, material, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>equipment and services ... in connection with construction projects,\u201d and its terms were to cover all future subcontracts between them. Of particular relevance to the issue before us, the Master Subcontract Agreement provided that any disputes that might arise between those two corporate entities, which could not be resolved by \u201cgood faith negotiations,\u201d must be submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">One year later, Schneider Electric was retained to assist in the building of a facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground, whereupon it entered into a subcontract agreement with NCS, in accordance with the parties\u2019 Master Subcontract Agreement, providing that NCS was to perform certain work at the construction site of that facility. The subcontract required NCS to furnish a performance bond, which it did. The issuer of that bond was Western Surety. And, significantly, the bond incorporated by reference the subcontract between Schneider Electric and NCS, which had incorporated by reference the Master Subcontract Agreement between those two parties, with its mandatory arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">When NCS thereafter declined to perform the construction required by the subcontract, as a result of a payment dispute, Schneider Electric filed, as provided by the parties\u2019 Master Subcontract Agreement, a demand for arbitration. Although that demand, initially, named only NCS as a respondent, it was subsequently amended to include Western Surety, as a corespondent, on the grounds that the performance bond, issued by Western Surety, incorporated by reference the subcontract, which, in turn, had incorporated by reference the Master Subcontract Agreement, with its mandatory arbitration clause, and thereby purportedly bound Western Surety to that clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In response to its belated inclusion into Schneider Electric\u2019s demand for arbitration, Western Surety filed a petition, in the Circuit Court for Howard County, to stay that arbitration and for a declaratory judgment, avowing, among other things, that it was not a party to Schneider Electric\u2019s and NCS\u2019 agreement to arbitrate their disputes and therefore could not be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>pelled to participate in the arbitration proceeding pending between them; it asserted, moreover, that Schneider Electric had breached the performance bond and that that breach had relieved Western Surety of any liability under that instrument. Then, following the transfer of this dispute from Howard County to Harford County, the Circuit Court for Harford County granted partial summary judgment in favor of Western Surety, concluding that, under either federal or state law, Western Surety was not subject to the arbitration provision of the incorporated Master Subcontract Agreement and therefore could not be compelled to participate in the pending arbitration proceeding between Schneider Electric and NCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In so ruling, the Harford County circuit court cited three grounds for its decision: first, the words of the performance bond evinced an intent by Western Surety to guarantee the performance of all construction work to be performed by NCS, but not all contractual obligations undertaken by NCS, pursuant to the subcontract; second, the arbitration clause of the Master Subcontract Agreement, even if ultimately incorporated by reference into the performance bond, mandated arbitration only as to disputes between Schneider Electric and NCS; and, third, to rule otherwise, would, in effect, read out of the performance bond language expressly providing for a judicial resolution of any dispute, involving the bond, that might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Schneider Electric then noted this appeal, contending that the Harford County circuit court\u2019s ruling was in error for two reasons: first, by agreeing, in the performance bond, to \u201cjointly and severally\u201d bind themselves to the performance of the subcontract between Schneider Electric and NCS, both Western Surety and NCS were thereby bound to comply with the arbitration clause incorporated by reference into that subcontract; and, second, because the performance bond incorporated by reference that subcontract, Western Surety was rendered subject to the arbitration clause. Finding no merit to either claim of error, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">In May 2009, Schneider Electric<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and NCS entered into a \u201cMaster Subcontract Agreement,\u201d in which the parties agreed, as noted, that NCS would \u201cprovide labor, material, equipment and services necessary to perform work in connection with construction projects, from time to time[.]\u201d The Master Subcontract Agreement set forth, among other things, the terms and conditions that would apply to all future subcontracts between the two companies. It also included a provision, which is the crux of this appeal, that any dispute between them would be subject to arbitration, if they were unable to negotiate a resolution of that dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Several months later, on August 14, 2009, Clark Construction Group, LLC, which is not a party to this matter, entered into a contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers to build a replacement facility for medical research at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford County, Maryland. The following October, Clark Construction, now the general contractor for that construction project, contractually retained the services of Schneider Electric to assist in the construction of that facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Seven months after Schneider Electric was engaged, by Clark Construction, as a subcontractor for the construction project, Schneider Electric, pursuant to its Master Subcontract Agreement with NCS, entered into a subcontract with NCS, to perform work for that project. The subcontract incorporated by reference the Master Subcontract Agreement, which contained the arbitration clause at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Specifically, the subcontract provided that NCS would perform \u201celectrical and pneumatic installation\u201d work at the Aberdeen facility. For that work, NCS was to be paid $2,050,000, \u201cin installments as the Work progresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The subcontract also required NCS to furnish a performance bond, designating Schneider Electric as the obligee, for 100 per cent of the \u201cSubcontract value,\u201d that is, $2,050,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> NCS subsequently obtained that bond from Western Surety. The performance bond, issued by Western Surety, at NCS\u2019 request, was an American Institute of Architects (\u201cAIA\u201d) form A312<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and bound Western Surety and NCS to Schneider Electric \u201cfor the performance of the Construction Contract,\u201d which was incorporated by reference into the performance bond. The term \u201cConstruction Contract,\u201d as defined by the performance bond, included the subcontract, between Schneider Electric and NCS, and thereby the Master Subcontract Agreement between those two entities, with its mandatory arbitration clause, which had been incorporated by reference into the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The subcontract specified that NCS\u2019 work would begin on May 25, 2010 and conclude by May 31, 2013. As the work progressed, numerous change orders eventually increased the amount to be paid NCS, by Schneider Electric, from $2,050,000 to $2,309,883, and extended the date that NCS was to complete its work from May 31, 2013 to February 28, 2014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In the summer of 2013, a dispute arose between Schneider Electric and NCS concerning payment for work NCS had purportedly performed. NCS claimed it was owed approximately $410,000, by Schneider Electric, for various progress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>payments, claims, and change orders. When Schneider Electric rejected NCS\u2019 demand for payment, the parties attempted, as required by their Master Subcontract Agreement, which had been incorporated by reference into their subcontract, to resolve their dispute \u201cthrough good faith negotiations and settlement.\u201d When those efforts proved unavailing, NCS, on August 30, 2013, abandoned the job site, notwithstanding a provision in the Master Subcontract Agreement requiring it to \u201ccontinue to diligently perform the Work and maintain the progress schedule (without waiving its claims) despite the pendency of any dispute or any arbitration or litigation proceeding!;.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Upon learning of NCS\u2019 cessation of work, Schneider Electric promptly sent an initial notice of default to both NCS and Western Surety, advising them of what Schneider Electric believed to be a breach of contract by NCS. After two months had passed and NCS had still not resumed its work at the job site, Schneider Electric, on October 25, 2013, sent a final notice of default to both NCS and Western Surety, declaring that Schneider Electric intended to \u201cterminate for cause\u201d the subcontract between it and NCS, that Schneider Electric would \u201cproceed to complete NCS\u2019 work in an expeditious manner using manpower supplied by other electrical subcontractors,\u201d and that NCS and Western Surety would \u201cremain liable for all costs and expenses incurred\u201d by Schneider Electric to complete NCS\u2019 work. Schneider Electric then, on November 12, 2013, notified both NCS and Western Surety that the NCS subcontract had \u201cbeen terminated for cause pursuant to Section 18.3\u201d of the Master Subcontract Agreement, which permitted it to do so if NCS abandoned the work it was contractually required to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Because NCS, as of August 30, 2013 (the date it left the job site), had performed only 70 per cent of the work required under the subcontract, Schneider Electric hired other electrical subcontractors to complete the remaining work. It, ultimately, paid those subcontractors approximately $2,000,000 to fulfil NCS\u2019 contractual obligations, which further fueled the dispute between the parties, as that amount substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>exceeded the amount that NCS was to be paid upon the completion of the work it had not yet performed, when it ceased any further activity at the construction site. In fact, according to Schneider Electric, NCS\u2019 breach of the subcontract had caused it to suffer nearly $1,500,000 in damages, which was the difference between the approximately $2,000,000 it paid others to complete the work NCS was to perform under the subcontract and the approximately $500,000 NCS was to be paid had it fulfilled its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">In February 2014, Schneider Electric filed a demand for arbitration, with the American Arbitration Association, naming NCS as the sole respondent and claiming damages in the amount of $1,473,100 as well as attorneys\u2019 fees, interest, and costs. Then, two months later, it amended that demand, to include Western Surety as a co-respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Finding, itself, now a party to the arbitration demanded by Schneider Electric, Western Surety filed, in response to that demand, a petition, in the Circuit Court for Howard County, seeking both a stay of arbitration and a declaratory judgment. Specifically, Western Surety requested, invoking Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 3-208,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the circuit court stay arbitration \u201cwith respect to any claims asserted by\u201d Schneider Electric against it because it was not, it averred, a party to any arbitration agreement with Schneider Electric or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>NCS or to any agreement between them. Western Surety further requested that the court \u201cissue a declaratory judgment with respect to the legal relations between\u201d it and Schneider Electric and, in so doing, to specify the reasons that it, Western Surety, could not be required to participate in the arbitration currently pending between Schneider Electric and NCS, as well as to specify any \u201csuretyship defenses\u201d Western Surety could invoke, were Schneider Electric to bring a claim against it under the performance bond, should it prevail in the pending arbitration proceeding with NCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In reply, Schneider Electric filed a motion to dismiss the state court action, brought by Western Surety, on the grounds of improper venue. Although Western Surety opposed that motion, it did agree to Schneider Electric\u2019s request for a change of venue, which led the Howard County court to subsequently transfer this matter to the Circuit Court for Harford County. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-327(b) (authorizing a circuit court, upon sustaining defense of improper venue but determining that \u201cin the interest of justice the action should not be dismissed,\u201d to transfer that action\u201d to any county in which it could have been brought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">At the same time that Schneider Electric moved to dismiss the state court proceedings, it filed a petition, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking to compel Western Surety to arbitrate their dispute. The federal district court dismissed that petition, citing the \u201cabstention doctrine,\u201d promulgated by the Supreme Court, in <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976), which permits a federal district court to dismiss a federal action, when \u201cthe parallel state-court litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. </em>Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 28, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Later that year, following the transfer of the case to the Harford County circuit court, Western Surety, in September 2014, filed, in that court, a motion for partial summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ment, asserting that, because there was no agreement to arbitrate between it and Schneider Electric, it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to its request for a stay of arbitration. The granting of that motion by the Harford County circuit court prompted the filing of this interlocutory appeal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by Schneider Electric.</p>\n<p id=\"pAD\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b60-1\">Having not been stayed during the pendency of this appeal, arbitration proceedings, to which only Schneider Electric and NCS were parties, continued without interruption. In fact, shortly after the parties\u2019 presentation of oral argument, before this Court, those proceedings concluded with a determination, by the arbitrator, that NCS had breached its subcontract with Schneider Electric, whereupon Schneider Electric was awarded, by the arbitrator, a total of $1,658,924.21 in damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, arbitrator\u2019s fees, and costs that Schneider Electric had incurred. Following that decision, Western Surety promptly filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, contending that, because the dispute between Schneider Electric and Western Surety was, principally, whether Western Surety was contractually obligated to submit to arbitration and, as that arbitration had concluded, the instant appeal is now moot and warrants dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-2\">\u201cA question is moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>Falik v. Hornage, </em>413 Md. 163, 186, 991 A.2d 1234 (2010) (citation and quotation omitted). Although the arbitration between Schneider Electric and NCS has, indeed, ended, the issue of whether Schneider Electric may seek payment of that award from Western Surety via arbitration is still before us. That issue was understandably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>neither addressed nor resolved during the arbitration proceedings between Schneider Electric and NCS. It therefore remains an \u201cexisting controversy\u201d between the parties and, in fact, lies at the heart of this appeal. Accordingly, we shall deny Western Surety\u2019s motion to dismiss and proceed to the merits of the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b61-1\">Under Maryland Rule 2-501(f), a circuit court may grant summary judgment, if there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact,\u201d and \u201cthe party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cBecause a grant of summary judgment is predicated upon a ruling on a question of law and not a dispute of fact, our review is de novo \u201d <em>Stein v. Pfizer Inc., </em>228 Md.App. 72, 85, 137 A.3d 279 (2016) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 Md. 129, 146 A.3d 476 (2016). Keeping that standard of review in mind, we turn now to the first issue we have been asked to decide and, that is, whether we must apply federal law, specifically, the Federal Arbitration Act and its attendant presumption in favor of arbitration, in determining whether Western Surety is bound contractually to arbitrate, as Schneider Electric contends, or state contract law, as Western Surety claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-2\">Preliminarily, we note that the court below did not address whether the contracts at issue, in this appeal, involved interstate commerce and, consequently, it never determined whether the Federal Arbitration Act applied to the instant controversy. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (defining \u201ccommerce,\u201d for purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act, as including \u201ccommerce among the several States\u201d). Nor was it necessary that it do so, given that it found that, under either federal or state law, Western Surety was not contractually bound to arbitrate any disputes arising from the performance bond it had issued because, regardless of which Act, federal or state, applies, state law governs the issue of contract formation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">The Supreme Court first annunciated this principle in <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>(1987), and then later reiterated it, in <em>Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, </em>556 U.S. 624, 129 S.Ct. 1896, 173 L.Ed.2d 832 (2009), to clear up an apparent misreading of Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act by a number of federal and state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Section 2 of that federal Act states that a written arbitration provision \u201cin any ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (emphasis added), an ambiguous clause, to be sure. Then, in <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. 483, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426, the Supreme Court indicated, apparently not plainly enough, that, while the former clause\u2014\u201cin any ... contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable\u201d\u2014generally provides that \u201c[a]n agreement to arbitrate is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, <em>as a matter of federal law,\u201d </em>the language that follows\u2014\u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract\u201d\u2014provides that \u201cstate law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is applicable <em>if </em>that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492-93 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Nonetheless, a significant number of federal and state courts, in addressing whether non-signatories to contracts containing arbitration clauses may either compel a signatory or be compelled by a signatory to arbitrate disputes arising under those contracts, have misconstrued Section 2 and mistakenly concluded that it provides that enforceability of an arbitration clause by or against a non-signatory is to be resolved, in accordance with federal common law. <em>See, e.g., R.J. Griffin &amp; Co. v. Beach Club II Homeowners Assoc., </em>384 F.3d 157, 160 n.1 (4th Cir. 2004); <em>Int\u2019l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen &amp; Anlagen GMBH, </em>206 F.3d 411, 417 n.4 (4th Cir. 2000); <em>MS Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin, </em>177 F.3d 942, 947-48 (11th Cir. 1999); <em>Grundstad v. Ritt, </em>106 F.3d 201, 204-05 (7th Cir. 1997); <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Gilbane Building Co., </em>992 F.2d 386, 388-89 (1st Cir. 1993); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. West Point Constr. Co., </em>837 F.2d 1507, 1508 (11th Cir. 1988) (per curiam); <em>Exchange Mut. Ins. Co. v. Haskell Co., </em>742 F.2d 274, 275-76 (6th Cir. 1984) (per curiam); <em>Rashid v. Schenck Const. Co., Inc., </em>190 W.Va. 363, 438 S.E.2d 543, 547 (1993); <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Woolley/Sweeney Hotel No. 5, </em>545 So.2d 958 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">This misreading of Section 2 has engendered much confusion among many state courts, including Maryland\u2019s Court of Special Appeals. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. Witherspoon, </em>197 Md.App. 69, 81, 12 A.3d 685 (2011) (\u201cUnder the [Federal Arbitration Act], courts look to substantive provisions of state law regarding threshold issues of the validity, revocability, or enforceability of contracts, but to federal law to resolve issues as to whether a non-signatory to a contract can enforce, or be bound by, an arbitration provision in a contract signed by other parties.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Case Handyman and Remodeling Servs., LLC v. Schuele, </em>183 Md.App. 44, 57, 959 A.2d 833 (2008) (\u201cTo resolve the issue whether a non-signatory can enforce a contract\u2019s arbitration provision under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, courts look to the federal substantive law of arbitrability.\u201d), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>412 Md. 555, 989 A.2d 210 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In 2009, the Supreme Court laid to rest this misinterpretation of that section of the Federal Arbitration Act, in <em>Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, supra, </em>556 U.S. 624, 129 S.Ct. 1896. There, it explained that when, as in this case, a question arises as to whether an arbitration clause may be enforced by or against non-parties to a contract containing such a clause, \u201c \u2018traditional principles\u2019 of state law,\u201d which \u201callow a contract to be enforced by or against non[-]parties ... through \u2018assumption, piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, incorporation by reference, third-party beneficiary theories, waiver and estoppel,\u2019 \u201d provide the answer to that question. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 129 S.Ct. 1896 (quoting 21 R. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u00a7 57:19, at 183 (4th ed. 2001)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Moreover, in the past few years, several federal courts of appeals, consistent with the <em>Carlisle </em>Court\u2019s relatively recent admonition, have candidly conceded their mistaken impression that federal common law controls in such situations. <em>See, e.g., Crawford Prof. Drugs, Inc. v. CVS Caremark Corp., </em>748 F.3d 249, 255 (5th Cir. 2014) (recognizing that \u201cprior decisions applying federal common law, rather than state contract law, to decide\u201d whether an arbitration clause may be enforced by or against nonparties to the contract were in error); <em>Lawson v. Life of the South Ins. Co., </em>648 F.3d 1166, 1170-71 (11th Cir. 2011) (declaring that many of that circuit\u2019s prior \u201cdecisions involving the question of whether a non-party can enforce an arbitration clause against a party have not made clear that the applicable state law provides the rule of decision for that question\u201d). We now join those courts in stressing that, under the Federal Arbitration Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the question of whether an agreement to arbitrate binds a non-signatory is a question of state contract law. <em>Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, </em>556 U.S. at 631, 129 S.Ct. 1896; <em>First Options of Chicago, </em>Inc. <em>v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995); <em>Perry v. Thomas, </em>482 U.S. at 492-93 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Finally, if the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, rather than the Federal Arbitration Act, applies in this case, we, of course, reach the same conclusion, that is, state contract law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>not federal law, governs whether an agreement to arbitrate binds a non-signatory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Cheek v. United Healthcare of the Mid-Atlantic, Inc., </em>378 Md. 139, 147, 835 A.2d 656 (2003) (observing that, under the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the \u201cdetermination of whether there is an agreement to arbitrate ... depends on contract principles since arbitration is a matter of contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We now turn to the issue, which is. the fulcrum of this case: whether, under Maryland contract law, Western Surety, in effect, agreed to arbitrate any disputes between it and Schneider Electric, because the performance bond, issued by Western Surety, on behalf of NCS, incorporated by reference the subcontract, which, in turn, incorporated by reference the Master Subcontract Agreement, with its arbitration clause, to which only Schneider Electric and NCS were parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201cMaryland follows the objective theory of contract interpretation,\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Regency Furniture, Inc., </em>183 Md.App. 710, 722, 963 A.2d 253 (2009), according to which a \u201ccourt must, as its first step, determine from the language of the agreement what a reasonable person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the position of the parties would have meant at the time the agreement was effectuated.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 291, 674 A.2d 106 (1996) <em>(\u201cScarlett Harbor I\u201d), aff'd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997) <em>(\u201cScarlett Harbor II\u201d). </em>Moreover, \u201c[w]here the contract comprises two or more documents, the documents are to be construed together, harmoniously, so that, to the extent possible, all of the provisions can be given effect.\u201d <em>Regency Furniture, </em>183 Md.App. at 722-23, 963 A.2d 253 (quoting <em>Rourke v. Amchem Prods., Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 354, 863 A.2d 926 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The latter principle of contract interpretation bears particular relevance to the issue before us, because the agreement between Western Surety and Schneider Electric is the product of principally three documents: the performance bond together with the subcontract and the Master Subcontract Agreement, with its arbitration clause, the former of which incorporates the latter two.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Paragraph 1 of the performance bond states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[NCS] and [Western Surety], jointly and severally, bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns to [Schneider Electric] for the performance of the Construction Contract [which includes both the Subcontract and the Master Subcontract Agreement], which is incorporated herein by reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">According to Schneider Electric, paragraph 1 of the bond binds Western Surety to submit to arbitration all disputes, arising under what is referred to above as the \u201cConstruction Contract,\u201d first, because it \u201cjointly and severally\u201d binds Western Surety to ensure \u201cthe performance of the Construction Contract,\u201d which includes, insists Schneider Electric, compliance with the arbitration clause, if invoked, and, second, because paragraph 1 of the bond incorporates by reference the subcontract, which, in turn, incorporates by reference the Master Subcontract Agreement and thus its arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Schneider Electric\u2019s assertion that Western Surety, by \u201cjointly and severally\u201d binding itself to \u201cthe performance of the Construction Contract,\u201d as stated in paragraph 1 of the performance bond, also bound itself to the incorporated Master Subcontract Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause, ignores the context of those words as well as misconstrues the term \u201cperformance.\u201d The Master Subcontract Agreement states that Schneider Electric \u201cdesires to engage the services of [NCS] to provide labor, material, equipment and services necessary to perform work in connection with construction projects, from time to time, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in\u201d the Master Subcontract Agreement. (Emphasis added.) As the purpose of the Master Subcontract Agreement (and the subcontract, which incorporated that agreement by reference) was to ensure that NCS would \u201cperform work,\u201d prescribed by that agreement, it is with that purpose in mind that the term \u201cperformance\u201d should be construed. <em>Ocean Petroleum Co. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 88, 5 A.3d 683 (2010) (citation and quotation omitted). The arbitration clause, on the other hand, is nothing more than an enforcement mechanism, which may never come into play, if all parties proceed as agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Moreover, the paragraphs of the bond, which immediately follow paragraph 1 and employ the verb \u201cperform,\u201d confirm that the term \u201cperformance,\u201d contrary to Schneider Electric\u2019s contention, extends only to the tasks that NCS was to complete. Paragraph 2 of the bond states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">If [NCS] performs the Construction Contract, [Western Surety] and [NCS] shall have no obligation under this Bond, except to participate in conferences as provided in Subpara-graph 3.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Subparagraph 3.1 of the bond, in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">If there is no [default by Schneider Electric], [Western Surety\u2019s] obligation under this Bond shall arise after ... [Schneider Electric] has notified [NCS] and [Western Sure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ty] ... that [Schneider Electric] is considering declaring a [default by NCS] and has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with [NCS] and [Western Surety] to be held not later than fifteen days after receipt of such notice to discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract. If [Schneider Electric], [NCS] and [Western Surety] agree, [NCS] shall be allowed a reasonable time to perform the Construction Contract, but such an agreement shall not waive [Schneider Electric\u2019s] right, if any, subsequently to declare a [default by NCS.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In sum, NCS\u2019 obligation to \u201cperform,\u201d as set forth in paragraph 2 and subparagraph 3.1 of the bond, refers to the performance of the work it agreed to complete and not to every contractual provision in the incorporation-by-reference chain, which runs from the Master Subcontract Agreement, between Schneider Electric and NCS, to the subcontract between those two parties, to the performance bond, issued by Western Surety. We therefore conclude that the \u201cjoint and several\u201d obligation clause in paragraph 1 of the performance bond does not evince Western Surety\u2019s assent to be bound by the arbitration clause in the incorporated-by-reference chain of documents, particularly as it was not a party to either of the two earlier contractual links in that chain, namely, the Master Subcontract Agreement and the subcontract that followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">We turn now to consider whether the language in paragraph 1 of the bond, providing that the \u201cConstruction Contract [which, as noted earlier, includes the Master Subcontract Agreement, with its arbitration clause] ... is incorporated herein by reference,\u201d compels Western Surety to submit to the arbitration clause of that Agreement. In <em>Scarlett Harbor I, supra, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 674 A.2d 106, this Court specifically addressed the question whether a non-signatory surety on a performance bond, which incorporated by reference a construction contract (containing an arbitration clause) between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>developer of a condominium project and one of its subcontractors, could compel the developer to arbitrate its dispute with the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">That case arose from complaints by unit owners alleging defective design and construction of a high-rise condominium development, Scarlett Place Residential Condominium. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 674 A.2d 106. Those complaints led the council of unit owners of the condominium to file a civil action, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, against the project developer, Scarlett Harbor Associates Limited Partnership (\u201cSHALP\u201d), its general partners, and its former general partners, \u201casserting breach of the statutory implied warranty, breach of express warranty, breach of contract, and violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendants, in turn, impleaded several other entities, including a subcontractor, Leonard A. Kraus, Inc., and Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, which had issued Kraus\u2019s performance bond. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Because the subcontract between SHALP and Kraus contained a broadly worded arbitration clause,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which, as this Court explained, \u201centitled Kraus to require arbitration to resolve any \u2018claims, disputes, [or] other matters ... arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents or breach thereof,\u2019 \u201d Kraus filed a petition, in the Baltimore County circuit court, to compel the SHALP defendants to submit to arbitration. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 674 A.2d 106. Though Hartford was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>a party to the subcontract between SHALP and Kraus, Hartford also filed a petition, in the same court, to compel arbitration, asserting its right to invoke the subcontract\u2019s arbitration clause, because the performance bond it had issued incorporated the subcontract by reference.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 292, 674 A.2d 106. The circuit court granted Kraus\u2019s petition but denied Hartford\u2019s, \u201cruling that the performance bond contract did not contain an arbitration agreement\u201d for Hartford to invoke and that Hartford was not a party to the subcontract, which did. <em>Id. </em>at 289, 674 A.2d 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">In affirming that ruling, this Court observed that \u201c[w]hen an earlier document is \u2018incorporated by reference\u2019 into a subsequent contract, it simply means that the earlier document is made a part of the second document, as if the earlier document were fully set forth therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 674 A.2d 106 (citations omitted). But, we then stressed that the mere \u201cincorporation of one contract into another contract involving different parties does not automatically transform the incorporated document into an agreement between the parties to the second contract,\u201d unless there is \u201can indication of a contrary intention\u201d to do so. <em>Id. </em>We therefore rejected Hartford\u2019s contention that such \u201can indication\u201d was evident, noting that the purpose of the incorporation-by-reference bond language was \u201csimply to establish the primary obligation on which Hartford\u2019s secondary obligation would depend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, then, we noted that, even if the arbitration clause were incorporated into the bond, that clause \u201conly require[d] arbitration of disputes between Kraus and SHALP, not Hartford and SHALP,\u201d <em>id. </em>much like, as we shall see, the arbitration clause at issue here, which expressly requires the arbitration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>disputes between Schneider Electric and NCS but not disputes between Schneider Electric and Western Surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">Moreover, the bond in <em>Scarlett Harbor, </em>like the bond in the instant case, contained a clause that, in the Court\u2019s words, \u201cindicate[d] an intention to <em>litigate </em>disputes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 674 A.2d 106. That clause stated: \u201cAny suit under the bond must be instituted before the expiration of two years from the date on which final payment under the subcontract falls due.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Hartford\u2019s interpretation of its bond would have read those words out of the contract, the <em>Scarlett Harbor I </em>Court rejected that construction, on the grounds that \u201ca contract should not be interpreted in a manner in which a meaningful part of the agreement is disregarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It is true, as Schneider Electric points out, that the Court of Appeals, in affirming this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>expressly declined to say whether its holding would apply to the specific question presented in this case, namely, whether a surety could be compelled to arbitrate, on the grounds that, in issuing a bond that incorporated by reference a contract, with an arbitration clause, it had agreed \u201cto arbitrate claims on the bond.\u201d <em>Scarlett Harbor II, </em>346 Md. at 129 n.7, 695 A.2d 153. Nonetheless, when the same principles of Maryland contract law that were invoked by this Court, in <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>are applied to the bond and other contractual documents at issue here, we are compelled to reach a conclusion that logically follows the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Scarlett Harbor </em>II\u2014that is, that Western Surety is not compelled to arbitrate any dispute involving the performance bond it issued, simply because that bond incorporated by reference an agreement, to which it was not a party, containing a mandatory arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As we noted in <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>the \u201cincorporation of one contract into another contract involving different parties does not automatically transform the incorporated document into an agreement between the parties to the second contract,\u201d unless there is \u201can indication of a contrary intention\u201d to do so. <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>109 Md.App. at 292, 674 A.2d 106. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>instant case, there is no indication of such a \u201ccontrary intention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Moreover, as in <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>the performance bond, in the instant case, \u201cactually indicates an intention to <em>litigate </em>disputes.\u201d 109 Md.App. at 293, 674 A.2d 106. Paragraph 9 of the bond states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">Any proceeding, legal or equitable, under this Bond may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction in the location in which the work or part of the work is located and shall be instituted within two years after Contractor default or within two years after the Contractor ceased working or within two years after the Surety refuses or fails to perform its obligations under this Bond, whichever occurs first. If the provisions of this Paragraph are void or prohibited by law, the minimum period of limitation available to sureties as a defense in the jurisdiction of the suit shall be applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In rejecting the argument made, in <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>that an incorporation-by-reference clause in a performance bond must be construed as providing that the surety and the parties to the construction contract all agreed to be bound to an arbitration clause in that construction contract, we declared that such a reading of the bond would, in effect, read out of it a provision, which provided that \u201c[a]ny suit under the bond must be instituted before the expiration of two years from the date on which final payment under the subcontract falls due,\u201d <em>Scarlett Harbor </em>I, 109 Md.App. at 293, 674 A.2d 106. And, that is precisely what would occur here were we to hold that, notwithstanding paragraph 9\u2019s express direction that relief must be sought in the courts of this State, mandatory arbitration of disputes arising under the performance bond was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Finally, we note that Schneider Electric\u2019s contention that we should follow the majority of courts in other jurisdictions, holding that a surety, which has agreed to the incorporation by reference of a prior contract, containing an arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>clause, into a bond at issue is thereby bound to arbitrate any disputes with the bond\u2019s obligee, is unpersuasive. First of all, the analysis in those cases, as the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Scarlett Harbor II, </em>\u201cdoes not go beyond the fact that the contract containing an arbitration provision has been incorporated into the bond.\u201d <em>Scarlett Harbor II, </em>346 Md. at 129 n.7, 695 A.2d 153. Indeed, the first two of the cases, cited by the Court of Appeals as lacking any substantive analysis under the law of contracts, <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. West Point Constr. Co., supra, </em>837 F.2d 1507 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam), and <em>Exchange Mut. Ins. Co. v, Haskell Co., supra, </em>742 F.2d 274, 275-76 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam), are two of the principal cases upon which Schneider Electric relies in this appeal. Those and the other cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> cited by Schneider Electric, are not only short on substance, but shy of analysis. Indeed, had we not been provided, by <em>Scarlett Harbor I, </em>with the analytic framework we now employ and, consequently, forced to look outside of Maryland for persuasive authority, we would rely upon the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in <em>AgGrow Oils, LLC v. Nat. Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>242 F.3d 777 (8th Cir. 2001), and <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mandaree Pub. Sch. Dist. </em># <em>36, </em>503 F.3d 709 (8th Cir. 2007),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which are the only federal decisions (out of all of the cases cited by the parties) to correctly apply state contract law to the question of whether an agreement to arbitrate exists and also, in our view, correctly held that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>under the circumstances, a bond\u2019s mere incorporation by reference of a contract, containing an arbitration clause, did not obligate the issuer of that bond to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HAR-FORD COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
