Green, III, of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and unlawfully wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun. The court sentenced appellant to life, all but eighty years suspended, on the murder conviction, thirty years, consecutive, on the conspiracy conviction, and twenty years, consecutive to the murder count, for the convictions of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On appeal, appellant presents the following two questions for this Court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">1. Did the trial court err in admitting the identification testimony of a key State\u2019s witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing the State to present evidence during closing argument?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer these questions in the negative, and therefore, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">On October 23, 2013, Jeff Meyers was shot and killed in the driveway of his Cecil County residence while sitting in his pickup truck. During the ensuing seven-day trial against appellant, the State presented numerous witnesses indicating that the shooting was related to stolen money and drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">Appellant admitted at trial that he and Jonathan Copeland drove a Ford Mustang to Mr. Meyers\u2019 house on Principio Road the day of the murder, where they confronted Mr. Meyers about the theft of money and drugs belonging to Mr. Copeland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An altercation ensued, and Mr. Meyers was shot and killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Thus, it was not disputed that appellant was present at the time of the murder, and that Mr. Copeland, who was taller and skinnier than appellant, was the only other person with appellant at the time of the shooting. The contested issue was the identity of the shooter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Doris Carter testified that she was driving on Principio Road when she observed a Mustang blocking Mr. Meyers\u2019 truck. She observed that the door of the Mustang \u201cwas open on the driver\u2019s side, and someone was standing there with one foot in the car, one foot out of the car, and there was another person standing off to [her] left.\u201d Ms. Carter described the person \u201cstanding at the car\u201d as \u201ctall and thin,\u201d wearing a black hat \u201cwith white design, [which] seemed to be like snowflakes.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She described the other person as a \u201cshort stouter male,\u201d who was wearing a \u201choodie\u201d and appeared to be a \u201cwhite male.\u201d'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As she drove past the Mustang, Ms. Carter observed \u201cthe short stout person shooting into\u201d Mr. Meyers\u2019 truck.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Near the end of the State\u2019s direct examination of Ms. Carter, the prosecutor asked her if she could identify the \u201ctaller skinnier\u201d man if she saw him. Ms. Carter responded: \u201cI think so.\u201d After a lengthy conference with the court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>opposing counsel, discussed in more detail, infra,, the prosecutor brought Mr. Copeland into the courtroom. Ms. Carter then identified Mr. Copeland as the \u201ctaller thin\u201d person who was \u201cwearing the hat\u201d and standing next to the black Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">As indicated, appellant was convicted of murder and related crimes. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"pACg\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Appellant first contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in allowing Ms. Carter to identify Mr. Copeland in court as the \u201ctaller thin\u201d man that she saw standing outside the driver\u2019s side of the Mustang \u201cwearing the hat.\u201d He asserts that, by \u201cfailing to provide [him] with complete and accurate information regarding the extent to which [Ms.] Carter could identify [Mr.] Copeland, both in court and photographically,\u201d the State \u201cviolated its discovery obligations under Maryland Rule 4-263.\u201d He contends that the court should have precluded the identification procedure, and the failure to do so was an abuse of discretion and reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The State responds in several ways. Initially, it argues that appellant\u2019s claim of a discovery violation is unpreserved for this Court\u2019s review. Even if preserved, the State contends that there was no violation of the discovery rules, and therefore, appellant\u2019s claims are without merit. Finally, the State argues that, even if it did fail to satisfy its discovery obligations, any prejudice to appellant was limited, and cross-examination, not exclusion of the evidence, was the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Discovery Generally</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Maryland Rule 4-263 sets forth the discovery obligations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>prosecutors in circuit court criminal trials.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The provisions at issue in this appeal are subsections (d)(3), (6), (7), and (9). In this regard, the Rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">(d) Disclosure by the State\u2019s Attorney. Without the necessity of a request, the State\u2019s Attorney shall provide to the defense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">(3) State\u2019s Witnesses. As to each State\u2019s witness the State\u2019s Attorney intends to call to prove the State\u2019s case in chief or to rebut alibi testimony: (A) the name of the witness; (B) except as provided under Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 11-205 or Rule 16-910 (b), the address and, if known to the State\u2019s Attorney, the telephone number of the witness; and (C) all written statements of the witness that relate to the offense charged;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">(6) Impeachment Information. All material or information in any form, whether or not admissible, that tends to impeach a State\u2019s witness, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">(D) an oral statement of the witness, not otherwise memorialized, that is materially inconsistent with another statement made by the witness or with a statement made by another witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-12\">(G) the failure of the witness to identify the defendant or a co-defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-13\">(7) Searches, Seizures, Surveillance, and Pretrial Identification. All relevant material or information regarding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-15\">(B) pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(9) Evidence for Use at Trial. The opportunity to inspect, copy, and photograph all documents, computer-generated evidence as defined in Rule 2-504.3 (a), recordings, photographs, or other tangible things that the State\u2019s Attorney intends to use at a hearing or at trial ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 171, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001), the Court of Appeals explained that the State\u2019s compliance with these rules is not discretionary. The Maryland Rules of Procedure, which have the force of law, \u201care not mere guides but are \u2018precise rubrics\u2019 to be strictly followed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining whether a discovery violation has occurred, the courts look first to the plain meaning of the rule. <em>Id. Accord Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 264-65, 757 A.2d 796 (2000) (\u201c[T]o effectuate the purpose and objectives of the rule, we look to its plain text,\u201d and if the words of the rule are unambiguous, \u201cour inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">[T]he scope of pretrial disclosure requirements under Maryland Rule 4-263 must be defined in light of the underlying policies of the rule. Inherent benefits of discovery include providing adequate information to both parties to facilitate informed pleas, ensuring thorough and effective cross-examination, and expediting the trial process by diminishing the need for continuances to deal with unfamiliar information presented at trial. Specific to the mandatory disclosure provisions of Rule 4-263(a), the major objectives are to assist defendants in preparing their defense and to protect them from unfair surprise. The duty to disclose pre-trial identifications, then, is properly determined by interpreting the plain meaning of the Rule with proper deference to these policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 172, 771 A.2d 1082 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The testimony at issue on appeal occurred on the third day of trial, when the State called Ms. Carter, the only eyewitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>to the shooting. After she testified regarding what she saw, including the \u201ctall and thin\u201d person standing by the driver\u2019s door of the car and the \u201cshort stout person shooting into the truck,\u201d the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] All right. As time has gone by though, as you sit\u2014again, as you sit here right now, do you have an image of what the taller skinnier one, as you described him, next to the driver\u2019s door looked like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] And if he was presented to you do you believe that you could identify him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">[MS. CARTER:] I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] Your Honor, can we approach at this time, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I\u2019m going to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The court then permitted counsel to approach. The jury left the courtroom, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASI\">[PROSECUTOR:] Your honor, the state\u2019s intention at this time\u2014and this was the reason for the writ for Mr. Copeland[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]\u2014noting, of course, that the defendant is not charged merely with first degree murder[ ], he is also charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder. He\u2019s charged specifically [with] conspiracy with Mr. Copeland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">It is the state\u2019s proffer to the court that we believe that Ms. Carter, upon seeing Mr. Copeland, will be able to positively identify him. It\u2019s very clear that from the case law that presence is not protected as fifth amendment privilege material. Counsel for Mr. Copeland has already indicated he knows what our intentions are for this morning, and he doesn\u2019t believe he has any standing to object. He\u2019s already counseled his client on this. And based on representations of Mr. Copeland\u2019s attorney, Mr. Copeland understands that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the state intends to produce the body of Mr. Copeland to at least one witness, and we\u2019ve chosen Ms. Carter for identification purposes. I think identification of a co-defendant is\u2014 when charged as coconspirators is almost as important as identification of the defendant within the court process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">We intend to have Ms. Carter specifically identify\u2014this is the first prong of this\u2014identify Mr. Copeland either by face, and say, yes, that\u2019s him, or that looks like him or whatever she says, then ask her about the physique, whether that\u2019s consistent with the first or the second person or anything to that effect. So that\u2019s what we plan to do, and I know counsel has an objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Defense counsel stated that the State was required to advise prior to trial \u201cthat they\u2019re going to have a witness who identifies the co-defendant.\u201d He then objected to bringing Mr. Copeland into court to stand next to appellant and ask Ms. Carter \u201care these the same two people,\u201d which \u201cessentially [is] an identification of [appellant], which no one said that anyone is going to identify [appellant].\u201d Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">So I think, first of all, there is a discovery problem in that we have no notice that this is going to happen. I mean, that\u2019s\u2014I think that\u2019s been basically admitted that he\u2019s not even sure if she\u2019s going to do it, but clearly they\u2014someone had some idea that she\u2019s going to come in here and say later on that she\u2019s come to understand and now she\u2019s able to identify him. So there\u2019s that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">And then to have\u2014I mean, I understand that you can perhaps have people for builds and such; but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re doing this to, one, identify Mr. Copeland; two, he intends\u2014I mean, this is\u2014I don\u2019t think he actually said it, that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The court ruled that there would not \u201cbe a stand up next to the defendant and have them sized up.\u201d It then asked the State why it had not disclosed this information in discovery. The prosecutor replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>In terms of discovery the state has to turn over that which the state has, and civilian witness\u2014more so than police offices [sic]\u2014civilian witnesses every day get on the stand and say things when they see it for the first time. They say things different and supplemental, additional to what they said during the interview process, and that is part of the pretrial process in terms of the state and the defendant interviewing witnesses and preparing for it, to know these things in advance....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">The state has to\u2014for discovery purposes, the state has to turn over that which the state is in possession of under the rules. Now when there are statements, written statements, recordings, photos lineups, identification processes like that, we\u2019re required to turn them over to the defendant. Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The reality is, is that Ms. Carter is capable as we hear now from her testimony, of testifying to whether or not she recognizes the defendant or not; and that is not something that in and of itself has to be discovered [sic] to the defendant here. I note that this is co-defendant, not the defendant himself. The rules talked about an identification of the defendant. They don\u2019t contemplate the identification of other people at the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The court then asked if Ms. Carter had given a written statement. After confirming that there was a report, and that defense counsel had a copy, the colloquy continued, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN0\">THE COURT: So you have that information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">THE COURT: Sufficient to cross the witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">THE COURT: Assuming on my part that her testimony is that her recollection has changed\u2014well, you\u2019ve said sufficient to cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I still think an identification of the co-defendant, whenever you get notice of it\u2014clearly there was some notice. I mean, discovery is an ongoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>obligation. That\u2019s something that should be given before trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">THE COURT: What can you cite in support of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQo\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Well, we filed a discovery motion asking for it, and I\u2014I mean\u2014and essentially I would argue that the identification of the co-defendant in this case is\u2014 because he\u2019s a co-defendant is essentially identification\u2014the two go part and parcel on this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The prosecutor then stated that the co-defendant, Mr. Copeland, was interviewed and seen by \u201cplenty of other people,\u201d and defense counsel knew that \u201cthe co-defendant existed. There is no surprise. This is not a surprise witness.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">[T]he only claim of surprise is, is that this witness is going to be able to identify him. But as the court correctly pointed out, which was part of what the state\u2019s argument was going to be, is that the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine and get out of her the fact that she did not\u2014she actually went so far as to say that she couldn\u2019t identify anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pACf\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">And so [defense counsel] will be able to adequately cross-examine her and make the appropriate arguments after she identifies, if, in fact, she does identify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I just note that there\u2019s a slight difference between identification of co-defendant by an eyewitness versus just witnesses as to who he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">[PROSECUTOR:] I think everybody we\u2019ve listed who\u2019s going to identify him is an eyewitness on some level. I don\u2019t see the difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The court then issued its ruling. It stated that it had \u201clooked again at both the discovery request and the response,\u201d and it was going to permit the show up, but control it \u201cvery carefully,\u201d noting that Mr. Copeland was \u201cnot to come within the well of the courtroom. That means he can stand six feet behind you and next to Detective Lewis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>After the jury returned, Mr. Copeland was brought into the courtroom. The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] Ms. Carter, did you have an opportunity to take a look at the individual that was in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you recognize him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes. That was the person that was wearing the hat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. When you say the person that was wearing the hat\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">[MS. CARTER:] That was standing outside the car door on the driver\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">[PROSECUTOR:] Just a point of clarification, Ms. Carter. When you say outside the car door, are you talking about the driver\u2019s side of the Mustang?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-13\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes. The door was open, and he was standing inside\u2014with the door open but inside the door, one foot in the car, one foot out of the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-14\">[PROSECUTOR:] Okay. And as you previously testified about a taller skinnier one and a shorter stockier one ... which of the two\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-15\">[MS. CARTER:] That\u2019s the taller thin one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Ms. Carter about her discussions with the police \u201ccloser to when [the incident] happened.\u201d She denied telling the detectives two days after the incident that the person with the snowflake hat shot into the car. She agreed that she told the detectives, approximately a week later, that she did not get a very good look at the people as she drove by because she was worried about their vehicle in the road. She was unable to give any further description of the people involved, other than that there were two men, one who was short and stocky, and the other tall and thin, and that one was wearing a hat. She noted, however, that \u201cmemories start coming back after I talked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>them, and I didn\u2019t talk to them until now. I\u2019m just telling you what I saw that day and what I remember I saw that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">With respect to her identification in court of Mr. Copeland, counsel asked if she had \u201cever been shown a photo of him before.\u201d The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">[MS. CARTER:] I just identified him through just like his eyes and the hat, and not because of, you know, what he was wearing today or anything like that. I remember he looked at me and I looked at him as I was going by because he was right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Have you seen his picture in the newspaper or anywhere since this happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes, yes, in the Cecil Daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">[MS. CARTER:] But I knew when [I] saw that, that was the person driving the car\u2014or standing outside that driver\u2019s door. The other person I\u2019d saw in the paper also, and I didn\u2019t know them at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] When you\u2014since\u2014when was the first time that you realized, seeing a picture, that you knew who that person was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">[MS. CARTER:] When I saw it probably in the paper. I said, oh, wow, that\u2019s the guy that was wearing the hat, that\u2019s the guy that was standing outside the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] So like a year ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">[MS. CARTER:] ... I\u2019m not sure when they put it in the paper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] But sometime after this case and people were charged\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-15\">[MS. CARTER:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">Ms. Carter testified that she did not call anyone to tell the detectives that she had seen the newspaper photo of one of the men involved, noting that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be here today.\u201d She told the detectives that she knew who Mr. Copeland was when she \u201cwent over ... everything again with them, what I saw\u2014everything that I saw that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The State contends that, for two reasons, appellant failed to preserve his discovery violation claims for this Court\u2019s review. First, it asserts that, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-323(a), a party must object to the admission of evidence \u201cat the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter\u201d for the claim to be preserved, and it argues that, although appellant \u201cobjected earlier on discovery grounds ..., he did not object at the time [Ms. Carter] testified about her identification.\u201d The State analogizes appellant\u2019s objection to a motion <em>in limine, </em>arguing that, when the court denies such a motion to exclude evidence, a party can challenge this ruling on appeal only if he or she makes a contemporaneous objection at trial when the evidence actually is introduced. Because appellant did not do so in this case, and he did not \u201cask for, or receive, a continuing objection regarding [Ms.] Carter\u2019s identification testimony,\u201d the State argues that this issue is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Second, the State contends that appellant\u2019s objection below was based only on the argument that the State was required to disclose in discovery an identification of the defendant, which encompassed Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland as a co-defendant. It asserts that the argument on appeal, to the extent that it encompasses additional contentions, is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Several rules are relevant to the State\u2019s preservation arguments. Initially it is well-established that Maryland\u2019s appellate courts ordinarily will not consider \u201cany issue \u2018unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. State, </em>434 Md. 472, 479, 76 A.3d 1035 (2013) (quoting Md. Rule 8-131(a)). Moreover, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-323(a), \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence shall be made at the time the evidence is offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for objection become apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Here, we are not persuaded by the State\u2019s first argument, that defense counsel failed to preserve the argument that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>discovery violation barred evidence of Ms. Carter\u2019s identification given the failure to object to Ms. Carter\u2019s ultimate testimony identifying Mr. Copeland. The Maryland appellate courts have addressed, and rejected, similar arguments, particularly where the testimony is admitted minutes after a motion in limine ruling. <em>See Norton v. State, </em>217 Md.App. 388, 396-97, 94 A.3d 110 (2014) (After denial of motion in limine to exclude evidence, requiring a defendant to \u201cmake \u2018yet another objection only a short time after the court\u2019s ruling to admit the evidence would be to exalt form over substance.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Clemons v. State, </em>392 Md. 339, 363, 896 A.2d 1059 (2006)), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>443 Md. 517, 117 A.3d 1055 (2015). <em>See also Dyce v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 193, 198, 582 A.2d 582 (1990) (\u201cGiven the temporal proximity between the ruling on the motion <em>in limine </em>and the prosecutor\u2019s initial inquiry on cross-examination we shall exercise our discretion under Md. Rule 8-131 and consider the issue, notwithstanding the lack of literal compliance with Rule 4-323(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Here, when the State, during its direct examination of Ms. Carter, stated that it intended to have Ms. Carter attempt to identify Mr. Copeland in court, defense counsel objected. The court considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and it permitted the State to proceed. Although defense counsel did not object when the State, immediately thereafter, had Mr. Copeland brought into the courtroom and asked Ms. Carter if she recognized him, we conclude that this issue was sufficiently preserved for this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The State\u2019s second preservation argument, however, has merit. Appellant\u2019s argument below did not specifically mention Rule 4-263, and in no way can it be construed as arguing a violation of Rule 4-263(d)(3), (6), or (9). Appellant\u2019s argument regarding a discovery violation was limited to the argument that the State was obligated to disclose the identification of a co-defendant, particularly when it \u201cessentially\u201d was an identification of appellant in this case. Under these circumstances, we agree with the State that appellant\u2019s additional claims on appeal are not preserved for this Court\u2019s review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Accordingly, we will limit our analysis to the issue raised below, and we will not consider the contentions that the State\u2019s failure to disclose Ms. Carter\u2019s identification violated discovery obligations pursuant to Rule 4-263(d)(3) (requiring disclosure of \u201ceach State\u2019s witness [the prosecution] intends to call\u201d to prove its case); (d)(6) (requiring disclosure of information \u201cthat tends to impeach a State\u2019s witness\u201d); and (d)(9) (allowing inspection of \u201cphotographs, or other tangible things\u201d). Without in any way suggesting that there was a violation of Rule 4-263(d)(3), (6), or (9), our review will be limited to whether the circuit court erred in allowing the identification procedure due to a violation of the State\u2019s discovery obligations pursuant to Rule 4-263(d)(7) (regarding disclosure of a \u201cpretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In addressing a claim that the circuit court erred in admitting evidence based on a discovery violation, the standard of review by the appellate court depends on the rationale of the circuit court. If the circuit court finds that there was a discovery violation, but it determines that exclusion of the evidence is not the appropriate sanction, we review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Williams, </em>364 Md. at 178, 771 A.2d 1082 (\u201cThe remedy ... for a violation of the discovery rule is, in the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial judge.... Generally, unless we find that the lower court abused its discretion, we will not reverse.\u201d). Where, however, as in this case, the court does not make a specific finding regarding whether there was a discovery violation, \u201cwe exercise independent de novo review to determine whether a discovery violation occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 771 A.2d 1082.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If we determine that the State did violate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>discovery rule, we consider whether the admission of the evidence was harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Discovery Regarding Pretrial Identification of the Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Appellant contends that the State violated Rule 4-263(d)(7), which requires the State, \u201c[without the necessity of a request,\u201d to provide to the defense: \u201cAll relevant material or information regarding: ... (B) pretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness.\u201d He asserts that the State failed to disclose that, after Ms. Carter\u2019s \u201cinitial vague description of the two men at the scene of the shooting, she positively identified Copeland in a photograph and advised police that she was able to positively identify Copeland.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Appellant relies on <em>Williams, </em>364 Md. at 166, 771 A.2d 1082, in which the State advised in discovery that a police officer conducting surveillance could testify only \u201cto the general description of a man who entered the surveilled premises.\u201d At trial, however, the officer specifically identified the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>as the person who entered the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 771 A.2d 1082. The Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to provide Williams with complete and. accurate information regarding the extent to which Trooper Wilson, a witness closely-identified with the State, could identify Williams\u201d was a violation of the discovery rule requiring disclosure of pretrial identifications of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 178, 771 A.2d 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Williams, </em>however, is readily distinguishable. The identification in <em>Williams </em>was deemed to fall within the ambit of Rule 4-263(d)(7) because it involved an identification of the defendant. Here, however, Mr. Copeland was not the defendant on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Appellant acknowledges this distinction between the cases, but he argues that it \u201cis a distinction without a difference,\u201d for either of two reasons. First, he asserts that, although Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) refers only to identifications of the defendant, reading the rule \u201cin light of the policies underlying the State\u2019s discovery obligations, in particular the policy ... of assisting \u2018defendants in preparing their defense and to protect them from unfair surprise\u201d \u201ccompels the conclusion\u201d that the Rule includes pretrial identifications \u201cof a defendant and a co-defendant.\u201d Second, he asserts that, even if the Rule is read to apply only to information regarding identifications of the defendant, it was applicable here under the specific facts in this case. In that regard, he asserts that, where the only issue was the identity of the shooter, Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland as the tall, thin man necessarily implied the identification of appellant, the defendant, as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We address first appellant\u2019s contention that Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires disclosure of a pretrial identification of, not only a defendant, but also a co-defendant. We begin, as we must, with the language of the rule. <em>See Johnson, </em>360 Md. at 264-65, 757 A.2d 796 (\u201c[T]o effectuate the purpose and objectives of the rule, we look to its plain text,\u201d and if the words of the rule are unambiguous, \u201cour inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>As indicated, Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) requires disclosure of \u201crelevant or material information regarding . pretrial identification of the defendant by a state\u2019s -witness.\u201d (emphasis added). This language is plain and unambiguous. It does not include a co-defendant, or even \u201ca\u201d defendant, but rather, it requires disclosure of pretrial identifications of \u201cthe defendant.\u201d Given this plain and unambiguous language, we hold that the term \u201cdefendant\u201d does not include co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Indeed, as the State points out, where the intent of Rule 4-263(d) was to require disclosure of information regarding co-defendants, as well as defendants, the term co-defendant was specifically used. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-263(d)(6)(G) (requiring the State to disclose impeachment information, including: \u201c[T]he failure of the witness to identify the defendant or a co-defendant.\u201d). <em>See also Polek v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, </em>N.A., 424 Md. 333, 351, 36 A.3d 399 (2012) (\u201cTo determine the plain meaning of language, we consider the statutory scheme in which the particular provision or provisions appear.\u201d). The requirement in Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) that the State disclose information regarding a pretrial identification of the defendant does not encompass identifications of co-defendants or other participants in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s argument that Ms. Carter\u2019s pretrial identification of Mr. Copeland constituted the \u201cidentification of the defendant\u201d because, under the facts of this case, it \u201cnecessarily implied the identification of [him] as the shooter.\u201d Appellant explains his contention in this regard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqA\">Critical to [appellant\u2019s defense that he was present when Mr. Meyers was shot, but Mr. Copeland was the shooter] was that the only eyewitness to the shooting, Carter, was vague in describing the two men she saw at the scene of the shooting, acknowledging that she did not get a good look at [them], that she initially could not give much more by way of description than what she had testified to\u2014tall and skinny versus short and stocky, one wearing a hat, the other a hoodie, and admitting, e.g., that she could not describe any facial features or facial hair. Moreover, while Carter insisted, contrary to Detective Sewell\u2019s testimony, that she never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>saw the shooter with the snowflake hat, this insistence is contrary to all of the evidence putting Appellant in possession of that hat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">The weakness of Carter\u2019s account, absent the positive identification of Copeland, created an opening for Appellant to argue that she was mistaken about which of the two people was the shooter. The obvious purpose behind the State\u2019s orchestrating the in-court identification was to shore-up Carter\u2019s identification of Appellant as the shooter, via positive identification- of Copeland as the non-shooter, and thereby eliminate this opening for the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Appellant relies on this Court\u2019s statement in <em>Simons v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 562, 575, 860 A.2d 416 (2004), in which this Court held that, \u201cwhen the pretrial statement of an eyewitness directly implicates the defendant in the commission of the crime,\u201d it constitutes a pretrial identification in the context of the discovery rules. He asserts that Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland \u201cimplicated\u201d him in the murder and made the identification discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Simons </em>is misplaced. In that case, this Court addressed, as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Williams, </em>a statement of identification of the defendant. Specifically, the issue in <em>Simons </em>was \u201cwhether a witness\u2019s testimony placing a defendant, previously known to the witness, at the scene of the crime constitutes an identification under [the] discovery rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 860 A.2d 416 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Appellant cites no persuasive authority supporting his argument that an identification of someone other than the defendant falls within the scope of Rule 4-263(d)(7)(B) in the circumstance where it suggests, in conjunction with other evidence, that the defendant was involved with the crime. If the rule were construed in this regard, how would the State know what was required to be disclosed? Here, the reason why Ms. Carter\u2019s identification permitted the inference that appellant was the shooter was appellant\u2019s trial strategy; he testified at trial that he was one of the two men that witnesses saw at the crime scene, and Ms. Carter\u2019s identification ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>out the other person. The State\u2019s pretrial discovery obhgations cannot be dependent on the defense trial strategy, which often will be unknown prior to trial,</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We hold that the State\u2019s discovery obligations pursuant to Rule 4-263(d)(7) are limited to that set forth by the plain language of the rule, i.e., information regarding \u201cpretrial identification of the defendant by a State\u2019s witness.\u201d Because Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland was of someone other than the defendant, the State did not violate this rule in failing to give the defense information that Ms. Carter previously had recognized Mr. Copeland\u2019s picture in the newspaper and could (or might) identify Mr. Copeland in court. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in admitting Ms. Carter\u2019s identification of Mr. Copeland at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"pAl\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Appellant next contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in allowing the State to present evidence during closing argument.\u201d Specifically, he asserts that, during \u201crebuttal closing argument, over objection, the State replayed portions of recorded telephone discussions between [a]ppellant and [Mr.] Copeland.\u201d Appellant contends that allowing the State to replay the recordings when they were not introduced into evidence \u201cwas analogous to permitting the introduction of evidence out of order,\u201d which was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The State contends that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to replay recordings that had been played during trial for the jury, but were not admitted as exhibits. It contends that appellant\u2019s analogy to \u201cpermitting the introduction of evidence out of order\u201d is inapposite because the recordings at issue here, although not admitted as exhibits, were in evidence after they were played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Shortly before closing argument, defense counsel objected to the prosecutor playing the recordings of the jail house conversations between appellant and Mr. Copeland. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">What was said is evidence, but the State did not offer the CDs into evidence, the actual media. They played certain portions. There\u2019s nothing on the record that indicates specifically what they played, like time to time, just certain things are played, and they are going to randomly pick things. Quite frankly, those CDs aren\u2019t in evidence. I would argue that what\u2019s in evidence, it\u2019s the testimony through those tapes. He can argue that. I\u2019m not arguing that it\u2019s not in evidence what they heard on there. They have heard it. But the actual media, if he\u2019s going to that media and play it again, they aren\u2019t in evidence. Frankly, there\u2019s nothing in evidence specifying which parts were played and I think it should be the jury should rely on their memory as to what the evidence is. I mean, I guess we could\u2014I mean, he could theoretically get a transcript and just read it back. That might be the solution for him. Or he can argue it. But those CDs are not in evidence and I don\u2019t think he should be allowed to play that for the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The prosecutor argued that the recording that he planned to replay during closing argument was \u201cin evidence and available for consideration.\u201d He stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">The fact that counsel says that we could get transcripts and replay it means that he\u2019s acknowledging that it is something that the jury can consider, which means that it is in evidence.... Something that\u2019s in evidence in a formal sense as to what they can take back into the jury room is what he\u2019s referring to and he is then conveying that into the other sense of what\u2019s in evidence. What\u2019s in evidence is anything that they can consider. If they can consider it, if they have heard it, if they have seen it, and in this ease they have heard it and they have seen it, then they are allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>consider it and I am allowed to refer to it. The fact that I am allowed to refer to it, and by his own words, [defense counsel\u2019s] own words, that I could even in his eyes potentially read from a transcript is drawing attention to it yet again. That\u2019s no different than me playing it again. There\u2019s absolutely no difference between them hearing it from a recorded device versus hearing it from some type of transcription device. The only fundamental difference here is, and it\u2019s done for procedural purposes only, not substantive, procedural purposes only, is that those discs for reasons that everybody in this courtroom knows cannot go back into the jury room. It doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t consider it. It is fair game. I have every intention of referring to those quotes.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">After considering further argument, the court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">The words are in. Whether they came out of the mouth of one of, well, not one of the attorneys, but one of the witnesses or off of a screen, those words are in. They can\u2019t be taken back. They can be replayed. What I don\u2019t want, Mr. [Prosecutor], is them played, those snippets or whatev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>er you want to call them, played repeatedly. One shot at them. I think that\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">[PROSECUTOR:] Understood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Before specifically addressing appellant\u2019s claim of error, we will briefly discuss the scope of permissible closing argument and the limits thereon. The Maryland appellate courts have made clear that an attorney has \u201c \u2018great leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Newton, </em>230 Md.App. 241, 254, 146 A.3d 1204 (2016) (quoting <em>Pickett v. State, </em>222 Md.App. 322, 329, 112 A.3d 1078 (2015)). <em>Accord Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999). We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">[I]t is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\"><em>Sivells v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 254, 270, 9 A.3d 123 (2010) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 380, 969 A.2d 989 (2009)), <em>cert. dis\u2019d as improv. granted, </em>421 Md. 659, 28 A.3d 704 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The determination whether counsel\u2019s comments in closing were improper and prejudicial is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Sivells, </em>196 Md.App. at 271, 9 A.3d 123. \u201cAn appellate court generally will not reverse the trial court \u2018unless that court clearly abused the exercise of its discretion and prejudiced the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 431, 722 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Turning to the specific issue raised here, appellant has not cited, and this Court has not found, any Maryland opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>addressing whether it is an abuse of discretion for a court to allow a party to replay during closing argument a recording played to the jury during trial. Other courts, however, have addressed the issue and held that it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to permit a party, during closing argument, to replay recordings,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In <em>Hodges v. State, </em>194 Ga.App. 837, 392 S.E.2d 262, 263 (1990), the Court of Appeals of Georgia stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">The replay of a portion of the videotape is not a recall of a witness, but rather the verbatim repetition of testimony already in evidence. \u201cSince counsel in argument clearly have the right to comment on the evidence, it is not improper for them to repeat what testimony was, to read from documents which have been admitted in evidence, or to read from admitted transcripts of recordings played for the jury.\u201d <em>Ramsey v. State, </em>165 Ga.App. 854, 859, 303 S.E.2d 32 (1983). As the videotape statement had been admitted into evidence, we find no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in allowing counsel to replay the tape rather than having a transcript prepared and read.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The Supreme Court of Georgia subsequently agreed with this analysis, holding that counsel in closing may \u201cproperly replay a portion of a videotape admitted into evidence as it is simply the verbatim repetition of testimony already in evidence.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>268 Ga. 354, 490 S.E.2d 75, 82 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Other jurisdictions similarly agree. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Muhlenbruch, </em>634 F.3d 987, 1001 (8th Cir. 2011) (court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the government to play the videotape during closing arguments); <em>People v. Gross, </em>265 Ill.App.3d 74, 202 Ill.Dec. 250, 637 N.E.2d 789, 791-92 (1994) (\u201c[N]o abuse of discretion in the decision to allow the replay of limited excerpts of videotaped evidence for the purpose of summary during closing argument.\u201d); <em>State v. Bonanno, </em>373 So.2d 1284, 1292 (La. 1979) (\u201cBecause the tape recorded statements were properly admitted into evidence at trial, the court did not err in allowing the state to replay the tapes during its closing argument.\u201d); <em>State v. Marinez, </em>324 Wis.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>282, 781 N.W.2d 511, 519 (2010) (determination whether to allow video statements during closing argument is a matter within the court\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Defense counsel below recognized that the prosecutor could have read from a transcript of the recordings below. This is consistent with Maryland law that \u201cthe trial judge ha[s] discretion to permit counsel in closing argument to read from portions of the trial transcript.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 727, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). <em>Accord Yuen v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 109, 118, 403 A.2d 819 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized that, because playing a recording during closing argument is analogous to reading from a transcript, it is not an abuse of discretion to allow a party to replay a recording during closing argument. <em>United States v. Guess, </em>745 F.2d 1286, 1288 (9th Cir. 1984) (\u201c[T]he use of tape recordings in oral argument falls within the discretion of the trial j\u00fcdge as does the use of exhibits or trial testimony transcripts.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1225, 105 S.Ct. 1219, 84 L.Ed.2d 360 (1985); <em>Fields v. Commonwealth, </em>12 S.W.3d 275, 281-82 (Ky. 2000) (\u201cAs for closing argument, attorneys are generally allowed to replay excerpts from recorded testimony, which is analogous to reading excerpts from the record.\u201d). We agree with this analysis and hold that the trial court has discretion to allow a party, during closing argument, to replay portions of a recording admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellant contends that the court in this case abused its discretion in allowing the State to replay the recordings in closing argument because, although the recordings were played for the jury, they were not physically admitted into evidence. He asserts that this \u201cwas analogous to permitting the introduction of evidence out of order.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">As the circuit court noted, although the recordings themselves were not in evidence, \u201cthe words [were] in.\u201d Because a party is entitled during closing argument to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the evidence, counsel may repeat the testimony by replaying the recording that the jury already heard in evidence, similar to reading a transcript of testimony. Accordingly, it was not an abuse of discretion by the circuit court to permit the prosecutor to utilize the previously played recording in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Detective Lewis testified that the Statement of Charges reflected that \u201ca witness saw a short, stocky person wearing a snowflake hat shooting into the car.\u201d He testified that the witness was Ms. Carter. Julie Kempton, a forensic biologist, testified that two sources of DNA were found on the hat. Appellant was a major contributor to the DNA, and although Ms. Kempton could not identify the minor contributor, she was able to rule out Mr. Copeland. Finally, appellant testified at trial that he was wearing the hat at the time of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. Detective Lewis testified that, at booking, appellant\u2019s height was 5'6\" and his weight was 190 pounds; Mr. Copeland's height was 5'9\" and his weight was 160 pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\">. Several other witnesses saw a black Mustang and heard gunshots, but they did not witness the actual shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b81-17\">. As the State points out, Rule 4-263 has undergone significant changes over time. We will apply the 2014 version of the rule that was in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s trial. <em>See Riggins v. State, </em>223 Md.App. 40, 45 n.1, 115 A.3d 224 (2015) (\"Md. Rule 4-263(d)(3) was revised after appellant was convicted (effective January 1, 2014) .... We shall apply the 2013 version of the rule in effect for appellant\u2019s trial\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b83-13\">. The day before, the State advised the court that it wanted Mr. Copeland present in court \u201cfor identification purposes\" by Ms. Carter. Defense counsel stated: \"This is the first time I\u2019ve heard that this is going to happen.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. The circuit court here did not make a specific finding regarding whether the State committed a discovery violation. Rather, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>considered the parties' arguments, reviewed appellant\u2019s discovery request and the State\u2019s response, and simply stated that it was \"going to permit the show up.\u201d Under the circumstances, we review this case as one in which the trial court ruled that there was no discovery violation that precluded the State from conducting the show up and eliciting testimony regarding the identification of the co-defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">. The State disputes that it knew pretrial that Ms. Carter could identify Mr. Copeland, and there were no factual findings in this regard by the circuit court. We note, however, that the State clearly had some reason to believe at trial that Ms. Carter could give some form of identification of Mr. Copeland. It proffered that it believed that Ms. Carter \"will be able to positively identify\u201d Mr. Copeland, although it subsequently stated that its intent was to have Ms. Carter \"identify Mr. Copeland either by face, and say, yes, that\u2019s him, or that looks like him or whatever she says, then ask her about the physique, whether that\u2019s consistent with the first or the second person or anything to that effect.\u201d Moreover, in responding to the court\u2019s question why the State had not disclosed that Ms. Carter could identify Mr. Copeland in some way, the prosecutor stated that the rules required that the State disclose the identification of a defendant, not a co-defendant or other people at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">. Although the prosecutor did not elaborate on the reasons at that point, the State indicated at an earlier bench conference that it had only a copy of the entire jail call recording, and it did not have the \u201ctechnology to isolate\u201d the portions of the audio recordings that the State wanted the jury to hear from the remainder of the recorded conversations. Thus, it played a portion of the recordings for the jury, stating: \u201cThey will be marked for identification purposes only. They will not go into evidence so that [the jury] cannot take it back into the jury room and hear the parts that are not played.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The State offered to provide transcripts of the audio conversations that were prepared by the Sheriff's Office. Defense counsel objected, arguing that \u201cit's the jury\u2019s job to interpret what is said on the tape, not the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s.\u201d The court sustained the objection, barring the State from publishing the transcripts to the jury or admitting them into evidence. <em>Cf. Marshall v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 572, 575-80, 923 A.2d 143 (2007) (court did not abuse discretion in admitting transcript of recording prepared by the Detective assigned to the case, where the court instructed the jury that the transcript was only an aid to assist the jury, but the jury was required to determine the content of the recording).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
