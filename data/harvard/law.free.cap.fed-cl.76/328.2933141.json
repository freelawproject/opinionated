Petitioner claims that a Hepatitis B vaccination (\u201cHBV\u201d) caused neutropenia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and arthritis, and raises several objections to the Special Master\u2019s decision. These objections concern the degree of attention given to the record by the Special Master; the Special Master\u2019s determinations regarding the credibility of petitioner and her expert witness; - and the amount and nature of the questions posed by the Special Master during the hearing on petitioner\u2019s claims. For the reasons below, the Court sustains the Special Master\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Petitioner, born on November 28, 1959, received her HBV on April 28, 1998. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 1 at 1-2. She filed her petition for compensation on April 2, 2001, <em>see </em>Pet. at 1, claiming that the HBV was followed by her \u201cfirst and marked problem\u201d with pneumonia in August 1998, \u201csignificant knee pain\u201d a few weeks later, then \u201cflu-like symptoms at least once or twice a month\u201d (later diagnosed as \u201cacute pharyngitis with viral syndrome\u201d), and finally \u201cpersistent canker sores\u201d that last \u201cfor weeks at a time\u201d and are accompanied by constant sore throats, swollen glands, low-grade fever, and chronic fatigue. <em>Id. </em>Ex. 13 ITU 3-4, 6-8. During a January 8, 2002 status conference, petitioner identified her theory of injury as \u201cHepatitis B vaccine-related autoimmune neutropenia.\u201d <em>See </em>Sp. -Mstr. Order (Jan. 8,2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">At her request, petitioner was granted extensions of time in which to compile a record for the Special Master\u2019s review and to secure the opinion of a medical expert. <em>See, e.g., </em>Final Enl. Bef; Invol. Dism. (Nov. 27, 2002); Mot. for Ext. (Jan. 5, 2004). While proceeding <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>petitioner initially produced the medical opinion of Professor Boyd E. Haley, Ph.D., which the Special Master rejected on January 23, 2003 as failing to prove actual causation. <em>See Sp. </em>Mstr.\u2019s Order to Show Cause (Jan. 23, 2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After petitioner produced the expert opinion of Harold E. But-tram, M.D., and the government responded, the Special Master rejected Dr. Buttram\u2019s report, ruling that it, too, was inadequate. <em>See </em>Sp. Mstr.\u2019s Order to Show Cause (July 2, 2003) .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In January and May 2004, petitioner filed the medical reports of Ariel Distenfeld, M.D. <em>See </em>Distenfeld Aff. (Jan. 29, 2004); Pet.\u2019s Ex. D (May 6, 2004). The government responded with the medical report of Gregory H. Reaman, M.D. Resp.\u2019s Ex. A (July 8, 2004) .</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">On October 19, 2005, the Special Master convened a hearing at which petitioner, petitioner\u2019s expert, and respondent\u2019s expert tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tified. During her testimony, petitioner was asked by the Special Master to explain three medical records which indicated that the symptoms of injuries and illnesses allegedly caused by the HBV actually predated her immunization. Tr. (Oct. 19, 2005) (\u201cTr\u201d) at 28-32. On September 1,1998, she apparently told an orthopedist, Dr. Jonathan Glashow, that her problem with her right knee \u201cha[d] been going on for about six months.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 7. The notes from a September 3, 1998 appointment with Dr. Avaz of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center state that petitioner informed the doctor that she was \u201cin general good health except for last 6 months had episodes of ? sore throat, tactile temp x 2-3 days, fatigue, had episode of pneumonia,\u201d right knee pain, and \u201crecurrent cold sores.\u201d Pet\u2019s Ex. 6 at 1. And the notes dated September 9, 1998, from the evaluation of a physical therapist recommended by Dr. Gla-show, state that \u201c[approximately] 6 mo[nths] ago [petitioner] noticed minor discomfort in [right] knee.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 12 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Petitioner contended that her statement to Dr. Glashow was \u201can estimation,\u201d and that she \u201cwasn\u2019t really thinking that precisely about the time frame.\u201d Tr. at 28. She speculated .that the doctor might have posed possible time frames of a week, six months, a year, and two years, and that six months would thus have been \u201cthe closest to what I could say.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 106-09. Concerning the statement to Dr. Avaz, petitioner claimed not to remember giving a six-month figure, and explained that because she was in such pain and taking \u201cAdvil, for the knee,\u201d she was \u201ckind of in a daze.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. She hypothesized that if she said \u201csix months,\u201d she \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking of a specific month,\u201d but instead used \u201csix months\u201d as an expression of any period of time less than six months. <em>Id. </em>And she testified that she did not recall telling the physical therapist that her knee problem had existed for six months, <em>id. </em>at 31, guessing that she \u201creally didn\u2019t think it was important when exactly the symptoms began.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. Distenfeld, opined that the antibodies created in petitioner\u2019s body in response to the HBV could have attacked the neutrophils in her blood, resulting in low counts of white blood cells in general (leukopenia), and of neutrophils in particular (neutropenia). <em>See </em>Tr. at 52-56. Since neutrophils destroy bacteria and viruses, a low neutrophil count leaves the body susceptible to infections. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61. Rather than the range of 1800-6000 neutro-phils per microliter of blood, which is considered normal, <em>see </em>Distenfeld Aff. at 2,- petitioner\u2019s blood tests taken after she received the HBV show abnormally low levels \u2014 approximately 960 in late August 1998, 580 in September 1999, and then varying from a low of about 500 in August 2000 to a normal count of 1900 in June 2005. <em>See </em>Tr. at 86-90; <em>see also </em>Pet.\u2019s Ex. 9 at 28; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 8 at 6; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 11 at 20; Pet.\u2019s Ex. L at 2. Doctor Distenfeld testified that petitioner suffered from \u201cmultiple infections,\u201d including pneumonia, \u201crecurrent pharyngitis, some swelling of lymph nodes, [and] fatigue,\u201d beginning three months after receipt of the HBV. Tr. at 51. He posited that neutropenia resulting from an autoimmune reaction to a vaccination would normally take two to four months after the vaccination to develop, and that petitioner\u2019s testimony of symptoms occurring three months after receiving the HBV is consistent with this time frame. <em>Id. </em>at 56; <em>see also id. </em>at 99 (explaining neutropenia could occur \u201cas early as two weeks\u201d after the triggering event).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">In response to questioning from the Special Master, petitioner\u2019s expert conceded that he had not seen records of any complete blood counts performed for petitioner after June 1992, when her neutrophil count of 1980 was \u201cin the lower end of the normal range,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 86, and prior to August 1998, and thus could <em>not know </em>whether she had neutropenia during that time period. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 93. He also conceded that the existence of symptoms of infection prior to the date of the HBV \u201cwould put some doubt on [his opinion], no question about it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. Doctor Dis-tenfeld also stated that he was basing his opinion on \u201ca history\u201d that was \u201cprovided\u201d to him, copies of blood tests and counts, \u201cand some very few, actually, original medical records,\u201d the latter being \u201cjust very few pages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Reaman, testified that rather than causing her infections, it was more likely the case that petitioner\u2019s diminished neutrophil count in August 1998, on the heels of her pneumonia, was the result of a viral infection. <em>Id. </em>at 120. He also explained that bacterial and severe fungal infections \u2014 but not viral infections \u2014 are \u201ccomplications of neutropenia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. After petitioner was re-called and asked by the Special Master about the \u201cviral syndromes\u201d to which she earlier testified, petitioner explained that she does not distinguish between bacterial and viral when she uses the term \u201cviral,\u201d and that she had not been hospitalized \u201cfor a severe fungal infection or a severe bacterial infection.\u201d Tr. at 166-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">After the hearing, the parties were given time to supplement the record. On April 13, 2006, petitioner filed a motion for leave to amend her petition to add a claim for significant aggravation. <em>See </em>Mot. for Leave to Amend Pet. Petitioner submitted a supplemental affidavit from Dr. Distenfeld. Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32. The expert stated that he had reviewed \u201cadditional medical records,\u201d and had not changed his opinion in the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 1. He explained that \u201c[t]he new records indicate that [petitioner] was in good health prior to the vaccination with the exception of two small canker sores on her inner lip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Basing his opinion on the medical clinic records from the day she was given the HBV, he concluded she \u201cwas in general good health previous to the vaccination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (citing Pet.\u2019s Ex. 31). He opined that \u201cthe vaccination greatly aggravated [petitioner\u2019s] previous low normal neutrophil count condition and led to the substantial deterioration of her health including frequent colds, fatigue and a bout of pneumonia and recurring illnesses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Special Master denied petitioner compensation in an opinion dated September 27, 2006. He based his decision on \u201cfour pointed, dispositive issues.\u201d <em>Doe v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>No. [redacted]V, slip op. at 3 (Sp.Mstr. Sept. 27, 2006). First, he did not find credible the petitioner\u2019s explanations of her statements to medical providers, in early September 1998, that her symptoms began six months prior. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Based on the medical records reflecting these statements, and the records showing persistent canker sores prior to the April 28, 1998 HBV, the Special Master determined it was more likely than not that petitioner had cold sores and bouts of sore throat, tactile temperature, and fatigue, as well as knee pain, all prior to her Hepatitis B vaccination. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Second, the Special Master gave Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion \u201cno evi-dentiary weight,\u201d <em>id., </em>due to the expert\u2019s admission that he did not review all of petitioner\u2019s medical records before forming his opinion, and the expert\u2019s assumption, contrary to the Special Master\u2019s findings, that petitioner was in good health prior to the vaccination. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Thus, the Special Master found that the expert failed to establish that the HBV was the legal cause of petitioner\u2019s neutropenia. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Third, with no expert on arthritis testifying in support of her claim, <em>see </em>Tr. at 59-60, petitioner\u2019s arthritis claim rested on the diagnoses and clinical observations contained in the medical records. While an orthopaedic surgeon treating petitioner noted that she exhibited \u201cpossible autoimmune arthritis,\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. I at 1, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging of her right knee showed \u201cpatello-femoral degenerative disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The Special Master determined that the physician\u2019s records \u201cdo not express \u2018a medical theory causally connecting\u2019 Ms. [Doe\u2019s] April 28, 1998 Hepatitis B vaccination with Ms. [Doe\u2019s] arthritis,\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 8 (quoting <em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2005)), and explained no association between the HBV, \u201cpossible autoimmune arthritis,\u201d and the diagnosis of \u201cpatellofemoral degenerative disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The Special Master found that the medical records did not establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the HBV caused petitioner\u2019s arthritis. <em>Id. </em>And fourth, the Special Master found the significant aggravation claim was not proven by petitioner. He noted that petitioner \u201cdid not experience any bacterial infections or fungal infections that are common with chronic neutropenia,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10 (citing Tr. at 70-71, 161, 166-67), and that petitioner\u2019s most recent blood count \u201cshowed no evidence of neutropenia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Pet.\u2019s Ex. L). Because he had given Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion \u201cno evidentiary weight,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>see id. </em>at 6, the Special Master concluded that the expert could not be relied upon to prove that the HBV significantly aggravated a preexisting condition. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On October 26, 2006, petitioner filed her motion for review pursuant to Rules 23 and 24 of the Vaccine Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (\u201cVR\u201d). She raises three objections to the Special Master\u2019s decision. Petitioner contends that the Special Master conducted a \u201csuperficial review of the factual record\u201d that deprived her of a full and fair hearing. Mot. for Rev. at 1-2. She challenges the Special Master\u2019s determination of her expert\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 2-6. And she argues that \u201ccritical evidence\u201d was ignored by the Special Master. <em>Id. </em>at 6-14. This third objection encompasses the question of petitioner\u2019s credibility, <em>id. </em>at 6-10, the alleged existence of evidence in the record supporting the significant aggravation claim, <em>id. </em>at 10-11, and a complaint that the Special Master assumed the role of \u201czealous advocate for the government\u201d by his extensive questioning of petitioner and her expert. <em>Id. </em>at 11-14. Petitioner argues that the Special Master\u2019s decision should be reversed as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and not in accordance with law. <em>Id. </em>at 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">A. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\n<em>1. Court\u2019s Standard of Review of a Special Master\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Under the Vaccine Act, the Special Master must award compensation if, \u201con the record as a whole,\u201d he finds \u201cthat the petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d the claims in the petition. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1)(A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Act provides that \u201c[t]he special master or court may not make such a finding based on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or by medical opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1). The Special Master must consider all the \u201crelevant medical and scientific evidence contained in the record,\u201d including any \u201cdiagnosis, conclusion, [or] medical judgment ... regarding the nature, causation, and aggravation of petitioner\u2019s illness, disability, injury, condition, or death\u201d and \u201cthe results of any diagnostic or evaluative test which are contained in the record and the summaries and conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300aa-13(b)(l). The Act further specifies that \u201c[a]ny such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary shall not be binding on the special master or court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Special Master is entrusted with \u201cevaluating the weight to be afforded to any\u201d of these sources of information. <em>Id.; see also Bradley v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>991 F.2d 1570, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1993) (describing credibility determinations of a special master as \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d by a reviewing court).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">The Special Master\u2019s decision may be reviewed by this Court, which may \u201cset aside any findings of fact or conclusion of law of the special master found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law and issue its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(e)(2)(B). Findings of fact are to be reviewed under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard; legal questions are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>and an abuse of discretion standard is used for discretionary rulings. <em>See Munn v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>970 F.2d 863, 870 n. 10 (Fed.Cir.1992). With respect to arbitrary and capricious review, \u201cno uniform definition of this standard has emerged,\u201d but it is \u201ca highly deferential standard of review\u201d such that \u201c[i]f the special master has considered the relevant evidence of record, drawn plausible inferences and articulated a rational basis for the decision, reversible error will be extremely difficult to demonstrate.\u201d <em>Hines v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>940 F.2d 1518, 1527-28 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\n<em>2. Standard of Causation in Vaccine Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Causation-in-fact \u2014 the basis for the legal entitlement to compensation when a petitioner\u2019s injury is either not listed in the Vaccine Injury Table of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-14 or did not occur within the time period set forth in the Table \u2014 must be proven under either one of two formulations adopted by the Federal Circuit. <em>See Pafford v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>451 F.3d 1352, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2006). Under one formulation, the petitioner must establish that the vaccine was both a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the injury and a substantial factor in causing the injury. <em>See Shyface v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>165 F.3d 1344, 1352 (Fed.Cir.1999). Under the alternative three-part test more recently articulated by the Circuit, the petitioner must prove \u201c(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury; and (3) a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.\u201d <em>Althen v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>418 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2005). Under either approach, the petitioner bears the burden of proving causation by preponderant evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-13(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Special Master\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">As was described above, petitioner raises several objections to the Special Master\u2019s decision. These concern the comprehensiveness of the decision; the factual determinations made by the Special Master, including the assessment of witness credibility and the weighing of record evidence; and the active role of the Special Master in questioning witnesses. None of the objections warrants setting aside the Special Master\u2019s findings or conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>1. The Lack of a \u201cComprehensive Opinion\u201d Does Not Mean Review was Arbitrary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Petitioner\u2019s first objection appears to be an over-reaction to two sentences in the decision, and a criticism of its length. The Special Master explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">The special master engages usually in a thorough, critical, intellectual analysis of the facts, the medical evidence and the medical testimony under the actual causation standard. However, after considering carefully the record as a whole, the special master determines that a comprehensive opinion is not necessary in this ease. Doe, slip op. at 3 (internal citations omitted). Petitioner, understandably disappointed with the result below, re-characterizes these sentences as an admission of a \u201ccursory examination of the record.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 2. She contends that the Special Master\u2019s decision exhibits a \u201csuperficial review of the factual record\u201d resulting in \u201cmultiple errors,\u201d an \u201cincomplete assessment of the medical record,\u201d and a \u201csummary dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These alleged shortcomings, in turn, are .said to reveal violations of the Special Master\u2019s obligation to \u201cafford[] each party a full and fair opportunity to present its case\u201d and to \u201cgovern[ ] by the principles of fundamental fairness to both parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (quoting VR 3(b), 8(c)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">But in placing special importance on the phrase \u201ca thorough, critical, intellectual analysis\u201d and the word \u201ccomprehensive,\u201d petitioner ignores other, highly relevant words of the Special Master \u2014 that the decision was written \u201cafter considering carefully the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 3. Although the decision might be relatively brief, the level of detail in the discussion section confirms that the Special Master carefully considered the full record in reaching his decision. <em>See id. </em>at 3-10. A review of the transcript from the October 19, 2005 hearing also shows that the Special Master was very well-acquainted with the medical records submitted by petitioner \u2014 indeed, that is one of petitioner\u2019s objections to the proceeding below. <em>See </em>Mot. for Rev. at 11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">All it appears the Special Master meant by stating that \u201ca comprehensive opinion is not necessary\u201d was that the \u201cfour pointed, dis-positive issues\u201d he identified obviated the need to discuss such matters as the plausibility of petitioner\u2019s medical theory that HBV can cause neutropenia. <em>See Doe, </em>slip op. at 3. If he is right, then the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cthorough, critical, intellectual analysis\u201d of these matters is irrelevant. There is no requirement that decisions of the Special Master be more thorough and comprehensive than necessary to decide the merits of a petition. Rather, the Special Master must \u201cconsider[] the relevant evidence, draw[] plausible inferences and articulate[ ] a rational basis for the decision.\u201d <em>Hines, </em>940 F.2d at 1528. To determine whether this obligation was met, the Court turns to petitioner\u2019s substantive objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\n<em>2. The Determination of Expert Credibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Special Master, \u201cgiven circumstances that are peculiar to this case,\u201d made the determination <em>to </em>\u201caecord[] Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion no evidentiary weight.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip, op at 6. This determination rested primarily on two grounds. First, Dr. Distenfeld testified that he had formed his opinion after having seen \u201cvery few pages\u201d of petitioner\u2019s \u201coriginal medical records,\u201d and based it instead on a \u201chistory\u201d that was given to him. Tr. at 83-84; <em>see Doe, </em>slip op. at 6-7. Second, Dr. Distenfeld, on the basis of the information he did review, assumed that petitioner did not suffer from any symptoms of infection prior to receiving the HBV on April 28, 1998. <em>See </em>Tr. at 91-92; <em>see also Doe, </em>slip op. at 7. But the Special Master had determined, based on petitioner\u2019s medical records, that several symptoms pre-dated the receipt of the HBV. <em>See Doe, </em>slip op. at 6. During the hearing, when these records were brought to Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s attention, he acknowledged that such a finding would unquestionably \u201cput some doubt on\u201d his opinion that the HBV caused petitioner\u2019s neutropenia. Tr. 94. The Special Master concluded \u201cwithout doubt that Dr. Distenfeld did not formulate his opinion upon an independent, objective appraisal of Ms. [Doe\u2019s] medical history developed through his thorough review of Ms. [Doe\u2019s] medical records.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Petitioner objects to this credibility determination. She argues that it is based on just \u201cone question and one answer during the heat of the hearing,\u201d when Dr. Distenfeld, who \u201cis not a professional witness,\u201d \u201capparently forgot what records he reviewed\u201d when confronted by \u201cintense questioning.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 3. To support her contention that Dr. Distenfeld reviewed her complete medical record, petitioner cites various statements of the expert. <em>See id. </em>at 3-6. In his initial affidavit, he stated he had \u201cexamined [Jane Doe\u2019s] medical records by various physicians and providers, dating from 1992 through the present.\u201d Distenfeld Aff. at 1. In a later addendum, he stated that, \u201creflected in [petitioner\u2019s] medical records\u201d was evidence of \u201crecurrent infections\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">She did in fact develop[] an infection at the beginning of August, 3 months after the vaccination. She was treated for pneumonia with weakness, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing and fever. This illness continued for the entire month of August with on going fatigue, dizziness, cough and intermittent fever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Pet.\u2019s Ex. D at 1. After the hearing, Dr. Distenfeld submitted a supplemental affidavit that referenced \u201cadditional medical records,\u201d including respondent\u2019s Exhibit E and petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 30 and 31. <em>See </em>Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32. And during the hearing, the expert testified as to aspects of petitioner\u2019s medical history, such as her August 1998 bout of pneumonia and the results of blood counts. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. at 67-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">A special master\u2019s \u201cassessments of the credibility of the witnesses\u201d have been described by the Federal Circuit as \u201cvirtually unchallengeable on appeal.\u201d <em>Lampe v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>219 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2000). This deference rests on the special master\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in determining credibility because he saw the witnesses and heard the testimony.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>991 F.2d at 1575; <em>see also Hodges v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>9 F.3d 958, 961 (Fed.Cir.1993) (explaining that our Court \u201cis not to second guess the Special Masters[\u2019] fact-intensive conclusions\u201d under the \u201cuniquely deferential\u201d standard of review in Vaccine Act cases). Petitioner has not identified any reason to disturb the Special Master\u2019s assessment of her expert\u2019s credibility. In none of the documents submitted by the expert did Dr. Distenfeld provide an entire list of the medical records he examined. <em>See </em>Distenfeld Aff.; Pet.\u2019s Ex. D; Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>While review of a transcript is no perfect substitute for the observation of a witness\u2019s testimony \u2014 one of the strong reasons militating in favor of deference to the credibility determinations of special masters, <em>see Bradley, </em>991 F.2d at 1575 \u2014 such review does not give the impression that the expert misspoke when he admitted he had seen \u201cvery few pages\u201d of petitioner\u2019s \u201coriginal medical records,\u201d and had reviewed a \u201chistory\u201d given to him. Tr. at 83-84. Nor was there anything about the questioning that would induce memory difficulties. <em>See id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Doctor Distenfeld testified that' his opinion rested on the assumption, based on petitioner\u2019s earlier testimony at the hearing, that petitioner had no medical problems before receiving the HBV. <em>See </em>Tr. at 91-92. When asked if he had reviewed petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 6, the medical records from the September 3, 1998 appointment with Dr. Avaz, Dr. Disten-feld responded, \u201cI think I did, but I don\u2019t have an immediate recollection of it.\u201d Tr. at 93. These records were the basis of the Special Master\u2019s determination that several symptoms of infection were experienced pri- or to the administration of the HBV. <em>See Doe, </em>slip op. at 4-6. Asked about this recitation of petitioner\u2019s medical history, the expert answered, \u201cI think I would have to really see if this is correct, if the history is correct, but if it is correct, I might have to assume that [petitioner] had some symptoms prior to the vaccination.\u201d Tr. at 94. As the Special Master observed, Dr. Distenfeld failed to address the September 3,1998 notes of Dr. Avaz in his supplemental affidavit submitted after the hearing. <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 7-8; see Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32. The expert ignored that recitation of petitioner\u2019s medical history, and instead rendered the opinion that petitioner \u201cwas in general good health previous to the vaccination,\u201d based on the records from the medical clinic the day she was given the HBV \u2014 which only noted \u201ctwo small canker sores on her inner lip.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32 at 1-2. He thus ignored evidence the Special Master found \u201chighly probative\u201d under \u201cFederal Circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Special Master, having heard Dr. Dis-tenfeld\u2019s testimony and having reviewed the record, concluded that the expert\u2019s opinion was not .fully informed by the evidence and was not credible. <em>See id </em>at 6-8. These findings are amply supported by the record and will not be set aside. <em>See Lampe, </em>219 F.3d at 1361-62 (accepting special master\u2019s weighing of evidence and his determination that experts who relied on evidence rejected by him were not persuasive).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>3. The Record Supports the Special Master\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Petitioner\u2019s third objection is that the Special Master\u2019s decision \u201c[i]gnores [cjritical [e]vidence.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 6. Under this objection, petitioner primarily discusses the determination of her credibility, <em>see id. </em>at 6-10, but also discusses the evidence of significant aggravation and the Special Master\u2019s active role at the hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 10-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\n<em>a. The determination of petitioner\u2019s credibility.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">The Special Master identified three medical records from early September 1998, which indicated that petitioner had told medical providers that symptoms she now attributes to her receipt of the HBV actually dated back six months \u2014 eight weeks, that is, prior to the vaccination. <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 4-6. The Special Master gave petitioner the opportunity to explain these discrepancies during the hearing, <em>see </em>Tr. at 28-32, and found her explanations lacking in credibility. <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 5. These explanations included speculation that six months was the closest approximation from a list of choices suggested by one doctor, <em>see </em>Tr. at 28; that she was \u201ckind of in a <em>daze\u201d </em>due to knee pain and Advil, <em>id. </em>at 30; that six months to her means \u201cno greater than six months,\u201d <em>id; </em>and that she did not think that it was important to give accurate information to a doctor concerning when symptoms of an illness began. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Petitioner disputes the Special Master\u2019s interpretation of her medical records. She contends that the pieces of information regarding the onset of her knee pain were \u201cclearly approximations.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 7. But although one record states that her knee \u201c[p]roblem has been going on for about six months,\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 7, and the other uses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>symbol for \u201capproximately\u201d to modify her statement of minor discomfort noticed six months prior, <em>see </em>Pet.\u2019s Ex. 12 at 2, it is doubtful that- an individual would use \u201csix months\u201d as an approximation regarding a symptom that began just three months prior. <em>See </em>Tr. at 106-07 (petitioner testifying that knee discomfort began \u201cprobably, around June <em>or </em>so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Regarding the records from Dr. Avaz, <em>see </em>Pet\u2019s Ex. 6 at 1-2, petitioner argues that the note stating she was \u201cin general good health except for last 6 months\u201d should be read to mean that only the \u201crecurrent cold sores\u201d dated back that far. Mot. for Rev. at 7-9. She cites the clinic record from the date of her vaccination to support this interpretation, as that record noted only mouth sores as a current medical complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see </em>Pet.\u2019s Ex. 31. According to petitioner, \u201c[t]his record is dispositive <em>of </em>the time conflict issue.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 8. But this interpretation does not easily mesh with the actual notes written by Dr. Avaz, which stated that petitioner \u201cfor last 6 months had episodes of ? sore throat, tactile temp x 2-3 days, fatigue, had episode of pneumonia 8/98 treated with PCN x 10 days,\u201d then described her treatment for knee pain, and added: \u201cAlso [symptoms of] recurrent cold sores.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. 6 at 1; see <em>also </em>Mot. for Rev. at 7. Thus, the reference to the \u201crecurrent cold sores\u201d is added with an \u201calso,\u201d and is separated from the other symptoms by the description of two discrete events \u2014 petitioner\u2019s pneumonia and her visit to a sports doctor for her knee pain. The notes cannot be naturally read so that the six months time period is based on the cold sores that are \u201c[a]lso\u201d added to the notes at the end of that paragraph. The Special Master\u2019s interpretation of these notes as indicating that the symptoms of a sore throat, tactile temperature, and fatigue were the \u201cepisodes\u201d occurring for the \u201clast 6 months\u201d is certainly a more plausible and natural reading of the notes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The Special Master was correct to observe case law that favors contemporaneous medical records over oral testimony, especially when the former contradicts the latter. <em>See Doe, </em>slip op. at 4-5. Thus he was not arbitrary or capricious in adhering to well-grounded law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">[T]he Supreme Court counsels that oral testimony in conflict with contemporaneous documentary evidence deserves little weight. [The Federal Circuit\u2019s] predecessor adopted the same principle____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Medical records, in general, warrant consideration as trustworthy evidence. The records contain information supplied to or by health professionals to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. With proper treatment hanging in the balance, accuracy has an extra premium. These records are also generally contemporaneous to the medical events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3g\"><em>Cucuras v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>993 F.2d 1525, 1528 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 396, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1947); <em>Montgomery Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. United States, </em>222 Ct.Cl. 356, 375, 615 F.2d 1318 (1980)). Petitioner\u2019s contemporaneous medical records show that in early September 1998, for the purpose of receiving medical treatment, she told medical providers that her knee pain and some of her symptoms of infection had been in existence for roughly six months. She explained that \u201csix months\u201d was an approximation for time periods of three months concerning her knee pain, and one month concerning the other symptoms. The Special Master found these explanations to be incredible. Doe, slip op. at 5. Based on the record, the Court cannot disagree. And given the Special Master\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in determining credibility,\u201d which makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>such judgments \u201cvirtually unreviewable,\u201d the Court must uphold the Special Master\u2019s determination. <em>Bradley, </em>991 F.2d at 1575; <em>see also Hodges, </em>9 F.3d at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\n<em>b. The significant aggravation claim,.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Just shy of six months after her hearing, petitioner moved for leave to amend her petition to add a significant aggravation count. <em>See </em>Mot. for Leave to Amend Pet. (April 13, 2006). This count was supported by the opinion of Dr. Distenfeld, who submitted a supplemental affidavit which touched on the issue. <em>See </em>Pet.\u2019s Ex. 32 at 2. In this supplemental affidavit, Dr. Distenfeld denied that petitioner suffered from any pre-vaccination symptoms of infection. He stated that petitioner\u2019s only medical problem as of the date of receiving the HBV was \u201ctwo small canker sores,\u201d which he explained to be \u201ca common occurrence much like the common cold\u201d and to be of unknown origin. <em>Id. </em>at 1. He opined that \u201cthe vaccination greatly aggravated [petitioner\u2019s] previous low normal neutrophil count condition and led to the substantial deterioration of her health including frequent colds, fatigue and a bout of pneumonia and recurring illnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Doctor Distenfeld had previously opined that \u201cthe vaccine dramatically aggravated a low normal neutrophil count in [petitioner\u2019s] case.\u201d Pet.\u2019s Ex. D at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">For the reasons explained above, the Special Master \u201cd[id] not credit Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>slip op. at 10. Thus, he determined that petitioner had failed to prove that the vaccine actually caused a significant aggravation in her condition. <em>See id. </em>And for the same reasons already stated, the Court cannot reverse this credibility determination. Doctor Distenfeld doggedly stuck to his assumption that petitioner suffered no symptoms of infection prior to the vaccination, even though the medical records stating otherwise were brought to his attention by the Special Master. <em>See </em>Tr. at 93-94. It was not arbitrary for the Special Master to conclude that Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion was not credible. <em>See Lampe, </em>219 F.3d at 1361-62. And without Dr. Distenfeld\u2019s opinion on the matter, proof of causation was absent. <em>See Althen, </em>418 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>c. The Special Master\u2019s role at the hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Petitioner\u2019s final objection is that the Special Master \u201czealously investigated and prosecuted the case for the government.\u201d Mot. for Rev. at 11. Petitioner complains that, by her estimate, the Special Master asked over seventy questions of her expert, in comparison with fewer than sixty posed by counsel for the respondent, and asked fifty-eight questions of her, compared to just twenty from respondent\u2019s counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. According to petitioner, the Special Master\u2019s active involvement in the hearing was contrary to \u201cthe traditional role of a judge in a civil matter,\u201d violated \u201cthe explicit intent of the vaccine act as being a less adversarial forum than civil litigation,\u201d and \u201cimpermissibly increas[ed] [petitioner\u2019s] burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Petitioner\u2019s objection in this regard appears to stem from a misunderstanding of the role of the Special Master. The Vaccine Act authorizes the Special Master to \u201crequire such evidence as may be reasonable and necessary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-12(d)(3)(B)(i). The Act also provides that \u201c[t]here may be no discovery in a proceeding on a petition other than the discovery required by the special master.\u201d <em>Id. </em>300aa-12(d)(3)(B). Additionally, the Act provides that the special masters shall promulgate their own rules, which must \u201cprovide for limitations on discovery and allow the special masters to replace the usual rules of discovery in civil actions in the United States Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>300aa-12(2)(E). As a result, while conducting proceedings expeditiously, flexibly, and in a less adversarial manner, a special master may \u201crequir[e] such evidence as may be appropriate[ ] in order to prepare a decision[ ] including findings of act and conclusions of law.\u201d VR 3(b). The special master has the prerogative to \u201cquestion a witness,\u201d and may do so without being \u201cbound by common law or statutory rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. 8(b), (c).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Thus, instead of being passive recipients of information, such as jurors, special masters are given an active role in determining the facts relevant to Vaccine Act petitions. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>reason that proceedings are more expeditious in the hands of special masters is that the special masters have the expertise and experience to know the type of information that is most probative of a claim. Under the procedural framework erected for Vaccine Act cases, the Federal Circuit has noted that \u201cthe permissible scope of the special master\u2019s inquiry is virtually unlimited.\u201d <em>Whitecotton v. Sec\u2019y of HHS, </em>81 F.3d 1099, 1108 (Fed.Cir. 1996); <em>see also Munn, </em>970 F.2d at 871 (describing Congress\u2019 designation of the special master as that of an \u201cexpert\u201d and acknowledging that special masters are entitled to \u201cthe special statutory deference in fact-finding normally reserved for specialized agencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Petitioner has not identified any questions from the Special Master that exhibit any partisanship or antagonism, and a review of the transcript yields none. Merely because the Special Master, an expert in whose care the ultimate fact determinations are entrusted, asked many questions of witnesses does not mean the Special Master crossed the line between fact-finder and prosecutor; rather, it means he did his job. Petitioner\u2019s objection to his role in the hearing is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">After reviewing the submissions of the parties, the evidence in the record, the transcript of the hearing, and the decision of the Special Master, for the foregoing reasons the Court concludes that the Special Master did not err in denying compensation to petitioner under the Vaccine Act. The decision of the Special Master is SUSTAINED. The petition for review is DISMISSED with prejudice. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment for respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">.

Mstr.\u2019s Order to Show Cause (July 2, 2003) at 4. The Special Master agreed with respondent\u2019s assessment that Dr. Buttram's statement did not satisfy the actual-causation standard, as it was found to rely solely on a temporal association between the HBV and petitioner's health problems and lacked a scientific explanation and a logical sequence of cause and effect. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\">.
