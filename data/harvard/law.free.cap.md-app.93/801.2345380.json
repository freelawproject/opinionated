Wagner, was awarded a lump-sum payment of $60,000 by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission on April 19,1991, pursuant to Article 101, section 49 of the Maryland Annotated Code (1985) (repealed and reenacted 1991).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The award was subsequently affirmed by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. A timely appeal was noted by appellant, C &amp; R Contractors. The appellant alleges here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">I. The trial court erred in finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion by awarding the claimant a lump sum for sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) for reasons that were not either a business or living necessity and which would reduce his weekly benefits to an unacceptably low amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>II. The trial court erred in finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had the legal authority and/or jurisdiction to award a lump sum payment for sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) to a claimant found to be permanently totally disabled when the initial forty five thousand dollars ($45,000) had not been paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">III. The circuit court erred in denying the appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Appellee was injured on January 8, 1980. After first receiving temporary total disability and vocational rehabilitation, he was ultimately found to be permanently totally disabled and awarded benefits at the rate of $106 per week. Thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of section 49, he requested and was awarded a lump-sum payment in the amount of $60,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">During the proceedings for the requested lump-sum payment, the appellee primarily proffered that a lump sum was required to facilitate the purchase of a $159,000 house. He proffered that the house was necessary because he had been living with his wife and two children in a house with his parents. This living arrangement, according to appellee, forced him and his wife to sleep in the same room with their children separated only by a partition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also stated that he wanted to buy a house in order to build equity for his wife in case he died, given that he could not procure life insurance. Additionally, the lump-sum award was to be used to pay off his debts. As we have said, the Commission ultimately awarded a lump-sum payment that was later affirmed on appeal by the circuit court. We shall first address appellant\u2019s second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">Did the trial court err in finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had the legal authority and/or jurisdiction to award a lump-sum payment for sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) in a permanent total disability case where the initial forty five thousand dollars ($45,000) had not been paid?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Appellant argues that \u201ca lump sum may not be granted for a sum which exceeds the compensation benefits awarded to the Claimant and allowed by law.\u201d In support of this contention, appellant cites to section 36(l)(a) of Article 101<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which states that payments under that section cannot exceed $45,000. That section, however, also provides that if total disability shall continue after a total of $45,000 has been paid, then \u201cfurther weekly payments ... shall be paid to him during such disability.\u201d Md.Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 36 (1985) (repealed and reenacted 1991). It is the interplay of these two provisions that gives rise to the question raised by appellant. To resolve the question, we must determine the result of this intrasectional interaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">In <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 92-93, 581 A.2d 9 (1990), the Court of Appeals recently reviewed the standards of statutory construction, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">When interpreting a statute, the starting point is the wording of the relevant provisions. If \u201cthe language in question [is] so clearly consistent with apparent purpose (and not productive of any absurd result) ... further research [is] unnecessary.\u201d ...

It noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">The Workman's Compensation Act was passed to promote the general welfare of the State and <em>to prevent the State and its taxpayers from having to care for injured workmen and their dependents, </em>when under the law as it previously existed, such workmen could not recover damages for their injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 628, 569 A.2d 697 (quoting <em>Paul v.

The Court further opined:</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The short of it is that the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANdN\">should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.

While the Act is to be liberally construed, a court is not at liberty to disregard its plain meaning. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We also stated that \u201cno presumption of correctness attaches to the Commission\u2019s interpretations of the pertinent provisions of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273-74, 511 A.2d 541. <em>See also Symons v. R.D. Grier &amp; Sons Co., </em>10 Md.App. 498, 500, 271 A.2d 398 (1970) (explaining that factual decisions of the Commission are <em>prima facie </em>correct while decisions involving questions of law are not).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Prior to 1973, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act did not contain a provision for continuing payment. By Chapter 671 of the Acts of 1973, the legislature added a provision to Section 36 providing that irrespective of $45,000 being stated as a maximum: \u201cif the employee\u2019s total disability shall continue after a total of $45,000.00 has been paid, then further weekly payments at the rate previously paid shall be paid to him during such disability.\u201d Act approved May 24, 1973, ch. 671, 1973 Md.Laws 1400. The purpose clause of Chapter 671 stated that it was \u201cmaking provision for payment of additional benefits for total disability above the statutory limit under certain conditions____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1399. The only condition mentioned in the body of the act was that total disability must be continuing. <em>Id. </em>at 1400. At the same time, the legislature substantively changed section 49 as a result of the modification of section 36. Section 49 was modified to prohibit the inclusion of any of the continuing payments (after the $45,000) in a lump-sum award: \u201c[H]owever, that no lump sum may be granted from compensation payable after the sum of $45,000.00 has been paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1404. As of 1973, it is clear that the two provisions, <em>i.e., </em>the provision for payments in excess of the $45,000 cap and the provision that they cannot be included in a lump-sum award, were interconnected and were to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>construed together in order to achieve a harmonious result. Thus, the statutes then extant explicitly forbade that which appellant claims is inherently prohibited in the statutes as they now exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Had the statutes remained explicit, the resolution of this issue would be clear. The prohibition, however, is no longer contained in the code. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Act was amended in 1986. Act approved May 27,1986, ch. 767,1986 Md.Laws 2929. One of the amendments was an express repeal of the provision in section 49 prohibiting the inclusion of compensation recoverable after $45,000 has been paid in a lump-sum award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">As we perceive the legislative history of the related sections, it is clear that when the legislature first provided for the continuation of payments beyond the amount of $45,000 it realized the potential impact it might have on section 49. In accordance with this recognition, it amended section 49 to express its legislative intent to prohibit such awards. Act approved May 24, 1973, ch. 671, 1973 Md. Laws 1404. Thereafter, the legislature repealed the prohibition. Act approved May 27, 1986, ch. 767, 1986 Md. Laws 2929. In <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 689, 516 A.2d 976 (1986), the Court said: \u201cGenerally, a substantive amendment to an existing statute indicates an intent to change the meaning of that statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) By creating a prohibition and then repealing it, the legislature appears to have spoken. Thus, <em>to a point, </em>the legislative intent is clear. Lump-sum awards of compensation payable after the payment of $45,000 are no longer absolutely prohibited. That, however, does not fully answer the question raised by appellant that we now rephrase as: Must the <em>period </em>for which the $45,000 cap exists (regardless of whether the $45,000 is paid in periodic payments or a lump sum payment) have elapsed before a lump sum may be awarded for benefits payable after that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Appellant attempts to argue in its brief that certain occurrences could transpire, such as recovery of the claimant or death of the claimant, resulting in a lump-sum award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>in excess of benefits otherwise ultimately payable in periodic payments. A similar argument was made in <em>Victory Fireworks &amp; Specialty Co. v. Saxton, </em>170 Md. 446, 450, 185 A. 123 (1936), where the employer claimed, irrespective of the fact that the statute permitted lump-sum awards, that they could not be awarded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">(a) Because of the possibility of partial or total recovery of the claimant during the compensation period; and (b) because the claimant may die before the time when he would normally have received the maximum amount of such award.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The Court said that lump-sum awards were permitted under the statute, even in light of the concerns of the employer, and then opined: \u201c[T]he statute was designed to benefit both parties: the employers, by making it impossible to have exorbitant and unreasonable judgments obtained against them; and the employees, by providing for them definite and certain compensation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 185 A. 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Appellant also asserts that the sum payable after the $45,000 cap is otherwise purely speculative. We note that it is no more speculative than any portion of the compensation payable at the time of the initial award except that the statute specifically limits the initial amount to $45,000. The claimant\u2019s survivors would be limited<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by that amount, if the claimant expired prior to receiving $45,000. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., Labor &amp; Emp. \u00a7 9-640 (1991) (\u201cSurvival of Compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">This is not to say that the Commission has unlimited power to make lump-sum awards in respect to the post $45,000 benefits once the right to the latter benefits has accrued. The Commission\u2019s discretion in respect to lump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>sum amounts is not unbridled. It is clear that the Commission must have an evidentiary basis supporting the extraordinary aspect of need expressed by the claimant and the amount of any such award. We shall later address these sub-issues of need and amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">We are first constrained to conclude that while a lump-sum award may be authorized in respect to benefits due after a total of $45,000 has been paid, that lump-sum award may not be made until the termination of the period for which the original $45,000 is awarded. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We have noted that until 1986 lump-sum awards with respect to the additional period of benefits were expressly prohibited, and that by Chapter 767 of the Acts of 1986 this prohibition was repealed and removed from section 49. While that repeal operates to remove the absolute prohibition, the available legislative history does not indicate that the General Assembly intended to affect the time when such an award can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Our examination of the available legislative history indicates that the primary purpose of Chapter 767 of the Acts of 1986 was to clarify that when lump-sum awards were made from the Subsequent Injury Fund that the Fund be entitled to a reduction in weekly benefits payable to reflect the amount of the lump-sum award previously paid by it. Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law Committee, House Bill No. 1063, B.F. (1986). The bills were apparently first prepared and presented by the Subsequent Injury Fund. <em>Id. </em>(see letter of Sophia L. Swope, supervising attorney for the Fund, dated January 13, 1986, to Diana Vincent of the AFL-CIO). The Fund asserted that the purpose of the bill(s) was to correct a problem resulting from the Fund\u2019s termination of weekly payments when it had to make lump-sum payments, by providing for weekly deduction amounts applicable to the awards. Constitutional &amp; Administrative Law Committee, House Bill No. 1063, B.F. (1986). Another report, prepared prior to the bill\u2019s passage, indicated that the bill provided for a weekly \u201crate\u201d reduction when lump-sum awards were made and further noted that the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>applied to payments made by the Subsequent Injury Fund. <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The Department of Fiscal Services summarized the bill as applicable to awards \u201cin cases where prior awards have been made by the Subsequent Injury Fund,\u201d and that the bill\u2019s purpose was to provide a method for authorizing and computing the deductions in weekly benefits of prior awards. <em>Id. </em>Those deductions are required when lump sums are awarded. Throughout the progress of the bill, the general thrust was to accommodate the needs of the Subsequent Injury Fund for recoupment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">It was not until March 20, 1986, that the House adopted an amendment that stated \u201cOn page 2, strike beginning with \u2018However\u2019 in line 3 down through \u2018paid\u2019 in line 4.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The matter stricken by that amendment was the prohibition that had been in the statute since 1973: \u201c[Hjowever, no lump sum may be granted from compensation payable after the sum of $45,000 has been paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The only explanation for the repeal of the prohibition clause that we have discovered in the legislative history files was a letter written to the chairman of the committee on Constitutional and Administration Law, dated just two days before the amendment, from the Executive Assistant to the President of the Maryland State &amp; D.C. AFL-CIO, Diana K. Vincent. That letter, as pertinent to the issue in the case <em>sub judice, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">In working with H.B. 1063, it occurred to me that one sentence on page 2 of the bill, if the new language is adopted, will become archaic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Page 2 Lines 3 and 4: \u201cHowever, no lump sum may be granted from compensation payable after the sum of $45,000 has been paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">This limitation of $45,000 was included because there was no mechanism to recover an amount over the $45,000 paid out in a lump sum. The new language establishes a mechanism____to get credit for a lump sum paid. Example: Claimant is permanently and totally disabled---<em>[A]fter six or seven years, he has \u201cused-up </em>\u201d <em>the guaranteed amount of $45,000. </em>Now he needs a lump sum amount for some justifiable reason. Under current law, he is not eligible for a lump sum payment because there is no mechanism ... to get credit for the lump sum payment. The new language provides the mechanism____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-6\">Mark touched base with Commissioner Rosenbaum and the Commissioner agreed that the reference to the $45,-000 limit should be deleted. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">It thus appears that the prior prohibition was eliminated because the Legislature perceived that it was no longer necessary because it was, by Chapter 767, providing a means for employers and the Fund to reduce weekly benefits in respect to the recovery of any sums paid by them for the post $45,000 period under the lump-sum provisions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">As we perceive the intent of the Legislature generally, and as specifically reflected by the Subsequent Injury Fund amendments of 1986, it is concerned with insuring that weekly benefits inure to a claimant, both to assist a claimant and to keep her/him from requiring public assistance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>As we see it, and as we have previously stated, the primary purpose of the Act is to provide for periodic maintenance payments. In light of the legislative history we have reviewed, the 1986 amendments, though they eliminated the prohibition, have not changed that primary thrust of the Act, <em>i.e., </em>periodic payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">With that in mind, we must attempt to find a logical interpretation of section 36 that provides for a $45,000 cap, and immediately thereafter provides for continuing payments irrespective of the cap. We must then construe that section with section 49 to determine the appropriateness of the award in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We hold that lump-sum awards, if factually warranted, may be made with respect to benefits that accrue after the $45,000 cap is paid. Because the primary purpose of the Act is to provide for periodic payments to keep a claimant from requiring public assistance and for the further reason that lump-sum awards are not favored, we further hold that the post $45,000 benefits do not accrue and are not payable to a claimant until the expiration of the entire period of initial benefits reflected by the limit of $45,000 contained in the statute, whether those prior benefits are paid throughout that period or in a lump sum. No other interpretation we have been able to conceptualize gives meaning to the cap, the additional benefits irrespective of the cap, and the applicability of lump-sum awards to the post-cap period. Because the additional benefits provided for in section 36 do not become payable until the period of the initial award has passed, the subsequent benefits (that may never be payable) may not be subject to a lump-sum award until that time. While we acknowledge the \u201cmurky depths\u201d in which we labor, our holding is, we suggest, the most logical interpretation of facially illogical provisions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The Commission may not, therefore, make a lump-sum award that would include benefits that might accrue after the initial $45,000 is exhausted until the period for which a claimant is entitled to receive the original benefits has expired. Thus, to the extent that the Commission\u2019s granting of the lump-sum award exceeds $45,000, its action was unauthorized and erroneous. As we shall hereafter reverse the granting of the entire award for other reasons, it is not necessary for us to compute the exact amount of the award that exceeded the $45,000 statutory limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The Amount of the Award</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Section 9-729(c) of the Labor and Employment Article (1991) mandates that when <em>any </em>lump-sum award is granted, the Commission <em>shall:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-6\">(1) reduce the weekly rate of compensation until the amount of the lump sum would have been paid if it had been paid in weekly payments; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">(2) determine in the award:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">(i) the dollar amount and number of weeks to be paid by the employer or its insurer at the reduced weekly rate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">(ii) if payments are made from the Subsequent Injury Fund, the dollar amount and the number of weeks to be paid by the Subsequent Injury Fund at the reduced weekly rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">As we see it, based on the reduction provision, there must be an evidentiary basis, not only in respect to a claimant\u2019s needs but also as to the period of benefits. We shall first address the evidentiary support contained in the record that, but for the premature award of an amount over $45,000, otherwise supports the period of time for which the Commission estimated the award should be recouped.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>The extract indicates that in granting its final award of $60,000, the Commission, pursuant to the responsibility imposed by Article 101, section 49, computed the reduction for a period of 1,000 weeks (a $60 reduction per week for 1,000 weeks equals $60,000). It thus indicated that the lump-sum award would be recouped over a period of 19-20 years. While it is true that the claimant may not live for 19-20 years, there was absolutely no evidence (as opposed to speculation) presented by appellant before the Commission as to a life expectancy of less than that period. The Commission had evidence before it that at the time of the application for the award and the hearing, the appellee was 32 years old. The deduction to the weekly payments if the lump-sum award were to be upheld would terminate when appellant is 51 or 52 years old. The question before us then is whether the evidence of claimant\u2019s current age is sufficient to support the finding that the weekly payment reductions will recoup a lump-sum award within the 1,000 weeks, <em>i.e., </em>that the appellee is likely to live for that period. That question was answered in <em>Victory Fireworks, </em>where the court stated in response to a similar question regarding the possibility of death terminating the weekly benefits upon which a lump-sum award was based prior to the total reduction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-4\">The record does show that the claimant at the time of the conversion was but forty-three years of age, and it is but fair to assume, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the commission considered his life expectancy in making its lump-sum award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">170 Md. at 451, 185 A. 123. While <em>Victory Fireworks </em>was decided in 1936, we have been unable to find any cases that have held that under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act a presumption of life expectancy may not be based on a Commission\u2019s knowledge of a claimant\u2019s age. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant presented absolutely no evidence of claimant\u2019s life expectancy. The Commission made a <em>de facto </em>decision that the claimant\u2019s life expectancy was at least 19-20 years by creating that period of weekly benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>reduction. Based upon <em>Victory Fireworks, </em>we cannot say that the Commission was wrong or that the trial court erred in affirming the Commission on this point. Thus, to the extent that the appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence in regards to that portion of the lump-sum award as it relates to the period for which benefits would be paid, the Commission, based upon the evidence of appellee\u2019s age, determined that his life expectancy was 51-52 years, <em>i.e., </em>a period sufficiently long to permit appellant to recoup the lump-sum award. The Court of Appeals in <em>Victory Fireworks </em>at least acknowledged its acceptance of that approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">Did the trial court err in finding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion by awarding the claimant a lump sum for sixty thousand dollars ($60,000) for reasons that were not either a business or living necessity and which would reduce his weekly benefits to an unacceptably low amount?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We shall now address the matter of whether the Commission\u2019s granting of the lump sum award for the purposes requested by the plaintiff was correct. The resolution of this issue will necessarily resolve the third issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The Court reversed the trial court in the case of <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Taylor, </em>199 Md. 648, 87 A.2d 844 (1952), because the Commission failed to allow a discount<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and granted a lump sum in excess of the amount proved by the evidence of need. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">[L]ump sum awards should not be allowed merely to pay debts owed by a claimant, particularly in view of the fact that awards are not attachable. We have found no case in which an award for a purpose unrelated to the neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>sary living or business needs of the claimant, has been approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-4\">In the instant case, however, there was evidence of a business need____ [W]e should not substitute our views for those of the Commission in a matter left to its discretion. It is sufficient if there is <em>substantial evidence </em>to support a finding of need____ To the extent of the difference, the award was clearly excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 651, 87 A.2d 844 (emphasis added, citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The Court earlier in <em>Petillo v. Stein, </em>184 Md. 644, 652-53, 42 A.2d 675 (1945), opined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">The policy of the statute does not favor lump-sum awards. They are the exception rather than the rule. While necessary in some cases, they are not made of right. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Additionally, this Court has stated that the Commission\u2019s discretion is limited to awarding lump-sum amounts only where necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">The Commission\u2019s discretion ... should be exercised only when necessary for the proper care of injured workers and their dependents, and may not be allowed merely to pay debts owed by claimants. They are not granted for purposes unrelated to the <em>necessary </em>living ... needs of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-13\"><em>Univ. of Md. Medical Sys. Corp. v. Erie Ins. Exch., </em>89 Md.App. 204, 215, 597 A.2d 1036 (1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">We have earlier reviewed in our recitation of the facts the evidence presented by the appellant in support of his application for a lump-sum award. We recited that one of his purposes was to move from a one-room living arrangement for his four-member family to a $159,000 house in order to have a more comfortable living situation. When he was asked why he could not live in a less expensive townhouse, he responded that townhouses were multi-level and physical impairments would cause him difficulty in climbing stairs. He also stated that his hobby required the operation of power tools that were too noisy to use in multi-unit dwell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ings. When asked why he could not rent an apartment on his compensation and his wife\u2019s salary instead of purchasing a $159,000 house, he responded that no equity could be accumulated in a rental arrangement. It was important to him that he build equity in a house so that his wife would have that equity if he died, considering his inability to procure life insurance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also responded that portions of the lump sum would be used to pay off bills and encumbrances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">We have found no Maryland case in which the cost of a home, for which a lump sum has been awarded as a down payment, has negated the purposes for which the lump-sum provisions exist, <em>i.e., </em>to improve an appellant\u2019s financial position and thus to reduce the likelihood that the claimant will need additional public assistance. We have in fact found no Maryland cases where a lump sum has been made for the purpose of making a down payment in the purchase of a house. There are few Maryland cases involving the need factor of lump-sum awards. <em>See Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Taylor, </em>199 Md. 648, 87 A.2d 844 (1952) (prepayment of automobile payment); <em>Petillo v. Stein, </em>184 Md. 644, 42 A.2d 675 (1945) (legal and medical fees and vocational rehabilitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Lump-sum awards, allegedly based on need, have been rejected in various types of cases in several foreign jurisdictions. In <em>Van Hooser v. Mueller Co., </em>741 S.W.2d 329 (Tenn.1987), a lump sum was granted to a claimant because the insurer failed to make periodic benefit payments. The appellate court reversed the lump-sum award, however, because the insurer had made the back payments by the time the Commission made the award. The court held that the back payments had sufficiently corrected the arrears, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>and thus the lump sum was unnecessary, saying: \u201c[L]ump sum awards are an authorized exception to the general statutory purpose, and are <em>not </em>to be awarded as a matter of course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330 (citation omitted). The claimant in <em>Fowler v. Consolidated Aluminum Corp., </em>665 S.W.2d 713 (Tenn.1984), requested a lump-sum award in order to manage the amount to generate more income. The court found the reason insufficient, saying: \u201cThe mere fact that the employee ... might be able to earn interest on the commuted amount... has been held to be an insufficient reason for granting commutation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715 (citations omitted). The Tennessee court in <em>Valles v. Daniel Construction Co., </em>589 S.W.2d 911, 912 (Tenn.1979), noted, consistent with the statutory and case law in Maryland, that: \u201cThe general theory underlying the workmen\u2019s compensation statutes is to provide for periodic payments, as a substitution for the regular income theretofore earned.\u201d It further held that lump-sum awards are exceptions to the general \u201cscheme\u201d and should only be cautiously considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Supreme Court of Montana in <em>Stelling v. Rivercrest Ranches, Inc., </em>224 Mont. 313, 730 P.2d 388, 391 (1986), upheld the determination of the trial judge that a lump sum was inappropriate where the claimant desired to purchase a home without evidence that he was unable to live in the existing rental housing market. The claimant in <em>Stelling </em>also wanted to use portions of the lump sum to purchase an annuity in order to guarantee himself a sum certain over a longer period. The Montana court, however, did allow a partial lump sum to pay off a vehicle encumbrance where that encumbrance was a significant drain on the claimant\u2019s monthly finances. The claimant in <em>Garmann v. E.R. Fegert Co., </em>226 Mont. 432, 736 P.2d 123 (1987), asserted a purpose similar to the case <em>sub judice, i.e., </em>the purchase of a home (he also wanted to purchase a truck and buy furniture). The Commission\u2019s denial of an award was upheld. The court noted that the \u201cpurpose of the periodic payment method is to preclude ... wasting the means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>support and thereby becoming a burden upon society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>736 P.2d at 125 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The purchase of savings certificates with a lump sum in order to earn a greater rate of interest exceeding the discount rate was rejected as an unnecessary need in <em>Court of Flags v. Outland, </em>382 So.2d 443, 444 (Fla.App.1980), where the court said: <em>\u201c[WJorker\u2019s compensation benefits are not intended as life </em>insurance\u2014 The record ... contains nothing to indicate that the claimant\u2019s ... \u2018interests\u2019 were directly affected in any way by his concern over either of the ... estate planning or money market considerations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Nash, </em>116 Ga.App. 123, 156 S.E.2d 550, 552 (1967), the claimant wanted to buy a new truck to haul wood, and it was held not to be an \u201cexceptional circumstances[] ... nor strong and urgent reason[]----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">As we have indicated, some jurisdictions have accepted a broader range of purposes in awarding lump sums. <em>See Woodson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>102 N.M. 333, 695 P.2d 483 (1985) (exceptional medical expenses of a dependent); <em>Hock v. Lienco Cedar Prods., </em>194 Mont. 131, 634 P.2d 1174 (1981) (mortgage, auto loan, and funeral expenses created exceptional circumstances for 18-year-old widow having only a tenth grade education and with an infant daughter to support); <em>Herndon v. City of Miami, </em>224 So.2d 681 (Fla. 1969) (to purchase real estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We acknowledge that as to need sufficiency the Commission is the body charged with \u201cspecial knowledge,\u201d and that we should not substitute our views for those of the Commission. <em>Bethlehem Steel Co., </em>199 Md. at 650, 87 A.2d 844 (quoting <em>Petillo, </em>184 Md. at 653, 42 A.2d 675). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, appellee offered no evidence that the current rental market in Baltimore County could not have met the needs sought to be addressed by the Worker\u2019s Compensation statute. He basically rejected that alternative primarily because it does not permit the build up of equity. According to appellee, he desired to accumulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>equity to provide for his wife in lieu of the life insurance that was unavailable to him. As we have noted, the Worker\u2019s Compensation statute contains its own provisions for compensation of dependents of covered employees who die. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Labor &amp; Emp. \u00a7 9-640 (1991). It contains, more or less, comprehensive provisions for a claimant\u2019s surviving dependents. To the extent the legislative intention as to the needs of a claimant\u2019s survivors is determinable it is found in the Act itself, and the Act addresses that need. A claimant\u2019s wish to be awarded a lump-sum payment to build equity in realty in lieu of life insurance, is not, therefore, as we see it, contemplated by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Wagner also stated that rental properties and townhouses were unsuitable because his hobby required the use of power tools that would disturb neighbors. In the case of townhouses, he claimed that multi-floors would cause him physical problems.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There was absolutely no evidence presented that the rental market did not include detached single-level rental unit(s) of lesser cost that could accommodate his needs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To the extent the lump-sum award was intended to pay his debts, it failed in that purpose as well. Additionally, as we hereafter indicate, this specific lump-sum award rather than decreasing the possibility that appellee will need public assistance, increases that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We hold that in this specific case the evidence was not sufficient to support a conclusion that the circumstances were so exceptional or extraordinary as to overcome the general rule that lump-sum payments are not favored. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>are especially cognizant that the two primary purposes of the statutory scheme for periodic payments are: (1) to provide for regular payments to replace the normal income the covered employee would have received had he/she not been injured; and (2) to avoid, by making payments periodically, the wasting of a claimant\u2019s means of support in order to prevent the claimant from becoming a burden on society. The lump-sum award in the case at bar, on the evidence heard, patently conflicts with the latter stated purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">A brief summary of appellee\u2019s post award situation emphasizes how the lump-sum award granted here defeats, or may defeat, the statutory scheme. The Commission, as a result of the lump-sum award, has reduced his benefits by 60 percent to $40 a week for 19 to 20 years (1,000 weeks). Approximately $100,000 would remain due on the house he originally proposed to purchase.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The exhibits indicate total monthly payments of $978 for principal, interest, and taxes alone. Presumably, he is responsible for the entire amount. Should the resources of his wife become unavailable by reason of her loss of employment, divorce, death, etc., he would have only $40 per week to pay all of his expenses including the mortgage, tax payments, etc. Even if he did not remain responsible for the house payment, there remains only $40 per week for other expenses. Clearly, his remaining compensation of $40 per week for 1,000 weeks is insufficient to meet even his basic needs, irrespective of the mortgage payments and other house expenses. If these expenses are factored in, he would be, except for his wife\u2019s income, immediately unable to meet his expenses. The lump-sum award granted here does not increase the chances that he will improve his business\u2019 capacity to earn income; he has no business. The award of a lump sum does not assist him in reducing his personal or living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>obligations. Rather, awarding the lump sum increases his obligations to a point where it is impossible to meet them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Based upon the specific facts of this case, we hold that by granting the $60,000 lump sum to appellant, the Commission has clearly decreased his ability to support himself and increased the possibility that he will be a burden on society. We hold that the Commission's award was in error, and the trial court erred in affirming that award.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE TRIAL COURT WITH DIRECTIONS THAT THE CASE BE REMANDED TO THE COMMISSION IN ORDER FOR ITS LUMP-SUM AWARD TO BE RESCINDED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\">.

Indeed, there may well be a single family detached dwelling that is modestly priced and where, with appropriate tax deductions (interest and real property taxes), the ability to make the mortgage payments may equate with rental payments.

We have held that, under the circumstances of this case, where a lump-sum award substantially increases the possibility that a claimant will become dependent on public assistance, it is improper. We have also noted that the statute provides for compensation for survivors of deceased claimants, and thus we have questioned the appropriateness of the grant of lump-sum awards sought as a substitute for life insurance. We note that our opinion is based on the circumstances of this particular case. It is not inconceivable that lump-sum awards for the purpose of obtaining different living accommodations necessitated by a claimant\u2019s condition can be made that are unrelated to life insurance purposes, and that do not substantially increase the chances of a claimant becoming dependent on public welfare services.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
