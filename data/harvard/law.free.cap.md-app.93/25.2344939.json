The curfew imposed by the Board provides that it is illegal for a \u201cchild,\u201d defined as \u201cany person under the age of eighteen (18) years,\u201d to \u201cremain in or upon any public place or any establishment between the hours of 11:59 p.m. Saturday and 6:00 a.m. Sunday; or between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. of the following day on any other day of the week.\u201d Frederick City Code, \u00a7\u00a7 15-9, 15-10 (1991). The ordinance exempts from the curfew children accompanied by a parent or guardian, children \u201cupon an errand directed by\u201d a parent or guardian, children \u201cattending a cultural, scholastic, athletic, or recreational activity supervised by a bona fide organization,\u201d and children who are \u201cengaged in gainful lawful employment during the curfew hours.\u201d \u00a7 15-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">In addition, the ordinance makes it illegal for parents and owners and operators of any \u201cestablishment\u201d to permit any child not exempted from the curfew to remain in public places during the restricted hours. \u00a7\u00a7 15-12, 15-13. \u201cEstablishment\u201d is defined as \u201cany privately owned place of business carried on for a profit or any place of amusement or entertainment to which the public is invited.\u201d \u00a7 15-9(c). Finally, the ordinance prescribes the penalties for children, parents, and owners and operators of establishments, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>include, <em>inter alia, </em>taking a child into custody, immediate notification of the parents of such custody, and, after the second offense within 12 months, referral of the child to the department of juvenile services. \u00a7 15-14(a). Furthermore, any violation by a parent or owner or operator of establishments who has been advised of two prior violations by the same child within a 12-month period constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a \u201cfine not to exceed one hundr\u00e9d dollars ($100.00).\u201d \u00a7 15-14(b) and (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In the years following the enactment of the curfew ordinance, it was rarely enforced. During the summer and fall of 1990, however, the Mayor of Frederick, Paul P. Gordon, received complaints regarding the noise level and harassment of passersby in a three-block area of North Market Street in downtown Frederick. Complaints centered on one North Market Street restaurant in particular, the Rainbow Hunan Restaurant (\u201cthe Rainbow\u201d). A Chinese restaurant by day, the Rainbow was rented to a promotor who, on weekend nights, presented musical/dance events there that were attended primarily by African-American youth. According to Mayor Gordon, \u201cBesides individual complaints received from citizens, on at least three occasions a group of residents came to City Hall to complain to the City about noise and loitering problems in the Market Street area, particularly involving the Rainbow Hunan.\u201d In addition, \u201cgreat concern was shown by citizens as to why the Curfew Ordinance was not more aggressively enforced as a measure to control the noise and loitering problems.\u201d Moreover, \u201cother restaurant owners in the Market Street area were also complaining about these problems and the Rainbow Hunan was mentioned specifically in several complaints,\u201d according to the Mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On October 4, 1990, Mayor Gordon called a meeting of owners of restaurants in the North Market Street area, including the owners of the Rainbow. Three \u201cmeasures of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>controlling the noise and loitering problems\u201d on North Market Street were discussed. These \u201cmeasures\u201d were: \u201cthe restaurant ownersf] responsibility to control the noise level on the street; their responsibility to control the restaurants\u2019 entrance from becoming a fire hazard; and their responsibility to comply with the laws of Frederick City, including the Curfew Ordinance.\u201d On October 18, 1990, another meeting of restaurant owners was held to discuss strategies for managing the evening crowds on North Market Street. On Friday, October 19, 1990, Mayor Gordon announced at a candidates\u2019 forum that Frederick City police would soon begin enforcing the juvenile curfew ordinance. That announcement was reported in the lead article on the front page of the Frederick <em>News-Post </em>on the morning of October 20, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Enforcement of the curfew ordinance began at 11:59 p.m. on October 20. At least three checkpoints were planned,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one of which was the strip of restaurants on North Market Street that included the Rainbow. Police officers were instructed to \u201cmake a reasonable assessment of age\u201d before detaining a young person and thus satisfy themselves that \u201ca reasonable basis existed to conclude there was a curfew violation prior to taking any action.\u201d At about 12:30 a.m. on October 21, several police officers entered the Rainbow, \u201cexplained to the owners of the restaurant [their] purposes; and proceeded] to check the age of those patrons who appeared to be minors.\u201d Approximately 28 minors \u201cwere detained and led out to a bus waiting outside that had been designated to age verification purposes.\u201d According to the Frederick City Chief of Police, Richard J. Ashton, \u201cthis was done in an orderly and peaceful way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Among those minors escorted out of the Rainbow was Tyeicka Bowens, then 16 years-old, who had been dancing inside. A police officer led Bowens to the bus outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Rainbow, where her picture was taken and she was restrained with plastic handcuffs. An officer removed the handcuffs after Bowens complained that they were hurting her; she was then transported along with the other youths on the bus to the police station, \u201cwhere parents or guardians of the detained minors were called to pick them up.\u201d Neither Bowens nor any other minor was formally arrested or placed in cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Vanessa Brown was also picked up for violation of the curfew ordinance that night. Brown, who was then 19 years old and six months pregnant, had spent most of the evening at home with her friend Sherry Temple. At around 11:30 p.m., Brown and Temple \u201cdecided to ride around downtown\u201d; when they arrived downtown, they decided to go to the Rainbow. Because all of the parking spaces on North Market Street were taken, Brown and Temple parked on another nearby street, and \u201conce out of the car____ began walking to the club.\u201d As they arrived at the entrance of Rainbow, Officer Steve Scalf of the Frederick police department approached them and requested identification. Scalf was among those police officers charged that night with the task of enforcing the curfew. His job during the earliest hours of October 21 \u201cwas to stand outside the Rainbow Hunan Restaurant and Lounge ... and look for curfew violators passing on the street.\u201d At Officer Scalf s request, Temple provided him with her identification documenting that she was over 18 years old. Brown, however, had left her identification at home. Since Brown did not have identification with her, Officer Scalf instructed her to get on the waiting bus and remain there \u201cuntil her age could be verified.\u201d Brown protested and attempted to get away from Officer Scalf s hold on her arm. Officer Scalf then led her to the bus with his hand at the back of her neck. Once in the bus, Brown\u2019s picture was taken and she was handcuffed. From inside the bus, she told Temple to go and obtain identification from her mother. Temple and Brown\u2019s mother returned with the identification; after confirming that Brown was over the age restricted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>curfew, the police released her from the bus. Approximately 15 to 20 minutes elapsed between the time Officer Scalf first approached her and Brown\u2019s release. After Brown got off the bus, she and her mother complained to Police Chief Ashton about Scalf\u2019s treatment of Brown, and then went to the police station where they repeated their complaint to another police officer. Brown did not, however, seek medical treatment for bruises or file a formal charge or complaint against Scalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On the evening in question, three other restaurants in the North Market Street area were checked for curfew violators; the record does not reflect whether any violators were found at these other restaurants. Nor is there any indication in the record as to the race of any of the other alleged violators picked up in and around the Rainbow. The curfew had not been enforced for at least a year prior to October 21, 1990; by the end of 1990, however, according to an affidavit filed by Chief Ashton, \u201cbesides the incident complained of in this action, the enforcement of the [curfew ordinance] resulted in approximately 34 arrests, 19 of which were black minors and 15 of which were white minors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">On November 23, 1990, Bowens (by her mother as her next friend) and Brown together filed a multi-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against Ashton, Scalf, and the City of Frederick. The plaintiffs alleged the common law torts of negligence, assault and battery, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. They also charged that they had been improperly arrested during the early morning hours of October 21,1990, in contravention of their rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; the Maryland Constitution; and the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Finally, they asserted that the juvenile curfew ordinance under which they were arrested violated the Due Process Clause, Equal Protection Clause, and First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to each cause of action. On October 3, 1991, the Circuit Court for Frederick County granted the defendants\u2019 motion in its entirety. First, the circuit court held that \u201cthere is a clear qualified immunity to the police officers, the City and the Chief on the common law counts.\u201d In support of that finding, the court found that Scalf acted \u201cin the performance of his duty\u201d and that there was \u201cno showing of any malice\u201d or of \u201cany significant misconduct.\u201d Second, the court, after recognizing that intentional infliction of emotional distress was probably the most difficult tort for a plaintiff in Maryland \u201cto prevail on,\u201d held the plaintiffs had failed to allege \u201cthe evil intent\u201d or the \u201cnasty action\u201d necessary to state that claim. Third, the court granted summary judgment on the constitutional claims against the defendants because it found: (a) they had probable cause to detain Bowens and Brown, and (b) since there was \u201cneither a suggestion of incompetence nor any knowing violation of the law,\u201d they were immune from liability. Finally, the court held that the curfew itself was constitutional, because \u201cin its entirety\u201d it was \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d but, rather, \u201creasonably applied\u201d and \u201cnot vague.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">On appeal, all aspects of the order granting summary judgment are challenged. We address first the constitutionality of the ordinance and then consider the liability of those enforcing it. Because the lower court\u2019s decision involves issues of law, not fact, our review will focus on whether the decision below was legally correct. <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 592, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990); <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Before considering the specific constitutional challenges to the Frederick ordinance, we briefly consider Maryland statutory and common law on the general subject of juvenile curfew ordinances. Maryland Annotated Code Article 23B, \u00a7 22(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The council [of a municipal corporation, like Frederick] shall have the power to pass all such ordinances not contrary to the Constitution and laws of the State of Maryland or this charter as it may deem necessary for the good government of the town; for the protection of the town\u2019s property, rights and privileges; for the preservation of peace and good order; for securing persons and property from violence, danger, or destruction; and for the protection and promotion of the health, safety, comfort, convenience, welfare, and happiness of the residents of and visitors in the town.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Article 23B, \u00a7\u00a7 22(2) and (16) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">(2) <em>Specific powers. </em>\u2014 The council shall have, in addition, the power to pass ordinances not contrary to the laws and Constitution of this State, for the specific purposes provided in the remaining subsections of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(16) <em>Curfew. </em>\u2014 To prohibit the youth of the town from being in the streets, lanes, alleys, or public places at unreasonable hours of the night.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">On the basis of these statutes, appellees maintain that, the \u201cCity of Frederick has <em>specific authorization </em>to enact curfew ordinances to limit the nighttime activities of minors from the Maryland Legislature\u201d (emphasis added). This argument overlooks the fact that Article 23B, entitled Municipal Corporation Charter, was enacted by the General Assembly simply to serve as a model or guide for municipal corporations in formulating or amending their charters. It is not, and was never intended to be, a grant of power or \u201cspecific authorization\u201d by the General Assembly to the municipal corporation. As Judge Eldridge carefully explained in <em>Campbell v. City of Annapolis, </em>289 Md. 300, 310, 424 A.2d 738 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">As made clear by the title and initial sections of the Act adopting Art. 23B, Chapter 258 of the Acts of 1955, \u00a7 1, pp. 375-376, the article is merely a model \u201cfor the use of any town desiring to adopt it.\u201d It is not a grant of power by the General Assembly, but the grant of power to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>municipal government is by the people of a municipality which chooses to adopt the model.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Thus, neither the City of Frederick, nor any other municipality, has \u201cspecial authorization\u201d from the General Assembly to enact a juvenile curfew ordinance. Moreover, even if Article 23B did provide this authority, which it does not, by the express terms of Article 23B that authority would have to be exercised in a way \u201cnot contrary to the Constitution of Maryland.\u201d Art. 23B, \u00a7 22(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Only once before has the constitutionality of a municipal corporation\u2019s juvenile curfew ordinance been considered by a Maryland appellate court. Accordingly, the Maryland common law on this subject is limited to <em>Thistlewood v. Trial Magistrate for Ocean City, </em>236 Md. 548, 204 A.2d 688 (1964). There, the Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance that prohibited persons under the age of 21 from remaining on the streets of Ocean City between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. during the four-day Labor Day weekend of 1963. Even though <em>Thistlewood </em>predated the recent avalanche of reported opinions on the question and the elaborate rationales set forth in them, its constitutional analysis is both sensitive and sensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In <em>Thistlewood, </em>the Court of Appeals reasoned that, in order for a juvenile curfew ordinance to withstand constitutional scrutiny, three criteria must be met: (1) there had to be an evil; (2) the means selected to curb the evil had to bear a \u201creal and substantial relationship\u201d to the result sought; and (3) the means availed of could not unduly infringe upon the \u201cfundamental rights\u201d of those whose conduct was curbed. <em>Thistlewood, </em>236 Md. at 556, 204 A.2d 688.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****8 The Court examined the \u201cevil\u201d dealt with by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Ocean City ordinance, <em>i.e., </em>control of disorder amounting almost to riots which had occurred on past Labor Day weekends, and concluded that the short duration curfew \u201cbears a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Thistlewood </em>court then proceeded to the third inquiry, \u201cthe ultimate and critical question of* whether the means, in view of the evil, unduly affronted the fundamental rights of the minors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that the \u201cfundamental rights of minors were not affronted or violated by the ordinance\u201d because of \u201cthe demonstrated need for emergency use of the curfew in a resort town over Labor Day, the late and relatively short hours of the curfew and the fact that there were only four curfew days, the fact that its limited purpose was to prevent loitering or remaining in public areas, as opposed to merely using them for passage,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and, finally, the fact that it was directed only to minors who are peculiarly subject to regulation and control by the State.\u201d 236 Md. at 557, 204 A.2d 688. Thus, in <em>Thistlewood, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the juvenile curfew ordinance must not only withstand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201crational basis\u201d test, but also, because it infringed upon \u201cfundamental rights,\u201d must be narrowly drawn to further the asserted governmental purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">With the principles articulated in <em>Thistlewood </em>in mind, we turn to the constitutional challenges of the Frederick ordinance. As in most recent cases involving the constitutionality of juvenile curfews, this ordinance is challenged primarily on two grounds. First, the curfew is claimed to infringe upon minors\u2019 \u201cfundamental rights,\u201d or to be \u201coverbroad.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second,, it is asserted that it is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Fundamental Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Although, as noted above, there is a plethora of recent reported opinions interpreting juvenile curfew ordinances, one scholar has remarked in epic understatement, \u201cthe judiciary has failed to reach a consensus on the validity of these enactments.\u201d Note, <em>Assessing the Constitutional Validity of Juvenile Curfew Statutes, </em>52 Notre Dame Lawyer 858, 858 (1977) (and cases cited therein). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Assessing the Scope of Minors\u2019 Fundamental Rights: Juvenile Curfews and the Constitution, </em>97 Harv. L.Rev. 1163 (1984) (and cases cited therein). This is somewhat puzzling in light of the fact that in the twenty-five years since <em>Thistlewood </em>was decided, certain critical constitutional principles have become well established.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>For example, it seems clear now, although it was not when <em>Thistlewood </em>was decided, that if an ordinance such as that imposed upon the children of Frederick were enacted against adults, it would be unconstitutional. That is, a general curfew which, unlike that in <em>Thistlewood, </em>is not compelled by an emergency, nor imposed for a short duration, nor in a very discrete geographical area, could not withstand constitutional scrutiny. This conclusion seems required by <em>Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). There, in striking down on vagueness grounds a vagrancy statute, the Supreme Court expressly recognized the fundamental importance of a citizen\u2019s right to move about at will stating that such activities as \u201cnight walking,\u201d \u201cloafing,\u201d or \u201cstrolling,\u201d while \u201cnot mentioned in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights,\u201d are \u201chistorically part of the amenities of life as we have known them.\u201d <em>Papachristou, </em>405 U.S. at 164, 92 S.Ct. at 844. \u201cThe right to walk the streets, or to meet publicly with one\u2019s friends for a noble purpose or for no purpose at all \u2014 and to do so whenever one pleases \u2014 is an integral component of life in a free and ordered society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The source of this right has been variously regarded as the Due Process Clause, <em>People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d 219, 221 (Colo.1989); the First Amendment, <em>People v. Chambers, </em>66 Ill.2d 36, 4 Ill.Dec. 308, 310, 360 N.E.2d 55, 57 (1977); the Equal Protection Clause, <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, </em>216 NJ.Super. 557, 524 A.2d 478, 485 (1987); and the Ninth Amendment, Note, <em>Juvenile Curfew Ordinances and the Constitution, </em>76 Mich.L.Rev. 109, 118-25 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Whatever its source, this right is now widely regarded as \u201cfundamental.\u201d Accordingly, because a statute infringing upon fundamental rights can survive judicial scrutiny only if narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest, <em>see, e.g., Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 638, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1333, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); L. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 16-6 to 7 (2d ed. 1988), and because there appears to be no compelling state interest justifying nonemergency curfews affecting adults, courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>have held that such statutes cannot survive constitutional challenge. <em>See Ruff v. Marshall, </em>438 F.Supp. 303 (M.D.Ga. 1977) (holding such a statute unconstitutional); <em>City of Portland v. James, </em>251 Or. 8, 444 P.2d 554 (1968) (same); <em>City of Seattle v. Drew, </em>70 Wash.2d 405, 423 P.2d 522 (1967) (same); <em>Hayes v. Municipal Court of Oklahoma City, </em>487 P.2d 974 (Okla.Crim.App.1971) (same); <em>Ames v. City of Hermosa Beach, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 146, 93 Cal.Rptr. 786 (1971) (same). <em>See also Papachristou, </em>405 U.S. at 164, 92 S.Ct. at 844; <em>Bykofsky, </em>429 U.S. at 965, 97 S.Ct. at 395 (Marshall, J. dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\u201c[a]bsent a genuine emergency ... a curfew aimed at all citizens could not survive constitutional scrutiny\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Moreover, on numerous occasions since <em>Thistlewood, </em>the Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that \u201ca child, merely on account of [his or her] minority, is not beyond the protection of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Bellotti v. Baird, </em>443 U.S. 622, 633, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 3043, 61 L.Ed.2d 797, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>444 U.S. 887, 100 S.Ct. 185, 62 L.Ed.2d 121 (1979). <em>Accord, Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, </em>428 U.S. 52, 74, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2843, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (\u201cConstitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority\u201d); <em>Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 213-14, 95 S.Ct. 2268, 2274-75, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975) (confirming minors\u2019 access to nonobscene information); <em>Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 514, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) (free expression); <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 31-57, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1445-59, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) (establishing minors\u2019 rights to counsel, notice, confrontation, and cross-examination in juvenile court proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In light of these now established principles, <em>i.e., </em>(1) curfew statutes like that at issue here unconstitutionally burden fundamental constitutional rights of adults; and (2) minors do not lose constitutional rights because of their age, it would seem to follow as a matter of logic that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Frederick ordinance and all similar juvenile curfew ordinances are unconstitutional. This \u201clogic,\u201d however, ignores a critical factor, which was recognized by the <em>Thistlewood </em>court, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe activities and conduct of those under twenty-one may be regulated and restricted to a far greater extent than those of adults.\u201d 236 Md. at 557, 204 A.2d 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">This is so, not because constitutional rights become less fundamental when enjoyed by children, <em>Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., </em>393 U.S. at 511, 89 S.Ct. at 739, but because the lack of maturity and judgment of children supplies the government with different and additional compelling interests in regulating their conduct. <em>Bellotti v. Baird, </em>443 U.S. at 634, 99 S.Ct. at 3043. <em>See also, </em>52 Notre Dame Lawyer at 868 (\u201cthe existence of a constitutional right is not affected by the application of that right to either a minor or an adult; the constitutional rights involved in curfew situations exist for all persons regardless of age\u201d; however, \u201cthe scope of protection accorded these rights may well depend upon the age of the party allegedly restrained\u201d). The Supreme Court has recognized three factors that will generally be found to justify differential treatment of the constitutional rights of minors: \u201cthe peculiar vulnerability of children; their inability to make critical decisions in an informed, mature manner; and the importance of the parental role in child rearing.\u201d <em>Bellotti v.

Yet it concluded that the ordinance affected no fundamental rights of minors and so applied the rational basis test to uphold it. <em>Id. </em>at 1265-66. The court reasoned that, because the interests served by the ordinance outweighed any infringement on the rights of minors, the ordinance affected no fundamental rights. <em>Id. See also People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d at 221-23 (relying on. <em>Bykofsky </em>to similarly so hold); <em>City of Panora, </em>445 N.W.2d at 368-69 (same). As the dissenters remarked in <em>City of Panora, </em>this analysis \u201cwas backward.\u201d 445 N.W.2d at 374. In determining the constitutionality of legislation a court must first determine the applicable level of scrutiny, <em>e.g., </em>strict scrutiny or rational basis, and then determine if there are the necessary governmental interests to sustain the legislation in light of the applicable test. <em>See, e.g., Hombeck v. Somerset Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 641, 458 A.2d 758 (1983); <em>Attorney General v. Waldron, </em>289 Md. 683, 705-06, 426 A.2d 929 (1981); <em>Village of Deerfield v. Greenberg, </em>193 Ill.App.3d 215, 140 Ill.Dec. 530, 534, 550 N.E.2d 12, 16 (1990); <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, </em>524 A.2d at 485. In <em>Bykofsky, </em>the court determined the applicable level of scrutiny by weighing the asserted governmental interests, and then purported to apply the test arrived at by this unorthodox means to uphold the ordinance. For these reasons, we reject <em>Bykofsky </em>and the cases that have adopted its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Instead, we examine the three <em>Bellotti </em>factors \u2014 the special vulnerability of children, their inability to make critical decisions in a mature manner, and the State\u2019s need to encourage parental control of children<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 to determine if any one of them provides the compelling interest needed to justify restrictions, like those in the Frederick ordinance, on the fundamental rights of children. One, and only one, court has so held. In <em>City of Milwaukee v. K.F., </em>145 Wis.2d 24, 426 N.W.2d 329, 339 (1988), the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, with three justices dissenting, in summary manner concluded that \u201cthe interest of the municipality ... in protecting youths and curtailing juvenile crime is compelling and ... the ordinance ... is drawn as narrowly as practicable\u201d and so meets the \u201cstrict scrutiny standard requiring a \u2018compelling state interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Bykofsky, </em>401 F.Supp. at 1258; <em>People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d at 223; <em>City of Panora, </em>445 N.W.2d at 369; <em>City of Eastlake v. Ruggiero, </em>7 Ohio App.2d 212, 36 O.O.2d 345, 220 N.E.2d 126, 129 (1966) (all finding these interests justify juvenile curfews under the rational basis standard). The Wisconsin analysis is so slight that it can hardly be regarded as persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Some of those courts that have used the <em>Bellotti </em>factors to hold that juvenile curfew ordinances have a rational basis, however, do provide more thoughtful discussions of these factors in the context of juvenile curfews. They have noted \u201cthe peculiar vulnerability of youngsters to drug usage and sexual contact,\u201d <em>City of Panora, </em>445 N.W.2d at 369 <em>(citing City of Dallas v. Stanglin, </em>490 U.S. 19, 27, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1596, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989)), and that \u201cyouths abroad at night are more vulnerable to crime and peer pressure than their adult counterparts.\u201d <em>People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d at 223. <em>See also People v. Chambers, </em>4 Ill.Dec. at 310, 360 N.E.2d at 57 (juvenile curfew justified \u201cupon the basic assumption that when a child is at home during the late night and early morning hours, it is protected from physical, as well as moral, dangers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Children are vulnerable to crime and the emotional trauma it causes, perhaps more vulnerable than adults. <em>But see Waters v. Barry, </em>711 F.Supp. at 1137 (crime \u201cposes no <em>peculiar </em>damage to children ... violence is ubiquitous; it afflicts all of us\u201d) (emphasis in original). This vulnerability justifies our system of separate juvenile courts to protect children from emotional turmoil associated with crime. But the efforts of the juvenile courts to shield those involved in the judicial process \u201care a far cry from blanket restrictions on the liberties of children who face no such predicament.\u201d Note, 97 Harv.L.Rev. at 1175. The <em>Bellotti </em>court itself recognized that, while children can be specially treated to protect them from emotional trauma, with respect to \u201cdeprivations of liberty\u201d their rights are \u201cvirtually coextensive\u201d with that of adults. 443 U.S. at 634, 99 S.Ct. at 3043. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that children\u2019s special vul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>nerability justifies the Frederick ordinance. <em>See Waters v. Barry, </em>711 F.Supp. at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Nor do the other two <em>Bellotti </em>factors justify it. With regard to the children\u2019s inability to make mature decisions, several courts have recognized that the decision to go outside during certain hours does not involve any critical decisions by minors. <em>Johnson v. City of Opelousas, </em>658 F.2d at 1073; <em>Waters v. Barry, </em>711 F.Supp. at 1137. Some courts, however, have concluded that \u201ca child\u2019s immaturity may lead to a decision to commit delinquent acts, such as vandalism, drug or alcohol use, or crimes of violence,\u201d and this provides a rational basis for a juvenile curfew. <em>People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d at 232. <em>Accord, City of Panora, </em>445 N.W.2d at 369. The problem with accepting this rationale as a compelling state interest justifying a juvenile curfew is that whether to commit a crime is not the decision specifically dealt with by a curfew. \u201cFar from addressing a \u2018precisely delineated\u2019 set of activities that require children to make critical choices, a curfew prohibits all activities \u2014 even nondisruptive and nonharmful ones \u2014 in public during certain hours.\u201d Note, 97 Harv.L.Rev. at 1176-77. Properly drafted criminal statutes prohibiting the sale of liquor or pornography to minors and punishing vandalism and disturbance of peace, more specifically, and probably more effectively, deter and prevent criminal activity. <em>Compare, City of Dallas v. Stanglin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The final <em>Bellotti </em>factor is preservation of the parental role in child-rearing. A juvenile curfew ordinance that prohibits innocent and <em>parentally approved conduct, e.g., </em>stargazing, or going for a walk, or attending a music/dance entertainment, as the appellants did here, does not further the parental role. Rather, it subverts the parental role by proclaiming that the government knows better than the parent what is necessary for the proper upbringing of the child. <em>See Johnson v. City of Opelousas, </em>658 F.2d at 1074; <em>Waters v. Barry, </em>711 F.Supp. at 1137; <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, </em>524 A.2d at 487; <em>City of Seattle v. Pullman, </em>82 Wash.2d 794, 514 P.2d 1059, 1064 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In sum, we conclude that the Frederick ordinance burdens the fundamental rights of minors and is not justified by any compelling governmental interest. This is, we note, the same conclusion that has been reached by the vast majority of courts that have, in considering juvenile curfew ordinances, recognized, as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Thistle-wood, </em>that they infringe upon the \u201cfundamental\u201d rights of minors. <em>See Johnson v. City of Opelousas, supra; Waters v. Barry, supra; McCollester v. City of Keene, </em>586 F.Supp. 1381 (D.N.H.1984); <em>City of Seattle v. Pullman, supra; In re Doe, </em>54 Haw. 647, 513 P.2d 1385 (1973); <em>K.L.J. v. State, </em>581 So.2d 920 (Fla.App.1991); <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, supra; City of Wadsworth v.

K.F., supra</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">An ordinance containing language so imprecise that it cannot be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence does not give fair notice of the acts that it forbids or requires and, therefore, denies due process. <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, </em>524 A.2d at 481 <em>(citing Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974)). When persons of ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess as to the meaning of a law and, consequently, \u201cdiffer as to its application,\u201d the law \u201cviolates the first essential of due process of law \u2014 to wit, providing fair warning and notice of what is prohibited or required so that one may act accordingly.\u201d <em>Bykofsky, </em>401 F.Supp. at 1248 <em>(citing, inter alia, Connally v. General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926); <em>Lanzetta v. New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939)); <em>City of Seattle v. Pullman, </em>514 P.2d at 1062. Moreover, when the wording of a statute is vague, police officers lack an \u201cascertainable standard\u201d by which to enforce it, <em>Allen v. Bordentown City, </em>524 A.2d at 481, and the likelihood of \u201carbitrary enforcement\u201d increases. <em>See Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra, </em>405 U.S. at 162, 92 S.Ct. at 843; <em>Naprstek v. City of Norwich, </em>545 F.2d 815, 818 (2d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The four terms within the Frederick statute that are challenged for vagueness are (a) \u201cbona fide organization\u201d; (b) \u201ccultural, scholastic, athletic, or recreational activity\u201d; (c) \u201csupervised\u201d; and (d) \u201cgainful lawful employment\u201d. None are defined in the statute. We are satisfied that, notwithstanding certain \u201cpossible ambiguities\u201d that might be \u201chypothetically constructed\u201d as to the application of the latter three terms, the conduct they proscribe is sufficiently self-explanatory. <em>See City of Milwaukee v. K.F., </em>426 N.W.2d at 334. <em>See also Eanes v. State, </em>318 Md. 436, 459, 569 A.2d 604, <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 938, 110 S.Ct. 3218, 110 L.Ed.2d 665 (1990) (\u201ca law is not vague simply because it requires conformity to an imprecise normative standard\u201d). The first term, however, is far less obvious in its intent. \u201cBona fide\u201d is not explained in the ordinance; nor does the ordinance specify who is to say, and under what standards, an organization is to be regarded as \u201cbona fide.\u201d In its amicus curiae brief, the American Civil Liberties Union asserts that the appellees had difficulty articulating in their depositions what a \u201cbona fide organization\u201d would be. In response, the appellees point out that Chief Ashton stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">... They\u2019re in business for a profit. To sell alcohol, to sell food, and to have a live band there. They\u2019re not somebody who\u2019s going to take an interest in your child. Your minor child .. [I]f it\u2019s the YMCA or Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, what have you, you know, their purpose in having a dance is to provide kids with recreation ... [N]ot to provide them with food and booze and the music. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>And these are people there that make money and the way I see a bona fide organization is somebody that\u2019s putting on an activity for kids and they\u2019re going to care about the kids. It\u2019s going to be chaperoned and you can feel relatively safe sending your child there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Thus, it appears that Chief Ashton's standard for determining if an organization will be considered \u201cbona fide\u201d for the purposes of the curfew is whether it is acting for profit, or whether the organization \u201ccares\u201d about the minors it seeks to entertain. Appellees also rely on the definition found in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) for the term \u201cbona fide\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cin or with good faith; honestly, openly, and sincerely, without deceit or fraud.\u201d These definitions are not necessarily consistent, given the fact that most for-profit organizations operate honestly, openly, and sincerely. Under the latter definition, the dance activities at the Rainbow would certainly qualify as being sponsored by a \u201cbona fide\u201d organization; under Chief Ashton\u2019s explanation, however, they would not. Moreover, we are averse, as other courts have been, to delegate to a single person, even the Chief of Police, the power to decide the meaning of the word \u201cbona fide.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Mosier, </em>59 Ohio Misc. 83, 13 O.O.3d 290, 394 N.E.2d 368, 377 (Ct.Comm.Pleas, Ohio 1978) (provision giving police chief authority to decide which organization may hold functions exempt from curfew \u201cis an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and is unconstitutionally vague\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">Indeed, a question raised by the ACLU is an important one: Would the attendance at a late evening concert at Hood College (located in Frederick City) by a minor, subject the minor, his or her parents, and the promoter of the concert to criminal penalties where the concert was promoted by an outside <em>for-profit </em>promoter who brought some contemporary cultural artist to the college? We are concerned that the answer to this question may depend on the makeup of the audience attending a for-profit event. As pointed out by the dissenters in <em>City of Panora, supra, </em>the type of law sought to be enforced by the City of Frederick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>has an ugly history. Born of prejudice, curfew ordinances have risen in popularity during some sad times in this country. Before the civil war, curfew laws in the south designated times when slaves could be on the streets. <em>See Curfew Statute, Ordinance, or Proclamation, </em>59 A.L.R.3rd 321, 326 (1974). During the late 1800s, immigrants were arriving in this country in great numbers. Though not treated as badly as slaves, the immigrants nevertheless faced prejudice. Curfew ordinances again became popular because of fears that immigrants could not control their children. <em>See </em>97 Harv.L.Rev. at 1164 n. 9. In 1941 emergency curfews were imposed upon American citizens of Japanese ancestry. Ironically, some of our most decorated heroes in World War II were children of these Americans. <em>See </em>59 A.L.R.3d at 349-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aij\"><em>City of Panora, </em>445 N.W.2d at 374 (dissenting opinion). Even the curfew had passed constitutional muster as serving a compelling interest, therefore, it could not survive the vagueness test because it fails to set forth a clear and nonarbitrary definition of \u201cbona fide organization.\u201d History has proven that the arbitrariness of the enactment and of enforcement of curfews requires as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">LIABILITY FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The lower court held that the appellees were entitled to summary judgment with regard to all claims growing out of enforcement of the ordinance, <em>ie., </em>the common law claims (assault and battery, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence and gross negligence), the federal constitutional claims, and the claims of violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Appellees assert that this result was proper for two reasons: (1) probable cause existed for the detention or arrest of Brown and Bowens; and (2) appellees are protected by governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Like the appellants in <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 446, 298 A.2d 156 (1972), appellants\u2019 claims for money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>damages for alleged abuse in enforcement of the ordinance \u201cfounders upon the shoals of probable cause.\u201d Probable cause to arrest without warrant exists when, at the time of the arrest, the facts and circumstances within the police officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that a crime has been or is being committed. <em>Collins v, State, </em>322 Md. 675, 680, 589 A.2d 479 (1991); <em>In re C, </em>105 Cal.Rptr. at 118 (\u201chonest and strong suspicion that the minor was in violation of the curfew ordinance\u201d amounts to probable cause to arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Here, on the night in question, Officer Scalf \u201cwas instructed to make a reasonable assessment of age, and to satisfy [himself] that a reasonable basis existed to conclude there was a curfew violation prior to taking of any action.\u201d When he saw Brown on the street outside the Rainbow, she \u201cappeared ... to be under the age of 18,\u201d and she was unable, moreover, to produce positive identification to the contrary. Officer Scalf was justified in briefly detaining or arresting<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> her to determine if she was, in fact, violating the curfew ordinance. Similarly, sixteen-year-old Bowens\u2019 youthful appearance constituted sufficient basis on which the police could detain her \u201cin order to acquire additional information to confirm or refute\u201d the impression (which proved accurate in her case) that she was violating the curfew ordinance. <em>People v. Smith, </em>87 Mich.App. 730, 276 N.W.2d 481, 483 (1979); <em>People v. Coleman, </em>50 Ill.App.3d 1053, 7 Ill.Dec. 581, 584-85, 364 N.E.2d 742, 745-46 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Thus, the question becomes, as it was in <em>Michigan v. De Fillippo, </em>443 U.S. 31, 37, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 2632, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979), whether \u201cit can be said that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that the conduct he observed and the words spoken constituted a violation of law simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>because he should have known the ordinance was invalid and would be judicially declared unconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court unequivocally held that the \u201canswer is clearly negative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">At that time [the time of arrest], of course, there was no controlling precedent that this ordinance was or was not constitutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a presumptively valid ordinance. A prudent officer, in the course of determining whether the respondent had committed an offense under all the circumstances shown by this record, should not have been required to anticipate that a court would later hold the ordinance unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">Police are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared unconstitutional. The enactment of a law forecloses speculation by enforcement officers concerning its constitutionality \u2014 with the possible exception of law so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws. Society would be ill-served if its police officers took it upon themselves to determine which laws are and which are not constitutionally entitled to enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">443 U.S. at 37-38, 99 S.Ct. at 2632-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">This rationale requires the similar conclusion here that, on October 21, 1990, there was probable cause for the detention or arrest of both Brown and Bowens for violation of the \u201cpresumptively valid ordinance.\u201d We have now held this ordinance unconstitutional but, as we have recounted in some detail within, numerous courts have come to a contrary conclusion when assessing very similar ordinances. Thus, it can hardly be said that the Frederick ordinance is a law \u201cso grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws.\u201d <em>Id. See United States v. Landry, </em>903 F.2d 334, 339 (5th Cir.1990) (even if unconstitutional juvenile curfew ordinance was basis for <em>Terry </em>stop, \u201cevidence seized pursuant to search incident to an arrest based upon an officer\u2019s good faith reliance on a city ordinance not yet declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>unconstitutional, is valid\u201d). <em>See also In re Hector, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 1146, 200 Cal.Rptr. 110, 113 (1984). The fact that there was probable cause, of course, eliminates one of the critical elements of the tort of false imprisonment, <em>see Brewer v. Mele, supra, </em>267 Md. at 440, 298 A.2d 156; <em>K-Mart v. Salmon, </em>76 Md.App. 568, 583, 547 A.2d 1069 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. 496, 551 A.2d 867 (1989), and so provides a sound basis for the grant of summary judgment on that count. The presence of probable cause here, also has two other, more wide-ranging, consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">First, it makes grant of summary judgment on the State constitutional claims proper. This is so because those claims for violations of Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights are, as appellants stated in their brief and reiterated at oral argument, \u201cclaims of improper search and seizure.\u201d Assuming without deciding that there has been a search and seizure here, since there was probable cause for appellants\u2019 arrest, any search and seizure was valid. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 229, 94 S.Ct. 467, 474, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (an arresting officer may constitutionally search a person validly arrested; the fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone, authorized a search); <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 98, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984). Thus, there is no basis for a claim that the alleged search or seizure was unconstitutional, <em>Michigan v. De Fillippo, </em>443 U.S. at 39-40, 99 S.Ct. at 2633-34, and so no basis for a violation of Article 24 or Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>See Gahan v. State, </em>290 Md. 310, 321, 430 A.2d 49 (1981) (decisions of Supreme Court interpreting \u201ckindred\u201d federal constitutional provisions are entitled to \u201cgreat respect\u201d in interpreting Art. 26); <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Board of Educ., </em>295 Md. at 640, 458 A.2d 758 (decisions of Supreme Court interpreting equal protection clause are \u201cpersuasive authority\u201d in cases involving \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>equal treatment provisions of Article 24\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We do not here hold that the appellees acted in good faith and so enjoy some sort of immunity from state constitutional claims. The Court of Appeals has specifically held that <em>\u201ca </em>public official who violates a plaintiffs rights under the Maryland Constitution is entitled to no immunity.\u201d <em>Clea v. City of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 680, 541 A.2d 1303 (1988). <em>See also Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 373, 597 A.2d 432 (1991). All that we hold here is that if a police officer has probable cause to arrest a person (like Bowens or Brown here), there is no basis upon which that person can assert that a search or seizure pursuant to that lawful arrest is unconstitutional. This holding is in no way inconsistent with <em>Clea. </em>The only questions before the Court there concerned the vicarious liability of Baltimore City and its Police Department for a police officer\u2019s conduct, and whether the officer was \u201centitled to public official immunity.\u201d <em>Clea, </em>312 Md. at 664, 541 A.2d 1303. As Judge Eldridge carefully explained in the initial sentence of that opinion, those claims were premised \u201cupon an <em>unlawful </em>search of the plaintiff\u2019s home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In contrast, here there was no unlawful search; rather, the search and seizure, if any, was lawful pursuant to a lawful arrest or detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In addition to eliminating the basis for appellants\u2019 false imprisonment and state constitutional claims, the presence of good cause for the arrests or detentions also provides the appellees with a basis for immunity as to all other claims. This is so because, when a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>acts within the scope of his or her law enforcement function, the officer is a \u201cpublic official,\u201d and, as such, is protected by a qualified immunity against civil liability for nonmalicious acts performed within the scope of employment. <em>Clea, </em>312 Md. 662, 672-73, 541 A.2d 1303 (1988); <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323-24, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980). When a police officer has probable cause to detain someone, and does so without malice or evil intent, the officer is, therefore, immune from civil liability, even if he or she is incorrect in the decision to act. <em>See Civil Actions Against State Government, </em>\u00a7 6.24 (Wesley H. Winborne, Ed.) (1982, 1992 Supp.) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Here, the plaintiffs ground each of their common law tort claims on allegations that they were \u201cforcibly\u201d handled and taken onto a bus, where they were searched, photographed, and handcuffed. They make no claim, however, that they were treated in a manner which, in the context of a lawful detainer, would not be considered within the scope of a police officer\u2019s employment and without malice. In the absence of probable cause to detain or arrest, a suit for assault and battery against a police officer might be permitted to go forward, <em>see Robinson v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>262 Md. 342, 349-50, 278 A.2d 71 (1971); that is not the situation here. Nor can the claims of false imprisonment or invasion of privacy, given the probable cause that existed, overcome the appellees\u2019 qualified immunity. <em>Simons v. Montgomery County Police Officers, </em>762 F.2d 30, 32-33 (4th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1054, 106 S.Ct. 789, 88 L.Ed.2d 767 (1986). In addition, the appellees\u2019 qualified immunity also prohibits Brown and Bowens from proceeding with their assertions of \u201cnegligence and gross negligence.\u201d <em>Jones v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital, </em>82 Md. App. 314, 333, 571 A.2d 859, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 351, 578 A.2d 191 (1990). <em>See also Boyer v. State, </em>323 Md. 558, 577, 594 A.2d 121 (1991).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Finally, with respect to the claims arising under federal law and the United States Constitution, the presence of probable cause also provides the appellees with qualified immunity from civil liability. Indeed, even if there was not probable cause, appellees would be entitled to summary judgment on these claims. This is so because, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), public officials are shielded from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for any alleged violations of federal constitutional or statutory law \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>See also Claiborne v. Cahalen, supra, </em>636 F.Supp. at 1277. A reasonable person in Officer Scalf s position would not have known, absent a judicial determination that the presumptively valid ordinance was unconstitutional, that in detaining Bowens or Brown for possible violations of the curfew ordinance, he was violating their constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR ENTRY OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH DIRECTIVES SET FORTH WITHIN.

Although the <em>Thistlewood </em>court never stated precisely what these \"fundamental rights\u201d were, other than \"personal liberties,\" <em>id. </em>at 550, 204 A.2d 688, its discussion of precedent indicates it believed rights of freedom of movement, speech, association, and assembly were involved. <em>See id. </em>at 553, 557, 204 A.2d 688. The rights have been so characterized by subsequent courts. <em>See, e.g., Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Opelousas, </em>658 F.2d 1065, 1072 (5th Cir.1981) (freedom of speech, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>association and travel); <em>Bykofsky v.

The distinction between a prohibition against \u201cloitering\u201d in a public area (which was regarded as constitutional) and a prohibition against \"being\u201d in a public area (which was not) is the one portion of the <em>Thistlewood </em>analysis that does not withstand close scrutiny. Although a number of courts continue to rely on this distinction, <em>see, e.g., People in Interest of J.M., </em>768 P.2d 219, 224 (Colo.1989); <em>In re Nancy C., </em>28 Cal.App.3d 747, 105 Cal.Rptr. 113, 119 (1972), the better modern view is that the distinction is \u201cmere semantics and untenable.\u201d <em>Bykofsky v.

Many courts have, almost as a matter of rote, concluded that such statutes are \u201coverbroad.\" <em>See, e.g., Johnson v.

In any event, when, as here, those challenging a curfew ordinance claim that it was unconstitutionally applied to them, analysis of the ordinance would seem, most appropriately, to begin with a determination of that question, and then proceed, if necessary, to questions of overbreadth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b67-5\">. Although Justice Powell\u2019s decision was joined by only a plurality of the Court, those who wrote separately did not question the portion of his opinion setting forth these factors. Moreover, these factors have been subsequently adopted by numerous courts in analyzing legislation aimed at children, including virtually all the juvenile curfew cases. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v.

Although appellees assert that these are the purposes served by the Frederick ordinance, we note there is no indication that these were the goals of the Board of Aldermen when it enacted the curfew ordinance in 1978. Nor were these goals considered sufficiently compelling by the City to warrant consistent enforcement of the curfew for over twelve years after its enactment. Moreover, the record indicates that the chief reason behind recent enforcement of the curfew was the \"numerous complaints\" from the citizens of Frederick City and restaurant owners on North Market Street regarding the increasing noise level and harassment of passersby in the area surrounding the Rainbow. The complaints of citizens regarding one area of town obviously do not justify the encroachment on the fundamental rights of the vast majority of Frederick City minors, who did <em>not </em>increase the noise level or harass passersby on North Market Street, to move as they please (or as their parents please) at night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">.

We need not here determine if Officer Scalf simply detained appellants or arrested them because there was, in all events, probable cause for their arrest. <em>Compare Terry v.
