The principal question raised by this appeal is whether a binding agreement for child support between the parties is, in and of itself, a sufficient reason for deviation from the child support guidelines, codified as Md.Fam.Law Code Ann. \u00a7 12-201, <em>et seq. </em>(1991 Repl.Vol.). For reasons we shall explain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>we answer this question in the negative. We also reject appellee\u2019s, Amnon Mates\u2019, contention that the fact that such an agreement was entered into prior to the adoption of the guidelines bears significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Appellant and appellee were divorced on 3 August 1983. The two children born of the marriage, Rafael David and Jonathan Jacob, were then ages six and three, respectively. The parties\u2019 divorce decree incorporated a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement Agreement (Agreement), which had been executed on 23 April 1982. It allocated child support as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">D. <em>Support of Children</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">1. a. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) herein and paragraph 2 below [appellee] shall pay to [appellant] the sum of $375.00 per month per child, for a total of $750.00 per month for the two children, for the support and maintenance of the two minor children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">b. [Appellee] shall not be required to make payments for the support and maintenance of either child for any period of time during which said child remains in [appellee\u2019s] care for two consecutive weeks or longer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">2. Said payments for the support of the minor children shall be changed or terminated as follows: (a) said payments shall increase starting May 31,1983, and each May 31st thereafter by the same percentage as [appellee\u2019s] cost-of-living adjustment increases his income ...; (b) said payments shall be changed at such time as [appellant] remarries at which time the payments shall be renegotiated so that [appellee] will provide only out-of-pocket costs for food, clothing and other similar expenses of the children not including lodging in [appellant\u2019s] then marital abode; (c) said payments shall terminate as to each child of the first to occur of the following events: (1) death of child; (2) arrival at age eighteen (18) years; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>marriage; (4) emancipation by full time employment; (5) death of [appellee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">3. As long as [appellee] is employed by the World Bank or is in another employment providing comparable health insurance, [appellee] shall maintain health insurance coverage for the children and shall pay the medical and dental (including orthodontia) expenses for the children not paid by insurance, provided that [appellant] consults with [appellee] prior to undertaking any such non-paid expenses in excess of $500.00 per year per child. The duty under this section shall terminate as to each child as provided in paragraph D(2)(c), <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">4. In addition to the foregoing, [appellee] shall pay all the educational costs of the children provided that the selection of school and/or college shall be arrived at by mutual agreement of [appellee] and [appellant]. The term educational costs as used in this Agreement means school tuition, fees and books beginning at pre-school kindergarten at age 5, through the full cost of a college education for each child. [Appellee\u2019s] obligation hereunder shall continue, with respect to each child, for four years of college, regardless of whether or not such child shall have attained majority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">On 21 February 1984, the amount of child support was modified by consent order. On 7 March 1990, appellant filed a Petition for Modification of Child Support (Petition) based on the adoption of the child support guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, appellee\u2019s monthly child support obligation under the Agreement was $695.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Hearings on the Petition were held before Domestic Relations Master S. Michael Pincus on 7 January and 21 February 1991. On 26 February 1991, the Master issued his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Report and Recommendations, along with a proposed order. The Master concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that use of the guidelines would result in a monthly child support obligation of $1756.00 and, therefore, application of the guidelines was mandated under \u00a7 12-202(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Master recommended that appellee\u2019s child support obligation only be increased to $1,000.00 per month. The Master arrived at this figure by using the guidelines and then subtracting certain of appellee\u2019s obligations under the Agreement, such as future college expenses and insurance costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Both parties filed exceptions to the Master\u2019s Report and Recommendations. After a hearing on the exceptions, the circuit court accepted the Master\u2019s Report but rejected his Recommendations, reasoning that application of the guidelines was an all-or-nothing proposition. \u201cYou can\u2019t ... mix apples and oranges. You can\u2019t say that the guidelines apply and then take away from them.\u201d Instead, the court concluded that use of the guidelines would be unjust and inappropriate in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The court apparently based this conclusion upon the existence of the Agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJy\">Here we have a very \u2014 what I find a very unusual voluntary separation and property settlement agreement. It doesn\u2019t really have to be even unusual, but in this case it was. If you look at the way the child support was set up, it was set up to pay a certain amount of money. There was provision for college education ... there was also provision that if [appellant] remarries, the payments are going to be renegotiated to a certain amount and, in fact, they were. [There was a provision t]hat [appellee] would only provide out-of-pocket costs for food, clothing and other similar expenses not including lodging and [appellant\u2019s then marital abode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[The agreement] also provided for an automatic cost of living adjustment as [appellee\u2019s] income went up. It is clear that the parties, for whatever reason, struck a bargain. They struck a bargain here which represented the results of a negotiation____ [B]oth sides were represented by counsel____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">Why did they enter into the agreement that they entered into? I don\u2019t know why. <em>If the application of the guidelines leads to a result which the parties didn\u2019t negotiate for and didn\u2019t bargain for, then the Court determines that would be unjust and inappropriate. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Having concluded that use of the guidelines would be unjust and inappropriate, the court declined to consider the Petition and ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">I think the position that [appellant] has to be in is if there is a sufficient change in circumstances from that contemplated in the agreement, that appropriate petition has to be filed and a factual record made. Then [appellant] can come up for a decision based not on the guidelines, but on the facts and circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">We shall expand upon the facts of the instant case as necessary during our discussion of the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Initially, we are presented with a motion' to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appellant improperly appended to her brief a standardized worksheet for determination of the appropriate amount of child support under the guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under subsection (a)(8) of Rule 8-602, we may dismiss an appeal if \u201cthe style, contents, size, format, legibility, or method of reproduction of a brief, appendix, or record extract does not comply with Rules 8-112, 8-501, 8-503, or Rule 8-504.\u201d Rule 8-603(a)(3) provides, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that a motion to dismiss based on Rule 8-602(a)(8) shall be filed ten days after the appellant\u2019s brief was or should have been filed pursuant to Rule 8-502. Appellant\u2019s brief was filed on 31 March 1992, but appellee did not file a motion to dismiss until 11 May 1992. Thus, appellee failed to comply with Rule 8-603(a)(3). We shall, therefore, deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence before the court to support its finding that application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in the instant case, and that the court failed to make the necessary findings accompanying its departure from the guidelines. We agree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The law and policy of this State is that the child\u2019s best interest is of paramount importance and cannot be altered by the parties. <em>See Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 588, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990) (\u201cA parent cannot agree to preclude a child\u2019s right to support by the other parent, or the right to have that support modified in appropriate circumstances\u201d); <em>Polk v. Harris, </em>46 Md.App. 591, 598-99, 420 A.2d 1004 (1980), <em>quoting Stancill v. Stancill, </em>286 Md. 530, 535, 408 A.2d 1030 (1979) (\u201cThe chancellor cannot be handcuffed in the exercise of his duty to act in the best interest of a child by any understanding between the parties\u201d); <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>40 Md.App. 550, 554, 392 A.2d 1149 (1978) (\u201cThe fixing of child support derives from the obligation of the parent to the child, not from one parent to another\u201d). A parent has a legal obligation to provide support for the child. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">This policy is codified by the child support guidelines. <em>See Tannehill v. Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. 4, 11, 591 A.2d 888 (1991) (Guidelines intended \u201cto remedy the low levels of most child support awards relative to the actual cost of rearing children\u201d and \u201cimprove the consistency and equity of child support awards\u201d). The guidelines require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>trial court to presume, unless rebutted, that the amount of child support dictated by the guidelines is correct <em>Id. </em>The guidelines include specific language regarding the review of agreements for child support. Subsection (2) of \u00a7 12-202(a) provid\u00e9s, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">(2)(i) There is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">1. <em>the terms of any existing separation or property settlement agreement </em>or court order, including any provisions for payment of mortgages or marital debts, payment of college education expenses, the terms of any use and possession order or right to occupy to the family home under an agreement, any direct payments made for the benefit of the children required by agreement or order, or any other financial considerations set out in an existing separation or property settlement agreement or court order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">2. th\u00e9 presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly contributing. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Judge Rosalyn B. Bell, writing for this Court in <em>Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. at 14, 591 A.2d 888, observed that the considerations set forth in subsection (2)(iii) of \u00a7 12-202(a) \u201cdelineate situations that affect the financial resources of the parents or the financial needs of the children.\" While the guidelines do not exclude \u201cother relevant financial considerations that have the same or similar impact as the considerations listed[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>the terms of an agreement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>child support between the parties are relevant <em>only </em>to the extent that they impact upon the financial resources of the parents or the financial needs of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">That this was the intent of the General Assembly is demonstrated by an examination of subsection (2)(iv) of \u00a7 12-202(a). It provides that, while a trial court may deviate from the guidelines if application thereof would be unjust or inappropriate, the court must make specific written or oral findings supporting such deviation, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">A. the amount of child support that would have been required under the guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">B. how the order varies from the guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items conveyed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(iv). A hypothetical example is instructive. Assume that application of the guidelines in a particular case would force a supporting parent to pay more than the amount of child support dictated by the guidelines, because the parent has conveyed items of value under the terms of an agreement instead of paying a portion of the child support presumed under the guidelines. In such a situation, the terms of the agreement clearly impact upon the financial resources of the parents, because one parent\u2019s financial resources have been functionally decreased, while the other\u2019s have been functionally increased. It may also have an effect upon the child\u2019s needs if the items conveyed would otherwise have to be purchased for the child. The trial court, in finding that departure from the guidelines is warranted, may explain that the best interests of the child are served because the child is, in effect, receiving the amount of support to which it is presumptively entitled under the guidelines. Thus, the requirement that a trial court make specific written or oral findings supporting departure from the guidelines effectively restricts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>court\u2019s consideration of the terms of an agreement for child support between the parties to the impact of that agreement upon the financial resources of the parents or the financial needs of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court determined that the Agreement was, in and of itself, a sufficient reason for deviation from the child support guidelines. The court apparently did not consider the impact of the Agreement upon the financial resources of the parents or the financial needs of the children. The court thereby elevated the parties\u2019 contractual expectations over the best interests of the children and impermissibly allowed the parties \u201cto agree to preclude a child\u2019s right to support by the other parent, or the right to have that support modified in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. at 588, 568 A.2d 1157. The court also failed to make the necessary findings accompanying its departure from the guidelines. While the court indicated that items of value were conveyed under the Agreement instead of a portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, it did not state the estimated value of the items conveyed. Nor did the court state how deviation from the guidelines served the best interests of the children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellee argues that we need not do so because the Agreement is an \u201cunusual\u201d one and provides the parties\u2019 children with \u201cmore than adequate care.\u201d We disagree. We have held previously that failure to make findings in accordance with subsection (2)(iv) of \u00a7 12-202(a) is reversible error.. <em>Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. at 15, 591 A.2d 888. The conclusion that the Agreement is \u201cunusual\u201d is insupportable without some context, <em>i.e., </em>some explanation of what might be the terms of the \u201cusual\u201d agreement. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>more, the assertion that the parties\u2019 children are provided with \u201cmore than adequate care,\u201d assuming it is true, is beside the point. As we have already stated, the guidelines require a trial court to presume, unless rebutted, that the amount of child support dictated by the guidelines is correct. The burden is on the party seeking an amount of child support different from that indicated by the guidelines to rebut the presumption by evidence that use of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Appellee contends that the fact that the Agreement was entered into prior to the adoption of the guidelines bears significance. Specifically, appellee argues that application of the guidelines in the instant case would impair the obligation of the Agreement in violation of the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10. In considering Contract Clause arguments, we engage in the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">The threshold inquiry is \u2018whether the state law has, in fact operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u2019 ... If the state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the regulation, ... such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>******</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">Once a legitimate public purpose has been identified, the next inquiry is whether the adjustment of \u2018the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties [is based] upon reasonable conditions and [is] of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying [the legislation\u2019s] adoption.\u2019 (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\"><em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 271, 554 A.2d 366 (1989), <em>quoting Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power &amp; Light, </em>459 U.S. 400, 411, 103 S.Ct. 697, 704, 74 L.Ed.2d 569 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that application of the guidelines would operate as a substantial impairment of the contractual relationship between the parties, appellee\u2019s Contract Clause argument must fail. The guidelines unquestionably have a significant and legitimate public purpose. <em>See supra, </em>p. 328. Appellee argues that the purpose of the guidelines is not served in the instant case because the children are not suffering any . material deprivation under the Agreement. The fact that a particular amount of child support was negotiated by the parties, however, does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate or equitable. Moreover, as we have already made clear, even before the guidelines parties could not by contract bind a court to a particular amount of child support. <em>Polk v. Harris, </em>46 Md.App. 591, 598-99, 420 A.2d 1004 (1980), <em>quoting Stancil v. Stancil, </em>286 Md. 530, 535, 408 A.2d 1030 (1979) (\u201cthe chancellor cannot be handcuffed in the exercise of his duty to act in the best interest of a child by any understanding between the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Turning to the next step in our analysis, we conclude that the means employed by the guidelines are reasonable and appropriate to their purpose. Appellee contends that application of the guidelines to agreements such as the one involved in the case <em>sub judice </em>may lead to unjust or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>inappropriate results. The guidelines adequately provide for such a possibility, however, by vesting trial courts with discretion to depart from the guidelines if their application would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Relying upon the general rule that existing laws are to be read into the terms of contracts, <em>see, e.g., Burning Tree Club, </em>315 Md. at 269, n. 5, 554 A.2d 366; <em>Prince George\u2019s Club v. Carr, </em>235 Md. 591, 607, 202 A.2d 354 (1964), appellee also argues that a material change in circumstances does not exist in the case <em>sub judice, </em>despite the fact that the guidelines create a rebuttable presumption that such a change exists, <em>see infra, </em>\u00a7 2, because the law existing at the time that the Agreement was entered into contemplated a change of circumstances directly involving the parties or their children, rather than an \u201cartificial\u201d change created by the General Assembly. While the parties and their children may not have been directly involved in the adoption of the guidelines, they certainly are directly affected by it. Thus, it appears that even under the law existing at the time the parties entered into the Agreement, the establishment by the General Assembly of mandatory child support guidelines \u2014 the application of which would result in a change in child support of more than 25% \u2014 would have constituted a material change in circumstances. <em>See Cole v. Cole, </em>44 Md.App. 435, 439, 409 A.2d 734 (1979) (\u201cIt is, of course, well settled in this State that a court of equity may upon a proper petition to do so modify a decree for ... child support at any time if there has been shown a material change in circumstances that justify the action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Finally, appellee argues that the guidelines apply exclusively to child support \u201cawards,\u201d that is, child support obligations determined by adjudication, rather than child support obligations that are the product of agreements for child support between the parties. We find this argument completely unpersuasive. As we have already indicated, \u201c[a] parent cannot agree to preclude a child\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>support by the other parent, or the right to have that support modified in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. at 588, 568 A.2d 1157. Yet under appellee\u2019s position, the parties would be enabled to cede their children\u2019s presumptive right to the amount of support calculated under the guidelines simply because they entered into an agreement designed to satisfy their legal obligation to the children. We cannot accept such an anomalous result. In any event, it is clear that the incorporation of the Agreement into the circuit court\u2019s divorce decree of 3 August 1983 renders the Agreement no less an \u201caward\u201d for purposes of the application of the guidelines than an amount of support determined via contested hearings. \u00a7 12-202(b). Appellee offers no authority, nor are we aware of any, for the proposition that we should distinguish between litigated and agreement-based amounts of child support. <em>Cf McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 483, 593 A.2d 1128 (1991) (treating custody orders entered by the consent and upon the agreement of the parties analogously to litigated custody orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The circuit court\u2019s concluding comments suggest that, having determined that application of the guidelines would be unjust and inappropriate in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court considered it necessary for appellant to make a showing of a material change in circumstances separate and apart from the adoption of the guidelines in order to justify a modification of child support.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">I think the position that [appellant] has to be in is if there is a sufficient change in circumstances from that contemplated in the agreement, that appropriate petition has to be filed and a factual record made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Appellant contends that, even if the circuit court had properly concluded that application of the guidelines would be unjust and inappropriate, she was entitled under \u00a7 12-202(b) to consideration of her Petition. We shall address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>appellant\u2019s contention in order to guide the circuit court upon remand. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The guidelines create a rebuttable presumption that a material change in circumstances exists where use of the guidelines would result in a change in a child support award of 25% or more. Section 12-202(b) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">(b) Modification of orders. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the adoption of the guidelines set forth in this subtitle may be grounds for requesting a modification of a child support award based on a material change in circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">(2) The adoption of the guidelines set forth in this subtitle may not be grounds for requesting a modification of a child support award based on a material change in circumstances unless the use of the guidelines would result in a change in the award of 25% or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">While the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the above provision suggests that the adoption of the guidelines need not be considered a material change in circumstances, such an interpretation would vitiate the guidelines and, therefore, conflict with the settled rule that a reviewing court will not presume that the General Assembly, in enacting a statute, intended to create an ineffective or invalid law. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Maryland v. Shpritz, </em>63 Md.App. 623, 493 A.2d 410 (1985), <em>citing Swarthmore Co. v. Kaestner, </em>258 Md. 517, 526, 266 A.2d 341 (1970). If trial courts were not required to apply the guidelines in reviewing child support obligations established before the adoption of the guidelines, the legislature\u2019s mandate of the use of the guidelines would be rendered nugatory with respect to an entire class of child support agreements or awards. Nor can we ascribe to the General Assembly the intent to create two classes of children, one presumptively entitled to the amount of child support calculated under the guidelines and one deprived of that right, based solely on the time of the establishment of the original child support obligation. It is well-established that a child\u2019s right to support may not be fixed or limited based on the parents\u2019 station in life at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>divorce. <em>Cole, </em>44 Md.App. at 446, 409 A.2d 734. Thus, as a matter of law, where application of the guidelines would result in a change in the child support obligation of 25% or more, there is a rebuttable presumption that the adoption of the guidelines constitutes a material change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Trial courts, of course, have discretion to deviate from the guidelines if application thereof would be unjust or inappropriate, so long as they make specific written or oral findings supporting such deviation. But the presumption that a material change in circumstances exists is not automatically rebutted by a determination that strict application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">Ordinarily the amount of a child support award is governed by the circumstances of the case and is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose determination should not be disturbed unless he has acted arbitrarily in administering his discretion or was clearly wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYX\"><em>Gates v. Gates, </em>83 Md.App. 661, 663, 577 A.2d 382 (1990). Once the presumption that a material change in circumstances exists is established under \u00a7 12-202(b), a party is entitled to have his or her modification request reviewed by the trial court. If the trial court determines that application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, it is still vested with the discretion to otherwise modify the child support obligation. Accordingly, if the circuit court concludes upon remand that application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant will still be entitled to consideration of her modification request.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.

On April 10, 1990, however, the General Assembly amended the guidelines, mandating their use.\u201d <em>Tannehill v. Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. 4, 11, 591 A.2d 888 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">. Section 12-202(b) creates a rebuttable presumption that a material change in circumstances justifying modification of a child support award exists where use of the guidelines would result in a change in a child support award of 25% or more. <em>See infra, </em>\u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\">.

Presumably, the court would have been unable to do so even if it had wanted to, since its deviation from the guidelines was premised on the contractual expectations of the parties rather than the best interests of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">. The parties argue strenuously in their briefs as to whether departure from the guidelines is warranted in the instant case. We need not consider the question, since that will be the task of the circuit court on remand. We note, however, that some of appellee\u2019s arguments regarding the Agreement appear to be conclusionary and do not bear close examination. For example, appellee makes much of the fact that under the Agreement he is obligated to pay the children\u2019s educational expenses. Examination of the record suggests, however, that appellee may incur no significant educational expenses. The children attend public school. Until 1988, appellee had nothing set aside for the children\u2019s college education. In 1988, after a prior petition to modify child support had been filed, appellee set up a revocable trust and began placing $500 per month into the trust. After the current Petition was filed, appellee increased the monthly payments to $700. In addition, because appellee is an employee of the World Bank, the World Bank will pay for a substantial portion of the children\u2019s college expenses, provided they attend college abroad.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
