That which is to be allowed is costs in the partition, and these, with a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>sonable compensation to tbe plaintiff or petitioner for counsel fees, are to be taxed by tbe court: Snyder\u2019s Appeal, 54 Pa. 70; Grubbs\u2019 App., 82 Pa. 29, tbe petitioner\u2019s counsel alone being entitled to compensation out of tbe estate: Campbell\u2019s Est., 13 W.

The appellee was not a litigant to the estate, nor was he a respondent. He did not oppose tbe proceedings, but was in entire sympathy with them. He did not sign tbe petition with tbe appellants, for be did not know of its existence. He bad incurred expenses attendant upon tbe proceedings; bis counsel bad prepared a petition, bad examined letters and made searches; bad advised with him and tbe other heirs as to their best interests. These facts being within tbe knowledge of tbe court, tbe counsel fees were taxed to be paid in tbe manner stated in tbe decree.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b130-17\">Nothing appeared upon the paper books indicating whether or not there was any contest in the court below either in the proceedings for partition or over the taxation of the costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AIl\">Mr. Justice Clark:</author>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">. Tbe only error assigned in this case is, that the Orphans\u2019 Courttaxed with tbe costs and awarded to R. S. Waddell, Esq., attorney for John P. Biles, tbe sum of seventy-five dollars, as an allowance for counsel fees. Prior to the passage of tbe act of April 27,1864, tbe burden of compensating counsel for conducting proceedings in partition was borne in the Orphans\u2019 Court, by tbe petitioner, and in tbe Common Pleas, by the plaintiff; and, as the result of the action was alike beneficial to all tbe parties, it was deemed advisable to equalize tbe burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Tbe act of April 27, 1864\", therefore provides, as follows: \u2014 \u2022 \u201c Tbe costs of all cases in partition, in tbe Common Pleas or Orphans\u2019 Courts of this commonwealth, with a reasonable allowance to the plaintiffs or petitioners for counsel fees, to be taxed by tbe court or under its direction, shall be paid by all the parties in proportion to their several interests.\u201d Tbe act was nqt designed to pay tbe fees of mere litigation; services in tbe trial of contested eases were not the end in view: Grubbs\u2019 Appeal, 82 Pa. 23; hence tbe law fixes tbe compensation as a reasonable one, to be taxed by tbe court or under its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>direction. This enables tbe court to see that only a proper charge is made : Snyder\u2019s Appeal, 54 Pa. 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">But John P. Biles was not one of the petitioners in this proceeding. The petition, which it is alleged had been prepared by Mr. Waddell in his behalf, was never presented to the court; if this had been done, he might, under the circumstances, have been joined in the action; but this was not done, and even if it be true, that John P. Biles actually favored the partition, and acquiesced in all the proceedings which were had in the case, still he was in fact not one of the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The compensation of the petitioners\u2019 counsel, can only be taxed with the costs, because the act of assembly expressly authorized it. The power of the court is necessarily limited to the provisions of the statute. As the court had no power to tax the counsel fees of any but the petitioners\u2019 counsel, it follows that the decree was in this respect erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is therefore reversed, and the record remitted, in order that the decree may be modified in accordance with this opinion. The appellee to pay the costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
