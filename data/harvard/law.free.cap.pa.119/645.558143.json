The grain to be divided in the bushel and to be taken and carried to the mill and to be ground or sold as she shall or may from time to time order and direct, and the flour and bran made therefrom, or so much thereof as she shall or may from time to time require, be brought and delivered to her up-stairs in the house free from any cost or charge whatever; under and subject however that my daughter Catherine Brotzman shall, as long as she shall remain single and unmarried, have the free and undisturbed use, liberty and privilege of the room up-stairs that she has now in her possession, together with the necessary privilege in the kitchen, cellar, yard, garden and outhouses, and free egress, regress and ingress to and from said room, and to be furnished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>by my beloved wife during said term with as much provision as she may reasonably want without any cost or charge whatever. It is further my will and I hereby order and direct that in case that the said devise should, in the opinion of my son Abraham and my daughter Rachel and the survivor, be insufficient for the comfortable support and maintenance of my said wife and daughter Catherine during said term, then I order and direct that the sum of one hundred dollars shall be paid annually during said term to my said wife and daughter and the survivor out of the proceeds of the rent for the ore-bed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">To this bill the defendants, other than Rachel Riehl, executrix surviving, appeared and demurred, for cause alleging want of jurisdiction, adequate remedy at law and no relief grantable in equity. Rachel Riehl, the executrix surviving, then appeared, and on March 14,1881, for answer to the bill said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-6\">1. That the statements of fact made in the several sections of the bill of said plaintiff are true, and that the extracts from said will are correctly made, and a true and correct copy of said will is appended to said bill.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">2. And further, that this defendant denies and disclaims having authorized any defence to the bill of said plaintiff by demurrer or otherwise, but avers that the prayer of said plaintiff is just and equitable, and that in the opinion of this defendant the devise mentioned in said will is insufficient for the comfortable support and maintenance of said plaintiff, and that the annual payments of one hundred dollars each, with arrearages of interest, are necessary therefor and should be promptly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-8\">Wherefore defendant respectfully prays your- honorable court to make such construction of said will and decree as may carry out the intention of testator, and that she be dismissed hence with her reasonable cost in this behalf sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-9\">The demurrer filed by the other defendants was overruled and they were assigned to answer. Their answer, filed February 27, 1882, substantially admitted the averments of the bill, but denied the alleged deprivation of rights and privileges and the liability of defendants for the annual payments, admitting one annual payment and alleging want of equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-10\">Issue having been joined, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. Wm. O. Shipman, </em>as examiner and master, who filed a report, over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ruling certain exceptions thereto, on January 17, 1887, in which he found, in respect of the rights and privileges in the room, garden, cellar, yard and outhouses provided for the plaintiff by the testator\u2019s will, that it was the intention of the testator to give them to her so long as she remained single; that the devise in question was not a mere legacy charged upon the land, but an interest or estate; that the plaintiff had been deprived of these privileges, but that no specific relief in equity by way of reinstatement could be decreed, and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was an action for damages. He further found that the provision for the payment of $100 annually to the plaintiff continued to her after the death of her mother; that the legacy was demonstrative payable out of the rent of the ore-bed and was to follow the rent of the ore-bed generally, without restraint or confinement to the then existing lease; that, though it was contended that the legacy could not be recovered by means of a bill in equity, but resort must be had to a common law action, and that it did not appear by proper averments in the bill that it was the opinion of the testator\u2019s daughter Rachel that the devise of the household and other privileges previously given to the plaintiff was insufficient for her support and maintenance, yet it was the opinion of the master that the omission from the bill of such averments was not fatal, but amendable: City v. Railroad Co., 15 W. N. 364; Commonwealth v. Coit, 15 W. N. 270; Commonwealth v. Reeves, 13 W. N. 45; and that if, on the one hand, the amount of the rent was payable by the lessee to the legatee, then the acceptance and receipt thereof by the devisees would make them trustees for the legatee and they would be obliged to refund to her: Story, Eq. J., \u00a7\u00a7 1041,1196; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 307; McCoy v. Scott, 2 R. 222; Robb\u2019s App., 41 Pa. 45; Landis v. Scott, 32 Pa. 495; but, if the devisees of the realty were to be custodians of the fund and were authorized to receive and pay over the determinate and fixed portion of the rent as an annuity, then they were vested with the property for the benefit of another, were trustees under the will and the bequest was a testamentary trust; that he inclined to the latter alternative, and, citing Story\u2019s Eq. J., \u00a7 1041; Landis v. Scott, 32 Pa. 495; Anderson v. Henzey, 7 W. N. 39; Brown\u2019s App., 12 Pa. 337; Seibert\u2019s App., 19 Pa. 49, concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the court sitting in equity had jurisdiction, and, finding that the rental of the ore-bed per annum had all along exceeded $100, reported a decree that the bill be dismissed as to Rachel Riehl, executrix, and the Glendon Iron Co., and that the other defendants pay to the plaintiff the sum of $1,370, the amount of her unpaid annuity, with interest from January 1, 1876, to January 1, 1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">Exceptions to this report on the part of the plaintiff, overruled by the master and renewed on the filing of his report, were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-6\">1. The master erred in not recommending a decree that the oratrix be accorded, and reinstated in, the rights, liberties and privileges provided for her and directed in said will, as prayed for.1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-7\"><em>2. </em>The master, after finding the fact- that plaintiff has been deprived of said rights, liberties and privileges by defendants, erred in his conclusions of law that she cannot be accorded them and reinstated therein, and that she cannot be compensated in damages for such time as she may have been deprived of them.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-8\">Various-exceptions were filed by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-9\">On June 6,1887, the court Schuyler, P. J., disposed of the exceptions to said report in the following opinion and decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-10\">The last will of Joseph Brotzman, deceased, after making certain provisions for the testator\u2019s widow and his daughter, Catherine, proceeds as follows: \u201c It is further my will, and I hereby order and direct that in case the said devise should, in the opinion of my son Abraham and my daughter Rachel and the survivor, be insufficient for the comfortable support and-' maintenance of my said wife and daughter Catherine, then I order and direct that the sum of one hundred dollars shall be paid annually to my said wife and daughter and the survivor out of the proceeds of the rent for the ore-bed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-11\">In a subsequent part of his will the testator devises to his three sons, John, Abraham and Josiah, three contiguous tracts of land which they held in common, down to the death of the widow, th\u00e9 latter event occurring in 1875. Upon the death of the widow partition was made of these three tracts, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tract containing the ore-bed above mentioned fell to the lot of John. John subsequently died leaving a widow and three children, who succeeded to his title to the ore-bed, and are the real defendants in the present bill. The purpose of the bill is to obtain a decree that the defendants pay to the plaintiff, who is the \u201c daughter Catherine \u201d mentioned in the will, $1,100, with interest, the $1,100 representing eleven years of alleged arrearages from 1876 to 1886 inclusive, in the payment of the $100, which the testator directs to be \u201c paid annually \u201d out of the proceeds of the rent of the ore-bed. The learned master has recommended such a decree, and in so doing, we think, has committed error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">It will be noticed that the direction as to the payment of the $100 is not absolute, nor is the payment made to depend upon whether, in point of fact, the previous provision for the testator\u2019s widow and daughter was or was not sufficient, but the payment is made contingent upon the previous provision proving to be insufficient \u201c in the opinion \u201d of testator\u2019s son Abraham and his daughter Rachel. It is not for us to question the wisdom of such a bequest as this, nor does it lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to complain of its terms. True, both Abraham and Rachel might die,' as Abraham did die, without forming any opinion on the subject; or they might, if living, arbitrarily refuse to form an opinion, and in either case the bequest would fall. But the testator\u2019s bounty was his own and he could annex his own conditions to it. He might have withheld it altogether and plaintiff would have had no just ground of complaint, and she has just as little ground to complain that the bequest was given on a condition that might never happen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-6\">There is no dispute as to the testator\u2019s meaning. That is as plain as words can make it. The bequest is to vest only in case the previous devise should, in the opinion of testator\u2019s son Abraham and testator\u2019s daughter Rachel, be insufficient. Such being the condition on which the bequest is given, it is somewhat remarkable that the present bill, whose sole purpose is to enforce payment of the bequest, contains no averment that the condition has happened. The learned master passes over this serious omission very lightly, simply saying that it is amendable, and in so doing has adopted an opinion quite prevalent in the profession, that in equity amendments of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>pleadings are of right at any stage in the proceedings. This is a mistake. The rule as to bills is, that \u201c after witnesses have been examined the court will not, unless under very special circumstances, or in consequence of some subsequent event, allow the bill to be altered or amendedStory\u2019s Eq. PL, \u00a7 887. We do not understand that this rule has been changed by the act of May 4,1864, \u00a7 2, P. L. 775. The rule is a proper one and should be enforced. An opposite rule would but foster carelessness and tend to confusion and delay, without any corresponding good. We cheerfully concede that it is human to err. We also concede that even under our greatly simplified system of equity pleadings, mistakes may occur, even with the most careful pleaders, but when they do occur application to amend should be made at the earliest opportunity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-5\">But, even if bills were amendable as a matter of course at any stage in the proceedings, it would not help the plaintiff, for in the case in hand there is nothing to amend by. There is no evidence to indicate that either Rachel or Abraham ever in fact formed an opinion as to the insufficiency of the devise. The only evidence on the subject is to be found in the testimony of Rachel herself, delivered four years after bill brought, and all that she says is, that she \u201cknew that Catherine needs the $100 named in the will.\u201d Upon this testimony alone, although Rachel does not say when she acquired her knowledge, and although there is no pretence that it was ever communicated to defendants, the learned master recommends the decree referred to above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-6\">Very little reflection will show that the decree recommended by the master is a hard decree; so hard that we should hesitate to adopt it for that reason alone. Piad a demand in legal form been made on the defendants in 1876, it is fair to presume that they could have easily paid the $100, as the will directs, that is \u201cannually;\u201d whilst, if we adopt the decree recommended by the master, it might result in sweeping away their entire inheritance, and this through no fault of theirs. In the face of such a result, it is idle to talk about the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights, if she has any, as we think she has not. But concede, for the sake of the argument, that the plaintiff was under no legal duty to make a prior demand. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>enough, for our present purpose that she was under a moral duty so to do, and not having done so we think she has no standing in court. Plaintiff must remember that\" she is in a court of equity seeking equitable relief, and that whoever comes into a court of equity must come with clean hands. \u201c It is not alone fraud or illegality which will prevent a suitor from entering a court of equity; any really unconscientious conduct, connected with thfe controversy to which he is a party, will repel him from the forum whose very foundation is good conscience : \u201d 1 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 404. She must also remember, that although equity follows the law, \u201c a court of equity will in no case allow itself to be made the instrument of injustice : \u201d Kerr on Injunctions, 6.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-5\">In its purely legal aspect the present case presents two questions of considerable difficulty. The first has already been hinted at, whether even at law a prior demand is not necessary. The second is, whether from a fair interpretation of the whole will, it was not the intention of the testator that the $100 bequest should cease at the death of the widow. In the view taken above, it becomes unnecessary to decide these questions. I will say, however, that as to both of them the inclination of my mind is in favor of the theory of the defendants. I also agree with the learned counsel for the defendants that the $100 bequest is made a charge on lands, but I cannot agree with him that this court, sitting as a court of equity, has no jurisdiction to enforce payment of such legacies. The original jurisdiction of courts of equity over legacies charged on land is undoubted. Indeed, until the rule was changed by legislation, the jurisdiction was exclusive: Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., \u00a7 602. By our own act, February 24, 1834, \u00a7 59, P. L. 84, similar jurisdiction is conferred on the Orphans\u2019 Courts, and a mode is provided for enforcing the payment of such legacies. By operation of act March 21, 1806, \u00a7 13, 4 Sm. L. 332, this mode must be pursued to the exclusion of all common law remedies. The latter act, however, has no application to equitable remedies, and an examination of the cases relied on to prove that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court to enforce legacies charged upon land is exclusive, will show that they are all cases where an attempt has heen made to enforce payment of such legacies by a common law action. Every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>lawyer knows how tenacious courts of equity are of a jurisdiction that has once attached. Nothing short of a positive act of assembly can take away such jurisdiction, and there is no such act in reference to legacies charged upon land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-5\">1887, June 6, bill dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-6\">Upon the filing of the foregoing opinion and decree, the plaintiff took this, writ specifying that the court erred;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-7\">I, 2.

A court of equity having jurisdiction, with full proof of an equitable claim before it, should have power to make some decree. A decree of reinstatement in, or restitution of, rights, would not alone compensate for the years of their loss. Compensation in damages has been decreed again and again: Masson\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 26; Allison\u2019s App., 77 Pa. 221; Story\u2019s Eq.

The equity once shown to exist, will not be permitted to fall for want of a trustee ; nor by reason of any act or omission of the trustee; nor by reason of his refusal and neglect to execute a power, if such power is so given that it is reasonably certain that the donor intended that it should be exercised; Perry on Trusts, 3d ed., \u00a7\u00a7 248, 250, 251, 255; 2 Pomeroy, Eq. J., \u00a7 988; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. J., 13th ed., 384.

L. 84, it is provided that \u201c when a legacy is or hereafter may be charged upon or payable out of real estate, it shall be lawful for the legatee to apply, by bill or petition, to the Orphans\u2019 Court having jurisdiction of the account of the executor of the will by which such legacy was bequeathed, whereupon such court, having caused due notice to be given to such executor, and to the devisee or heir, as the case may be, of the real estate charged with such legacy, and to such other persons interested in the estate, as justice may require, may proceed, according to equity, to make such decree or order touching the payment of the legacy out of such real estate as may be requisite and just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">In Pierce v. Livingston, 80 Pa. 99, it was said by Shaes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\"WOOD, J., in commenting upon this section: \u201c It is very well settled that the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court under this section of the act is exclusive.\u201d This was the very point decided in the case, and the opinion is fortified by the citation of numerous authorities which fully sustain it. The 59th section of the act of 1834 gives a complete remedy in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and was evidently intended to exclude every other remedy and jurisdiction. That this is so as to common law remedies is admitted. Such result necessarily follows from the act of March 21, 1806, 4 Sm. L. 332, which provides that \u201c in all cases where a remedy is provided, or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of assembly of this commonwealth, the directions of said act shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.\u201d The learned judge below, however, held that this did not interfere with the jurisdiction of equity, and that a bill may still, be filed in the Common Pleas to enforce the payment of a legacy charged upon land.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">This is a narrow view of the act of 1806. Of what possible use is a bill in equity where an act of assembly has given a convenient and adequate remedy ? The very corner-stone of equity jurisdiction is that a wrong exists for which no adequate remedy has been provided, and which the law fails to correct by reason of its universality. Our books are full of cases in which it has been held that where a remedy has been provided by act of assembly, equity has no jurisdiction. Thus it has been held that a bill in equity will not lie against an incorporated company where the act incorporating such company gives a remedy by a proceeding for the assessment of damages, and that such remedy must be pursued: Stump\u2019s Appeal, 38 Leg. Int. 205. \"VVe have innumerable decisions to the effect that in all such cases the remedy must be pursued. So, indeed, we have an act of assembly to that effect, the act of 1806: Spangler\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 387. Other illustrations might be given and other authorities might be cited, were it necessary to show that under the act of 1806 a remedy given by an act of assembly must be \u201c strictly pursued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Prior to the act of 1834 the remedy universally adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>this state to recover a legacy charged upon real estate was a common law action. The books are full of such cases, and the practice continued long after the act of 1834 was passed. As was remarked by Justice Coulter in Strickler v. Sheaffer, 5 Pa. 240: \u201c Such is the tenacity, however, of customs and forms, in their hold upon the mind, that the old practice still lingered and lingers in some parts of the state.\u201d These cases were invariably reversed when they reached this court. Some little of this tenacity for old forms and customs must still exist, if we may judge from the frequency with which uncertain remedies are resorted to where a certain, convenient, and adequate one is given by an act of assembly. The filing of this bill, however, cannot be said to be a result of clinging to old forms, as I have no knowledge of such a bill having been filed in this state before; certainly none such has been called to our attention. The learned master below, in his labored argument to sustain the jurisdiction of the equity side of the Common Pleas, cites no such case. He places his opinion mainly upon the ground that this is a testamentary trust. The will undoubtedly creates a charge upon the land. A ground-rent and a mortgage are respectively a charge upon real estate. Whether the will of the testator creates a testamentary trust is a subject foreign to this inquiry. The jurisdiction of the Common Pleas cannot be sustained upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Pierce v. Livingston and numerous other cases have decided as plainly as language can make it, that under the act of 1834 the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is exclusive in the case of a legacy charged upon real estate. And we are of opinion that it excludes the equity as well as the common law jurisdiction of the Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Upon the merits we are all with the learned auditor, and are of opinion the plaintiff is entitled to the sum awarded her, but as she is in the wrong court, we cannot help her in this proceeding. The court reversed the auditor, and dismissed the bill. We are constrained in view of what has been said to affirm the decree, but it is without prejudice to her right to proceed under the act of 1834 in the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
