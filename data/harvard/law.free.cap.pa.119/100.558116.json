Strutkers, kis wife, presented tkeir petition in the court below, setting forth in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">That Anna C. Peace, wife of Edward Peace, died on April 21,1876, seized in fee of a certain parcel of land in Radnor township, containing about 104 acres, leaving a last will and testament, duly admitted to probate, wherein after a life estate to her husband, she devised the said real estate \u201c to such person or persons, and in such shares and proportions, and in such way and manner as the said Edward Peace by his last will and testament may nominate and appoint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-10\">That Edward Peace died on September 19, 1879, leaving a will, duly admitted to probate, wherein he provided: \u201cThe residue of my estate of every kind, and that left to me by my beloved wife in her last will and testament to dispose of as I deemed best, I direct my executors to divide into five parts. One part I will and bequeath to Phillip Physic Peace; one part I will and bequeath to my son Edward Coleman Peace ; one part I will and bequeath to my daughter, Anna Peace Bache; one part I will and bequeath to my daughter, Florence Peace; one part I will and bequeath to Mary Peace. The three last parts of my estate are to be held in trust by my executors or trustees, and the interest to be paid quarterly into their own hands. I also give to my daughters power to dispose of their shares by will, if they leave no children, as they choose, but if either should leave children, they are to inherit their mother\u2019s share equally at her death. If either of my children should die before attaining the age of twenty-one years their part of my estate is to be divided among the sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>vivors equally.\u201d Upon this will, letters testamentary were duly granted to James Rawle, and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">That these beneficiaries were all children of the said testator, and all attained full ageAnna Peace Bache had died intestate leaving to survive her a second husband, Henry Hobert Brown, and a minor child, Coleman Peace Brown; Florence P. was the wife of Robert P. Smith, and had two minor children; Mary, the wife of John S. Watts, had died leaving to survive her, her husband and two minor children, Anna Coleman Watts and John Murray Watts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">That by proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, resulting in a \u2022 sale thereof, the petitioners had become the owners in fee of two fifths of said real estate, being the interests of said Coleman P. Brown and of Anna C. and John M. Watts; and that one fifth was held by the said executors as trustees of Florence P. Smith, and to Philip P. and Edward C.

J., overruled these objections and on November 7, 1887, all parties in interest having neglected or refused to take arid accept the real estate, entered a decree authorizing and requiring \u201cJames Rawle, the active executor of the last will and testament of Edward Peace, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ceased,\u201d he having first given bond, etc., to expose the said real estate to sale, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">Exceptions having been filed to this decree, James Rawle, et al., executors and trustees under the will of Edward Peace, then took this appeal, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">1. Because it decreed an inquest and a sale of the premises notwithstanding that the petition showed that the petitioner, Mrs. Vannie D. Struthers, had no such interest or estate as would entitle her to maintain proceedings for partition in that court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">2. Because it decreed an inquest and a sale of the premises, as the property of the estate of Edward Peace, deceased, whereas the record shows that the parties took under the will of Anna C. Peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">3. Because the court decreed a sale of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">4. Because the court decreed a sale to be made by James Rawle, executor of Edward Peace, and not by the administrator d. b. n. of Anna C. Peace.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-10\"><em>Mr. Francis Rawle </em>(with him <em>Mr. Robert Ralston </em>and <em>Mr. Walter Gr.

The executor does not give one fifth of the estate to each of his children, but he directs it to be divided into five \u201cparts,\u201d and one of these parts he gives to each one of his children. Until these parts were ascertained by the act of the executors, in pursuance of their duty under the will, the beneficiaries, while having a vested interest in their parts, as finally set out, could not ascertain the specific property belonging to them. If the legal estate, necessary to effectuate the testator\u2019s intent, was vested in the executors, it seems clear that until an allotment was made, the beneficiaries took no interest which entitled them to a partition: Ruffel\u2019s Est. (O. C.), 1 W. N. 286; Lindenberger v. Matlack, 4 Wash. C. C. 278. This question, arising on the construction of the same will, has already' practically been passed upon by this court in Peace\u2019s Est., 106 Pa. 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-12\">2. The entire proceedings below were based upon the erroneous idea that the parties took under the will of Edward Peace. ' Clearly they took under the will of Anna C. Peace: Commonwealth v. Williams, 13 Pa. 29; Middleton v. Crofts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>2 Atk. 650. And where there is an administrator or executor competent and willing to act, the court cannot grant an order to sell in partition proceedings to any other person: Snyder\u2019s Appeal, 54 Pa. 67.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-4\">8. A decree of sale in the Orphans\u2019 Court in partition is definitive and an appeal may be taken before the execution of the order: Robinson\u2019s App., 62 Pa. 213; Horam\u2019s Est., 59 Pa. 152; Hess\u2019s App., 1 W. 255.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-5\"><em>Mr. George B. Darlington </em>(with him <em>Mr. Jos. B. </em>Townsend), for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-6\">1. The jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is based upon \u00a7 4, act of April 13, 1840, P. L. 320. The fact that minors are interested is on the record and undisputed. The alienee of an heir has all his rights in respect of partition in the Orphans\u2019 Court: Ragan\u2019s Est., 7 W. 438; Sampson\u2019s App., 4 W. &amp; S. 91; Thompson v. Stitt, 56 Pa. 156; Stewart\u2019s App., 56 Pa. 241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-7\">2. In the will of Edward Peace, there is no estate devised or given to the executors, and no power of sale or conveyance over real estate is conferred upon them. There is not one word to break the transmission of the title and estate passed to the devisees named in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-8\">3. Though Anna C. Peace was the last sole owner in fee, her will alone does not carry the title to the parties who were to take at the death of her husband. His will was the conduit to carry the title to his children in the mode and manner it defined. But if there was error in not directing the order of sale to the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Anna Peace, it was amendable below and is amendable here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"An-\">Mr. Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We find no error in this record. Mrs. Struthers, the petitioner, was the alienee of the shares of three of the minors, and as such was entitled to have partition: Ragan\u2019s Estate, 7 W. 438; Sampson\u2019s Appeal, 4 W. &amp; S. 86; Thompson v. Stitt, 56 Pa. 156; Stewart\u2019s Appeal, Idem 241. Aside from this, there are two minors interested in the estate. We are in no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Nor do we think the executors of the will of Dr. Edward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Peace have any such title to or interest in the property in question as gives them any right to prevent this partition. The will gives them no title whatever. Their power is confined to dividing it into five parts. And after such division they have no power to convey it. A title to the different divisions could only be given by proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court. This has been done as to all the real estate except this one property, which it is found cannot be divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We see no grounds, therefore, for our interfering with these proceedings for matters so purely technical. We are of opinion, however, that the decree below should be amended by substituting the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Anna C. Peace as the person to execute the order of sale in the place of the executor of Edward Peace. The will of the latter, so far as this real estate is concerned, is but the execution of the power contained in the will of Anna' C. Peace, and her administrator would seem, under the act of assembly, the proper person to make the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">It will be the duty of the court below to make this modification of its decree, and with this modification</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">On March 5, 1888, on motion of the appellants\u2019 attorneys, the decree entered in the foregoing cause was modified so far as to make the costs of the appeal payable by the appellees instead of by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
