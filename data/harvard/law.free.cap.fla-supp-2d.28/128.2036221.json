As a result of the pressure from the media and members of the community, De Acha withdrew Prida\u2019s play and substituted another.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In all, De Acha did produce three plays according to the agreement but the County refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The County Court entered a Final Judgment against the County for $1,000.00 plus costs and attorneys fees under Section 57. 105, F.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The County argues that enforcement of the agreement is contrary to public policy and that by doing so the Court is requiring the County to be a party to censorship and depriving Prida of her rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The Contract was with De Acha, not Prida. The County owed no duty to Prida. It had no control over the content of the plays.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">De Acha fully performed his part of the agreement and was entitled to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Though it appears that the County may have been oversensitive in its position and may not have had a legal defense to the action it cannot be said that there was a complete absence of a justiciable issue of law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The Judgment is affirmed except that portion awarding $750.00 in attorneys fees, which is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">The Motion for Attorneys Fees is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
