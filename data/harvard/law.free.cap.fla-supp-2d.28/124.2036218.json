There was no sworn Motion to Dismiss filed pursuant to the Rules of Criminal Procedure; had there been, the State would then have been afforded an opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>nity to file a traverse. Because of this procedural infirmity, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">We also reverse the orders denying the State\u2019s Motion to Extend the Speedy Trial Rule during the pendency of these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
