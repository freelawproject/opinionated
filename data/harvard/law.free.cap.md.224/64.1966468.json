On appeal here it is contended that Judge Raine, in reversing the Board, decided \u201ca point of law at variance with\u201d a decision previously rendered by Judge Macgill in the Circuit Court for Howard County, so as to make the case reviewable under Code (1957), Art. 2B, sec. 175 (f). But we think it is perfectly clear that Judge Raine\u2019s decision was predicated upon a finding that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unsupported by substantial evidence. If his finding was erroneous in fact, it would not be reviewable. On the other hand, Judge Macgill\u2019s action in affirming the Board in the other case was predicated on a finding that its action was not arbitrary and was supported by substantial evidence. We find no conflict on a point of law. Cf. <em>Good Citizens Community Protective Asso\u2019n v. Board of Liquor License Com\u2019rs of Balto. City, </em>217 Md. 129, 132, <em>Suttleman v.
