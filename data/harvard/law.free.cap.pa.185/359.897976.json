Hudson, n\u00e9e Rudy, for sale of real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-21\">The facts appear by the opinion of Ashman, J., dismissing tbe petition which was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-22\">The testator gave to his wife tbe income for life of bis resid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>uary estate, and at her death he authorized and empowered his executors to sell the residuary realty and to divide the proceeds of its sale equally between his two children, Sarah K. and George W. Rudy, \u201c if they be living, or the issue of such of them as may then be deceased.\u201d He died in 1878. George W. died in testator\u2019s lifetime, unmarried and without issue. The widow died November SO,-1895. Sarah K. died before the widow, but after the testator, leaving her husband and two sons to survive her. One of the sons died during the life tenancy, leaving a Widow. The husband of Sarah petitioned for an order of sale of the realty and a division of the proceeds. Had he an interest in the estate? And if he had, was it an interest which qualified him to aslc for the sale ? \u2022 This question involves the preliminary inquiry as to the character of the estates given to the children. Were they vested or contingent interests ? The word \u201c if,\u201d in the language of the gift \u201c if they be living,\u201d undoubtedly imports a contingency; yet the context may show that the contingency was not a condition precedent to the vesting, blit a condition subsequent which would operate merely to defeat an already vested estate. Thus, in Andrew v. Andrew, Law Reps. 1 Ch. Div. 410, A. devised land to T. for life, and from and after his death to his oldest son, if he should have attained the age of twenty-one, and in default of T.\u2019s having a son, then over. T. died, leaving one son, a minor. It was held that \u201c from and after \u201d meant an immediate gift at the death of the life tenant, and that the son took a vested estate in fee, subject to be divested by his death while a minor. In Alexander v. Alexander, 16 Com. B. 59, however, where the gift was to A., the son, for life, and from and after his decease to A.\u2019s second son, on his attaining 'twenty-one, and in default of there being a second son, then over, the decision was that the remainder to A.\u2019s second son, who died in his minority, was contingent. In Pennsylvania the rule is well established that where the persons who are to take must be living at a certain time,' the gift is contingent, because, until the time arrives, the persons who will answer to that description cannot be ascertained. Hence a gift to \u201csuch of his children as might then be living \u201d (McBride v. Smyth, 54 Pa. 245), or to a child for life, and after her death to \u201call her children then living\u201d (Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. Ill; Delbert\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa 462), has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>esteemed contingent. It is difficult \u2014 perhaps it is better to say impossible \u2014 to harmonize the latter cases with Crawford v. Ford, 7 W. N. C. 532, and Laguerenne\u2019s Estate, 12 W. N. C. 110, where the gift at the end of the life estate was to \u201c all my children who shall be then living, and the lawful issue of such as as shall be dead; \u201d or Manderson v. Lukens, 23 Pa. 31, to \u201c be equally divided among his children which should be then alive; and Womrath v. McCormick, 51 Pa. 507, where the estate was to \u201c be divided into as many parts as testator should then have children living, and be given to his living children and the issue of those dead,\u201d in all of which oases the estates were held to be vested. In this instance the scale vibrates about evenly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-4\">If, by the phrase \u201c if they be living,\u201d a qualification is annexed to the person, without fulfilling which he will be ineligible to take, the gift is uncertain until the condition is met, and is necessarily contingent upon the fact of his living. If, however, it is used to mark the time when the estate shall vest in possession, so that the children are to take an estate descendible to tlieir issue, which is to be enjoyed by the children at the death of the life tenant or by the heirs of their body, if they shall be dead, it carries a vested interest. This was the doctrine of Richardson\u2019s Appeal, 19 W. N. C. 175, where the gift was after the wife\u2019s death, to the children by name, \u201cand if any of my said children be deceased,\u201d the share shall go to his issue. The assumption that the interests were vested is favorable to the petitioner. If they were contingent upon the survival of the life tenant, the only party who by possibility would take was the surviving grandchild. The scheme of the will was to work a conversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-5\">The stock and fixtures in trade of the testator were ordered to be sold, and their proceeds, t\u00f3gether with the proceeds of sale of two specified houses, were directed to be applied to the payment of his debts, and finally, the moneys from the sale of the remaining real estate were to be divided among his children. The lapsed share of George, if it was personalty, vested as to one third in testator\u2019s widow and as to the balance in Sarah as testator\u2019s next of kin, and at her death in her two sons. When one of them died, the widow of the son was entitled to one half and the father to one half absolutely. But the intention to effect a sale was auxiliary to another and paramount intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u2014to effect a convenient transmission of testator's property to the devisees. The one intent affected the means, and the other the end, and if, for any reason, the, means were useless towards attaining the end, the lesser intent should be discarded. The purpose of a sale, and therefore of a conversion, was that the estate might be divided; if there was no necessity for a division, the purpose fell and the estate remained unconverted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">In the famous argument of Mr. Scott, afterward Lord Eldon, which was adopted by the chancellor in Ackroyd v. Smithson, 1 Bro. Ch. 503, it was shown that, in order to oust the heir, there must be not only an intention to convert the real estate for the purposes of the will, but also to give the product of the sale as personalty at all events and whether the purpose takes effect or not. In that case, the testator ordered his real and personal estate to be sold, and he gave the net proceeds to legatees, two of whom died in his lifetime. The lapsed shares, so far as thejr consisted of personalty, went to the next of kin, and, so far as they were constituted-of realtjr, went to the heirs- at law. This doctrine that real estate directed to be converted in order to subserve a purpose will be treated as personalty for that purpose, but will remain unchanged as to all beyond what that purpose requires, was upheld in King v. King, 13 R. I. 501, and Craig v. Leslie, 3 Wheat. 581, and those cases- were followed by this court-in Worsley\u2019s Estate, 36 W. N. C. 247.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-5\">Where the purposes of the conversion have totally failed the property will devolve according to its original character: Bisp. Eq., sec. 315. This retention of the quality of an estate, which the testator intended to transmute into another and different quality, may work a radical change in the interests of his beneficiaries. But that consideration can have no weight when we reflect that what has happened was outside of his contemplation altogether. He supposed that more than one person would share the residue, or he would not have ordered the sale and division of that residue. How can we, with any show of propriety, speculate upon what, if he had foreseen the actual event, he would or would not have done, either by way of preferring the heir, on the one hand, or the next of kin, on the other? The share which is in controversy lapsed by operation of law. \u2022 Its disposition cannot be referred to the intention of the testator, because he had no intention with regard to it. It must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>determined by the law, to which his silence on the point has relegated it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The case, then, is simply this: At the death of George W. Rudy, his share vested in Sarah K. Rudy as sole heir of the testator, but, inasmuch as her estate did not vest in possession, living the life tenant, her husband could not, at her death, take as tenant by the curtesy. Her two sons succeeded to her estate, and on the death of one of them, the survivor, subject to the life interests of the widow and father, took the lapsed share as heir, and the residue as sole devisee. The fee therefore centered in him as the one owner, and the direction to divide fell, because it is impossible to sever what is indivisible. The petitioner, as life tenant in one fourth of the realty, has certainly not such an interest as will entitle him to a sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court dismissing petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-7\"><em>Allen II.

L. 66; Act of February 24,1834, P. L. 75; Act of March 12, 1800, 3 Sm. L. 433, sec. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-8\">The executors under such a will are clothed with a power coupled with an interest, and the effect is to convert the realty into personalty, so much so that the interest of the heirs is not liable to lion or sale by the sheriff. It breaks the descent and vests the estate in the executors, leaving the legatees only an interest in the proceeds: Scott on Intestate Law (2d ed.), 582; Allison v. Wilson, 13 S. &amp; R. 332; Morrow v. Brenizer, 2 R. 188; Hannah v. Swarner, 3 W. &amp; S. 230; Silverthorn v.

An immediate and inevitable result of the direction to convert was to break the descent by vesting the estate in the executors, clothed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>power to sell, and to confer on the legatees, not an interest in the land, but simply a right to the proceeds of the sale, a mere chose in action, a claim strictly of a personal character : Willing v.
