As they approached Tenth street they saw a car going south on that street. Plaintiffs\u2019 son checked his speed, but continued on, and either ran into the front corner of the car, or on the track immediately in front of the car. He was struck and killed. The second boy struck the side of the car, but saved himself by throwing up his hands against the side. The motorman had his hands upon the brake and lever; he was at the moment looking eastward; the car was stopped in about four feet. The trial judge directed a nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-11\"><em>W.

He was sixteen years of age, and responsible for his acts. There was no opportunity for the motorman to prevent the collision, and in such circumstances, as we have many times held, there can be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
