Owing to a great shrinkage in his estate his intent to found a charitable institution failed. By his will he gave to his executors and trustees power to sell \u201cany or all of my real estate\u201d when they should think it for the best interest and benefit of his estate. Certain of his children petitioned the orphans\u2019 court to direct the trustees to sell the mansion house, which was an unproductive property, in order that the proceeds of the sale might be invested and the income therefrom distributed to testator\u2019s children. <em>Meld, </em>that it was proper for the court to direct the trustees to sell the property.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b448-11\">Argued March 29, 1898.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfI\">Appeal, No. 429, Jan.

Rogers, Harry Rogers, Frank G. Rogers and William Rudolph Smith to sell the property and invest the purchase money for the purpose of increasing the income to your petitioners and the other children of said Charles H. Rogers, deceased, and after their death holding the principal thereof for the trusts of testator\u2019s will. The trustees have replied to this request by stating that in their judgment they deem it for the best interests of the estate to make sale of the premises, and they would make said sale saving for the fact that they are doubtful as to their authority to do so under the terms of testator\u2019s will. For this reason and this reason alone, they decline to make said sale, saying that they will deem it their duty to sell and that they will sell, if your honorable court shall declare that they have the power so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">Your petitioners further pray your honorable court to cite the trustees to appear and make answer whether they do decline to sell said premises solely because they are in doubt as to their powers to do, and if upon their answer it shall appear that they do decline for said reason only, then to order such sale, and in support of their application they offer the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">Your petitioners are advised that there is no immunity or exemption from sale inhering in the title to the mansion house and thirty-six acres of ground before mentioned, but that a sale of the premises at this time with the purchase money held upon the same trusts would best carry out the real intentions of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">Your petitioners submit that the primary intent of the testator was to establish a home; that his secondary intent was to establish that home in the mansion house in which he resided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>and tbe thirty-six acres of ground more or less thereunto belonging. The condition of the estate as herein set forth, your petitioners feel clearly demonstrates that this secondary intent has failed. At the present time, were all the children deceased, after payment of $600,000 in legacies to the grandchildren, the whole personal estate, and practically all of the real estate, save this mansion house and property would be exhausted; if, therefore, the trustees and executors would retain the same, it would be absolutely impossible for them to carry out the provisions of \u00bb the will for the establishment of the home at this place. There would be a home without any means of maintaining the same or supporting the occupants. Your petitioners respectfully submit that a state of affairs has developed in this estate which establishes that the home must be sold in the end. That it would be a great hardship on the children of decedent if the trustees are compelled to maintain this property at a considerable expense to the estate in the hope that possibly a sufficient number of grandchildren will die to permit an appropriation of a fragment of the estate in the future to the appropriation to a home. Your petitioners further show that the testator clearly had his children in mind as the primary objects of his bounty when he expressed his thoughts in these words in his will:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">\u201c And it is my will, however, that in no event shall either or any of my said children receive annually a less sum than six thousand dollars out of the said income of my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">The children after the extinguishment of the $10,000 annuity now paid to -Miss Mary Rogers, will receive barely $8,500 per annum. A sale of the mansion property might add from $800 to $1,000 to the income of each, yet they would still be in receipt of a much smaller sum than was contemplated by the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">Your petitioners further show that the mansion house upon the property is a very large one, most expensively built, having twenty-two rooms, exclusive of bath rooms, and the whole exterior of the grounds surrounding to be kept in order consistently with the mansion house involves a large expenditure of money; that by reason thereof, and by reason of other surroundings, the property today would not bring a rental in any way commensurate with the interest on the purchase money of the entire tract if sold; that the real value of the property today con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sists in the grounds divided up, and that sooner or later city streets will he cut through the property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">That all of the cestuis que trustent, under said will, have knowledge of these proceedings, and are desirous that a sale of the premises should be consummated, as is evidenced by their answer to that effect hereto attached; those who are minors being represented by their said guardians ad litem.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">Your petitioners attach to this petition affidavits of S. Kingston McKay and Henry R. Gummey, two experienced men in the real estate business in Philadelphia, as to the proportionate value of rental and sale of the property. A certificate of the board of revision of taxes of the assessment of the properly for taxation is hereto annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">In view of the existing circumstances and the power of sale vested in said trustees, and on the information that your petitioners have received that the trustees have expressed themselves as being of the opinion that it would be for the best interests of the estate that a sale should be made, your petitioners pray your honorable court to direct said trustees to sell said mansion house and all of said thirty-six acres of ground, more or less, thereunto appertaining and belonging, at either public or private sale, as a whole or in parcels, as to them shall seem meet, if it shall appear that they deem such sale should be made, but decline solely because of their doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\">The court made the order prayed for by the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-9\"><em>William Rudolph </em>Smith, for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag-\">presented no argument, but stated that the trustees did not think it wise to make the sale until their power to do so had been judicially determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-10\"><em>Charles Biddle </em>and <em>John Gr. </em>Johnson, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"APOB\">April 11, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b456-11\">Pee Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Undoubtedly it was for the best interest of the estate of the decedent that the decree of sale of the property in question should be made. It is perfectly clear also that the power of sale conferred upon the executors and trustees by the will of the testator was amply sufficient to justify the sale by them. It em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>braced the whole of the testator\u2019s real estate of which this property was a part, and the learned court below was entirely right in granting the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
