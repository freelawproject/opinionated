So much of the devise in trust as attempts the creation of an estate in remainder, violates the rule against perpetuities, and is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\">2.

The manifest scheme and purpose of the devise was to make a disposition of testator\u2019s estate which the law forbids, and the particular estate devised was attempted solely in furtherance and aid of this purpose. It therefore falls under the same condemnation as the devise in remainder, and is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-11\">4. The whole devise to the beneficial donees therein named being invalid, George Johnston died intestate as to the beneficial interest in the lands described in this devise, and the plaintiff, as one of his heirs at law, is entitled to the relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-12\">5. There being no other disposition of said beneficial estate or interest in said lands, contained in the last will of George Johnston, the testator, a trust results to the heirs at law of the said George Johnston, deceased, to the extent of the estate given to his executors and their successors in the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-13\">The question presented is an interesting one, and we have given it our best consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-14\">It is first of all necessary that we have a clear understanding of what is meant by a perpetuity, and the rule which prohibits grants creating them, or tending to create them clearly stated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Perpetuities have been variously defined, and the rule against them has been expressed with quite as much variety. Whatever confusion there is among the cases, and it is not a little, \u2022 may be due to this circumstance; but in whatever terms defined or expressed, there is such a uniform and consistent recognition of the essential features and principles in every definition and rule, that, so far as these are concerned, there is no conflict whatever between them. All are not alike clear, but if closely studied all will be found consistent with each other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">Nowhere do we find a more intelligible and satisfactory statement of doctrine and rule than is given in the case of Phila. v. Girard\u2019s Heirs, 45 Pa. 26, in a summary as lucid as it is comprehensive. It is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">\u201c 1. Perpetuities are grants of property wherein the vesting of an estate or interest is unlawfully postponed; and they are called perpetuities not because the grant, as written, would actually make them perpetual, but because they transgress the limits which the law has set in restraint of grants that tend to a perpetual suspense of the title or its vesting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">\u201c2. The law allows the vesting of an estate or interest, or the power of alienation to be postponed for the period of lives in being and twenty-one years and nine months thereafter; and all restraints upon the vesting, that may suspend it beyond that period, are treated as perpetual restraints, and therefore as void, and consequently the estate or interests dependent upon them are void, and nothing is denounced by the law as a perpetuity that does not transgress this rule.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">Next it is important that we distinguish clearly between the two separate and distinct estates or interests which this devise attempts to create: First, a term of seventy-five years in a trustee fdr certain beneficiaries: Then, upon its determination, an absolute interest over to those, in effect, who would be entitled to take if the testator had then died intestate. To determine whether the devise is repugnant to the rule, and if so in what particular and with what result, these several estates must be considered separately, since it sometimes happens where several estates are created in the same subject, that while one must fall because of its offense, the other may stand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">Thus prepared for the inquiry it may not prove so difficult as it first appears.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>First then as to the particular estate \u2014 the term for years given to the trustee. There are many reported cases, among them Barnum v. Barnum, 26 Md. 119; Deford v. Deford, 36 Md. 168; Thorndike v. Loring, 15 Gray, 391; Fosdick v. Fosdick, 6 Allen, 41, in which devises not distinguishable from this are held to be violative of the rule, on the ground that the trusts of the wills required for their execution a longer period than the rule allows. If the doctrine of these cases be correct, then clearly enough this particular estate offends against the rule; since not only is there a possibility that the seventy-five years from the death of the testator will carry beyond the lifetime of the last surviving child of the testator, with twenty-one years and nine months added thereto, but, in view of the ages of these children, it is altogether probable that this will result. Besides, in such a case as this, a still shorter limit must be applied; for the rule is, that where the testator fails to avail himself of-lives in' being, and adopts a term of years, without reference to any life in being, the term cannot extend beyond twenty-one years from his death. \u201c If an absolute term is taken, and no anterior term for a life in being is referred to, such absolute term cannot be longer than twenty-one years : \u201d Perry on Trusts, 349. So we have a manifest repugnance between the devise and the rule, if the doctrine of the cases referred to be correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">It does not appear that these cases have been overruled, yet, Prof. Gray, in his Work on Perpetuities, pp. 166-176, insists that in all of them the rule had been both misunderstood and misapplied. His argument to us seems complete as it is convincing. Beginning with the origin of the rule, and tracing its development through all stages, he shows how in its design, and purpose, and uniform acceptance and application, except in the eases criticised, it was directed against future contingent interests only, and never could have had any reference whatever to vested estates. In this he is sustained by the terms of every definition that has been given of a perpetuity, and by every authority on the general subject. The cases referred to are not so many attempts to enlarge and widen the rule, so as to embrace other subjects than. those originally intended, but, as he insists, proceed upon a misapprehension of its purpose and scope.' The variance between them and the doctrine as stated in Phila. v. Girard\u2019s Heirs, supra, must strike any one, and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>impossible to see how both can be correct. The particular estates which they condemn are present vested interests, whereas the rule applies only to future estates. They condemn them because the trusts with which they are clothed may require in their execution a larger period than that prescribed by the rule. But Prof. Gray shows, clearly enough, that the rule has no concern with anything but the beginning of the estate; that it requires a vesting within the period, and where this occurs, the extent of continuance of it is something wholly outside of its ox&gt;eration. And so in section 232 he asserts, as admitted and established doctrine, that an interest is not obnoxious to the rule, if it begin within a life in being and twenty-one years thereafter, though it may extend beyond. The same thing is asserted by Lewis in his Work on Perpetuities, p. 144, and with equal clearness and emphasis. He says: \u201cThe remoteness against which the rule is directed is remoteness in the commencement, or first taking effect of limitations, and not in the cesser or determination of them. An estate that is to arise within the prescribed period, may be so limited as to be determined on the happening of any event, however remote.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-3\">There is of course no disputing such authority as this ; and the doctrine is so clearly expressed, as in the authority we have cited from our own state reports, that it admits of no two interpretations. Manifestly the cases criticised are reconcilable with neither. Applying then this doctrine and rule to the particular estate created by the devise we are considering, rather than subjecting it to the rulings made in these cases which have been referred to, it seems, judged of by itself, unrelated to other parts, to stand clear of the rule. Here the particular estate, both legal and equitable, vested at once. There was nothing future about it, except its continuance; it began within the prescribed limits, and it is of no consequence, so far as concerns the rule, that it extends beyond it. Each of the testator\u2019s children took a present vested interest in the term of seventy-five years, the full enjoyment of which nothing could defeat but his or her death before its expiration; not transmissible because not an estate of inheritance, but otherwise as freely alienable as any other estate or interest. It is impossible to see how the rule against perpetuities can be applicable in such a case as this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The ulterior estate, that is, the gift over to testator\u2019s children and grandchildren, upon the determination of the estate given to the trustee, must stand or fall by the same test. The determining question must be, is this a vested interest, or is its vesting suspended until the expiration of the particular estate ? If the former, it too is outside of the operation of the rule; but if the latter, the rule necessarily applies and as certainly condemns it; since if there be any suspension at all, it is for seventy-five years, whereas the utmost limit in a case like this is twenty-one years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-4\">An estate is said to be vested in interest, when there is a present fixed right in some one of future enjoyment of it; it is not vested, but contingent, when either the person who is to enjoy it, or the event upon which the estate is to arise is uncertain. The rule as stated in Smith on Executory Interests, p. 281, is as follows: \u201c Where real or personal estate is devised or bequeathed to such children, or to such child or individuals as shall attain a given age, or the children who shall sustain a given character, or do a particular act, or be living at a certain time, without any distinct gift to the whole class, preceding such restrictive description, so that the uncertain even forms part of the description of the devisee or legatee, the interest so devised is necessarily contingent on account of the person. For until the age is attained, the character is sustained, or the act performed, the person is unascertained; there is no person answering to the description of the person who is to take as devisee or legatee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-5\">In our case, a sale of the land is directed at the expiration of seventy-five years from testator\u2019s death, and the proceeds are bequeathed in the following language, \u201c to and among all my said children, share and share alike, that may be then living, and the legal descendants of any of my said children that may then be dead, the legal descendants of said deceased child or children to take however only such share or portion of the said proceeds of sale, as their deceased parent would have taken if then living.\u201d There is here no distinct gift to the whole class of children ; those only are to take who survive the determination of the particular estate. The language used makes a fair equivalent of a bequest to such children \u201c as shall attain a given age.\u201d Not for seventy-five years can there be any person answering to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the description of the persons who are to take as devisees or legatees. It is not as though the parties had been individuated, as in McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414, where the interest was held to be vested. The peculiar features of that case are said in the subsequent case of Cascaden\u2019s Estate, 15B Pa. 172, to have controlled its decision. The case last mentioned approaches most closely the case in hand. There the bequest was as follows: \u201c When the youngest child arrives at the full age of twenty-one years then I direct all my said real estate and investments to be converted into money by my executors, and divided as follows: I give and bequeath to my wife out of said moneys fifteen thousand dollars, and all the rest, residue and remainder I direct to be divided among my said children, share and share alike, subject to the deduction which I have before directed to be made. Should any of my children die before the youngest child arrives at the age of twenty one years leaving children, then the said share be divided among said children, share and share alike, or if he or she shall die without leaving children, then his or her share shall be divided among the remaining children, share and share alike.\u201d It was held that the interests given to the children did not vest until the youngest arrived at the age of twenty-one years. In the opinion, the court distinguished clearly between the facts of this and of McClure\u2019s Appeal, supra. They said : \u201cIn that case (McClure\u2019s Appeal) the testator directed the residue of his estate, if any, remaining after the death of his wife, to be equally divided between his nephews and nieces, individuating them by their names, and declaring that each is to have an equal share. It was said in the opinion of the court, \u2018 The gift is to his nephews and nieces, not as a class, but by name as individuals, without words of survivorship, and with no bequest over, in the event of their death, in the life of the widow.\u2019 Herein that case differs from the one in hand. In the latter the testator does not individuate his children and give each one a share by name. In fact the names of his children are nowhere mentioned in the will. The gift to them is to a class, and the distribution is to be made among them share and share alike when his youngest child shall arrive at the age of twenty-one years and the share of such child as shall die before that period, without leaving children, shall be divided among the remaining children, share and share alike. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>rt is obvious that had Mrs. Manrise (a daughter of the testator) died prior to the distribution without leaving children, her share would have gone to the surviving brothers and sisters under the terms of the will. But it was contended that because she left a child surviving her, her interest in the estate vested in her descended to and vested in .her child. Had this child lived until the period of distribution, there can be no doubt she would have been entitled to her mother\u2019s share. As she died before that time, to hold that she is entitled to her mother\u2019s share, is to accord to her a higher estate than her mother possessed. The estate of the latter was contingent upon her living until the youngest child came of age.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-4\">In the present ease it is the event \u2014 that is, the determination of the term of years \u2014 that is to indicate which if any of the testator\u2019s children or grandchildren are to take; the taking is made contingent upon their surviving, that period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Many authorities might be cited in support of the view we take of this part of the devise in question, that its effect is to create a future contingent interest, but it is hardly necessary to do more than we have. What gives it greater confirmation than any adjudication upon a case with general features the same,\u2014 since all the cases are more or less distinguishable from each other, and each stands upon its own peculiarities, \u2014 is the undisguised and unmistakable purpose of the devise to accomplish this very result, as manifest we think as though expressed in words. After all it is the intention of the testator that governs. It is impossible, as we read this will, to conclude that the testator intended that any of his children should take an estate or interest in the remainder which would be transmissible or alienable, during the continuance of the particular estate. And yet to hold these interests vested, would give them this quality. On the contrary, it is obvious that the testator\u2019s chief and controlling purpose throughout was to tie up his estate, and hold it intact beyond the power of either children or grandchildren to interfere with the final distribution he proposed at the end of seventy-five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">And it may be that we must yet allow to this purpose a still wider and more controlling effect, since having determined that this ulterior estate is a future -contingent interest, repugnant to the - rule and therefore void for remoteness, it remains to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>sider in what condition this leaves the particular estate. As we have said, this latter, standing by itself, unrelated to other parts, does not offend against the role; but this needs to be qualified somewhat. The estate it grants is free from offense, since it is freely alienable and in no sense tends to a perpetuity; but it contains a power to sell which flatly contravenes the rule and which dare not be exercised. The rule with respect to powers contained in a grant, is the same as that which applies to estates. \u201c If a power can be exercised at a time beyond the limits of the rule against perpetuities it is bad. This happens when a donee of the power, and the occasion on which it can be exercised, may both, by possibility, be in existence beyond the limits of the rule: \u201d Gray on Perpetuities, 306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\">So then we have nothing left of this whole devise, but a simple estate of seventy-five years in a trustee ; every other interest in the land passing directly and immediately to the heirs of George Johnston, the testator; in other words, the heirs taking the fee in the lands subject to this term of years, if the latter be allowed to stand. The result would be easily reached if the beneficiaries under the trust were the \u201cheirs \u201d of the testators; but they are not, the gift is to his children and the legal descendants- of such as shall die during the period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\">The rule with respect to void ulterior limitations is stated by Lewis, in his Work on Perpetuities, p. 420, as follows : \u201cAs to prior limitations, the invalidity of a limitation on account of remoteness, places all prior gifts in the same situation, as if it had been omitted entirely from the disposition scheme. ... A limitation of a life estate, or other partial interest, with a remainder expectant upon it, which is void for remoteness, of course remains in statu quo prius; neither receiving enlargement nor suffering diminution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">If this rule admits of no exception, but is to be applied in every ease, then this particular estate must stand. But, that is a conclusion that it would seem ought, if possible, to be avoided, for the devise stripped of the power of sale and avoided as to the larger estate over, cannot with any reason be said to express the testator\u2019s wishes. It will not be pretended that the particular estate was designed to serve any purpose of its own, distinct from the limitation over. On the contrary it is evident that it was adopted simply as a means to an end; a hook upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>which to hang suspended a tied-up estate, until such time as testator desired it to be opened and parted. How does it in any way enforce testator\u2019s wishes, to leave the hook in its place, when there is no estate to suspend upon it ? The estate which he expected to suspend for seventy-five years, if we are right in our previous conclusions, the law has disposed of, vested it at once in his heirs who have the right to dispose of their interests therein at any time. The whole scheme of tire testator in this regard has been defeated. Instead of observing his will, is it not rather enforcing one not his, to keep alive under such circumstances an estate which he contemplated only in connection with another and larger one which the law has annulled ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\">It would seem that such a case ought upon reason to be excepted out of the general rule. In McSorley v. Leary, 4 Sandf. Ch. 414 (7th. L. ed.), 1154, it is held that if a part of testator\u2019s general scheme is that the estate shall be kept entire for any unlawful period, no part of the provisions can be sustained, but the estate to which the void provisions relate, will vest immediately in the heir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\">\u201c When a will contains distinct and independent provisions so that different portions of the property or different estates or interests in the same portions of the property are created, some of which are valid and others invalid, the valid will be preserved unless those which are invalid and those which are valid are so dependent upon each other, that they cannot be separated without defeating the general intent of the testator: \u201d Haxtun v. Corse, 2 Bar. Ch. 506 (5th L. ed.), 782. The rule is stated in argument in Darling v. Rogers, 22 Wendell, 495, as follows: \u201c Where a will is good in part and bad in part, the part otherwise valid is void if it works such a distribution of the estate, as from the whole instrument taken together was evidently never the intention of the testator. Otherwise when the good part is so far independent that it would have stood had the testator been aware of the invalidity of the rest.\u201d In Hawley v. James, 16 Wendell, 61, in which the decision of the chancellor was reversed, it is distinctly asserted in the opinion of the Chief Justice that valid life estates prior to void remainders,- will not be upheld, if upholding them would work injustice and defeat the main object of the testator. Prof. Gray in his Work on Perpetuities clearly recognizes such exceptions to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>rule. In discussing those cases which seem to have overlooked that part of the rule which makes it applicable only to future contingent interests, he makes special reference, on p. 172, to the case of Thorndike v. Loring, 15 Gray, 391, supra, which of all the cases we have seen most nearly approaches this in its essential features. In that case a fund was given by will to trustees for fifty years (it is of no consequence in this connection that it was given to accumulate;) then to be paid over to those who would be entitled to the testator\u2019s estate if he had died intestate. The court held that the gift to the trustees was void for remoteness; that therefore the whole trust fell; that .a residuary clause in the will took effect and that the estate passed at once to the residuary legatees. Prof. Gray shows that the particular estate did not offend against the rule; that it was good in law or equity, though the ulterior gift was not. Nevertheless he sustains the action of the court in setting aside the whole trust, in the following language: \u201c It may be fairly urged in support of the decision in Thorndike v. Loring that the trust was created solely for the purpose of making an invalid gift and that its sole object being illegal the whole trust failed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-4\">It is equally clear that in the present case, the only purpose the testator had, in connection with the trust he established, was to make an invalid gift. His aim was to control the disposition of his property beyond the period that the law allows, and this devise was the scheme adopted to accomplish it. It was a manifest attempt to accomplish an illegal object, and for this reason, if for no other, the whole scheme should fail. A like result follows from the circumstance that the two estates are not separable; that is to say, they are so related that upholding the one and avoiding the other, would clearly defeat the main, if not the only purpose of the testator in making the devise. No cases are to be found in Pennsylvania supporting the view here expressed; but neither can any be found which are in conflict with it. There are cases, \u2014 Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 354, and others which recognize the general rule as stated by Lewis, viz : that a prior estate neither receives enlargement nor suffers diminution when a remainder expectant upon it is declared void for remoteness; but the question whether this general rule admits of exceptions, is nowhere discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>any of them. Elsewhere we have seen, the rule is not invariably applied, and a recognized exception is where, as in this case, the failure of the ulterior estate disturbs so as to defeat the main and dominant purpose of the testator. Another is where the particular, prior estate is adopted as a means for the accomplishment of that which the law forbids^ The present case falls within both exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-4\">Our conclusion is that the devise of the six several tracts of land described in the bill, contained in the last will of George Johnston, deceased, is wholly and entirely void, and that as to these lands, the said George Johnston died intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">It follows that the plaintiff, who is a son and heir at law, is entitled to the relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\">Let a decree in accordance herewith be prepared and submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-7\">The following decree was subsequently entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-8\">And now January 5, 1898, this cause came on to be heard at this term, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">1.
