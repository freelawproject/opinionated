An examination of the cases cited shows that with the exception of Brownfield\u2019s Estate not one of them sustains or even hints at such a proposition. In Smith\u2019s Appeal, there was an absolute gift with limitation over in case of death without issue; in Diehl\u2019s Appeal, power was given to the wife \u201c to do with all my property, whatsoever is left, whatever she pleases ; \u201d in Silknitter\u2019s Appeal, the gift was to a daughter \u201cand her heirs,\u201d with a provision that she should have \u201c only the interest during life,\u201d \u2014 these words, under well-settled principles, being insufficient to reduce the absolute gift (as in McCune v. Baker, 155 Pa. 503), and only \u201c operating on the manner of enjoyment; \u201d and in Grove\u2019s Estate, the wife to whom the estate was given, \u201c to be absolutely her own for and during her life,\u201d had also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>power to dispose of all, except what was given to certain legatees, \u25a0\u201c by her will together with such estate as she may acquire as her own.\u201d The syllabus of Brownfield\u2019s Estate, \u2014 the only remaining of the \u201c line of decisions \u201d referred to, is \u201c a bequest of personal property to a legatee for life, without any disposition of it after her death, may be. paid to her absolutely by the executor, and will be credited to him upon the settlement of his administration account.\u201d The objection to the credit was made by persons claiming as residuary legatees, but clearly shown not to be, and having, therefore,, no right to object. In the course of the argument for the executors, it was said by counsel, among other grounds, \u201c there being no limitation over, the bequest of personal property is absolute. See the rule established in 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848; \u201d and the court, after showing that the exceptants had no interest, adopted this suggestion, in. almost the very words in which it was made: \u201c The wife was entitled to receive it to dispose of as she pleased, there being no limitation over of it after her death. See 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848.\u201d In view of the want of interest on the part of the parties objecting to the credit, the point was not necessary to the decision of the case; and as no such rule was \u201c established in 5 Johns. Chan. Rep. 848,\u201d (Westcott v. Cady), it is probable, or at .least possible, that the learned judge accepted the assertion of counsel without looking at the report. Had he done so, he would have found that nothing of the kind was decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">Brownfield\u2019s Estate was decided in 1839, and is referred to. in no subsequent case prior to the. decision in Merkel\u2019s Appeal, in 1885 \u2014 a period of nearly fifty years. It is mentioned in Grey on Perpetuities, section 97, and shown to be opposed to the \u201c sounder and better supported doctrine \u201d that after a bequest of a life estate \u201c a reversionary interest is as valid as an executory bequest.\u201d .The idea is probably a relic of the common-law doctrine that there could be no limitation of personal property, by deed, after a prior life estate: 2 Kent, 352. Of course, where the gift is chiefly, or altogether, of things of which the use consists in the consumption \u2014 quaj ipso usu consumuntur (2 Kent, 353; 2 Williams on Executors, 1503; Drennan\u2019s Appeal, supra; Markley\u2019s Appeal, 132 Pa. 352; Scheifler\u2019s Estate, 18 W. N. 64), or where a power, to use or dispose of principal is given, expressly or by implication (Markley\u2019s Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>peal, supra; Gold\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. 495; Heppenstall\u2019s Estate, 144 Pa. 259), the gift of a life estate may be the equivalent of a gift of the absolute ownership \u2014 as it may be, also, where the will, taken in its entirety, shows that this was the intention of the testator, as in Merkel\u2019s Appeal; but in any case, this manifestly is not because of the mere absence of a limitation over. It is a fundamental principle that rights conferred by the intestate laws, in personalty no less than in real estate, can only be taken away by a will clearly manifesting a purpose to that effect (Hancock\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 532), which certainly cannot be said of a will limiting, in express terms, the extent of its operation to the life of the legatee, with no suggestion whatever of power to use or consume principal. In the case now before us, there is not only the gift of a mere life estate, but the further provision restricting it to the widowhood of the legatee, which, being a limitation \u2014 \u201c so long as,\u201d etc. (unlike the case of a condition), requires no gift over to make it effective: 2 Black, Com. 155; Richards v. Baker, 2 Atk. 321; Bennett v. Robinson, 10 Watts, 348. This restriction would be wholly defeated if the gift is to be treated as absolute in the first instance. See Sheaffer\u2019s Appeal, 8 Pa. 38. If, however, the law of Pennsylvania is as asserted in Merkel\u2019s Appeal, the principle would not apply to so much of the personal estate of this testator as is given at the death of the widow to charities. To this extent there is a limitation over; and the gifts having failed by reason of the death of the testator within a month after the execution of the will, the void legacies go, under the provisions of the statute, \u201c to the residuary legatee or devisee, next of kin or heirs, according to law.\u201d As there is no residuary gift, \u201c the next of kin according to law \u201d\u25a0 \u2014 that is, the persons who take under the intestate laws \u2014 are entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">But this testator blends his real and personal estate, and the life estate given to the wife is in both; and in such case, as conceded in Drennan\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 188, the doctrine asserted in Merkel\u2019s Appeal does not apply unless evidence of intention sufficient to overcome the presumption thus arising is furnished by the will itself. Here there is no such evidence,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">The exceptions to the readjudication are sustained, and one half of the principal of the estate is awarded to the widow, absolutely, and the other half to her upon the entry of security for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the protection of interests taking effect under the intestate laws at her death or remarriage; all income, including interest on deposits, if any, being also awarded to her absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-6\"><em>Lorenzo E. Bulette, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqU\">The limitation \u201c as long as she remains my widow,\u201d is a limitation upon condition subsequent, but without any limitation over, and is void: McIlvaine v. Gethen, 3 Wharton, 575; Hoopes v. Dundas, 10 Pa. 77; Marples v. Bainbridge, 1 Madd. 317; Long v. Dennis, 4 Burrow, 2055. The bequest is, therefore, in reality to the widow for life without any limitation over, which has been held in several cases to vest an absolute interest: Brownfield\u2019s Est., 8 Watts, 465; Merkel\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 235 ; Drennan\u2019s App., 118 Pa. 176; Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9; Diehl\u2019s Est., 36 Pa. 120; Silknitter\u2019s App., 45 Pa. 365; Grove\u2019s Est., 58 Pa. 429. Even if it were held that the void bequest to the charities constituted, quoad hoc, a limitation over, it would fall into the residue. But the clause conveying the bequest to the widow, it being the only disposing clause in the will, must be taken as the residuary clause, inasmuch as it follows the clause directing his debts and funeral expenses to be paid, and expresses the testator\u2019s intention to give \u201call my real and personal estate to my wife, Ellen,\u201d etc.; and, as the effect of this residuary clause is to give the widow an absolute interest she must take an absolute interest in whatever falls into and is disposed of by that clause: Merkel\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\">As the testator died within a calendar month of the date on which his will was executed, the bequest of $1,500 to the charities is, under the act of April 26,1855, void, and constitutes no limitation over of the gift to the widow: (a) because it falls into the residue by virtue of the act and not by direction of the testator ; (5) because the remedial part of the act takes away testamentary capacity as to such gift, from a testator dying within a calendar month of the execution of his will containing a gift to charity: Parsons v. Winslow, 6 Mass. 181; Wheeler v. Bingham, 3 Atkyns, 364; Garret v. Pritty, 2 Vern. 293; Gray\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 76.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-8\"><em>Preston K.

It is a rule of common sense as well as law, not to attempt to construe that which needs no construction.\u201d See also Woelpper\u2019s App., 126 Pa. 575.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">The appellant\u2019s contention moreover contravenes the peremptory rule that the heir and next of kin shall not be deprived of his rights under the intestate laws, except by express devise or necessary implication: Hitchcock v.

Pogue, 92 Pa. 254.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">Where there is any limitation over, there can be no inference that the use of the life tenant should be by absorption of the principal or any portion of it, otherwise there might be no remainder after the term for life for the limitations to take effect upon : Sheaffer\u2019s App., 8 Pa. 38.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Avt\">April 18, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-7\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Without assenting to all that was said by the learned judge who wrote for the court below, we all agree that his conclusion, on which the decree is based, is correct.
