Cooper Wetheral, deceased, has no interest under the alleged will of January 27, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-13\">The guardian claims that the interest of his wards in the estate of the decedent, which entitles him to his appeal, arises under the will of January 27,1888, through a bequest of $2,000 to their father, W. Cooper Wetheral, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-14\">In said will among a number of bequests to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of his <em>farm </em>is one of $2,000 to Wm. Cooper Wetheral, the father of these minors, but as Mr. Weth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>eral\u2019s death preceded that of the testator, this legacy would lapse unless otherwise disposed of by the will. The guardian claims that such disposition has been made by the substitution of his children, and points to the following clause of the will as making it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">\u201c In case any one to whom I have herein named (or made) a bequest shall not survive to receive his or her portion, and shall leave no child or children to inherit it, the share of any or all such legatees shall revert to my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">This is not a clause of substitution, for, if under it the children take, it must be by inheritance, and the legacy consequently have to first vest in the parent legatee. As Mr. Wetheral died before the testator the legacy bequeathed to him never vested in him, and his children consequently could not inherit it from him, and have, therefore, no interest under this will. If, however, we are wrong in our construction of the will, the appeal has been taken too late. The decree of the register probating the will of May 17, 1888, was entered May 16, 1892, and no appeal was taken therefrom until May 15, 1897, five years, less a day, thereafter. This decree was under the act of March 15, 1832, conclusive as to the personal estate unless appealed from within three years, and its legality could not be inquired into collaterally: Carpenter v. Cameron, 7 Watts, 51. The appeal in this case was consequently not taken in time, and for this reason, as well as for want of interest in the appellant, must be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">The rule is therefore made absolute and the appeal dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-9\"><em>W.
