On April 24,1864, Michael McGranighan took title to the premises described in the first paragraph of the bill, subject to a yearly ground rent of $36.00, payable to Richard J. Dobbins, his heirs and assigns, in equal half-yearly payments on the first day of the months of March and September in each year, redeemable on the payment of the principal sum of $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-10\">2. The said Michael thereupon entered into possession of said premises and about the year 1868 built a second house at the corner of 54th and Wyalusing avenue, on said lot. Into this second house he removed with his family, leasing thereafter the first house to his eldest son, Daniel, one of the plaintiffs, at the rent of $10.00 per month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>8. On October 2,1888, tlie said Michael died intestate seized in fee of the said premises, subject to the ground rent as aforesaid, leaving to survive him, his widow, Ann, and seven sons, as follows: Daniel, Hugh, Charles, Patrick, John, James F. and Michael S., to which said sons said premises descended and vested as tenants in common, in fee, subject to the dower right of their mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">4. In the month of December, 1888, Charles died intestate, seized of his undivided one seventh interest in said premises, leaving to survive him, his widow, Julia, and five children, as follows: Annie, Catherine, Charles, Henry and Frank; all of whom are minors, without guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">5. Ann, widow of Michael, the elder, continued to live in the corner house until her death, which took place on April 30, 1892, and Daniel has continued to live in the other house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">6. Daniel paid the rent on his house to his mother during her lifetime except for the last two months, when he was unable by reason of sickness to raise the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">7. The widow, Ann, at the time of her death owed five half-yearly instalments of ground rent amounting in all to $90.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">8. Suit was brought for the arrears of ground rent, judgment obtained and execution issued, and on August 1, 1892, the premises in question were sold by the sheriff to Jamos F. Mc-Graniglian and Michael McGranighan, the younger, for the sum of $600, and on September 19, 1892, the said sheriff delivered his deed to said vendees, subject to the ground rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">9. On the same day, September 19, 1892, the owners of the ground rent by deed granted and extinguished the same to the said James and Michael in consideration of $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-11\">10. On the same day, September 19, 1892, the said James and Michael mortgaged the said premises for $1,600 to the St. Agatha\u2019s Building and Loan Association, the mortgage money, as recited in said indenture of mortgage, being advanced to pay the consideration to the sheriff for said premises and the consideration for the extinguishment of the ground rent. In point of fact only $1,200 were applied for these purposes, $195 were used to pay doctor\u2019s bill and funeral expenses of the mother, and $205 appear to be unaccounted for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-12\">11. The said James and Michael, claiming the ownership in fee of said premises, instituted proceedings before a magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>against Daniel under the act of June 16, 1836, which proceedings have been removed to this court, being the same proceedings which the bill seeks to enjoin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\">12. The said James F. and Michael S. have collected and are collecting rent for the corner house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">13. The premises in question have a value of $400 and upwards above the amount of the aforesaid mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">The vital question in the case is whether James and Michael acquired the ownership in fee. If they did, the proceedings sought to be enjoined are entirely correct and the bill must be dismissed. If they did not, they hold merely as trustees for all concerned, and partition should be ordered and an account stated. The law of Pennsylvania was clearly laid down by Mr. Chief Justice Lewis, in Weaver v. Wible, 25 Pa. 270: \u201c Where several persons have a joint or common interest in an estate, it is not to be tolerated that one shall purchase an incumbrance or an outstanding title, and set it up against the rest, for the purpose of depriving them of their interests. ... All that can be demanded is contribution from each to the expense of any purchase which releases the common interest from embarrassment.\u201d This principle was restated by the Supreme Court in the late case of Powell v. Lant-zy, 173 Pa. 543.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">The defendants deny the plaintiff\u2019s right because they say that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">1. The sheriff\u2019s bill for sale was put up on the house in which Daniel lived, and he was going in and out and must have seen it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">2. Before the sheriff\u2019s sale John (one of the defendants), said to Daniel and Hugh: \u201c Before I will see it go to sheriff\u2019s sale, I will put up my share with any one of you.\u201d Hugh says : \u201c I don\u2019t want to have a damned thing to do with it; I don\u2019t want a dollar out of it; I have my own house and a building association, and' it is as much as I can attend to.\u201d Michael said to Dan: \u201c There is a lot of bills against it.\u201d He says : \u201c Well, 1 have no money to straighten them.\u201d Michael says: \u201cWell, somebody will have to straighten them, a stranger will own it; now I am in a building association, before a stranger will own it, I will bid on it, but if you don\u2019t wish that, why here is my book, give me what money\u00bb I have paid on my book, you go down and I would as lieve you would own it.\u201d He says: \u201cNo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>I am very glad, Mike, that you are able to buy it. I would not like to see it go out of the name. I would like to see you have it and I am glad to see that you are able to buy it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">3. Everybody knew of the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">4. Michael paid $50.00 at sheriff\u2019s sale, $25.00 his own and $25.00 his brother James\u2019s. They borrowed $1,600 on their shares from the building association, which was applied as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">Purchase money ....... $600.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">Principal of ground rent..... 600.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">Dr. Whiteside\u2019s bill for the mother . . . 85.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">Funeral and tombstone for the mother . . 110.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">$1,395.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-11\">What became of the other $205 did not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-12\">These points made by Michael were substantially reiterated by James, his narrative, however, varying somewhat in the details.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-13\">The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony on the other hand differed materially on some of these matters. 1. Daniel admits that he knew of the sheriff\u2019s bill, but says that he was confined to his bed. 2. Daniel describes the interview before the sheriff\u2019s sale as follows : \u201c Hugh asked them (the defendants) to put it in the hands of a trust company, or to the orphans\u2019 court; that he was willing to pay his share of what would be against it, and of course I acquiesced in what he said, in everything he said, right by his shoulder, and he said: \u2018 If there is a dollar coming to us, we want it, and if there is $10.00 in debt we offer to pay it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-14\">Daniel denied that any amount of money necessary to be raised was named; he denied that the brother offered his building association book, or that it was declined, or that he said that he would have nothing to do with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-15\">Assuming for argument\u2019s sake that the defendants\u2019 statements on these controverted points are exactly correct, it is difficult to see how they help the defendants\u2019 cause. The plaintiffs were not men of much education or knowledge of business affairs. Daniel is a gardener and Hugh was a fireman, who since the filing of the bill died in the performance of his duty. They were not men of means, but plain laboring men with families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to support. They had no money to pay the arrears of rent and other liens, and they had not sufficient business knowledge to know how to save their imperiled interests without a considerable outlay. The third party plaintiffs were the widow and five minor children, of a deceased brother, very poor, and of course, ignorant of business affairs. What did these cotenants defendants do under the circumstances? According to their own account they utterly ignored the widow and minor children, and put prominently before the other two plaintiffs the necessity of raising what was to them a considerable amount of money, and all their statements rested on the assumption that some one with money would have to take up the matter, and that the interests of those without money were doomed to be sacrificed. If in so acting they dealt in good faith and honestly gave their cotenants the best thought they had on the subject a question of some difficulty might be presented. We have, however, been unable to avoid the conclusion that at the time when the defendants puzzled two of the plaintiffs with the apparently insoluble difficulties of the situation, they had in their minds a method whereby all rights could have been saved with very little trouble, the method, which in point of fact, they promptly adopted. To us it seems that their bearing towards all the plaintiffs was, to use the language of Chancellor Kent in the somewhat analogous case of Van Horne v. Fonda, 5 Johns. Ch. 888, \u201crepugnant to a sense of refined and accurate justice, .... immoral because it would be against the reciprocal obligation to do nothing to the prejudice of each other\u2019s equal claim, which the relationship of the parties, as' joint devisees created. . . . The parties had equal concern which created a mutual obligation, to deal candidly and benevolently with each other, and to cause no harm to their joint interest.\u201d The plaintiffs are therefore entitled to the relief prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">And now, January 2, 1897, the prothonotary will notify the parties or their counsel of the filing of this report and opinion, and if no \u2022 exceptions are filed thereto within twenty days a decree will be entered according to the foregoing opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The following decree was subsequently entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">And now, February 24,1897, no exceptions having been filed to the findings of fact and law in this case within twenty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>from the filing thereof, in accordance with the report and opinion, and on motion of David H. Stone, Esq., solicitor for plaintiffs, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendants, James F. McGranighan and Michael S. McGranighan, hold the title to the premises described in said bill, acquired by them by purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale thereof on August 1,1892, as trustees for all the parties plaintiff and defendant, as of the shares and interests therein as the same were held by them or the persons through whom they claim immediately prior to said sheriff\u2019s sale, subject as respects the said James F. McGranighan and Michael S. McGranighan to the payment of a certain mortgage debt of $1,600 secured upon said premises by indenture of mortgage given by said defendants to the St. Agatha\u2019s Building and Loan Association, dated September 21, 1892, recorded at Philadelphia, in mortgage book T. G., No. 211, page 275, etc., and as respects the shares and interests of the other parties to $1,200 of said mortgage debt. And it is further ordered and decreed that an injunction issue to the said defendants, James F. McGranighan and Michael S. McGranighan, perpetually restraining them from further maintaining their action against plaintiff, Daniel McGranighan, for the recovery of said premises as of the term and number of this bill, and from commencing and maintaining any other action for the recovery of possession thereof in their own right based upon their said purchases at said sheriff\u2019s sale. And it is further adjudged and decreed that the said James F. McGranighan and Michael S. McGranighan account to the said plaintiffs, for the rents received by them for said premises or any part thereof. And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that partition or division of said premises be had and made among all of said parties according to the acts of assembly and the course and practice in equity, and the shares of said parties set out to them in severalty; and Walter George Smith, Esq., is hereby appointed master to state said account and to make said partition, and in case the said premises cannot be divided or parted among said parties without injury to or spoiling the whole, to value the same or convenient purports thereof, and to report his doings to this court for confirmation and further order.
