At the same time it is submitted that, as councils may change their intentions before this (paper) vacation is made absolute, by actual closing of the street to public use, the parties owning the property have no remedy for the damages sustained, and no action can be commenced against the city until after the street is actually closed. Parties seeking equity must do equity, hence this great injustice should not be forced upon the appellants, especially at the instance of such a small holding, \u2014 the complainants having less than a quarter interest in the property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-5\"><em>J. .Henry </em>McIntyre, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACU\">-The case was set down and disposed of on the bill and answers. In such cases the rule is that all material and relevant averments of fact contained in and proper for answer, must be accepted as true, whether the same be responsive to the bill or independent matters of defense; but of course, inferences either of law or fact, drawn by defendants from their own averments are not within the rule. Such inferences are solely for the court: Mazet v. City, 187 Pa. 548.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aph\">April 4, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-6\">Pee Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We find no error in the decree from which this appeal was taken.
