Co., by William Albert Johnson and wife to Jacob Boon on July 9,1889. In the second paragraph a statement of the purchase money mortgage of 1117,000 was made. In the third paragraph it was alleged that Jacob Boon and wife had conveyed the premises subject to said mortgage and certain trusts to the Beal Estate, Title Insurance and Trust Company of Philadelphia. In the fourth paragraph it was alleged that the trust company had executed a declaration of trust in which it was declared that the \u201c title to the said tract of land vested in the said company shall be held by them so far as concerns the said Jacob Boon and all other persons until otherwise conveyed as personalty and not realty\u201d to convey as Frederick B. Vogel, attorney for Lansdowne Heights, shall direct, and divide the net profits between Vogel and Boon. In the fifth paragraph it was alleged that the tract had been laid out in lots, a plan recorded, entitled \u201c Plan of Lansdowne Heights, No. 2,\u201d upon which lots are laid out and numbered from 950 to 1720.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">The facts appear by the opinion of the court below, Clayton, P. J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">The facts stated in paragraphs 1, 2, 8, 4 and 5 of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill are found to be true as therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">Sales were made from time to time of lots mentioned in said plan by Frederick B. Vogel, who signed himself as attorney for the Lansdowne Estate. The firm called the Lansdowne Estate consisted of Jacob Boon and the said F. B. Vogel, who were the only persons interested in said firm. The profits were to be equally divided between said Boon and Vogel. The said William A. Johnson had no beneficial interest in said firm or the lands conveyed to Boon, except as mortgagee. Vogel had the entire management of said land and acted only for himself, and as attorney in fact for Boon, the legal owner, subject to the mortgage to Johnson. By a written agreement signed by Johnson, dated June 11, 1889, two days after the date of the deeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>from Johnson to Boon, Johnson agreed to release from the lien of said mortgage debt all lots as laid out and sold, upon receiving the full consideration money obtained for said lots, said consideration to be not less than $2,500 per acre for lots on Darby road and Owens avenue, and $1,750 per acre for the balance, or at that rate. The said Vogel, acting for himself and Boon, proceeded to sell lots and received the consideration, under an agreement in writing, of which exhibit \u201cA,\u201d hereto annexed, is a copy. Under this agreement the plaintiffs in this bill purchased the several lots mentioned in the said bill of complaint. Johnson was not a party to, or known to any of the plaintiffs when said lots were bought. His name was not mentioned in any way when the agreement to purchase said lots was signed or afterwards.

Power, entered into an agreement with Frederick B. Vog\u00e9l as attorney for the Lansdowne estate, similar in form to exhibit \u201c A,\u201d for the purchase of lots Nos. 1641 and 1642, for . . $815</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">Of this he claims to have p dd . . . . 820</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">Johnson has been paid upon the said mortgage debt the sum of $51,569.50, and has released lots (valued at the sale price) to the amount of $48,569.50. The mortgagor being in default, the mortgage has been foreclosed, and after the sale of the balance of the land exclusive of the lots mentioned in this bill, there is still due to Johnson the sum of $55,679.89.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">The sheriff\u2019s sale was on February 29, 1896. The only connection the Rea] Estate Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co. have with the case will sufficiently appear by a declaration of trust, a copy of which is hereto annexed, marked exhibit \u201cB.\u201d This declaration of trust recognizes the said Vogel as the attorney in fact for Boon. Vogel at once commenced the sale of said lots under the form of an agreement, of which exhibit \u201c A \u201d is a copy. Johnson carried out his agreement and released all lots sold by Vogel for which he was paid the full sale price, and for quite a large number he released without receiving the sale price. The releases he signed without receiving the price were signed wholly upon the request of Vogel, and on his personal promise to pay over the said price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Payments on the mortgage being in default, Johnson threatened a foreclosure, whereupon an agreement was made, dated December 5, 1892, of which the paper annexed marked exhibit \u201c C \u201d is a copy. Johnson carried out his part of this last agreement. Vogel becoming again in default, Johnson proceeded to foreclose his mortgage. None of the plaintiffs had any knowledge or notice of the agreement of December 5,1892, nor of any agreement for the release of the lots they were buying other than the record notice of the first agreement. No tender had been made of any amount admitted to be due. While Johnson does not recognize the right of the complainants to demand a release from him, he has expressed his willingness to execute such releases upon being paid the full amount of each purchase, less what he has received from Vogel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">The above are all the material facts in the case. But two questions are raised: First, have the plaintiffs a legal or equitable right to require Johnson to execute releases for the lots so purchased by them without paying him the full consideration money, less what he has already received from Vogel ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">Second. Are the plaintiffs entitled to credit on the purchase money of their lots, for the money paid by them to and embezzled by Vogel?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">It may be admitted that the plaintiffs have an equitable right to have credit for all the money they have paid Vogel and which he has paid over to J ohnson. This, as I understand Mr. Johnson, he has always been willing to do. This is all, therefore, that need be said upon the first question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">The second question is the important one and its answer must depend entirely upon the written evidence, as there is no parol testimony upon the subject. Unless, therefore, the agreement of December 5, 1892, standing alone, can be construed as creating an agency, in which Johnson is the principal and Vogel his agent to receive the purchase money from the purchasers of such lots as Vogel should thereafter sell, or had theretofore sold, the plaintiffs must fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">We are of opinion that no sufficient evidence has been produced to warrant the court in finding that Vogel was the agent of Johnson for any purpose. There is no privity, either contract or estate, sufficient to raise such a presumption. We are also of opinion in the present condition of the case that Johnson cannot enforce any of the contracts made by Vogel or compel any of the plaintiffs to pay the balance admitted by them to be due to Vogel and Boon on account of their purchase of said lots. It will, therefore, be useless for the court to make a decree which it cannot enforce. The plaintiffs are before the \u2022court as terre-tenants and not as contracting parties. If we were to require J ohnson to execute the releases demanded on receiving the balances admitted to be due him, we could not make a binding decree that would require the complainants to pay said balances unless we find Vogel to be Johnson\u2019s agent. As we find no such agency, it follows that Johnson cannot recover the balances unpaid on a contract made with Vogel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">The complainants can demand releases upon tendering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>balance actually due, but, if we were to require Johnson to execute such releases, the complainants could decline to tender him the money. The contest is therefore not equal. They must be bound by our decree if he is. In the present condition of the real estate market, those who have made but small payments would not show great wisdom in tendering Johnson the balance of their purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">If, however, the complainants or any of them will pay into court within ten days from the filing of this decree the full amount of their purchases, less what Vogel has actually paid over under the agreement of December 5, 1892, with interest thereon from the time the whole balance was due, then we will order and decree that Johnson shall execute the releases prayed for, and we will permit him to take out the money, and we will make an order on the trust company to execute the deed. On failure to pay said money into court within the time above limited, let the bill be dismissed with costs. In any event the costs are ordered to be paid by the complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">exhibit \u201cA.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-7\">\u201c This agreement, made the 21st day of June, Anno Domini, 1890, between Frederick B.
