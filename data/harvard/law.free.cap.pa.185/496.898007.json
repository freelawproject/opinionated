There was evidence that the defendants used in' their laundry oxalic and sulphuric acids and chloride of lime. Plaintiff claimed that about three months after her first employment, she was set at work over a hot mangle; that she temporarily returned to plain ironing; that she was subsequently put to work again on the mangle, and that while she was at work at the mangle, her eyes became affected by fumes from the acids and chloride of lime, and that in consequence she subsequently lost her sight. There was no evidence that the defendants knew that the acids complained of would produce the disease from which the plaintiff suffered, or that it was not customary to use acids in laundries in the same manner and proportions as they were used in defendants\u2019 laundry. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-12\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-13\"><em>J.

The case was therefore destitute of the evidence necessary to establish the charge of negligence without which there could be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
