The case most nearly resembling it is Bird v. Hunsdon, 2 Swanston\u2019s Ch. Rep. 342.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-8\">It should not be and never is presumed that a testator intended to die intestate as to any part of the estate, if a contrary intention can be fairly deduced from the language of his will: Reimer\u2019s Est., 159 Pa. 212; Westcott v. Cady, 5 Johns. Ch. 348; Parsons v. Winslow, 6 Mass. 180; Stroud v. Bailey, 3 Grant, 310; McIlvaine v. Gethen, 3 Wharton, 575; Bondbright\u2019s App., 9 W. N. C. 475; Rishton v.

E. </em>Meyers, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3B\">The following cases clearly show the distinction between a bequest on condition and a conditional limitation: Hotz\u2019s Est., 38 Pa. 422; Bennett v. Robinson, 10 Watts, 348; Stahl\u2019s App., 2 Pa. 301; Middleton v. Rice, 6 P. L. J. 229.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">When Elizabeth Hamlin married, the bequest to her being a conditional limitation, she had no longer any interest in the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-11\">A bequest during celibacy is good, for the purpose of intermediate maintenance, and will not be interpreted maliciously to a charge of restraining marriage. This is not a subtlety of our law only, the civil law makes the same distinction. And no gift over is required to make a restriction in this form effectual: 2 Jarman on Wills (5th ed.), 566; Heath v. Lewis, 3 DeGex, M. &amp; G. 953; Webb v. Grace, 2 Phillips, 701; Hoopes v. Dundas, 10 Pa. 77; Rishton v. Cobb, 5 Mylne &amp; Craig, *145.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-12\">Testator no doubt thought he was doing a great kindness to Elizabeth Hamlin by giving her the annual interest of $5,000, which would be $300 annually during the limited period fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and clearly expressed, and that Elizabeth Hamlin would feel the same way, and with the fond belief that she would remain single and hear her name, the word \u201c death \u201d alone was inadvertently used instead of the words \u201c death or marriage.\u201d That in the same breath having in his mind that the gift should end when she ceased \u201c to be single and not bearing the name of Elizabeth Hamlin,\u201d he should have intended that it should not cease until her death, is so repugnant to every rule of commonsense that the solution of it is, that he used only the words \u201c after her death,\u201d and inadvertently or by mistake omitted the words \u201c or marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-4\">It is an established rule that words in a will may be supplied in order to effectuate the testator\u2019s intention as collected from the context: 1 Redfield on Wills, 454; McKeehan, etc., v. Wilson, 53 Pa. 74; Roper on Legacies, 1439; Simpson v. Smith, 1 Sneed (Tenn), 394; Kilpatrick v. Kilpatrick, 13 Ves. 476; Graham v. Graham, 5 P. L. J. 77; Purnell v.

Shuler, 2 Paige, Chan. 122.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">The general intention of the testator in his will must govern. Where the general intention is clear, it must prevail over some particular or special intention. Where it' is clear that the testator did not express his intention, the court will supply the proper words to carry the intention into effect: Redfern v. Redfern, Law Rep\u2019s. 6 Ch. Div. 136; Leach v. Micklen, 6 East, 486.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AYE\">March 21, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-6\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">It is perfectly clear, and is established by numerous authorities, that the bequest in favor of Elizabeth Hamlin was not upon a condition in restraint of marriage. She was to enjoy the income of $5,000 so long as she remained single and bore the name of Elizabeth Hamlin. When she ceased to be single and to bear the name of Elizabeth Hamlin her right to the income was simply ended. The words of the bequest were merely a limitation of the time of enjoyment. Hotz\u2019s Est., 38 Pa. 422, is precisely in point and rules this question. Many other cases cited in the appellee\u2019s argument are in the same line. The other question as to the vesting of the principal is equally free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>from doubt. The \u201ccemetery fund \u201d was well defined in the will and there was no uncertainty as to its import. By the express terms of the codicil that fund was to be increased by the principal fund of 65,000 after the death of Elizabeth Hamlin. There was no other use to which this sum was to be put in any event. The use of the income of this identical fund having terminated by the marriage of Elizabeth Hamlin, and the only limitation over being to the cemetery fund, there is no other right 'either to the income or the principal than the right of the cemetery fund. It is clear the appellant cannot have the income, but the income is a certain incident of the principal, and necessarily goes with it. There is no possible reason for delaying the vesting of the principal in possession at the moment the right of the donee of the income ceases. It is somewhat like the line of cases in which where there is a gift of the income to one and no gift over of the principal, we hold that the legatee of the income takes also the principal. A bequest of the interest of a fund without limitation is a bequest of the fund itself: Garret v. Rex, 6 W. 14; Campbell v. Gilbert, 6 Whart. 72; Van Rensselaer v. Dunkin, 24 Pa. 252; Insurance Co.\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 312; Millard\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 457. Here there is a limitation over of the principal of the fund, there is no person to take the income after the marriage of the legatee of the income, the succeeding income is a necessary incident to the principal and lienee passes with the principal, and there being no object to subserve by postponing the reception of the principal it becomes due at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Where a trust is unnecessary to protect any interest in re mainder, the estate is executed by the statute in the remainder-man : Bradley\u2019s Appeal, 36 Leg. Int. 38; McAleer\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa\". 139. The latter case in its facts is quite analogous to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
