Before Wiltbank, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-11\">At the trial it appeared that in 1878, a grade of plaintiff\u2019s property was established by a confirmed plan. Nothing was ever done, however, either by the city or by the plaintiff, in accordance with this plan. By an ordinance of November 2, 1885, the grade was changed from that established in 1878, and in 1889 Forty-fifth street was opened in accordance with the grade of November 2, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-12\">When William II. Jones, a witness for plaintiff, was on the stand, he testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Mr. Clark, of counsel, for plaintiff: \u201c Q. Did you ever make an estimate oE the amount of filling required upon those properties to bring them to the grade regulations of 1878 established by the city? A. I did. Q. Are those your figures?\u201d The purpose being to put plainly upon the record again the offer that the amount of filling necessary to bring plaintiff\u2019s properties to the grade regulations in force on November 1, 1885, is a material and relevant matter, and one which I am entitled to have before the jury. I repeat that offer, adding that this offer is made not as an independent item of damage, but as it influences value.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">Objected to by Mr. Miller. Objection sustained. Exception noted for plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">George <em>W. </em>Hancock, a witness for plaintiff, was questioned by the court: \u201cQ. But you are quite uncertain to what height it was to be filled, and it is only after the passage of the ordinance of 1888 that you find the height established according to the lines of <em>1885; </em>now, how can you estimate a value in view of that uncertainty? A. There was a grade established as early- Q. You must not talk about that grade of 1878 ; tliat is not in the case. I am putting the question as to the uncertainty which you have just spoken of. You have said that after this grade was adopted practically, and the work was done, you had facts. So you had. You had the facts, you had an established grade according to the lines on the plan of 1885. Before that, you had not facts. Now, before you had facts, how could you estimate the value of that land? \u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-9\">The witness was asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel: \u201c Q. I understand that there could have been a more favorable grade for the development of the plaintiff\u2019s property than the grade of November 2, 1885?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-10\">Objected to. Objection sustained. Exception noted for plaintiff. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-11\">Defendant\u2019s points and the answers thereto among others were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-12\">1, The jury have nothing to do with any plan earlier than the plan of 1885. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-13\">2. The jury have nothing to do with the question whether the city might have fixed a more favorable grade for Mi\u2019. Clark than it has fixed. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>3. No suit can be brought for damages because of the change of a street height on the city plan. The damage is not done until the work is performed. The question then is whether the property is worth more or less after the street is constructed to the new grade than it was under the conditions immediately preceding the construction. [6] <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.
