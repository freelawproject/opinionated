Before Biddle, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>At tlie trial, it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s husband, Albert M. Wood, together with Charles E. Cochran, was engaged on J une 18, 1896, in conducting a photograph gallery in Washington park in the city of Philadelphia. The park and gallery were lighted with electricity by the defendant. The rear portion of the gallery was covered with glass, and, to prevent the glass from being broken, the owners had placed a wire screen over it, so arranged that it was about two inches from defendant\u2019s wires. The screen became charged with electricity from one of the defendant\u2019s electric light wires, which had lost a portion of its insulating material. While plaintiff\u2019s husband was sitting in the gallery, a visitor to the park had come in contact with the screen and received a shock which resulted in his death. The deceased, upon hearing the commotion caused by this occurrence, went out of the gallery and learned from some of the persons present that the screen had become charged with electricity, and that this had caused the accident. The deceased then voluntarily touched the screen to demonstrate to the crowd that it was not charged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-4\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>E.

R. R., 141 Pa. 604; R. R. v. Robinson, 44 Pa. 175.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-7\"><em>Joseph T. </em>Bunting, with him <em>William G.

On the contrary, it clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>appears that his death was the result of his own voluntary, deliberate act in touching the screen heavily charged with electricity, in the face of ample notice that it was so charged. His evident purpose, in thus touching the screen, was to demonstrate that those who asserted it was thus charged were mistaken. Further reference to the evidence is unnecessary. It was clearly insufficient to carry the case to the jury, and hence, there was no error in refusing to take off the judgment of non-suit entered by the learned president of the court below at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
