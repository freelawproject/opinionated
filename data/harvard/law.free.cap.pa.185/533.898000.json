Before Finletter, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-10\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s husband, Richard J. Bruns, died on August 15, 1896, at a hospital. The evidence showed that on August 9, 1896, plaintiff\u2019s bead was slightly bruised and bis eye blacked wlfile riding as a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s cars. He walked home, complained of feeling tired, felt worse the next day; the day after be was feverish, witb pain in His head; to tliese were added, the next day, restlessness, swelling in the tliroat and wandering of the mind, and he died on the sixth day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-11\">At tbe time of the accident be was suffering from blood poisoning, complicated witli Bright\u2019s disease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-12\">On August 14, 1896, tbe day before lie died, the deceased and bis wife executed a release of damages for tbe consideration of $40.00. The evidence tended to show that tbe deceased signed tbe release after bargaining with tbe defendant\u2019s agent, and tliat be was mentally competent at tlie time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-13\">Under objection and exception tbe court overruled plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>offer to prove by the attending physician that on the day before the release was signed, the deceased was not mentally competent to transact any business. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\">The court charged as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">[It is not worth while arguing this case, for I direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, for two reasons. First of all, the evidence does not show that this man\u2019s death was necessarily the result of the accident. I do not recollect that any evidence has been given to show that fact; in other words, to connect the accident and the death. But independently of that, the defendant has produced a release regularly signed by the deceased before his death, and the evidence is not sufficient for me to permit the question of his mental capacity to go to the jury, and I therefore direct the jury to render a verdict for the defendant.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.
