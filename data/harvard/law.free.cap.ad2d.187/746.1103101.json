We disagree. Defendant was permitted to plead guilty to the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in full satisfaction of a two-count indictment. The sentence he received was within the statutory guidelines and consistent with the plea-bargain agreement. Given these circumstances, and considering the seriousness of the crime of which defendant was convicted, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court <em>(see, People v Maye, </em>143 AD2d 483, <em>lv denied </em>73 NY2d 788).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Mikoll, J. P., Yesawich Jr., Mercure, Crew III and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
