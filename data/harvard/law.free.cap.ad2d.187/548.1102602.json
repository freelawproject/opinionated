His claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is similarly without merit <em>(see, People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 146).</p><p id=\"b586-9\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in his supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Thompson, J. P., Bracken, Pizzuto and Santucci, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
