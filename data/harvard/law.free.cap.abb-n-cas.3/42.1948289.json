The complaint was fatally defective in that it did not <em>aver </em>that the certificates of the architect had been obtained. The provision for obtaining <em>them </em>was a <em>condition precedent </em>to the right of recovery by plaintiff, and defendants\u2019 right to exact the certificates was <em>several </em>as to each. Such averment was therefore essential, unless the production of the certificates was shown to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>waived, </em>or some <em>excuse pleaded </em>(Barton <em>v. </em>Hermann, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>379; Morgan <em>v. </em>Birnie, 9 <em>Bing. </em>672; Milner <em>v. </em>Field, 5 <em>Exch. </em>829; Clarke <em>v. </em>Watson, 18 <em>Com. Bench (N. S.) </em>278; Smith <em>v. </em>Briggs, 3 <em>Den. </em>73; Martin <em>v. </em>Leggett, 4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>255; Smith <em>v. </em>Brady, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>173; Stewart <em>v. </em>Keteltas, 36 <em>Id. </em>388; Batterbury <em>v. </em>Vyse, 2 <em>Hurls. &amp; C. </em>42; Thomas <em>v. </em>Fleury, 26 <em>N. Y. </em>26; Bloodgood <em>v. </em>Ingoldsby, 1 <em>Hilt. </em>388; Butler <em>v. </em>Tucker, 24 <em>Wend. </em>447; Adams <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c. of N. Y., 4 <em>Duer, </em>309; U. S. <em>v. </em>Robeson, 9 <em>Peters, </em>319; Sharpe <em>v. </em>San Paulo Railway Co., 6 <em>Moak's Eng. Rep. </em>528; Baron de Worms <em>v. </em>Mellier, <em>Id. </em>871).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-5\">II. No <em>waiver </em>was pleaded, nor anything that could operate as a waiver. Compliance with one covenant was no waiver of another ; there was nothing to show that the $6,000 was paid with or without the certificates of the architect, or that a portion of it was not paid for the extra work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-6\">III. No excuse for non-performance existed in the complaint. The allegation that the architect-\u201cunreasonably\u201d or \u201cwrongfully\u201d neglected to give the certificate was not enough (Worsley <em>v. </em>Wood, 6 <em>T. R. </em>710); but \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201ccollusion with the defendants,\u201d \u201cbad faith,\u201d or an \u201cinjunction of a competent court,\u201d had been held to be a sufficient excuse (Cases cited above; and Bowery Nat. Bank <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c. of N. Y., 63 <em>N. Y. </em>336; Jones <em>v. </em>Judd, 4 <em>Comst. </em>411).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-7\">IV. Admission by the demurrer, of facts alleged in the complaint, was qualified; and was only an admission on the argument. It admitted the facts if well pleaded, but it admitted no mere statement of a conclusion of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-8\">V. The complaint was radically defective in that it failed to express the necessary elements of a contract. The drawings and specifications, though assumed to be a part of the agreement, did not appear, and there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>no allegation that they were ever annexed (Cooney <em>v. </em>Winants, 19 <em>Wend. </em>504; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 162; Spear <em>v. </em>Downing, 34 <em>Barb. </em>522).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-5\">VI. The appeal was from the whole of the order in question, and broad enough, therefore, to reach the part relating to costs. The order should be so modified, in any event, as to give the usual costs \u201c on overruling a demurrer with leave to answer\u201d (Hoffman v. Barry, 2 <em>Hun, </em>52, and cases there cited; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 245, 349, 400; Bucking <em>v. </em>Hauselt, 9 Hun, 633; Nellis <em>v. </em>De Forrest, 6 <em>How. Pr. </em>413; Hendricks <em>v. </em>Bouck, 4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>461).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-6\"><em>Nathaniel A. Prentice (Chambers, Pomeroy &amp; Boughton, </em>attorneys), for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWl\">I. The allegations of the complaint were sufficient under section 162 of the Code. It was sufficient if the plaintiff alleged a due performance of all the conditions performed, and a valid excuse for non-performance of such as had been omitted. The unreasonable refusal of the architect (which was admitted by the demurrer) was a sufficient excuse for not obtaining his certificate (Hosley <em>v. </em>Black, 28 <em>N. Y. </em>438; Bowery Nat. Bank v. Mayor, &amp;c. of N. Y., 63 <em>Id. </em>336; Barton <em>v. </em>Hermann, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>381; Clarke <em>v. </em>Crandall, 27 <em>Barb. </em>76).</summary>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-7\">II. The demurrer admitted the truth of all the allegations of the complaint..</p>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-8\">III. The demurrer, by admitting \u201cdue performance\u201d of all conditions, except obtaining the certificate, admitted that the work was performed in a good, workmanlike manner, to the satisfaction of the architect. The. certificates were only one means of proving a performance, which might be proved <em>aliunde </em>when the certificate is unreasonably withheld (Thomas <em>v. </em>Fleury, 26 <em>N. Y. </em>33, 34).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-9\">IV. That portion of the complaint demurred to stated a cause of action plainly and concisely, as required by section 142 of the Code.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Robinson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgG\">In contracts for the performance of work under the supervision of an architect, which, to entitle the contractor to payment for work\" done, not only require its completion according to the terms of the contract, but also its approval by, and a certificate of, the architect to that effect, the performance of the work and the production of the certificate are both prerequisites to any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">A formal approval and acceptance of the architect \u201c would not relieve the plaintiffs from their agreement to perform the work according to the plans and specifications\u201d (Glacius <em>v. </em>Black, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>150).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">While the architect\u2019s certificate is thus made essential and is otherwise indispensable to any right of recovery, its non-production may be excused when withheld by <em>fraud </em>or collusion, or <em>in bad faith </em>(Thomas <em>v. </em>Fleury, 26 <em>N. Y. </em>26; Barton <em>v. </em>Hermann, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>378).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The requirement of such certificate being for the benefit and protection of the employer, he may by some definitive or expressive act, waive the necessity for its production. A mere allegation of his <em>acceptance </em>of the work done has no legal significance. Everything done in the progress of the work contracted for, if known to or recognized by the employer, is to be deemed accepted in part performance; and notwithstanding any such allegation as is made in the 'present case, \u201cthat the defendants duly accepted the work performed by plaintiff under and by virtue of said agreement,\u201d the complaint presents no suggestion that the entire work as performed was accepted <em>as a full compliance with the requirements of the contract.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Without this, no waiver of an architect\u2019s certificate of complete compliance (so far as it gave assurance of the fact) could be deemed to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">This action was brought to recover a part ($550) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>the last and final payment of $2,550, which was to be made when the whole work was \u201ccompleted and accepted,\u201d and it is true such completion and acceptance is alleged in these precise and general terms, but as to-the certificate of the architect as to this final payment that the work had been so completed <em>11 in a </em>good, workmanlike, <em>and substantial </em>manner, <em>to his satisfaction and under his </em>direction,\u201d as required by the-contract, none such is alleged to have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The certificate of the architect being indispensable-to any recovery (so far as material), unless withheld for <em>fraud or collusion </em>or <em>in bad </em>faith, the allegation that it was so withheld \u201cunreasonably,\u201d has never been accepted as a justification for its non-production. Every principle upon which the architect\u2019s determination and adjudication in this respect is-deemed operative under the contract, rejects any such <em>\u201cunreasonable </em>\u201d action as without the consideration of the parties, or the obligations of their contract. The architect, so far as it commits any matter to his judgment, is accepted as an <em>umpire </em>between them (Smith <em>v. </em>Briggs, 3 <em>Den. </em>73; Butler <em>v. </em>Tucker, 24 <em>Wend. </em>449; Wyckoff <em>v. </em>Meyers, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>145), and his mere refusal, when his impartial judgment dictates it, confers upon the contractor no right of recovery, even if, by other witnesses, he should be able to maintain that he had substantially performed the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The best judgment of the architect upon the matter so committed to his determination has been agreed upon as the test of the performance ; and neither party can reject or repudiate his certificate given .on the one side or his refusal to give it on the other, upon mere allegations or testimony tending to show that his action had been \u201cunreasonable.\u201d His entire refusal to act would throw upon the courts the duty of acting in his stead; but.until divested of the power as conferred upon him by the parties, by death, incapacity, resig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>nation or <em>estoppel to </em>act, the parties have agreed to accept either his certificate or Ms refusal to certify to the-work done by the contractor as a final judgment between them. Under these considerations the complaint was defective in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><em>First. </em>The mere allegation of complete performance of the work did not confer any right of action for want of the architect\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Second. </em>This was not supplied by the averment that the architect had <em>\u201cunreasonably\" </em>refused such certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\"><em>Third. </em>The mere allegation that the defendants had duly accepted the work performed by plaintiff under and by virtue of said agreement added nothing in extenuation or avoidance of the necessity of such certificate, without further allegation that such work, was so accepted, not only in compliance with the contract, but <em>was also received as a full performance </em>\"Glacius <em>v. </em>Black, 50 <em>N. Y. </em>153).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The acceptance by the architect of any substitute-for that which the contract called for, if substantially variant from its terms, could not be justified (except through authority of the employer), nor can the acceptance by the employer of inferior or different work, than such as was contracted for be deemed or accredited as part or entire performance, except upon some new consideration, operating between the parties; any agreement to accept any such imperfect or incomplete work with deductions for defects agreed upon, would; be binding (Glacius <em>v. </em>Black, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">But without it, the idea that the mere declarations, of an intention or purpose to waive any right to damages already accrued is wholly unavailable as a defense thereto or as against the assertion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Under these circumstances it follows that the complaint was defective in the foregoing particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">The order overruling the demurrer should therefore.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>be reversed and judgment given for the defendants, unless the plaintiff within twenty days from the service of a copy order to be entered herein, amend his complaint and pay the costs of the trial on the demurrer and of this appeal (to be taken by the clerk), and for failure to so amend and pay such costs that defendants have judgment final.</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">C.
