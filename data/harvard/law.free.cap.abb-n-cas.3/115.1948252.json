Cram, Marine Court, Specia ; Term, November, 1877, is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">McAdam, J.\u2014The plaintiff procured an order for the examination of the defendant, as an adverse party before trial. A copy of the order and of the affidavit upon which it was granted, was served upon the attorney of the defendant, pursuant to section 875 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">The defendant has not been personally served with the order, and does not appear for examination, and the question presented, therefore, is whether service upon the attorney alone furnishes the court with authority to compel the defendant\u2019s attendance by attachment or to punish him for his non-attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The provisions of law relating to the examination of an adverse party before trial will be found in sections 870 to 876 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Section 870 authorizes the deposition of a party to an action to betaken at the instance of an adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Section 871 authorizes the deposition of a person not a party to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Section 872 provides what the affidavit to obtain such depositions shall contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Section 878 provides for the order of examination, and directs what it shall contain. \u201cThe order must require <em>the party or person to he examined </em>to appear before the judge, or before a referee, to be named in the order, for the purpose of taking, the examination, at a time and place therein specified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The order must also direct the time of service of a copy thereof.'</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">Section 874 provides that \u201c <em>If the party or person so served </em>fails to obey the order <em>his </em>attendance may be compelled, and <em>he may he punished </em>in like manner, <em>and the proceedings thereon are the same </em>as if he failed to obey a subpoena, issued from the court in which the action is pending, or if no action is pending from the court of which the judge is a member.\u201d This section requires us to ascertain the mannei of compelling a witness to attend for examination, and the proceedings to punish him for non-attendance, because the adverse party served with the order for examination is to be compelled to appear, and is to be punished for non-appearance in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The manner of compelling attendance by subpoena, is by exhibiting the original to the witness, by delivering a copy or ticket containing the substance, and by paying him the legal fees <em>(Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 852), and a person so subpoenaed, who unreasonably refuses to obey such subpoena, or an order duly served upon him, is liable in damages, and may be punished for contempt, <em>and if he is a party to the </em>action, <em>the cowrt may, as an additional punishment, strike out his pleading (Id. </em>\u00a7 853), and sections 855 to 863 contain the provisions authorizing the arrest of the witness, his committal where he refuses to be examined, and the proceedings thereupon, all of which, by section 874, <em>supra, </em>are made applicable to the proceedings for the examination of an adverse party, before referred to, and it is under these sections (852 to 863) that the power of punishing by fine, imprisonment, or striking out the pleading of the party, is furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Section 875 next provides that a copy of the order, and of the affidavit upon which it was granted, must be served upon the attorney for each party to the action, in like manner as a paper in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The N. T. superior court (Pake v. Proal, 2 <em>Abb. New Cas. </em>418) decided that under this section (875) the service of a copy of the order and of the affidavit upon which it was granted, upon the attorney of the party whose examination was sought for, was sufficient, without service upon the party himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel insists that this construction of the statute is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The high authority of the learned court which made the decision cited, requires that in declaring the practice of this court in the premises, I should either follow the precedent referred to, or furnish what I consider legal reasons for not following it. These reasons are that all the various sections of the act before referred to, .being in <em>pari </em>materia, must be construed together, particularly as they relate to one general scheme (see King v. Leighton, 58 <em>N. Y. </em>at p. 386 ; Thaule <em>v. </em>Ritter, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>439 ; Ansonia Brass and Copper Co. <em>v. </em>The N. Y. Chimney Co., 53 <em>N. Y. </em>123), and that section 875 cannot be isolated from the rest and construed standing alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Judge Folger, in delivering the opinion of the court of appeals in the case last cited (in speaking of an isolated section of another act), said, \u201c This section may not stand alone. It is to be read and applied in connection with every other section of the act. All must have their due and conjoint effect; each must be so far qualified and limited by the other, as that all may have operation in harmony, if so it may be, and each must be kept in subserviency to the general intent of the whole enactment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">The defendant may be out of the United States, having no knowledge whatever of the order for his examination, for aught that appears, and yet, if the construction \"contended for be correct, and I have jurisdiction to do any act in the premises, I have the power to strike out his pleading and to punish him for contempt of court. No such construction can prevail. The service upon the attorney alone is incomplete. Attorney and client must both be served. The order will, therefore, be discharged, but, under the circumstances, without costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b148-11\">Lawrence, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">The examination must proceed. Section 873 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>opinion, renders it obligatory upon the justice to whom the affidavit is presented to grant the order, provided the facts required by section 872 be stated ;and appear in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The defendant having appeared in the action, the service on the attorney was sufficient <em>[Code, </em>section 875, and my memorandum in the case of Thompson v. Sickles, November, 1877.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">There was no appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\"> The decision in the case of Thompson \u00ab. Sickles, here referred to, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">Lawrence, J.\u2014A more critical examination of the provisions of section 875 of the Code of Civ. Procedure than I was able to make when these papers were first laid before me satisfies me that my first impression was erroneous, and the defendant\u2019s attorney is right in contending that service can properly be made upon the attorney for the plaintiff. That section provides, in substance, that where the party sought to be examined has appeared in the action, a copy of the order and of the affidavit on which it is granted must be \u2022served upon his attorney, but if he has not appeared, they must be served upon the party (See also Mr. Throop\u2019s note to section).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">Order granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
