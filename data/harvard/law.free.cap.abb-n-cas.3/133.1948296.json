A mere allegation in an answer that a party to an action is not the real party in interest, is bad upon demurrer (Bentley <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>204, 205; Russell <em>v. </em>Clapp, 3 <em>Code R. </em>65; Thomas <em>v. </em>Desmond, 12 <em>How. Pr. </em>321; Brown <em>v. </em>Ryckman, <em>Id. </em>314 ; Seeley <em>v. </em>Engell, 17 <em>Barb. </em>537; Jackson <em>v. </em>Whedon, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>142 ; Savage <em>v. </em>Corn Exchange, &amp;c. Co., 4 <em>Bosw. </em>15 ; <em>Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 499 ; <em>Code of Pro. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 147, 148; Burnside <em>v. </em>Matthews, 54 <em>N. Y. </em>78, 82; Wright <em>v. </em>Wright, <em>Id. </em>437, 441).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-13\">II. \u201cThe defense that the plaintiff is not the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>party in interest is <em>new matter. </em>A general avernment to that effect, however, is not enough ; the facts must be stated which constitute the defense, and which <em>show </em>that he is not the party in interest. \u2019 \u2019 And plaintiff may demur <em>(Pomeroy's Remedies and Remedial Rights, </em>p. 733, \u00a7 711, and cases cited ; 24 <em>Ind. </em>318; 11 <em>Id. </em>369 ; 10 <em>Id. </em>205 ; 6 <em>Id. </em>309 ; <em>Code of Civ. Pro. </em>\u00a7 494).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">III. Such a defense is not frivolous, and the remedy is not by motion. It is a material allegation, and if not. properly pleaded in the complaint the remedy is by demurrer (Tamisier <em>v. </em>Cassard, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>187).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>John Cummins, </em>opposed.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAf\">I. If the clause of .the-answer demurred to is too defective to constitute any part of a defense, it should be stricken out on motion <em>(Bliss' </em>Code, p. 341; Townsend <em>v. </em>Norris, 2 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>433; Smith <em>v. </em>Greenin, 2 <em>Sandf. </em>702; Ketcham <em>v. </em>Zerega, <em>1 E. D. Smith, </em>553 ; Thomas <em>v. </em>Harrop, 7 <em>How. Pr. </em>57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">II. If it does not consist of new matter it cannot be-demurred to. The clause or part of answer here demurred to is more in the nature of a negative to plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">III. The answer is not frivolous (Tamisier <em>v. </em>Cassard, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>187).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b162-9\">Barrett, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX3\">I. The answer is demurrable. It attempts to set up new matter; that is, matter which could not be proved under a denial nor unless set up (Jackson <em>v. </em>Whedon, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>142; Savage <em>v. </em>Corn Ex. Fire Ins. Co., 4 <em>Bosw. </em>bottom of p. 15, and top of p. 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">II. And it is bad on demurrer, for the reason that no fact is stated\u2014nothing but a conclusion of law. The action must of course be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, but whether it is so prosecuted depends upon the facts (Russell <em>v. </em>Clapp, 3 <em>Code R. </em>65; Bentley <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>204 ; Brown <em>v. </em>Ryckman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>12 <em>How. Pr. </em>314; Witherspoon <em>v. </em>Van Dolar, 15 <em>How. Pr. </em>266). There may be a question when <em>ownership </em>in another is pleaded (see Holstein <em>v. </em>Rice, 15 <em>How. Pr. 1 </em>and note), enough certainly to put the plaintiff to his demurrer; which is all that was held in Tamisier <em>v. </em>Cassard, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>187. None, however, where the averment is limited to the phraseology of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer with costs, and with the usual leave to the defendant to amend his answer within twenty days, upon payment of such coste.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
