The defendants interposed statutory demurrers, raising two questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-21\">(a) Do the statutes of the United States authorize a qui tarn action to recover against one who has defrauded the United States by making a false income tax return; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-22\">(b) Under the statutes of the United States is it necessary to obtain the permission of the Commissioner of Internal Eevenue before commencing a qui tarn action of the character indicated?</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-23\">The District Court, finding against the plaintiff and against the United States, entered judgments for the defendants. These appeals followed. Por a statement of the cases, citation of statutes, and a full discussion of the law we refer to the opinion of the learned trial judge. 4 P. Supp. 947. As his opinion contains complete and correct answers to the questions involved, we adopt it as our own and accordingly affirm the judgments from which these appeals were taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
