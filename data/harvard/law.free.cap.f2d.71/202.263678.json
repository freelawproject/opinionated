Others numbered 1, 2, 8, 9, and 11 were rejected by the Examiner of the United States Patent Office whose decision was affirmed by the Board of Appeals. Following the Board\u2019s decision, appellant sought and obtained permission to amend, for purposes of appeal, by substituting for the disallowed claims two others, numbered respectively 12 and 13, which the board held to be directed to the same subject-matter as those first rejected. Upon the formal rejection of these two latter claims by the Board, the instant appeal to this court was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-25\">All the disallowed claims \u2014 both the old and the new \u2014 seem to be technically embraced in the appeal. We assume that this course was followed as a matter of precaution. At the hearing appellant formally requested dismissal of the original disallowed claims and the consideration of those substituted as described. Since the latter received consideration by the Patent Office in due and proper statutory form, they are properly before us, and the motion of appellant is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-26\">The claims in dispute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-27\">\u201c12. A sound-wave detecting instrument having, in combination, a device comprising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a membrane that is capable of vibrating in a sound field and the weight and the dimension of which are such that the membrane shall follow faithfully, during its vibrations in the said field, the Instantaneous sound variations of the said field without substantial alteration of the said variations from what the said variations would have been in the absence of the said device, and means controlled by the vibrations of the membrane for detecting the vibrations of the membrane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201c13. A sound-wave detecting instrument having, in combination, a device comprising a membrane that is capable of vibrating in a sound field and the weight and the dimension of which are such that the membrane shall follow faithfully, during its vibrations in the said field, the instantaneous sound variations of the said field without substantial alteration of the said variations from what the said variations would have been in the absence of the said device, means for projecting energy rays in a direction at an angle to the vibratory path of the membrane, whereby the energy rays will ho intercepted variably in accordance with the position of the membrane in its vibratory path, and means controlled by the position of the membrane in its vibratory path for detecting the vibrations of the membrane.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The Examiner cited the following five references: Thomson-Houston Co. (Br.), 241153 of 1925; Graham et al. (Br.), 271125 of 1927: Telefunken Ges. (Ger.), 444673 of 1927; Snook, 1681376, August 21, 1928; DeForest, 1726289, August 27, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> The Board of Appeals referred specifically to only Graham et al. and DeForest, the subject-matter of claim 12 being rejected by it upon Graham et al., and the subject-matter of claim 13 upon Graham et al. taken in connection with DeForest. However, the other references were not overruled by the Board and so they remain as references which we may consider. In re Wagenhorst, 64 F.(2d) 780, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">It is proper to say that the allowed claims comprise a group embracing a limitation to the use of an occulting vane, and it was solely on account of this limitation that they were allowed. Appellant, therefore, insists that he is not broadly protected as to the device which he claims to have invented, and such protection is sought in the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The Graham et al. patent (British) relates to telephone receivers. It includes a \u201cmovable sound producing electrode in the form of a membrane or diaphragm\u201d (described in the specification as \u201cexceedingly light in character\u201d), arranged for free vibration between two fixed electrodes which \u201cmay he formed as metal gauze screens.\u201d In one of the drawings of this patent a movable electrode is shown connected at its circumference to the central portion of a flexibly suspended ring \u201cwhich may be made of great or small width and of metal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The DeForest patent is entitled \u201cDiffraction Microphone,\u201d and is stated to relate \u201cbroadly to microphone construction whereby sound waves are converted into eleetrieal current variations.\u201d One of the figures of its drawings, disclosed a diaphragm, the vibrations of which, the Solicitor for the Patent Office avers, may be detected by its variation in the light received upon a photo electric cell from a lamp. Appellant questions the correctness of the construction of this feature of the DeForest patent by the Patent Office tribunals, and this matter will receive later attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">This patent was apparently cited only as a reference with respect to appellant\u2019s projection of \u201cenergy rays\u201d as described in claim 13, supra, or, to use the designation of his brief, \u201cappellant\u2019s specific recording mechanism.\u201d The DeForest patent is conceded'by appellant to be in the \u201csound-detecting\u201d field.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">The other references have to do with the utilization of variations in an energy beam to detect the motion of a diaphragm and require no detailed analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">Appellant lays greatest stress, particularly in his supplemental brief, filed by permission of the court after the oral argument, upon claim 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">He insists that the device of Graham et al. is what is commonly referred to as a \u201cloud-speaker\u201d; that it is not a sound detecting, or sound measuring device, hut a sound reproducing device, whose function and purpose is entirely different from the function and purpose of his own device.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">In oral argument before this court appellant\u2019s counsel used the \u201cflared horn\u201d element of a loud speaker, modeled upon one of the figures of the Graham et al. drawings, and sought to illustrate to the court how appellant\u2019s device would operate to measure or detect the sound reproduced by the Graham et al. device, in the sound field lying within the circumference of the flared horn.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">We are quite convinced that Graham et al. and appellant have different general purposes in view, but the question is whether appellant has, by Ms claims as drawn, sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>eeeded in so defining his structure, as a structure (both claims being apparatus claims), that the Graham et aL patent does not in terms anticipate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The critical feature of appellant\u2019s device, it seems to us, lies in the delicate membrane which he uses. The particular one displayed during argument of the case was less than an inch in diameter and so thin as to be scarcely visible except when brought relatively near the observer. It was, of course, explained that different sound fields would require different sizes of membranes, but, as we understand it, in the practical use of the instrument, whatever may be the diameter of the membrane, assuming it to be circular in shape, or whatever its dimensions if otherwise shaped, it must always be exceedingly thin, and of a lightness which renders its weight negligible as compared with anything to which weight is customarily ascribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In certain of the original disallowed claims the membrane was referred to as being \u201csubstantially weightless,\u201d and the specification so describes it, explaining the necessity for lightness by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201cIndeed, if the membrane could be made ideally weightless, it would move exactly in unison with the surrounding air, and would exactly follow the vibrations of the air particles during the transmission of a eompressional wave. Its own identity would then be lost in the operation, and it would introduce no discontinuity in the path of the compressional wave. This ideal arrangement can be approached, in practice, by making the membrane sufficiently weight-less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The principal opinions of the tribunals of the Patent Office were written upon the claims as originally phrased, and evidently it was not thought by them that the phrase \u201csubstantially weightless\u201d distinguished appellant\u2019s membrane from the \u201cexceedingly light\u201d membrane of Graham et al., and we are finable to hold that their conclusions in that-respect are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Furthermore, we are unable to find in the language of. the claims as now phrased any clarity or definiteness of description respecting the membrane which renders it possible to distinguish over Graham et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">It is argued that the language is clear to tho.se skilled in the art. This may be true, but we have also to consider whether it is clear enough to distinguish from the prior art. We are unable to find that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">There remains to be considered the limitation in claim 13, respecting the so-called \u201crecording mechanism\u201d of which the DeForest patent was held anticipatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">We have carefully considered appellant\u2019s arguments to the effect that the Board of Appeals misunderstood or misconstrued the DeForest disclosure. This is a matter upon which we hesitate to place our judgment against that of the experts of the Patent Office, but, assuming, without holding, that, in some particulars, there may have been error in the conclusion as to operation of the DeForest device, we are unable to discern wherein there was error in the specific application made of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">The appeal as to claims numbered 1, 2, 8, 9, and 11 is dismissed, and the decision of the Board of Appeals as to claims numbered 12 and 13 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge, did not participate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
