To distinguish between the drafts drawn by the Richfield Oil Company on the Wells Fargo Bank, payable to themselves, which were to be accepted by the bank, and the foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>drafts drawn on the customers of the Rich-field Oil Company, we will refer to the latter as foreign hills of exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Before this case was tried in the lower court, the hills of exchange had been paid to the bank, and the court, in lieu of the relief originally prayed for, gave judgment for the amount of $163,305.85. At the time the receiver was appointed for the Richfield Oil Company on January 15, 1931, the latter owed $625,000 to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The ultimate question involved in this ease is whether or not the appellant bank is entitled to apply the proceeds of the foreign hills of exchange upon the general indebtedness above mentioned. The legal questions involved in the exercise of that right of set-off are based upon transactions beginning October 6, 1930', between the Richfield Oil Company and the appellant hank, whereby a new line of credit, based upon its foreign commerce, was extended to the Richfield Oil Company to the aggregate amount of $155,-000. There is the further question of a subsequent waiver of the right of set-off. Much of the confusion in the caso has arisen from the introduction of evidence of the negotiations between the parties beginning in August, 1930', leading up to the acceptance agreement of October 8, 1930, and of the numerous transactions which occurred thereafter. The contract between the parties was, in the main, in writing. Each party relies more strongly on parol testimony than is justified under the law concerning the effect of written contracts. The bank takes the broad: view that the evidence, oral and documentary, shows that the agreement between the parties was one for a revolving credit, first for $150,000, and, subsequently, for $155,-000, and that all hills of exchange deposited with them in connection with the foreign business of the Richfield Oil Company were deposited under this agreement. The appellee correctly contends that the written agreements must be construed according to their terms and that these terms are conclusive as to the agreement between the parties, but that the references therein to drafts and other documents may ho explained by parol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Appellee\u2019s further contention that there was an oral agreement which excluded the foreign hills of exchange involved in this action from the effect of the written agreements cannot be sustained. Before stating the contra\u00e9is and evidence in relation thereto, it should he observed that the- rules with reference to the use of parol evidence in construing a written agreement between the parties are succinctly stated in the Codes of California, and in the decisions of its courts, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">\u201cThe execution of a contract in writing, whether the law requires it to bo written or not, supersedes all the negotiations or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied the execution of the instrument.\u201d Section 1625, Civ. Code Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">\u201cA contract in writing takes effect upon its delivery to the party in whose favor it is made, or to his agent.\u201d Section 1626, Civ. Code Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">\u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to bo ascertained from the writing alone, if possible; subject, however, to- the other provisions of this title.\u201d Section 1639, Civ. Code Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">\u201cSeveral contracts relating to the same matters, between the same parties, and made as parts of substantially one transaction, are to he taken together.\u201d Section 1642-, Civ. Code Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">\u201cWhen the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the parties, it is to he considered as containing all those terms, and therefore there can be between the parties and their representatives, or successors in interest, no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing, except in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">\u201c1. Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-15\">\u201c2. Where the validity of the agreemeni is the fact in dispute. But this section does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which it relates, as defined in section eighteen hundred and sixty, or to explain an extrinsic ambiguity, or to establish illegality or fraud. The term agreement includes deeds and wills, as well as contracts between parties.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. Cal., \u00a7 1856.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Parol evidence can be introduced to identify the subject-matter of the contract, but not to contradict its terms. Gardiner v. McDonogh, 147 Cal. 3-13-, 81 P. 964. There may be a valid, oral collateral agreement, if it does not conflict with or alter the terms of the written agreement. Whittier v.

This acceptance ajp-eement was accompanied by fourteen drafts dated October 6, 1939, aggating $150,990 drawn by Richfield Oil Company upon the Wells Fargo Bank m fa-, v0.r Ourselves, for wluch a written receipt was given by the bank. This, it will be obserTCd&gt; was a written proposal to make a ^ontract. Ob October 8, 1939, he delivered to the bank tw0 letters \u00b0lf transmission dated October 7, 1930, and the documents therein described. The first letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFa\">\u201cOctober 7 1939. \u00abWells F Bank and Union Tr\u00bfst Com_ Market at Montgomery gan pvancisc0, California,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGy\">\u00abSubject: Drafts #193004 and #193005. \u00abBirIa Brothers, Ltd., M/S 'Silver Hazel\u2019,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">\u00abGentlemen: We are enclosing the foljowjng enumerated documents covering shipment going forward to Calcutta, India per the M/S 'Silver Hazel\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>\u00ab1 \u2014 Our Draft #103004 amounting to $63,950.00 drawn at sight on Birla Brothers, Ltd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\"><em>\u201c2 </em>\u2014 Our Draft #103005 amounting to $63,950.00 drawn at 180 days sight on Birla Brothers, Ltd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201c3 \u2014 Our Invoice #930112 in the amount of $127,900.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201c4 \u2014 Insurance Policy in triplicate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201c5 \u2014 Three originals Bill of Lading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201cProvided these documents are found to he in order, please forward them to your correspondent bank at Calcutta, requesting them to notify you immediately by wire of non-acceptance or non-payment of draft at maturity. Tlianking yon, we remain, Yours very truly, Richfield Oil Company of California, B. D. Blanchard, Assistant Manager, Foreign Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The second letter of transmission covered a similar shipment to Birla Bros, on the \u201cSilver Ray\u201d with two bills of exchange for $55,-900.76 each, one payable at sight and the other 180 days after sight. Another letter dated October 8, 1930, by the comptroller of the Richfield Oil Company to the assistant vice president of the appellate hank, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">\u201cWe are sending by Mr. Hall, documents covering a shipment to Birla Brothers, Ltd., Calcutta, India.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">\u201cWill you please release against this shipment $115,000 worth of acceptances made payable at 90 days sight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">The most important question in the ease is whether or not these two 180-day foreign bills of exchange, aggregating $119,850.75, on Birla Bros., Calcutta, handed to the bank on October 8,1930, were covered by the terms of the acceptance agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">It is agreed that the acceptance agreement, although in writing, does not of itself sufficiently identify the documents or security which was the subject-matter of the contract between the parties without the consideration of parol testimony. The drafts referred to in the acceptance agreement as handed to the bank for acceptance are described therein merely by their date, October 6th, and the fact that they are payable in San Francisco to the order of \u201cOurselves,\u201d which implies that the drafts are drawn by the Richfield Oil Company, payable to themselves. They a.re also indicated by the amount of $150,000. They were, however, described in the receipt signed by the bank. The parol evidence shows that the total number of drafts presented on October 6, 1930, by the Richfield Oil Company for acceptance by the bank, all dated October 6, 1930, payable to themselves, aggregated $150,000, but on October 8th the amount of .drafts to be accepted was limited to $115,000 by the terms of the letter of October 7, 1930, which constituted an amended offer. The transaction thus consummated on October 8, 1930, by this delivery of the letters dated October 7th, and of the documents therein described, and by the acceptance of nine of the drafts for which a receipt had been issued on October 6th, definitely identifying the drafts aggregating $150,000 which were handed to the bank for acceptance, and the nine drafts aggregating $115,000 which were accepted by the bank. The security given to the bank for such acceptance is not indicated by the written acceptance agreement alone other than by the words \u201cmerchandise,\u201d and \u201cgoods.\u201d But the delivery of the bills of lading clearly identifies such goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">It is clear also from the acceptance agreement that the goods in question were to he exported and that the ownership thereof was to be indicated by bills of lading. This acceptance agreement was upon a form used by the bank and most of the provisions therein were no doubt printed. As indicated in the letters of transmission from the Richfield Oil Company to the bank dated October 7, 1930, the goods referred to were in transit to Calcutta, India, upon the \u201cSilver Hazel\u201d and the \u201cSilver Ray,\u201d and consisted of kerosene and fuel oil which was specifically described in the bill of lading. A consideration of the writings exchanged without the aid of any oral evidence other than the fact of delivery of such documents shows that the security of the bank for its liability under its acceptance of the drafts presented to it was to be merchandise in transit on board the \u201cSilver Hazel\u201d and \u201cSilver Ray\u201d which was described in the acceptance agreement as \u201cmerchandise\u201d and also as \u201cgoods,\u201d and that in order to effect the pledge of this cargo the Richfield Oil Company transferred its bills of lading therefor, properly assigned, to the bank, together with foreign bills of exchange drawn upon the purchaser of the goods represented by the bills of lading which would enable the bank to realize upon the value thereof by receiving from the purchaser the price thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">It is clear that during the voyage, by reason of the possession of the bills of lading, and under the terms of the acceptance agreement, tlie bank was secured by the entire value of the cargo. The transaction between the parties was evidenced with clarity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>definiteness by <em>the </em>written acceptance agreement, by tbe written documents accompanying tbe agreement, by tbe written acceptance endorsed by the bank, and by the letters exchanged and by the credit realized to the Richfield Oil Company upon nine drafts presented to the bank for acceptance and needed no additional parol evidence to identify the subject-matter of the contract and establish its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The appellee contends \u201c * * * that the agreement related to drafts and nothing else. * a' * Only short-term drafts were being deposited as security under the acceptance, the balance being sent to the bank for collection alone. * * * As these securities were not described or specified in the <em>agreement, </em>recourse was had to parol evidence from which it was clearly shown that certain drafts only were deposited under the agreement as security for the acceptances to 'be issued. * * * Recourse to the evidence, however, shows that only the so-called short term drafts were understood and deemed to be under the acceptances, and that the proceeds of the drafts here involved represent moneys received by appellant upon drafts left with it solely for collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">It is further contended by appellee that the agreement with reference to the long term bills of exchange was that they were to be kept separate from the other accounts of the Richfield Oil Company and that by this agreement to keep the accounts separately the bank waived its banker\u2019s lien upon the proceeds thereof. If the written acceptance agreement was an agreement to pledge to the bank the goods in transit to India, as we hold, and if the foreign bills of exchange which were delivered to the bank were intended as a means of acquiring possession of the proceeds derived from the sale of the .goods and substituting those proceeds for the goods themselves, then it is clear that the transaction is a unit and that a separate oral agreement with relation to the 18(Lday bills of exchange which excepted them from the provisions of the agreement and which relieved the proceeds from the lien declared in the agreement in favor of the bank, is inconsistent with the written agreement and cannot be considered in the face of that written agreement. The net result of the claim of the appellee is that the proceeds of the two 18(hday bills of exchange were not to be subject to a banker\u2019s lien, whereas the written agreement expressly provided that the proceeds of the property pledged, that is, of the goods pledged, should be applied to any other indebtedness due from the Richfield Oil <em>Company to </em>the bank, past, present, or future. This is clearly in conflict with an oral agreement, express or implied, that the proceeds of the two 180-day bills of exchange should not be subject to any lien on behalf of the bank for past, present, or future indebtedness. Moreover, we have examined the oral evidence concerning the arrangements between the parties, and find nothing therein justifying the conclusion that the bank intended to waive its banker\u2019s lien upon the foreign bills of exchange deposited with it by the Richfield Oil Company, as we will now point out in connection with the two other bills of exchange involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">A $1,245.11 bill of exchange drawn upon Ricardo Yalezquez, dated December 30. 1930, was deposited with the appellee bank December 27, 1930, and paid to the bank by the drawee of the bill on May 18', 1931. \u00c1 bill of exchange drawn on Birla Bros., limited, of Calcutta, India, for $23,532.08, dated January 31, 1931, was deposited with the appellant bank January 8, 1931, and paid September 10, 1931. Papers deposited with the bank in connection with these drafts were identical in form and legal effect with those deposited in connection with the original acceptance agreement except that there was no acceptance agreement deposited therewith. In order to understand the situation in that regard it will be necessary to state some of the dealings of the parties between the. date of the original acceptance agreement and the deposit on January 8, 1931, of the last of the two bills of exchange involved herein. On October 13-, 1930, the oil company claimed a \u201cdraft reserve\u201d of $9,734.16 and requested the issuance of an acceptance of one of its drafts for $5,000 deposited on October 8th and retained by the bank, being a part of the $35,000' against which no acceptances had been made. The bank replied that it had executed the acceptance for $5,000 at 90- days sight maturing January 31, 1931, and had credited the proceeds to their account, and added, \u201cYou mention that you have a draft reserve with us for $9,734.16. This figure covers the amount of your drafts Nos. 103009 and 103012 [deposited October 91 and October 12, 1930' for $4883.40] and the balance remaining on your Nos. 103006 A and 103004 [$119,850.76, minus $115,000 drafts accepted $4850.76], but evidently does not take into consideration your draft No. 103110' drawn on La Paz, Bolivia, for $11,031.14 [deposited October 10, 1930].\u201d On October 20, 1930, after a talk with Mr. Gilstrap in which Mr. Lyons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>comptroller of the Richfield Oil Company, was told that the above-mentioned draft for $31,031.41 could be used \u201cas reserve against acceptances,\u201d it was requested that the bank issue an acceptance for $10,000 to mature in 90 days. The bank replied that they accordingly had executed the 90-day acceptances for $10,000 and \u201ccredited your account with the proceeds, $8,925.00,\u201d and that \u201cwe have earmarked the same against the $11,-031.34 hill of exchange above mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">On November 24, 1930, the Richfield Oil Company requested the issuance of $25,000 in acceptances, making $155,000 in all, and inclosed a draft for $5,000 in addition to the $20,000 unaccepted drafts held by the bank as a part of the original $150,000\u2019 deposit. On November 28, 1930, the hank informed the Richfield Oil Company that it had complied with its request and had executed $25,-000- in acceptances and had credited the proceeds derived from the sale thereof to the account of the oil company in the amount of $24,812.50. After the acceptance of drafts in the amount of $25,000 on November 28, 1930, the bank requested an additional acceptance agreement to cover the additional $5,000 of acceptances which it had executed on November 28th. This acceptance agreement was signed December 2d and sent to the bank December 3, 1930, to be dated by the bank and was dated November 25, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The acceptances of the bank up to January 8th amounting to $155,000 had been issued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">$115,000 on October 8, due January 6, 1931</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">5,000 on October 13, due January 33, 193 L</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">10.000 on October 20', 1930, due January 19, 1931</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">25.000 on November 25, 1930, due February 26, 1931.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Against these acceptances the bank advised the Richfield Oil Company that it had collected $119,626.05 December lOtb, and $10,991.07 December 31st. No other drafts were accepted by the bank in connection with tlie deposit of. foreign bills of exchange with it by the Richfield Oil Company. In view of the fact that the bank upon the extension of additional credit of $25,000\u2019 by way of an acceptance on November 25, 1930, making the total acceptance $155,000, required an additional acceptance agreement for $5,000\u2019, we do not see upon what basis it can be' claimed that other foreign bills of exchange afterward deposited without any such additional acceptance agreement came within the terms of the acceptance, agreements already executed. If other acceptances had been executed by the bank, the correspondence with relation thereto would no doubt indicate the basis upon which they were made. We think the position of the appellee is correct, that those two foreign bills of exchange (for $23,532.08, and for $1,245.11, respectively) did not come under the acceptance agreement whieh expressly provided for the equivalent of a banker\u2019s lien thereon. That being true the question is whether or not the banker\u2019s lien given by law upon such bills of exchange as were deposited with the hank was waived by the hank at the time the bills wen deposited. The appellee contends that thr, agreement of the bank as testified to by Hall and Pope to keep the account of ihe foreign business separate was in effect a waiver of the banker\u2019s lien. This arrangement was made according to the testimony of Hall and Pope as a matter of convenience because of Hall\u2019s agreement with the Richfield Oil Company concerning commissions. Nothing was said at the time of the agreement to keep the accounts separate about the banker\u2019s lien, and as we have already pointed out, the express written agreement was that the proceeds of the bills of exchange deposited under the acceptance agreement should be available to apply to any indebtedness due from the Richfield Oil Company to the bank. This arrangement instead of being a waiver of the banker\u2019s lien was an assertion of a lien as to all collections covered by the acceptance agreement. In the general agreement or arrangement testified to by Hall to keep the foreign accounts separate from the other account of the Richfield Oil Company, there was no distinction suggested between the bills of exchange whieh matured in less than 90 days and those which matured in more than 90 days, although he testified that the former were and that the latter were not to be used as a basis for acceptances after the expiration of 90 days. According to Ilall the agreement was that the foreign exchange business should bo kept separate, not that there should be two separate accounts in the foreign exchange department, one on a short term and the other on long term bills of exchange. The two types of bills of exchange were separated in their dealings solely because of the refusal of the bank to issue acceptances upon bills of exchange which were not payable within ninety days. There was no contract, express or implied, to treat the two types of bills of exchange differently with relation to the banker\u2019s lien unless it can bo said that the express assertion of the lien as to the hills of exchange included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the acceptance agreement was an implied waiver of the lien as to those not included. But sueh an express agreement was necessary for under the law of California where specific property is pledged for a specific obligation to a bank, the bank has no general banker\u2019s lien upon the proceeds of the pledged property. Consequently, and in order to assert such a lien, it is neeessary to stipulate in the contract by which the property was hypothecated that the proceeds of that property should be available for application to other obligations owed to the bank, if sueh Hght was agreed to by the parties. Arnold v. San Ramon Valley Bank, 184 Cal. 632,194 P. 1012, 13 A. L. R. 320; Bell v. Bank of Cal., 153 Cal. 234, 94 P. 889; Berry v. Bank of Bakersfield, 177 Cal. 206, 170 P. 415; Continental Nat\u2019l Bk. v. Moore, 299 F. 270 (C. C. A. 9). The mere separation of the deposit accounts in a bank as a matter of convenience would not operate as a waiver of the banker\u2019s lien, particularly where there was no agreement or understanding as to the disposition of the account.

A.) 20 F.(2d) 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We conclude that under the written acceptance agreements the bank had a lien equivalent to a- banker\u2019s lien upon the foreign bills of exchange covering the cargo of the \u201cSilver Ray\u201d and \u201cSilver Hazel\u201d and that under the law of California the bank had a banker\u2019s lien upon the other two bills of exchange involved herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The next question arises because of the appellee\u2019s claim that the bank subsequently waived its lien, if any it had, by a transaction between the bank and the receiver which occurred immediately after his appointment, and after the bank had received the proceeds of the two Birla Bros, bills of exchange payable on sight, amounting toi $119',626.05, which were sufficient to discharge the obligations to the bank upon the -$115,000\u2019 drafts accepted October 8, 1930. This waiver is predicated upon certain telegraphic correspondence between the receiver and the bank. The receiver sent to the appellant the following telegram:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cLos Angeles, California. 12:30 P. Jan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">16th, 1931.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cJulian Eisenbach, San Francisco, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">\u201cAs receiver I am ordered by Federal Court to take over all assets including cash in banks stop while you have undoubtedly right of offset, sueh right if exercised will seriously cripple receivers operations. It is necessary therefore to request that all banks restore to receiver full cash balance. Please therefore transfer sueh funds to a new account on your books in my name as receiver evidence of my authority and signature cards will follow by mail. Local banks have indicated they will acquiesce in this program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUUm\">\u201cWm. C. McDuffie, Receiver of \u25a0Richfield Oil Co. of California.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">To which the appellant replied as follows r</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avm\">\u201cSan, Francisco, Calif., Jan. 16, 1931, 6 p. m. \u201cW. C. McDuffie, Receiver Richfield Oil Co. of California, Richfield Bldg., 555 South Flower St., Los Angeles, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">\u201cReplying telegram we are willing to restore into your name as receiver Riehfields balance in cheeking account provided we are notified by you that all companys banks have taken similar action. We are holding certain collections as security for acceptances. Please understand that we continue to reserve all our rights for bankers lien against these collections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-13\">\u201cJulian Eisenbach, Vice President Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Union Trust Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">This was followed by two letters which need not be quoted, and on January 22,1931, by the following telegrams from the receiver to the bank:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-15\">\u201cAll banks have now expressed their willingness to replace Richfield Oil Company\u2019s offset balances of January 15th to credit of receiver. Will therefore greatly appreciate your at once transferring sueh sums to my credit advising me the amount by wire collect. Wish express appreciation your cooperation as these funds will be of great assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">And the reply telegram of January 23, 1931, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-17\">\u201cAnswering wire have today placed to your credit Richfield Oil Companys offset balance of January fifteenth amount forty thousand eight hundred seventy four dollars seventy-seven cents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-18\">In considering these telegrams it will be noticed that what the receiver asked was that all banks restore to receiver full cash balances; that the appellant bank replied, \u201cWe are willing to restore into your name as receiver Riehfields balance in your cheeking account,\u201d and that upon being notified that the other banks were willing to replace the balances of January 15th which they had off<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>set, the appellant bank noti\u00f1ed the receiver that they had placed to the receiver\u2019s credit the offset balance of January 15th amounting to $10,874.77. From this portion of the correspondence it would seem to be perfectly plain and clear that the balance asked and agreed to he restored was a balance of $40,-874.77 in tbe checking account of the Rich-field Oil Company, but the appellee contends that there are other portions of these telegrams which indicate a promise on the part of the hank to waive its lien, if any it had, upon the four bills of exchange in controversy. Reference is made to the telegram of January 16tli where the receiver states that he is to take over all assets including cash in the banks. The argument is that in view of this statement it must be assumed that the words \u201cfull cash balance\u201d used later in the telegram refers to assets such as the foreign bills of exchange in its possession. This argument is predicated particularly upon the necessities of the receivership and the results sought to be accomplished by restoring cash balances so that the receiver could continue to conduct the business of tbe corporation. We cannot see how this statement by the receiver can be considered more than a statement showing that he had authority dealing with the bank. This statement was to be followed by a copy of tbe order appointing the receiver which would show that the bank had a right to transfer the assets to him as a representative of the Richfield Oil Company and of the court. If we consider the telegram by its four corners, it obviously refers to the restoration of the cheeking account in the bank so that the receiver would stand in the shoes of the Richfield Oil Company. The reply is, \u201cWe are willing to restore balance in checking account.\u201d This was an acceptance of the proposition subject to eonfinnatic|n by tbe other hanks. Appellee bases an extensive argument on the final sentence in the reply telegram of January 16th with reference to \u201ccertain collections.\u201d It would seem clear that this sentence was inserted in the telegram as a matter of precaution and to prevent uncertainty. If we assume that the bank had a banker\u2019s lien against any collections, it is clear that it intended to reserve its lien thereon and that the words \u201ccertain collections\u201d relate to those foreign bills of exchange which are hypothecated \u201cas security for acceptances.\u201d The argument of the appellee then is, first, that this sentence reserving a lien does not refer to the bills of exchange which had'been deposited for collection against*\u2019which no acceptances has been issued; and, second, inasmuch as the reference is merely to such bills of exchange as are held as security for acceptances, the reservation of the right to a banker\u2019s lien against such bills of exchange in effect waives the banker\u2019s lien upon all other hills of exchange held by the bank, but not held as security for acceptances because, it is claimed, an express reservation of lien upon certain property is a waiver of the lien against other property not mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In view of these claims we will consider first the relation of the parties to the two 180-day hills of exchange of the Birla Company after the payment of the bills of exchange which were applied to and which extinguished the obligation of the Richfield Oil Company upon the acceptances for the $115,-000. The acceptance agreement provides that in case of the sale or disposition of the property aforesaid the bank might apply the proceeds \u201cto the payment of all legal or other costs, ele., and may apply the residue of such proceeds to the payment of this or any existing liability of o-urselves to yon whether then payable or not, returning the overplus to us. * \u25a0* * \u201d If, as we hold, tlie 180-day bills of exchange were a part of the security given to the bank for the acceptances as a means of collecting the proceeds of the sale of the property by the Richfield Oil Company to the Birla Bros., it is clear that these bills of exchange, even after the payment of the $115,009 upon the bills payable at sight were still held as security for acceptances theretofore or thereafter to be executed. It is clear also that under the express terms of the acceptance agreement these bills of exchange were held as security for any other liability of the Richfield Oil Company to the bank, whether due or not. Consequently, when the bank, in its telegram of January 16th, reserved \u201call our rights for banker\u2019s lien against these collections,\u201d it expressly reserved its right to the proceeds derived from these particular bills of exchange. We have followed the argument of the appellee in regard to this last sentence in the bank\u2019s telegram of July 16th to show that there is nothing inconsistent in the two parts of tbe telegram. The situation with reference to the bills of exchange for $23,-532.08', drawn on Birla Bros., and the one for $1,245.11 drawn on Valezquez, is somewhat different. They were not held in a special sense \u201cas security for acceptances.\u201d No credit had been extended on account of them, but the bank had a lien thereon for all sums due it which would include, of course, sums due it upon unpaid acceptances. The amount unpaid on January 16, 1931, on ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ceptances was about $25,000. So, if we construe the bank\u2019s telegram of January 16 th with technical nicety, the bank expressly reserved its \u201cbanker\u2019s lien on these collections;\u201d The broader view is that they were not included in the checking account which the bank agreed to restore, and, consequently, it was unnecessary for the bank to express any reservation of its lien thereon. The matter was not under consideration. Furthermore, the agreement to keep the general account of the. Richfield Oil Company separate from its foreign business account precludes the idea that the telegrams exchanged on January 16th, or immediately thereafter, had any reference to the foreign account. We should add that the appellee further fortifies its contention concerning the meaning of this sentence in the telegram of January 16th by evid\u00e9nee as to the conduct of the bank and of the receiver thereafter with relation to funds derived from bills of exchange similarly placed. This evidence consists of the fact that the bank credited the checking account of the receiver with the proceeds of several bills of exchange which were afterward collected by it in connection with the foreign business amounting in all to $39,469.57, and that it filed a proof of claim with the receiver for the amount of the $625,006 note above mentioned in which claim it is stated that the bank held no lien or security therefor. Subsequently, the bank amended this claim to assert its contention that the amounts collected or to be collected upon the bills of exchange in question were security for and to be offset against the obligation of $625,000'. It is sufficient to say that where the agreement evidenced by the telegrams is clear and definite, the subsequent conduct of the parties inconsistent therewith does not alter the contract nor furnish the means for its interpretation. The fact is1 that the bank waived its lien upon $39,469.57. It is explained by the officer of the bank that at the time these amounts were credited to the cheeking account of the receiver it was believed by the bank that the Richfield Oil Company was solvent and would be able to pay the claims against it; but that by the time the Birla Bros.\u2019 bills of exchange were collected the officers of the bank had become satisfied that the company would not be able to do so. Whether this is a true explanation of the conduct of the bank is entirely immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The appellee also introduced evidence to show the subsequent conduct of the- other banks with relation to their waiver agreements. Their conduct was not brought home to the appellant and is of no significance whatever, and even if brought to the attention of the bank after the transaction was closed, would be without significance. There was no estoppel. The language used by the parties in the exchange of telegrams is plain and unambiguous, and cannot be enlarged by the subsequent conduct of the parties unless conduct itself constituted a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We have not undertaken in this opinion to set forth all the evidence pro and eon bearing upon the points in issue. The parties submitted to the court all the banking transactions between them in the foreign department and the evidence of the negotiations leading up to the agreement of October 8th, and all the documents and transactions subsequent thereto. The transcript contains 489 pages, and the briefs about 275 pages. Each party has advanced some testimony and some arguments that we have not discussed in this opinion. To follow the ramifications of this argument would extend this opinion beyond reasonable limits. Wo have pointed out what we consider to be the controlling evidence under the law. There is practically no dispute in the evidence except with relation to the conversation between Hall and Pope on behalf of the Rich-field Oil Company and of the officers of tho bank who participated in the same conversations. We have also refrained from discussing the probabilities with reference to the conduct and intent of the parties, not only because there are plausible arguments on each side\u2019of that question, but more particularly because of the fact that the agreement between the parties was definite and certain and in the main in writing, and, hence, the interpretation thereof is not substantially aided -by such considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
