There was no evidence that the representations made by the plaintiff were, false, or were the inducement to the defendant\u2019s entry into the contract. It appeared that the defendant became dissatisfied with his contract upon visiting the classes once, and thereupon ceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to have anything to do with the plaintiff, and stopped payment on the check. <em>Held </em>that as the defendant had failed to establish the essentials of his defense, a judgment in his favor was erroneous.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b385-6\">Argued May 4th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ams\">decided June 1st, 1921.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">Action to recover the amount of a check given by the defendant in consideration of his admission, and the admission of his minor 'daughter, to the plaintiff college and their enrollment as students therein, brought to and tried by the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County, <em>Markham, </em>Jfacts found and judgment rendered for the defendant, and appeal by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Aam\">\n<em>Error and new trial ordered.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-8\"><em>Morris Blumer, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-9\"><em>Herbert O.

All of the allegations of the complaint essential to the cause of action have either been found by the court or are fairly established in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">The contest was over the second defense of the answer, which alleged that Louis Blumer made certain representations to the defendant, that the defendant relied upon these representations and enrolled in the plaintiff college as a pupil, and gave to the plaintiff the check made payable to Dr. Louis Blumer, dean, and that these representations were false and made with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>intent to defraud the defendant. There was evidence from which the court might have found a part of these representations proven. But there was no evidence that the inducement to the defendant\u2019s entry into this contract, or the giving of this check, was his reliance upon the truth of these representations. The evidence proves that the defendant became dissatisfied with his contract with the plaintiff upon visiting the classes once, and thereupon ceased to have anything to do with the plaintiff, and stopped payment on the check. There was no evidence from which the falsity of these representations could have been found. Indeed, when the defendant was asked the question, \u201cDid you find any of them false? \u201d he answered, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t try them out.\u201d The defendant failed to establish the essentials of his defense of fraudulent representations. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Oviatt, </em>86 Conn. 63, 67, 84 Atl. 321; <em>Scholfield Gear &amp; Pulley Co. </em>v. <em>Scholfield, </em>71 Conn. 1, 19, 40 Atl. 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">There fe error and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
