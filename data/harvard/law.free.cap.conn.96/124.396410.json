Compensation was paid the deceased to the time of his death. His average weekly wage was $18.88.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-11\">He was nineteen years of age and unmarried. At the time of his injury he lived with his mother, in a household consisting of his mother, a brother James, who worked, a brother Stanley, attending school, and a maternal grandmother, an invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-12\">The income of the plaintiff, his mother, consisted of $26 per week, of which James contributed $11 and the deceased $15. Such sum was necessary for the reasonable support of the household. The plaintiff was partly dependent on the deceased. The said Francis Quilty received from the home that which cost an amount found to be $5.20 per week.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-13\">The plaintiff claimed, first, that the case was covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>by the law in force at the time of the death. This claim was overruled. Second, that as a partial dependent she should be awarded $9.44 per week, being half of the average weekly wage, and being a sum less than the average weekly contribution. This claim was overruled <em>pro forma.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">The commissioner awarded and adjudged, <em>proforma, </em>that the defendants pay the plaintiff, as compensation for the death of said Francis Quilty, $5.45 per week for the period beginning August 23d, 1920, and continuing for three hundred and twelve weeks, subject to any proper modification in case of the death of the plaintiff, and subject to such modification or adjustment, if necessary, as may be proper by virtue of any judgment-which may be rendered as a result of proceedings consequent upon this <em>pro forma </em>award; and further awarded and adjudged that the defendants pay forthwith $100 for burial expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">'. The commissioner found that the claim involves doubtful questions of law which the public interest requires should be finally and definitely decided, and these are stated seriatim in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>Cornelius J.

In the interval between his injury and his death, Chapter 142 of the Public Acts of 1919 came into effect? which Act, in \u00a7 6, materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>changed the law as to the method of determining the compensation of partial dependents from the'method in force at the time of the injury and found in \u00a7 5349 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The plaintiff urged that \u00a7 5349 relates to a matter of procedure and remedy and that it was at once superseded by the later Act. She also urged that as compensation to a dependent does not arise until the decease of the employee, the measure of the compensation should be determined by the law then in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">As we said, in effect, in <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 220, 96 Atl. 963, in dealing with a case of an employee, the right to compensation arises from the contractual relation between the employer and employee existing at the time of the injury, and the statute then in force in relation to compensation formed a part of the contract of employment, and determined the substantive rights and obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The obligations of the employer to dependents of an employee in case of the death of an injured employee are equally substantive obligations, and are also fixed and determined by the statute in force at the time of the injury. The Act of 1919 clearly does not relate to procedure merely, but affects substantive rights and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">General Statutes, \u00a7 5350, which provides that \u201cquestions of dependency shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury,\u201d supports the above ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The remaining question presented for decision is this: \u201cHow is the compensation reckoned in case of partial dependency under the statute in force before the amendment of the Compensation Act made in 1919?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">General Statutes, \u00a7 5350, provides that, in case compensation is to be paid to more than one partial dependent, \u201cthe compensation in case of death shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>be divided among them according to the relative degree of their dependence.\u201d When the total amount of compensation to be paid to partial dependents is fixed, the above provision determines its division among them. To determine this amount we turn to General Statutes, \u00a75349, which provides: \u201cCompensation shall be paid on account of death resulting from injuries within two years from date of injury as follows: (a) for burial expenses, one hundred dollars; (b) to those wholly dependent upon the deceased employee at the time of his injury, a weekly compensation equal to half of the average weekly earnings of the deceased at the time of his injury; (c) in case there is no one wholly dependent upon the deceased employee, to those partially dependent upon the deceased employee at the time of his injury, a weekly compensation not exceeding that payable to those wholly dependent and in such proportionate sum as may be determined according to the measure of dependence; but the compensation payable on account of death resulting from injuries shall in no case be more than fourteen dollars or less than five dollars weekly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The amount to be paid to partial dependents is the same, whether there is one or more partially dependent, and, if there are more than one partially dependent, \u00a7 5350 provides for the method of division among them. Therefore the term in \u00a7 5349, reading, \u201cin such proportionate sum as may be determined according to the measure of dependence,\u201d relates to the method of determining the amount of compensation to be paid partial dependents. A proportionate part of some sum is to be taken. An examination of the Act leaves no reasonable alternative, except to find that the term \u201cproportionate sum,\u201d in \u00a7 5349, relates to the weekly compensation to be paid the wholly dependent mentioned in the same paragraph,</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Under this construction a partially dependent may conceivably receive any fractional part of the weekly compensation to be paid the wholly dependent; and under the maximum and minimum provision a sum in excess of the weekly aid received by the partially dependent from the employee may in some circumstance be awarded such dependent. Of the several ways of construing \u00a7 5349 suggested, the foregoing seems the more reasonable and more in accord with the terms and spirit of the statute, when viewed in the light, not of this case merely, but of all possible cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The sum fixed by \u00a7 5349 as the amount to be paid those wholly dependent, is one half of the average weekly earnings of the deceased at the time of the injury. Therefore the amount to be paid to partial dependents is such proportion of the compensation that would be paid the wholly dependent as is the measure (or degree) of the dependency of the partial dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Twenty-six dollars was the weekly sum necessary for the reasonable support of the plaintiff\u2019s household, and the deceased provided weekly $15 of this support. Therefore in this case the plaintiff\u2019s measure of dependency on the deceased was fifteen twenty-sixths (15/26) of the sum necessary for the reasonable support of her household. The commissioner, ' therefore, in his <em>pro forma </em>award, correctly awarded compensation to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The Superior Court is advised to affirm the award of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
