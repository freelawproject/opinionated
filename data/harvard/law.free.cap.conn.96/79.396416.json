That the plaintiffs are trustees in liquidation of the Derby Manufacturing Company, a corporation formerly organized under the laws of Connecticut, and now dissolved by vote of the stockholders, and are acting as receivers of the estate of said corporation under the orders of the Superior Court in New Haven County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>2. That on June 1st, 1920, certain claims for additional federal taxes were filed by the United States and the defendant with plaintiffs, and that on said date an order was issued by the Superior Court disallowing such claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">3. That on June 15th, 1920, the United States, by the Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, filed an application for an order in said court that the claim of the United States be paid, which application is now pending in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, said defendant threatens to seize the property in the hands of the trustees acting as receivers under the orders of this court, by process of distraint in order to satisfy such pending claim for taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">5. That such threatened interference by said defendant would be a contempt of this court, and would leave the plaintiffs without any adequate remedy at law in the protection of the property held in their custody as officers of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-9\">Wherefore, the plaintiffs pray that the said defendant, James J. Walsh, Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Connecticut, his agents, deputies, and successors in office, may be restrained from interfering in any manner with the possession of the estate of said Derby Manufacturing Company in the hands of the plaintiffs as trustees in liquidation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-10\">To this complaint the defendant demurred upon these grounds:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-11\">1. It appears from said complaint that the plaintiffs are trustees in liquidation of the Derby Manufacturing Company, under the provisions of \u00a7 3448 of the General Statutes, and as such trustees, their custody of the property of said corporation is not the custody of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-12\">2. It does not appear from said complaint that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>plaintiffs are officers of the court or that the property-in the custody of the plaintiffs is in the custody of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">3. No action taken by the defendant, as collector in behalf of the United States of America against the property in the custody of the plaintiffs, as trustees, can be construed as a contempt of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-7\"><em>Edward A. Harriman, </em>with whom was <em>Harold E. Drew, </em>for the appellants (plaintiffs).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-8\"><em>Allan K. Smith, </em>Assistant United States\u2019 Attorney, for the appellee (defendant).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b94-9\">Curtis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">Under the demurrer the essential question for decision was whether the possession of the plaintiffs of the property of the Derby Manufacturing Company was the custody of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The plaintiffs were trustees in liquidation of the company, with such relation to the property as proceedings under the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 3447 and 3448, created.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">The plaintiffs claim that by such proceedings they became receivers of the court in relation to the property of the corporation, and hence that the property came into the custody of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The directors of a corporation, acting as trustees in liquidation under General Statutes, \u00a7 3447, only, are obviously not receivers or officers of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">If such trustees, in the exercise of their discretion, make application to the Superior Court under \u00a7 3448, they do not thereby change their relation to the property of the corporation, they are still merely trustees in liquidation, and not officers of the court holding the property in the custody of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">There are provisions in the statutes and an absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of provisions relative to the winding-up proceedings by trustees under \u00a7\u00a7 3447 and 3448, which clearly indicate that it was not the legislative intent to make them receivers by the enactment of \u00a7 3448 of the General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 3448, 3449 and 3450, the trustees may, in their discretion, secure an order of court limiting a time for the presentation of claims. But if a claim so presented is disallowed, the creditor, without the necessity of securing the permission of the court, must begin an action to enforce the claim within four months after disallowance. This course of proceeding differs radically from that pursued upon the disallowance of a claim in a receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Section 3448 of the General Statutes provides that if trustees in liquidation under \u00a7 3447 bring an application to the Superior Court for the hmitation of time within which claims must be presented, they shall still proceed to wind up the affairs of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 3447.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The provision of General Statutes, \u00a7 3450, permitting a creditor, pending the winding-up proceedings of trustees in liquidation, to secure the appointment of receivers of the corporation in liquidation, would be a useless provision if the trustees were already receivers and subject to the ordinary power of the court to remove its receivers for good cause shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">There is no provision in the statutes relating to trustees in liquidation providing that they shall furnish bonds as is required of receivers by General Statutes, \u00a7 6082.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">The trustees under this section are not, by their application to the court to limit a time for the presentation of claims, made, by that act, receivers of the corporation. They are still to wind up the corporation in accord with \u00a7 3447, but they may secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>direction from the court in the same manner as if they were receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Furthermore, it is hardly conceivable that it was the legislative intent, by the enactment of \u00a7 3448, to permit the directors, acting as trustees, at their discretion, to convert an entire board of directors into a board of receivers of the Superior Court, with the unnecessary expense thereby imposed upon the corporation, and hence, possibly, upon the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The winding-up proceedings of a corporation under \u00a7\u00a7 3447 and 3448, although under the direction of the court, are not the formal proceedings of a statutory receivership, but are informal proceedings which do not bring the assets of the corporation into the custody of the law. The proceedings are similar to those considered in <em>In re Litchfield County Agricultural </em>Soc., 91 Conn. 536, 100 Atl. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
