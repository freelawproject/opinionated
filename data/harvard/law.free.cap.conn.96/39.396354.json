Creedon were taken out by Abbie Lyons and all premiums paid by her, and that the policies and all proceeds therefrom belonged to her and at her death to her estate, subject to the duty on her part and on the part of her estate to pay the reasonable funeral expenses of Mary T. Creedon.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim of error is that the court erred in not granting her motion to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial.
