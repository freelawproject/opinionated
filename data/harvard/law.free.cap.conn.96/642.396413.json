Ten days later, upon weighing and sorting the tobacco, L discovered that it was damaged and that $1,028 of the purchase price was returnable to him, and the plaintiff thereupon paid L that amount and sought in the present action to recover of the defendant one half the sum so repaid. <em>Held </em>that upon the facts which the jury might reasonably have found from the evidence, the plaintiff could not be said to be a mere volunteer in repaying L, and therefore the trial court erred in its judgment of nonsuit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b654-12\">The law is solicitous to prevent one from enriching himself at the expense of another who has in good faith paid the latter\u2019s obligation.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b654-13\">Submitted on briefs October 6th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-o\">decided October 28th, 1921.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b654-14\">Action by the plaintiff to recover moneys paid by him for the benefit of the defendant, brought to the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County and tried to the jury before <em>Dickenson, J.; </em>the court rendered a judgment of nonsuit, and from its refusal to set such judgment aside, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AX_\">\n<em>Error and new trial ordered.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-15\"><em>Lewis Sperry, George W.

The jury might also have found that upon demand of the Lorillard Company the plaintiff paid this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">From the facts that plaintiff had the entire control of this sale and its terms; that the contract was not completed until the Lorillard Company had been reimbursed; and that both plaintiff and defendant were liable for such reimbursement, \u2014 the jury would have been justified in finding that the plaintiff was authorized to make such payment in behalf of defendant by the general authority conferred upon him, and if the jury so found, the plaintiff could not be held to \u25a0 have been a mere' volunteer, as the trial court held.</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Since the evidence justified a finding by the jury that the plaintiff in making the payment acted within his authority, we do not determine, if this were not so, whether under the circumstances present the defendant would be liable upon the application of the equitable principle of contribution. One thing is to be remembered in such a situation: the law is solicitous to prevent one man enriching himself at the cost of another who has in good faith paid that other\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
