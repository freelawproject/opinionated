J., Beach, Gager, Curtis and Burpee, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-11\">In crossing a highway a pedestrian is bound to exercise reasonable care, that is, such care as a reasonably prudent person would take under like circumstances; and this may require him to look at intersecting streets ahead of him and also the highway in his rear, in order to determine that no vehicle, if properly managed, is in such proximity as to endanger his safety in crossing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b643-12\">The evidence in the present case <em>held </em>not to show that the plaintiff's conduct violated this standard, nor that the verdict for the plaintiff was against the evidence.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b643-13\">Argued October 4th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARi\">decided October 19th, 1921.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-14\">Action to recover damages for personal injuries and special damage incurred in consequence, alleged to have been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, brought to the Superior Court in Hartford County and tried to the jury before <em>Maltbie, J.; </em>verdict for the plaintiff for $5,000, which the trial court, upon motion of defendant, refused to set aside, and from this ruling, and for alleged errors in the charge and in rulings on\" evidence, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A0j\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-15\"><em>Lewis Sperry </em>and <em>Herbert O.

The circumstances in evidence which the jury may reasonably have found, do not show that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct did violate this standard, nor warrant us in holding that the verdict of the jury was so palpably against the evidence as to require that it be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The only error in the charge which is pursued is that portion of the charge quoted on page thirty of the record, from which the defendant asserts the jury \u201ccould hardly have understood otherwise than that they should weigh the care or the negligence of both plaintiff and defendant, and decide which of the two was guilty of the more negligence.\u201d As we read the charge, it furnishes no possible basis for such claim; so clear is this that we do not deem it essential to quote the charge as made. Had the defendant\u2019s interpretation been substantiated by the record, the charge would then have been at variance with the rule as stated in <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co., </em>73 Conn. 428, 433, 434, 47 Atl. 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
