Arriving at the garage, the plaintiff\u2019s driver left the plaintiff\u2019s truck, and the towing truck moved to the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s truck to push it into the garage. During the course of these operations the plaintiff\u2019s truck, which was partially projecting over the defendant\u2019s track, was struck and damaged by the defendant\u2019s trolley-car. In an action to recover for such damage, the defense was that the plaintiff must show that its truck was legally registered and its driver licensed, in view of the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act (Public Acts of 1919, Chap. 233, \u00a7 44) denying recovery to an owner of a motor-vehicle for injury to person or property \u201creceived by reason of the operation of such motor-vehicle upon a public highway\u201d if it was not legally registered, or if it \u201cwas being operated by an unlicensed person\u201d in violation of the sections of the Act dealing with the issuing of licenses. <em>Held </em>that at the time of the accident the truck was not \u201cbeing operated\u201d by the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tiff\u2019s driver and was not in \u201coperation,\u201d and hence that the plaintiff might recover without showing registration of the car or licensing of the driver.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b402-6\">In any action to recover for injury to person or property received by the operation of a motor-vehicle upon any public highway, the plaintiff should allege, and has the burden of proving, that such motor-vehicle was registered and was operated by a licensed person.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b402-7\">Argued April 20th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A23\">decided June 1st, 1921.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-8\">Action to recover damages for injuries to the plaintiffs\u2019 motortruck, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant, \"brought to and tried by the City Court of Bridgeport, <em>Wilder, Deputy-Judge; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff for $200, and appeal by the defendant.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AAK1\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-9\"><em>Seth W.

The Act referred to is the comprehensive statute concerning motor-vehicles, and the material portion is as follows: \u201cNo recovery shall be had in the courts of this State by the owner of a motor-vehicle which has not been legally registered in accordance with section eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve for injury to person or property received by reason of the operation of such motor-vehicle upon a public highway . . . ; nor shall such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>recovery be had if such motor-vehicle be legally registered but was being operated by an unlicensed person in violation of any provision of section fourteen, fifteen or sixteen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The first question is whether the injury to the plaintiffs\u2019 motor-vehicle was \u201creceived by reason of the operation of such motor-vehicle upon any public highway. \u201d It is not so stated in the complaint. The material facts found by the trial court are that the plaintiffs\u2019 motor-truck, on the day of the collision, \u201cbecame disabled in Brookfield,\u201d which is about twenty-five miles from Bridgeport; that from that place it \u201cwas towed\u201d by the truck of one Edwards to a garage in Bridgeport owned by another person; that the plaintiffs\u2019 driver steered their truck while it was thus towed; that in front of the garage the Edwards truck was detached from the plaintiffs\u2019 truck, moved around to its rear, and began to push it into the garage across the tracks of the defendant; that during this operation the Edwards truck stopped pushing the plaintiffs\u2019 truck for a moment, and backed away from it to get into another position to continue to push it into the garage; that when the Edwards truck thus backed away from the plaintiffs\u2019 truck, it left it with a few inches of its rear end projecting over the defendant\u2019s tracks; that the defendant\u2019s trolley-car, approaching at that instant, collided with the plaintiffs\u2019 truck thus standing, and caused the damage complained of; and that the plaintiffs\u2019 driver had nothing to do with this moving and placing of the plaintiffs\u2019 truck, and was not on it at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In such circumstances, this motor-vehicle was not in operation within any recognized definition of the word. It was not in \u201cthe state of being at work,\u201d or in the \u201cactive exercise of some specific function.\u201d Century Dictionary. It was not performing any work or producing any effect. Webster\u2019s Dictionary. It was not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cthe exertion or action of any form of power or energy. \u201d Standard Dictionary. Nor was this motortruck making such a stop \u201cas motor-vehicles ordinarily make in the courseof their operation,\u201d norastop \u201cfairly incidental to its operation. \u201d <em>Stroud </em>v. <em>Water Commissioners, </em>90 Conn. 412, 414, 97 Atl. 336; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>229 Mass. 19, 22, 118 N. E. 224. In the former case, the owner drove his automobile from Middletown to Hartford, and, arriving at the Hotel Heublein, left the car standing on the highway in a parking-place opposite the hotel, with its power shut off, brakes set, and no one in charge; and, after it had been run into and injured, the owner drove his car back to Middletown. We held (p. 415) that in such circumstances the motor-vehicle \u201cwas as much in the ordinary course of operation on the highway at the time of the injury as if it had been used for shopping, calling, or delivering merchandise. \u201d With similar facts before it, the Massachusetts court reached the same conclusion. The simple statement of the facts in the present case demonstrates clearly that the plaintiffs\u2019 motor-vehicle was not at the time of its injury \u201cin the ordinary course of operation. \u201d Indeed, it cannot be said that the vehicle was in operation of any kind. It was the Edwards car only that was in operation within any of the recognized definitions of that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It is admitted that the plaintiffs\u2019 driver, who was with their motor-vehicle when it became disabled, was \u201can unlicensed person in violation of the provisions of\u201d the Act concerning motor-vehicles. The second question, therefore, is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle \u201cwas being operated\u201d by him. We think it was not. It is true that it is found that, after the plaintiffs\u2019 truck was disabled so that it had to be towed by the Edwards truck, he steered the plaintiffs\u2019 truck; but he did not cause that truck \u201cto move or perform the acts desired, \u201d or \u201cdirect\u201d its \u201cworking.\u201d Century Dictionary. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the time of the collision he had nothing to do with its movement or position. It was not operated by him, and so it is immaterial that he was unlicensed on the day of the accident. The plaintiffs\u2019 ground of action lies outside of the lines of prohibition fixed by the section of the Motor Vehicle Act upon which the defendant relies in its reasons of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The conclusions of the trial court concerning the negligence of the defendant are well supported by the facts found, and its judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Incidentally to its reasons of appeal, the defendant contends that the burden of alleging and proving that the plaintiffs\u2019 car was registered, and its driver was licensed, rested on the plaintiffs. In this we think the defendant is right. Whatever may be the rulings in other jurisdictions, they have no force with us, because they were not made respecting any statute similar to ours. Like the statutes of many other States, our general Act concerning Motor Vehicles (Public Acts of 1919, Chap. 233) requires that every motor-vehicle shall be registered in a manner prescribed, and shall be operated only by a licensed person; and it prescribes penalties for violation of these provisions. But it goes further, in \u00a7 44, and declares that \u201cno recovery shall be had in the courts of this State by the owner of a motor-vehicle\u2019\u2019 which has not been registered, or which is operated by an unlicensed person. It follows that in any action to recover for \u201cinjury to person or property received by reason of the operation of\u2019\u2019 a motor-vehicle \u201cupon any public highway, \u201d the plaintiff must take up the burden of proving that such motor-vehicle was registered and was operated by a licensed person. Those facts are indispensable requisites to his recovery, and it would be an inexcusable waste of time to present evidence to prove other facts until those requisites have been established. The necessary information and evidence the plaintiff usually has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>or can always easily procure before he begins his suit, while it will often be difficult and troublesome for the defendant to obtain them, especially if considerable time has passed since the alleged injury was received. Reasonably and logically, therefore, the plaintiff in this kind of cases should allege the necessary registration and license in his complaint, and prove them at the outset' of the trial. We believe that this has been the general practice hitherto. In the present case, however, it was not applicable for the reasons we have stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred, except Beach, J., who concurred in the result only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
