S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">(temporarily assigned).  This is a slander case. Plaintiff appeals from an involuntary dismissal in favor of defendants after the completion of the case. Defendant Drozd has not responded to the appeal but, of course, his interests are nonetheless before us. <em>Gnapinsky v. </em>Goldyn, 23 <em>N. J. </em>243, 250 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Plaintiff testified as follows: On September 5, 1959 at about 3 P. m., while backing his automobile out of his driveway, he was halted by a call from defendant Tiebie, a neighbor. While the latter was on the sidewalk about ten feet from plaintiff, he shouted: \u201cHey Frank, you\u2019d better watch your step or you\u2019re going to get in trouble,\u201d to which plaintiff inquired: \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Defendant Tiebie then, in a loud voice, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cYou are a no good dirty guinea, and all you do is sit out in front of your bouse all day long and sit and whistle 'at all women that ride up and down the street in their cars. You even whistle at the neighbor\u2019s wives. My wife can\u2019t even walk up and down the street without your whistling at her. Not only that, you even whistle at your own wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Later, after running an errand, plaintiff went to the home of defendant Drozd, also a neighbor, and told him that he had learned Drozd \u201cencouraged\u201d Tiebie by saying \u201cGive him hell, give him hell,\u201d and that plaintiff was \u201cthe biggest hypocrite you ever saw\u201d and was \u201cno damn good.\u201d Drozd\u2019s repfy thereto was \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s wife and a friend, one George Ambrosia, who were in a screened porch of plaintiff\u2019s house at the time of the aforementioned incident, testified that they heard the defendants make substantially the above statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">At the time of the incident plaintiff\u2019s height was <em>5'11 </em>and his weight 213 lbs. He was employed as a trailer-truck driver and was a shop steward at his place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Plaintiff stated that following these outbursts, his appetite was \u201ccurbed,\u201d he stopped eating breakfast, his weight dropped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>to 192 lbs., he became \u201cvery much upset,\u201d \u201cvery nervous,\u201d \u201cvery shocked,\u201d the thought of this incident was \u201calways on my mind,\u201d and his loss of weight necessitated extensive alterations to his wardrobe at a cost of \u201croughly around forty, forty-five, fifty dollars, I don\u2019t know.\u201d His wife corroborated his loss of appetite and weight, his nervousness and added \u201che doesn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d Plaintiff did not lose any time at his job, nor did he consult a doctor either before or after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Throughout plaintiff\u2019s case defendants objected to his testimony as to the effect of the alleged slanderous words upon him, on the ground that the causal connection between the two had to be established by medical testimony. The court at first sustained these objections but thereafter allowed plaintiff to testify thereon \u201con condition that the same would he connected up and shown to he the proximate result\u201d of these words.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">At the conclusion of the case both defendants moved for an involuntary dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. The trial judge, in granting these motions, found the words uttered by defendants were not slanderous <em>per se, </em>and therefore \u201cthere must be proof of special damages,\u201d and further stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cI do not feel that evidence which was only admitted upon the condition that it be connected up [by medical testimony] and shown to have been the proximate result of this remark, this statement, to have been made by one of two of these defendants, I don\u2019t find that connection has been established and therefore I find that no proof of actual damage has been sustained and the burden of presenting same being on the plaintiff that the plaintiff has failed to establish Ms case * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The main thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument herein is that the causal relationship between plaintiff\u2019s distress and defendants\u2019 slanderous words was well within the common knowledge of ordinary laymen and, therefore, there was no necessity for medical opinion to establish the same. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tiff further argues that there was sufficient proof of special damages to warrant submission of the same to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Assuming, but not admitting, that plaintiff\u2019s first argument is sound, we find his second to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Slander is actionable <em>per se, </em>that is, without charge or proof of special damages, when the false statements (1) charge commission of a crime, (2) impute certain loathsome diseases, (3) affect a person in his business, trade, profession or office, or (4) impute unchastity to a woman. <em>Gnapinsky v. Goldyn, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>250. If the defamatory statements are not within any of these four categories, plaintiff must prove that the utterance thereof was the legal cause of some special harm. <em>Restatement of the Law, Torts, sec. 575, p. </em>185.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Appellant concedes the statements made by defendants are not slanderous <em>per se </em>but, as heretofore stated, he argues that a jury question was presented as to special damages. His proofs with regard thereto were that he suffered from emotional distress, loss of appetite and loss of weight which, in turn, required that he make alterations to his wardrobe.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The special harm a plaintiff must prove is harm of a material or pecuniary nature. <em>Restatement, Torts, see. 575, p. </em>185. There must be proof of a pecuniary loss or loss of some substantial'or material advantage. <em>53 C. J. S. Libel and Slander </em>\u00a7 268(b), <em>p. </em>390.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> Evidence of mental suffering or physical sickness will not <em>alone </em>be sufficient to show special damage to support an action for words not actionable <em>per se, </em>53 <em>C. J. S. Libel and Slander </em>\u00a7 268(b), <em>p. </em>391. <em>Prosser on Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), <em>ch. </em>19, <em>sec. </em>93, <em>p. </em>594. However, once the cause of action is established by the proof of pecuniary loss, the bars are lowered and general damages may be recovered for his (plaintiff\u2019s) wounded feeling and humiliation and resulting physical illness. In other words, such damages are insufficient in themselves to make the slander actionable, but once the cause of action is made out without them, they may be tacked on as \u201cparasitic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to it. <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Butler v. Hoboken Printing and Publ. Co., </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>45, 46-47 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Plaintiffs only effort to prove pecuniary damages was the alleged alterations to his wardrobe. The cost thereof, at best, was minimal and his testimony pertaining thereto was vague, uncertain and indefinite. It was admitted upon condition that plaintiff thereafter prove that the charge therefor was reasonable. This was not done, and in the absence thereof the testimony was not competent. <em>Garafola v. Rosecliff Realty Co., Inc., </em>24 <em>N. J. Super. </em>28, 43 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> There is another fatal deficiency in plaintiff\u2019s case. His proofs indicate his sufferings were directly caused by defendants\u2019 remarks and not by their effect upon his reputation. He testified that he was always \u201cthinking\u201d about the statement and \u201calways had it on my mind.\u201d \u201cIt affected my whole life.\u201d His witnesses (his wife and his friend) admitted that these remarks did not affect their opinion of him and they \u201cstill feel\u201d that he \u201cis as fine a man as before these remarks were made.\u201d In order to prove damages stemming from slanderous remarks, the harm must result from the conduct of a third person and not from the defamer. <em>Restatement, Torts, sec. </em>575, comment (b) , at <em>p. </em>185. Emotional distress caused to the person slandered <em>by his knowledge </em>that he has been defamed is not special harm and this is so although the distress results in serious illness. <em>Restatement, Torts, sec. </em>575, comment (c) , at <em>p. </em>187.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Plaintiff argues that on the motion made he was entitled to the benefit of all favorable testimony introduced on his behalf, including all of the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. While this is sound, <em>Krug v. Wanner, </em>28 <em>N. J. </em>174, 179 (1958), such inferences must be rooted in evidence, <em>Gnapinsky v. Goldyn, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>252.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Eor the aforesaid reasons we conclude that the action of the trial court was correct. Affirmed. Costs in favor of defendant Tiebie.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Sullivan, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AleC\">(concurring). This suit is but another example of how litigious people are becoming. Here, plaintiff, a trailer-truck driver and shop steward at the trucking concern which employs him, claims that he suffered mental anguish, lost his appetite, and his weight went from 213 pounds to 192 pounds, because the defendant Tiebie called him a \"dirty guinea\u201d and said that he whistled at women.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">I don\u2019t know of any defamatory connotation to the word \"guinea,\u201d and there was no evidence produced at trial to show that the expression had any such meaning. <em>Webster\u2019s International Dictionary </em>defines \"guinea\u201d as a slang expression for an Italian immigrant. The word may be crude, and even objectionable, but in my opinion has not been shown to be defamatory. To claim defamation in the alleged statement that plaintiff whistled at women is ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The foundation of an action for defamation is injury to one\u2019s reputation. <em>Cole v. </em>Richards, 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>356 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932). I am at a loss to understand plaintiff\u2019s claim that his reputation has suffered. This is nothing but a spite suit and should never have been brought.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
