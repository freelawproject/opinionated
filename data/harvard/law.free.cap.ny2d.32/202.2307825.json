Appellant\u2019s innocuous behavior and his refusal to identify himself did not provide the officer with probable cause to believe that appellant was loitering; consequently, the arrest and search violated appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schanbarger, </em>24 N Y 2d 288; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gresham, </em>28 N Y 2d 823.) II. Section 240.35 (subd. 6) of the Penal Law violates due process requirements. The language of subdivision 6 is so vague that the statute does not give adequate notice of the behavior it forbids, nor does it prescribe comprehensible standards for its enforcement. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>347 U. S. 612; <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>405 U. S. 156; <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U. S. 88; <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>4 N Y 2d 469; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>306 N. Y. 110; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>City of Euclid, </em>402 U. S. 544.) III. Subdivision 6 is overly broad because it punishes prima facie harmless conduct without furthering a legitimate State interest. <em>(Fenster </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>20 N Y 2d 309; <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>405 U. S. 156; <em>People </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>4 N Y 2d 469.) IV. Since loitering by definition requires only a suspicion of criminal activity, section 240.35 (subd. 6), in effect, authorizes arrests on less than probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-5\"><em>Thomas J. Mackell, District Attorney (Martin L.

He had pleaded guilty following denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized from him when he was arrested for loitering in violation of subdivision 6 of section 240.35 of the Penal Law which reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\"><em>\u201c </em>A person is guilty of loitering when he * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Loiters, remains or wanders in or about a place without apparent reason and under circumstances which justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime, and, upon inquiry by a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or fails to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct and purposes \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">On May 21, 1970, at about 11:30 at night, Albert .Stokes, just out of the Army, and a friend of his entered the unlocked lobby of a housing authority apartment building located at Eockaway Beach Boulevard in Queens. They briefly talked to a third person in the building and then spoke to one another for about eight to ten minutes. At that point, two housing authority policemen who had been observing the two young men from the manager\u2019s office of the building, entered the lobby, and one of them asked Stokes if he lived in the building. He replied that he did not. The officer then asked him to identify himself and to explain his reasons for being there. Upon Stokes\u2019 reply that <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>I don\u2019t have to show you anything \u2019 * * * the Army [told me I don\u2019t] have to tell a cop anything \u201d, the patrolman placed him under arrest for loitering. He then searched Stokes and found in his possession hypodermic instruments and five glassine envelopes which, on later investigation, were found to contain heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">The complaint filed on the following day in the New York City Criminal Court charged the defendant with the crimes of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>nal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.15), criminal possession of a hypodermic instrument .(Penal Law, \u00a7 220.45) and the violation of loitering (\u00a7 240.35, subd. 6). It recited that \u201c At [about 11.32 p.m. in the lobby of the apartment building in question] the deponant [sic] observed the defendant loitering about the hallway for approx. 10 minutes and when the deponant approached the defendant and questioned the defendant the defendant refused to comply and refused to identify himself and would give no valid reason for being in the area. When the defendant was placed under arrest he was found to have in his possesion five (5) glassene [sic] envelopes corn taining alleged Heroin one (1) hypodermic instrument, one (1) bottlecap with residue of alleged Heroin, one (1) cooker and one (1) hypodermic needle. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Some months after a preliminary hearing at which the complaint was upheld, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence which had been taken from him at the time of his arrest. A hearing on his motion was held in conjunction with his trial on the loitering charge before a judge of the Criminal Court. He denied the motion\u2014after hearing the arresting officer\u2019s testimony\u2014 concluding that <em>\u201c </em>the search- [was] incidental to a lawful arrest \u2019 \u2019 and that the defendant <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is found guilty as charged * * * [of] loitering\u201d. Immediately following this determination\u2014 that he was guilty of loitering and that the search and seizure was proper, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the crime of attempted possession of a hypodermic instrument (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 220.45). He was placed on probation for a year.</p>\n<p id=\"A8k\">Upon appeal, the Appellate Term modified the resulting judgment, on the law and the facts, by reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction of loitering and dismissing that charge and, as so modified, affirmed the judgment. <em>\u201c </em>In our opinion,\u201d wrote the court, <em>\u201c </em>defendant\u2019s guilt of loitering was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, insofar as the complaint charged defendant with loitering, it was jurisdictionally defective.\u201d However, the court went on to say, since there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for loitering, the subsequent search was permissible and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In this court, the defendant urges, first, that the evidence seized from him should have been suppressed on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>no probable canse existed to believe that he was \u201cloitering\u201d and, second, that, in any event, the loitering provision (Penal Law, \u00a7 240.35, subd. 6), which served as the predicate for his arrest, is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">To justify an arrest for \u201cloitering\u201d under.subdivision 6 of section 240.35, there must be evidence (1) that the suspect is loitering \u201c in or about a place without apparent reason \u201d; (2) that the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>circumstances * * * justify suspicion that he may be engaged or about to engage in crime\u201d; and (3) that, \u201c upon inquiry by a peace officer, [he] refuses to identify himself or fails to give a reasonably credible account of his conduct and purposes \u201d. Study of the record bears out the defendant\u2019s position that there was no evidence that the circumstances justified a suspicion that he was \u2018 \u2018 engaged or about to engage in crime \u2019 \u2019. Indeed, the complaint filed against him is actually devoid of any such allegation <em>(supra, </em>pp. 204^-205). The evidence reveals no more than that the defendant and a friend were standing in the lobby of an apartment building\u2014concededly one in which they were not residents \u2014 carrying on a conversation late at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Absolutely lacking is evidence that the policeman had any information whatever \u2014 either from his own observations, those of his partner or from some independent source such as a complaint from one of the building\u2019s residents or an informer\u2019s tip \u2014 that would have rendered this otherwise innocent uonduct suspicious within the sense of the statute. In addition, both the defendant and his friend were standing in open view and neither was acting in a strange or furtive manner, and neither in any way sought to avoid the encounter with the police. In point of fact, we think the record demonstrates that the d\u00e9fendant was placed under arrest solely and simply because he refused to identify himself or explain his presence in the building. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Schanbarger, </em>24 N Y 2d 288, 291.) Such a refusal, however, may not, in and of itself, be a predicate for or justify an arrest or a conviction under the statute. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Schanbarger, </em>24 N Y 2d 288, 291-292, supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Merolla, </em>9 N Y 2d 62, 68; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>306 N. Y. 110.) \u201cWhile it may be true that there was no reason why the defendant should not have answered the [officer\u2019s] questions,\u201d Judge Burke wrote for the court in the <em>Schanbarger </em>case (24 N Y 2d, at pp. 291-292), also a prosecution for loitering, \u201c it equally is true that, his failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to answer cannot constitute a criminal act and, particularly, a violation of subdivision 6 of section 240.35.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The case cited by the court below, in support of its finding of probable cause \u2014 <em>People </em>v. <em>Gresham </em>(28 N Y 2d 823) \u2014is quite different from the present one. The defendant Gresham and another youth were standing next to a locked ticket booth in a deserted waiting room of a railroad station at the hour appointed for its closing, certainly not a customary time or place to be carrying on a conversation. Moreover \u2014 and the court considered this of high significance-\u2014the defendant\u2019s companion, upon the approach of the stationmaster and an auxiliary police officer, dropped an envelope to the floor and the defendant picked it up and actually ran out of the building with it and disposed of it before returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In short, there was here no probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest for loitering. This being so, the incidental search was unlawful and the evidence taken from him should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In the view which we have taken, we find it unnecessary to consider the further contention that the loitering statute (Penal Law, \u00a7 240.35, subd. 6) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Judges Bubke, Bbeitel, Jasen, Gabbielli, Jones and Wachtleb concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">. Meanwhile, the other officer had permitted Stokes\u2019 friend to leave the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
