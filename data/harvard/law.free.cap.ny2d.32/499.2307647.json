The trial court erred in refusing to suppress crucial evidence that was seized by the police in violation of the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(384 U. S. 436 [1966]). <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436; <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471; <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338; <em>Silverthorne Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385; <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 206; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pugliese, </em>153 F. 2d 497; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grossman, </em>45 Misc 2d 557; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paroutian, </em>299 F. 2d 486; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>13 N Y 2d 296; <em>People </em>v. <em>Paulin, </em>61 Misc 2d 289, 33 A D 2d 105, 25 N Y 2d 445.) II. The seizure of the evidence was unconstitutional under <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(395 U. S. 752 [1969]). <em>[Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 752; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U. S. 145; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>56; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>454 F. 2d 801; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ernest E., </em>38 A D 2d 394; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bercowitz, </em>60 Misc 2d 1078.) III. The police entry and search of the residence, in which defendant was found, violated defendant\u2019s rights under the United States Constitution and the New York Constitution. The entry and search were unconstitutional since made without a search or arrest warrant. <em>(Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct., </em>387 U. S. 523; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 610; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 F. 2d 385; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>262 F. 2d 449; <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U. S. 132; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U. S. 451; <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U. S. 294.) IV. The admission at the trial of the gun and the other evidence seized in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, as well as the testimony of a ballistics expert and other witnesses identifying the gun as the murder weapon, require reversal since the improper admission of such crucial evidence cannot be deemed harmless error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McKinney, </em>24 N Y 2d 180; <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U. S. 85; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 18; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>9 N Y 2d 286; <em>Andres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U. S. 740; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>New York, </em>346 U. S. 156.) V. The death penalty provision of the New York statute is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution on the authority of <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(408 U. S. 238 [1972]). <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>408 U. S. 786; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U. S. 845; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>61 Misc 2d 1043; <em>Duling </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>408 U. S. 936.) VI. The constitutional invalidity of defendant\u2019s sentence of death requires remand of this case for resentence by the trial judge in accordance with the term of imprisonment for a class A felony. VII. The New York statutory procedure for the trial of capital cases under which defendant was convicted, whereby on a plea of not guilty a defendant may be sentenced to death while on a plea of guilty he may receive a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, is unconstitutional under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(390 U. S. 570 [1968]). <em>(Funicello </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>403 U. S. 948; <em>Childs </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>403 U. S. 948; <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>403 U.

S. 948; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>403 U. S. 948; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Leeke, </em>403 U. S. 948.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Vni. The death penalty must be set aside because veniremen were excluded from the jury in violation of the clear mandate of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(391 U. S. 510 [1968]) and of the New York statute as well. <em>(Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U. S. 510; <em>Marion </em>v. <em>Beto, </em>434 F. 2d 29, 402 U. S. 906; <em>Boulden </em>v. <em>Holman, </em>394 U. S. 478; <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>398 U. S. 262.) IX. The prosecutor\u2019s systematic use of peremptory challenges to remove all scrupled jurors who were not subject to challenge for cause \u201c death qualified \u201d the jury and thereby violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a representative jury on the question of punishment. <em>(Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U. S. 202; <em>Trop </em>v. <em>Dulles, </em>356 U. S. 86.) X. The trial court abused its discretion and committed substantial error by denying defendant\u2019s motion for an adjournment of the penalty trial pending a psychiatric examination of defendant and the preparation of evidence in mitigation of sentence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aiss, </em>29 N Y 2d 403.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b534-4\"><em>Daniel C.

The evidence seized at 1040 Midland Avenue was constitutionally and properly obtained. <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436; <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471; <em>Silverthorne Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385; <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338; <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.

S. 912.) II. The evidence was validly seized. <em>(Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U. S. 752; <em>Vale of Louisiana, </em>399 U. S. 30; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>342 U.

S. 610; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U. S. 10; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1.) III. The house at 1040 Midland Avenue was validly entered without a search warrant. IV. The admission at trial of the weapon, the ammunition and related testimony would be harmless error even if the search was invalid. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.

The death penalty provision of section 125.30 of the Penal Law is constitutional. <em>(Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U. S. 238; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>McGautha </em>v. <em>California, </em>402 U. S. 183.) VI. If error did exist in the sentencing proceeding, the proper procedure would be remand for resentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>20 N Y 2d 64.) VII. Defendant was not coerced into pleading guilty to escape the death penalty. <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U. S. 742; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>390 U. S. 570; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>61 Misc 2d 1043.) VIII. The <em>voir dire </em>of the jury was conducted in accordance with the standards fixed by <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>as well as by New York law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>301 N. Y. 302, 340 U. S. 914, 940; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Bounds, </em>395 F. 2d 297, 393 U. S. 76; <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.

IX. Judge Walsh correctly refused an adjournment of one month for the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moseley, </em>20 N Y 2d 64; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dusablon, </em>16 N Y 2d 9.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b535-4\">Chief Judge Fuld.</author>\n<p id=\"AM_\">On the night of September 8, 1969, at about a quarter after nine, the defendant held up Paul DiG-eorge, an attendant at a gas station in Canastota, New York, and fled with his wallet and the station\u2019s cash receipts, driving east on Route 5 in a Ford convertible. Notified of the incident, Officer Robert Mumford of the Sherill Police Department stopped the defendant\u2019s car as he was driving through Sherill. While he and Police Chief Thomas Reilly were questioning the defendant, the latter suddenly produced a pistol and shot both officers. Reilly was able to radio in that he had been shot and that his assailant\u2019s auto was heading east on Route 5; he also furnished the defendant\u2019s last name and the car\u2019s license number.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">A little after ten o\u2019clock, the defendant drove up to a trailer home, owned by Mrs. Marie DiLapi, about five miles from the scene of the shooting and, abandoning the Ford, forced her at gunpoint to drive him in her car to Syracuse. On the way, he threw a wallet out of the car\u2014which was later found and identified as DiGeorge\u2019s \u2014 and told Mrs. DiLapi that he had shot the two Sherill policemen and would kill her if she tried <em>\u201c </em>any funny stuff. \u2019 \u2019 After she dropped him off in the vicinity of Kennedy and South Salina Streets in Syracuse, she went immediately to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>A check on the license number of the car in which the defendant was traveling disclosed that it belonged to a girl friend of his; that his full name was Martin Fitzpatrick; and that a person by that name owned a house at 1040 Midland Avenue, not far from where he had alighted from Mrs DiLapi\u2019s vehicle. Shortly after 8:00 a.m. on the following day, police officers surrounded that house. When a knock, an announcement that they were police officers and a telephone call from next door produced no answer, the police, acting without a warrant, opened the door\u2014which was ajar\u2014went into the house and began searching for the defendant. As they entered a room on the second floor, the defendant called\u2014from a closet in which he was hiding \u2014 \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Don\u2019t shoot. I give up. \u2019 \u2019 The officers seized and handcuffed him, took him out into the hall, a few feet from the closet, and advised him of his rights. Questioned about the gun he had used, the defendant stated that it was on a shelf in the closet where they had found him. An immediate search of its interior uncovered a bank bag containing the gun, with six empty shell casings in the cylinder and 27 live rounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Officer Mumford died on September 9, 1969, the day after the shooting, and Chief Reilly four days later. The defendant was indicted for their murder in the Oneida County Court on October 6. In selecting the jury for trial, late in 1970, the district attorney challenged for cause 20 veniremen because of reservations about capital punishment \u201411 of whom had indicated, however, that their objection to the death penalty would not prevent them from returning a verdict of guilt. The prosecution also utilized a number of peremptory challenges to exclude other veniremen opposed to capital punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">At the subsequent suppression hearing, police officers testified that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to the defendant. Sergeant Carhart stated that he \u201c was advised of his rights\u201d and Lieutenant Burns declared that Carhart had given the suspect \u2018 \u2018 his rights, \u2019 \u2019 adding that the defendant, when asked if he was \u201csure\u201d he understood his rights, replied in the affirmative. However, the judge decided, this testimony did not constitute <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>sufficient information \u2019 \u2019 upon which he could find that \u201c the <em>Miranda </em>requirement was complied with * * * or that the defendant waived such rights.\u201d Accordingly, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ruled the defendant\u2019s oral statements inadmissible. Nevertheless, concluding that the gun and the other items found in the closet could not be regarded, as the defense claimed, as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d the judge received them in evidence since, as he put it, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 proper police investigation would [in any event] have resulted in a search of that closet and [their] discovery. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Upon the trial, the defendant was identified by DiGeorge and Mrs. DiLapi, and at least two bullets used in the killings were proved to have come from the gun found in the closet. The jury returned a verdict of guilt on December 17, 1970. A few days later, prior to the commencement of what is commonly called the \u201c penalty trial \u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.30), the defendant sought an adjournment to permit a psychiatric examination and the preparation of other relevant presentence material. The motion was denied. The defendant then decided to handle the penalty trial himself in place of his attorneys. After the People had concluded their case, he declined to call any witness or offer any evidence. The jury reported, on December 23, that it agreed that the death penalty should be imposed and, following imposition of that sentence, the defendant appealed to this court as of right (CPL 450.70).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt is clear and, indeed, he does not question its sufficiency. He does, however, contend, among other arguments, (1) that the trial judge committed error, requiring\u2019 a reversal of the conviction and a new trial, when he received in evidence the gun and other articles found in the closet and (2) that, in any event, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(408 U. S. 238) compels annulment \u00a1of the death sentence imposed on the ground that, as the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution was construed in that case, such sentence amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\n<em>Fruit of the Poisonous Tree</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, the gun and the other items may not be deemed inadmissible in evidence as fruit of the poisonous tree, that is, as the product of what the trial Judge ruled were improperly obtained statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">There are, it is settled, exceptions to the rule that evidence is inadmissible if uncovered as a result of information obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>by impermissible conduct on the part of police officers. (See, e.g., <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471, 489; <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, 308 </em>U. S. 338, 341 [where the connection between the lawless conduct of the police and the discovery of the challenged evidence had \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint \u201d]; <em>Silverthorne Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, 392 [exclusionary rule has no application where government learns of the evidence \u201c from an independent source \u201d]; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Dentine, </em>21 N Y 2d 700, 971; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>436 F. 2d 1166, 1170, cert. den. 402 U. S. 912; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>294 F. 2d 723, cert. den. 368 U. S. 883.) As the Supreme Court wrote in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States </em>(371 U. S. 471, 487-488, <em>supra), \u201c </em>We need not hold that all evidence is <em>\u2018 </em>fruit of the poisonous tree \u2019 simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Bather, the more apt question in such a case is <em>\u2018 </em>whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. \u2019 Maguire, Evidence of Guilt, 221 (1959).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In line with this reasoning, the courts have held that evidence obtained as a result of information derived from an unlawful search or other illegal police conduct is not inadmissible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine where the normal course of police investigation would, in any case, even absent the illicit conduct, have inevitably led to such evidence. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Seohnlein, </em>423 F. 2d 1051, cert. den. 399 U. S. 913; <em>Wayne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 F. 2d 205, cert. den. 375 U. S. 860; <em>People </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>30 A D 2d 983; <em>People </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>55 Misc 2d 219; see, also, <em>Lockridge </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. of Los Angeles County, 3 </em>Cal. 3d 166, cert. den. 402 U. S. 910; Note 43 ALR 3d 385, 404; Maguire, How to Unpoison the Fruit, 55 J. Crim. L. C. <em>&amp; </em>P. S. 307, 313-317; but cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paroutian, </em>299 F. 2d 486, 489 [319 F. 2d 661]; Pitler, \u201c Fruit of the Poisonous Tree \u201d, 56 Cal. L. Rev. 579, 627-630.) In other words, as one commentator put it, the inevitable discovery factor \u201c permits the government to remove the taint from otherwise poisoned fruit by establishing that the unlawful act from which it resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was not a <em>sine qua non </em>of its discovery.\u201d (Maguire, How to Unpoison the Fruit, 55 J. Crim. L. C. <em>&amp; </em>P. S. 307, 313.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In the present case, it was entirely fortuitous that the police delayed the search of the immediate area where the defendant was discovered until they had begun questioning him and, as a result, very quickly learned where the gun was located. It is quite unreal to suggest that, but for the defendant\u2019s admission, the police would not have looked for incriminating evidence in the closet where he had been hiding. The weapon, employed in a robbery and a shooting of two police officers, is a prime object of any investigation and, unless thrown away, was certain to be either on or near the defendant. If not found upon him, the next most reasonable place to look for it was where he had been just before he was seized. Since, then, a search of the closet was inevitable regardless of the defendant\u2019s answers to questions put to him beyond its confines, it may not fairly be said that the police \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>exploited. \u2019 \u2019 the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>illegality \u2019 \u2019 involved in their interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">It has been suggested that the \u201c inevitable discovery \u201d exception may erode the \u201c exclusionary rule as a viable deterrent to. illicit police activity\u201d (Pitler, \u201cFruit of the Poisonous Tree\u201d, 56 Cal. L. Rev. 579, 630; see, also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paroutian, </em>299 F. 2d 486, 489, <em>supra), </em>chiefly because it may not always be certain what the police <em>would </em>have done, clear as it may be what they <em>could </em>have or <em>should </em>have done. However, the exception may safely be applied \u2014 and erosion of the salutary exclusionary rule avoided\u2014as long as the prosecution has the burden of proving \u201c that the illegal act was not a <em>sine qua non </em>of the discovery of the otherwise tainted evidence.\u201d (Maguire, How to Unpoison the Fruit, 55 J. Crim. L. C. <em>&amp; </em>P. S. 307, 317; see, also, <em>Somer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>138 F. 2d 790, 792.) The <em>\u201csine qua non </em>test,\u201d Maguire continued <em>(ibid.), </em>\u201cif properly administered, serves well the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of the exclusionary rule by denying to the government the use of evidence \u2018 come at by the exploitation of . . . illegality \u2019 and at the same time minimizes the opportunity for the defendant to receive an undeserved and socially undesirable bonanza.\u201d In the case before us, the defendant is clearly not entitled to have the gun suppressed, for, as indicated, the People have here unques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tionably met their burden of proving that the gun would inevitably have been located in the course of the police officers\u2019 investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>The Legality of the Search and- Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defendant, however, goes on to argue, first, that, even assuming the validity of the 6 \u2018 inevitable discovery \u2019 \u2019 exception and the lawfulness of his arrest, the seizure of the gun violated constitutional demands because it was not within the area from which he \u201cmight obtain weapons or evidentiary items \u201d as prescribed by <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(395 U. S. 752, 766). And, second, he maintains that the gun should have been excluded because the entry, search and seizure \u2014 and even the arrest\u2014were unconstitional because accomplished without a search or arrest warrant and without probable cause to believe that the defendant was within the house. . The arguments lack substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In the <em>Chimel </em>case (395 U. S. 752, <em>supra), </em>the court held that the lawful arrest of an accused, where effected without an arrest warrant, or a warrant to search the area where he is found, permits a search only of his person and the area from which he \u00a3 <em>\u2018 </em>might obtain weapons or evidentiary items\u201d (395 U. S., at p. 766). Since he had been removed from the closet\u2019s interior, the defendant urges that he was outside the authorized \u201c grabbable \u201d area. Nothing in <em>Chimel </em>requires so narrow a reading of the Fourth Amendment. The court did not disapprove of a search of the \u201croom\u201d or area where the \u201c arrest occurs \u201d (p. 763); it condemned only a search \u201c \u00a3 remote in time or place from the arrest \u2019 \u201d (p. 764). The immediate search of the very closet where the defendant was arrested is far different from the proscribed search of \u201c closed or concealed areas \u201d (p. 763), even in the room where a defendant is arrested. There was here no quality of <em>11 </em>rummaging at will \u2019 \u2019 among the defendant\u2019s effects at which the Fourth Amendment is aimed (p. 767). And the fact that the police had handcuffed the defendant did not render the closet search unauthorized. As this court remarked in <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(26 N Y 2d 558, 563), \u201cit is not at all clear that the \u2018 grabbing distance \u2019 authorized in the <em>Chimel </em>case is conditioned upon the arrested person\u2019s continued capacity <em>1 </em>to grab\u2019,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Nor was there need in this case for a search or arrest warrant. The shootings by a man named Fitzpatrick, whose car had been identified as belonging to a friend of \u2018 \u2018 Martin Fitzpatrick \u2019 \u2019 and whose trail led close to a house owned by a man of that same name, as well as the defendant\u2019s incriminating words of surrender just before the officers found him in the closet\u2014 all these gave the police more than sufficient <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 probable cause \u201d to arrest him. Moreover, the \u201cpermissible scope of search \u201d must be at least \u201c as broad as may reasonably be necessary to prevent the dangers that the suspect at large in the house may resist or escape.\u201d <em>(Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U. S. 294, 299.) \u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation \u201d, the court declared in the <em>Say den </em>case, \u201c if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others. Speed here was essential \u201d (387 U. S., at pp. 298-299). It was just as essential in the present case, despite the passage of some hours since the shootings had occurred. Those hours were undoubtedly spent in interviewing DiG-eorge and Mrs. DiLapi, in checking on the car, learning the defendant\u2019s identity, ascertaining the location of the house he owned and where he was likely to go. It was certainly not unreasonable for the police to believe that he would conceal himself, as he actually did, in the house which he owned and in whose vicinity he had last been seen. The circumstances demanded that they act quickly. He had fatally wounded two persons, had threatened the life of a third and was known to be armed. Proper police procedures, as well as elementary considerations of prudence, required the officers to enter and search the house for him in order to prevent his escaping and endangering the lives of others. Accordingly, no constitutional rights of the defendant were violated by the warrantless entry, search and arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>The Death Sentence as Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Section 125.30 of the Penal Law provides that a defendant shall be sentenced to death following a jury verdict convicting him of murder if, after a further \u201c proceeding \u201d, the jury unanimously agrees \u201con the imposition of the penalty of death\u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.35) and the court is \u201c satisfied\u201d that the \u201c victim of the crime was a peace officer who was killed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>course of performing Ms official duties \u201d (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.30, subd. 1, par. [a], cl. [i]). Following the presentation of evidence at the <em>\u201c </em>penalty trial \u201d and the court\u2019s charge to the jury, that body retires <em>\u201cto </em>consider the penalty to be imposed\u201d. And, continues subdivision 5 of section 125.35,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\"><em>\u201c </em>If the jury report unanimous agreement on the imposition of the penalty of death, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death. If the jury report unanimous agreement on the imposition of the sentence of imprisonment, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose such sentence. If, after the lapse of such time as the court deems reasonable, the jury report themselves unable to agree, the court shall discharge the jury and shall, ih its discretion, either impanel a new jury to determine the sentence or impose the sentence of imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As a reading of that provision makes clear, whether the death sentence is to be imposed rests in the discretion of the jury, and, as already indicated, we must say whether <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(408 U. S. 238, supra) requires a decision that that penalty constitutes \u201c cruel and unusual punishment \u201d under the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The defendants in the three separate cases dealt with in <em>Furman, </em>were sentenced to death, following trials by juries, one for murder and two for rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In each instance, the state legislature left the determination whether the penalty should be death or some lighter punishment to the discretion of the judge or the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Of the members of the court comprising the majority in <em>Furman, </em>only two\u2014 Mr. Justice Brennan (408 U. S., at pp. 257-306) and Mr. Justice Marshall (pp. 314-371)\u2014concluded that the infliction of the death penalty constitutes ' \u2018 cruel and unusual punishment \u201d and that, consequently, the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punishment for all crimes and under all circumstances. The other three justices, who concurred in the court\u2019s judgments of reversal, found it unnecessary to reach that <em>\u201c </em>ultimate question \u201d (per Stewart, J., p. 306). Instead, point<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ing out that in each of the cases before the court, the legislature had not itself mandated the death penalty, they held impermissible the practice of committing to the untrammeled discretion of a jury the power to pronounce life or death. (See, e.g., Note, The Supreme Court, 1971 Term, 86 Harv. L. Rev., at p. 76 <em>et seq.) </em>Note, 47 St. John\u2019s L. Rev. 107.) Mr. Justice Douglas condemned \u2018\u00a3 a system of law and of justice that leaves to the uncontrolled discretion of judges or juries the determination whether defendants \u25a0 * * * should die or be imprisoned. Under these laws no standards govern the selection of the penalty. People live or die, dependent on the whim of one man or of 12 \u201d (408 U. S., at p. 253). Thus, concluded Justice Douglas, \u201c these discretionary statutes are unconstitutional in their operation. They are pregnant with discrimination and discrimination is an ingredient not compatible with the idea of equal protection of the laws that is implicit in the ban on \u2018cruel and unusual\u2019 punishments\u201d (pp. 256-257). Mr. Justice Stewabt was also of the view that the sentencing practices provided by the statutes in question\u2014vesting juries or judges with discretion to determine whether the penalty should be death or life imprisonment\u2014offend against the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment. \u201c [T]he death sentences now before us \u201d, wrote Justice Stewabt (pp. 309-310), \u201c are the product of a legal system that brings them * * * within the very core of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishments, a guarantee applicable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em>370 U. S. 660. In the first place, it is clear that these sentences are \u2018 cruel \u2019 in the sense that they excessively go beyond, not in degree but in kind, the punishments that the state legislatures have determined to be necessary. <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 U. S. 349. * * * I simply conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed.\u201d And Mr. Justice White \u2014 addressing himself to the question whether capital punishment statutes are unconstitutional when \u2018 \u2018 the legislature does not itself mandate the penalty in any particular class or kind of case (that is, legislative will is not frustrated if the penalty is never imposed), but delegates to judges or juries the decisions as to those cases, if- any, in which the penalty will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>utilized \u2019 \u2019 (p. 311)\u2014reached the conclusion that \u201c the death penalty is exacted with great infrequency even for the most atrocious crimes and that there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed from the many cases in which it is not\u201d (p. 313). In short, added Justice White, \u2018 ' past and present legislative judgment with respect to the death penalty loses much of its force when viewed in light of the recurring practice of delegating sentencing authority to the jury and the fact that a jury, in its own discretion and without violating its trust or any statutory policy, may refuse to impose the death penalty no matter what the circumstances of the crime. Legislative ' policy \u2019 is thus necessarily defined not by what is legislatively authorized but by what juries and judges do in exercising the discretion so regularly conferred upon them. In my judgment what was done in these cases violated the Eighth Amendment \u201d (p. 314).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Since, then, the New York statute here challenged (Penal Law, \u00a7 125.35, subd. 5) leaves infliction of the death penalty solely to the discretion of the jury, we conclude, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of the Eighth Amendment in <em>Furman </em>(408 U. S. 238, <em>supra), </em>that we have no alternative hut to hold that that penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the sense of that provision. The circumstance that the penalty is limited to those found guilty of killing police and other peace officers is irrelevant; it does not alter or affect the fact that the Legislature, instead of providing mandatory death sentences for all defendants who kill police officers, has vested juries with a discretion to decide, case by case, whether that ultimate punishment should be inflicted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The judgment appealed from should be modified by vacating the sentence of death and remitting the case to the Oneida County Court for resentencing, and, as so modified, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\">. The three cases \u2014 entitled, in the Supreme Court, <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, Jackson </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>and <em>Branch </em>v. Texas\u2014may be found, respectively, in the Reports of those jurisdictions in 225 Ga. 253, 225 Ga. 790 and 447 S. W. 2d 932.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. In sharp contrast, Chief Justice Burger, in the course of his dissenting opinion, stated, in effect, that, if constitutionality turned on whether the legislature provided mandatory death sentences \u201cin such a way as to deny juries the opportunity to bring in a verdict on a lesser charge * * \u201c I would have preferred that the Court opt for total abolition\u201d (408 U. S., at p. 401). \u201cI could more easily be persuaded \u201d, continued the Chief Justice (pp. 402-403), \u201cthat mandatory sentences of death, without the intervening and ameliorating impact of lay jurors, are so arbitrary and doctrinaire that they violate the Constitution * *' * I had thought that nothing was clearer in history, as we noted in <em>McGaufha </em>[v. <em>California, </em>402 U. S. 183] one year ago, than the American abhorrence of 'the common-law rule imposing a mandatory death sentence on all convicted murderers.\u2019 402 U. S., at 198. \u00b0 * * If anywhere in the whole spectrum of criminal justice fresh ideas deserve sober analysis, the sentencing and correctional area ranks high on the list. But it has been widely accepted that mandatory sentences for crimes do not best serve the ends of the criminal justice system. Now, after the long process of drawing away from the blind imposition of uniform sentences for every person convicted of a particular offense, we are confronted with an argument perhaps implying that only the legislatures may determine that a sentence of death is appropriate, without the intervening evaluation of jurors or judges.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">. In this view, we find it unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s additional contentions relating (1) to the exclusion from the jury of jurors opposed to capital punishment and (2) to the denial of his application for an adjournment of the penalty trial pending his psychiatric examination and the preparation of evidence to support his plea for a sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b545-6\">Wachtler, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"ARz\">I agree with the result and most of the reasoning adopted by the majority; however, there are two parts of the decision which trouble me.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Initially I do not feel it would be wise for this court to adopt the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrine. I can accept, with some reluctance, a policy of allowing evidence to be obtained without a warrant where the operation of law would have made its future discovery inevitable. Both <em>Wayne </em>v. <em>United States </em>(318 F. 2d 205, cert. den. 375 U. S. 860) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Soto </em>(55 Misc 2d 219), cited in the decision, can be rationalized on that ground. However, allowing <em>\u201c </em>poisoned \u201d evidence in on the ground that some hypothetical police search would have uncovered the evidence anyway results in a speculative theory with no discernable limits. Here there was no \u201c independent source \u201d for the police search. (See <em>Silverthorne Lbr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, 392.) It is not \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the police would not have searched the closet. In point of fact, they did not search the closet until told by defendant that the gun was there. It is not at all obvious that the gun would be found near where defendant was hiding. Defendant had left the scene of the crime several hours prior to his apprehension. Most defendants hide, destroy, or dump the ihcriminating weapon as soon after the crime as possible. In fact, few defendants are arrested in pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>session of the murder weapon several hours after the commas'sion of the crime. The \u2018\u00a3 inevitable discovery \u2019 \u2019 doctrine is speculative at best, and there is absolutely nothing to prevent the expansion of the doctrine far beyond \u00a3\u00a3 the closet \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The decision states that the scope of the doctrine is coextensive with what \u201cthe normal course of police investigation \u201d would have inevitably turned up. \u201c The normal course of police investigation \u2019 \u2019 differs greatly from one police department to another and even within departments, so theoretically at least the constitutional standard would differ from locale to locale.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In addition, defining what \u201c the normal course of police investigation <em>\u201d </em>would <em>inevitably </em>have turned up could prove most difficult. In this case, the decision states that unless the gun was thrown away <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Once it was not found upon him, the next most reasonable place to look for it was where he had been just before he was seized Does that mean this doctrine is limited to \u201c the next most reasonable place \u201d and excludes the second next most reasonable place? And who can produce a priority list of \u201c reasonable \u201d places to use as a standard in these types of cases <em>% </em>And what does \u201c where he has been seized \u201d mean? Is it limited to the closet or does it include the house? And if the defendant is apprehended outside the house, how will it be possible to give any consistent definition to the term \u201c where he has been seized \u201d? I am afraid these are not questions that can ever be worked out with any consistency on a case by case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Even if we could be fairly certain that a subsequent police search would turn up the evidence, we could not be certain that the search would have been conducted in a constitutional manner. In the ease at bar, it was at least arguable that the warrantless search of the house was unconstitutional. The question arises if the \u00a3 \u00a3 inevitable discovery \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>doctrine would expunge the taint from an unconstitutional and warrantless search if the People could convince a Judge that regular police procedure would have produced a warrant independent of the illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">As I stated' in my dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brosman, </em>32 N Y 2d 254, I think that the <em>application </em>of standards is so inherently difficult in search and seizure cases (really in the entire criminal area) that we must be certain that the standard at least is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>and unambiguous. I think both for the sake of certainty and the integrity of our State and Federal Constitutions we should follow an objective test in situations such as these. If the police did in fact discover the evidence as the result of an unconstitutional action, the evidence should be suppressed. The \u201c inevitable discovery \u201d doctrine is so ambiguous and so subject to abuse that I think it is unwise to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Equally bothersome to me is the majority\u2019s interpretation of <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(395 U. S. 752). Their decision implicitly adopts the caveat in <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(26 N Y 2d 558, 563) that \u201cit is not at all clear that the \u2018 grabbing distance \u2019 authorized in the <em>Chimel </em>case is conditioned upon the arrested person\u2019s continued capacity <em>\u2018 </em>to grab \u2019 \u201d. I do not believe that the <em>Chimel </em>rationale would uphold a search of a \u201c grabbing area \u201d after the defendant can no longer grab. Contrary to the assertion in the decision, the <em>Chimel </em>court never approved a search of the area where the \u201carrest occurs\u201d. The Supreme Court only approved a search where there is a danger to the officer or there is a possibility the evidence will be concealed or destroyed. (395 U. S. 752, 763, <em>supra.) </em>Later the court emphasized that the police may search the area \u201c from which the person arrested <em>might </em>obtain weapons or evidentiary items \u201d. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 766; emphasis added.) The court did not say and clearly did not mean the police could search where an arrested man <em>might have </em>obtained weapons or evidentiary items. The court specifically held that a search of constitutionally protected areas could not even be conducted in the room where the \u201c arrest occurs \u201d if those areas are not within reach of the arrested man. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The grabbing area delineation only makes sense if it is supported by a rationale resting on danger to the police or evidence destruction. If a search could be conducted after the apprehended person can no longer reach any evidence or weapon, the definition of the allowable search area as, in effect, the \u201c grabbing area \u2019\u2019becomes completely arbitrary and without any underlying justification. If the <em>Chimel </em>case is to be overruled or limited, it is the place of the Supreme Court and not. our court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">I agree that there were exigent circumstances which justified the police entering the house without a warrant. Had the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>been in open sight, it could have been seized because once the defendant gave the police a justification for entering the house he no longer had a legitimate expectation of privacy and thus no constitutional protection from apparent evidence in the area the police had legitimately entered. However, in the case at bar, the gun was in a bag hidden from open view. The decision notes there was no <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>\u2018 </em>rummaging at will \u2019 \u2019 but that was only because the unconstitutionally obtained confession allowed the police to know exactly where the gun was hidden. The hypothetical police search envisioned by the report under the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>inevitable discovery\u201d doctrine would have <em>\u201c </em>inevitably \u201d led to a great deal of \u201c rummaging around \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">I might add that I am not at all certain that the majority had to reach the search and seizure question in its decision after having adopted the <em>\u201c </em>inevitable discovery \u201d doctrine. If \u201c the normal course of police investigation \u201d would have turned up the gun, why not also assume that the hypothetical search was conducted pursuant to a hypothetical search warrant? It is certainly \u2018 \u2018 the normal course of police investigation \u2019 \u2019 to obtain a warrant where one is required. Of course, we are well aware that police, in completely good faith, often fail to obtain warrants even in situations obviously calling for warrants just as they often fail to search areas which, with the aid of hindsight,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> seem to have been obvious places to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In conclusion then, although I believe that the receipt of the gun in evidence constituted error, it should be considered harmless in light of the overwhelming proof establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt of the homicides. Accordingly, I concur in the court\u2019s decision that the judgment of conviction be modified and the case remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Judges Burke, Breitel, Jasen and Gabrielli concur with Chief Judge Fuld; Judge Wachtler concurs in a separate opinion in which Judge Jones concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Judgment modified and case remitted to Oneida County Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> I am also afraid that the \u201c inevitable discovery \u201d doctrine cannot help but become <em>sub silentio </em>a result-oriented theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
