Upon leaving the building, the officer observed the defendant carrying a crowbar and an automobile battery, the cables of which appeared torn. The patrolman then stopped the defendant and asked whether he owned the battery, to which he replied, <em>\u201c </em>Yes \u201d. The defendant was then asked whether he owned the crowbar, to which he again answered, <em>\u201c </em>Yes \u201d. The officer then arrested the defendant purportedly for the possession of a burglar\u2019s tool and the possession of stolen property. In searching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the defendant incident to the arrest, the officer found one hypodermic needle, one syringe, one bottle cap, and an unspecified quantity of a drug suspected to be heroin. The defendant was subsequently charged with criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the sixth degree (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.05) and criminally possessing a hypodermic instrument (Penal Law, \u00a7 220.45). No charges were filed with respect to possession of the crowbar or the battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The Criminal Court of the City of New York granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the heroin and the narcotics paraphernalia. The Appellate Term reversed, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant, that the search incident was legal, and that the contraband thereafter seized was admissible into evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We reverse, for defendant\u2019s actions, although not inconsistent with culpable possession of a burglar\u2019s tool and stolen property, are also susceptible of many innocent interpretations. His behavior, at most equivocal and suspicious, was unsupplemented by any additional behavior or circumstances raising <em>\u201c </em>the level of inference from suspicion to probable cause \u201d. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Corrado, </em>22 N Y 2d 308, 311, 313.) For example, the defendant\u2019s answers to the officer\u2019s questions were not evasive or unresponsive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rosemond, </em>26 N Y 2d 101, 102-103, 105; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>16 N Y 2d 186, 189.) Indeed, it appears he was afforded very little opportunity, if any, to explain where he acquired the suspect items. Then, too, there was no flight at the approach of the officer (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>16 N Y 2d 270). Nor was there any report of a car breakin nor any indication that this was a high crime area. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>30 N Y 2d 774, 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In sum, the officer\u2019s bare suspicion of criminal activity was sufficient for an investigatory stop. His observations and his inquiry were, however, insufficient to raise that suspicion to the requisite standard of probable cause <em>(Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 175-176), without which the arrest and the incidental- search must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Bxjrke, Breitel, G-abrielli. Jones and Wachtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
