While that motion was pending, the district attorney offered to allow him to plead to robbery in the third degree (a class D felony; new Penal Law, \u00a7 160.05), but only on condition that his acceptance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>take place before his motion was decided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Complying with that condition, the defendant entered his plea to the lower crime. On this appeal, two questions are presented for our determination: (1) was the defendant deprived of his right to a speedy trial and (2) was his \u201c waiver \u201d of that right accomplished by coercion or duress. Both questions should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On July 22,1967, a robbery was committed in a Yonkers supermarket. On August 30, 1967, a felony information was filed in the Yonkers Court of Special Sessions, charging the defendant and two others with the robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At about the same time the defendant, incarcerated in the Queens County House of Detention on other charges, was orally advised of such detainer; he never appeared in the Yonkers court. According to the district attorney, the Yonkers warrant was not lodged at the Queens jail until February 10, 1968. At all events, the defendant, while serving a prison term for other crimes, was indicted for the Yonkers holdup \u2014 on a charge of robbery in the first degree \u2014 on December 23, 1970. He was not brought to the Westchester County Court for arraignment until November 15, 1971. Counsel was assigned to represent the defendant and, on November 29, he brought an article 78 proceeding to dismiss the indictment for failure to afford his client a speedy trial. Defense counsel states that, although the Supreme Court justice, before whom the matter came, decided the petition \u00a3 \u00a3 on the merits \u2019 \u2019 against the defendant, he gave him no order from which he could appeal. On December 4, he was advised by the district attorney that the defendant would be brought to trial on December 15, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">On December 7, the defendant moved, by motion returnable December 17, in the Westchester County Court to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the indictment on the ground that, by virtue of a delay of 51 months \u2014 the period between August, 1967 and November, 1971 \u2014 he had been denied his constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial. On December 14, three days before the return day of the defendant\u2019s motion, the district attorney, in an affidavit in opposition, asserted that, since the indictment, which he described as the only \u2018 \u2018 proper accusatory instrument \u2019 \u2019, was filed only 11 months before, there was no undue delay in the trial. He further declared that any lag resulted from the prosecution\u2019s practice of treating \u201cjail\u201d and \u201cbail\u201d cases alike for \u201c purposes of trial priority \u201d and that the case was being reached for trial \u2018 \u2018 in the normal course of events.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">On the same date, December 14, upon the district attorney\u2019s application, the court agreed to mark the case ready for the following morning subject to its decision on the motion for a speedy trial. On the next day, however, the defendant changed his plea of not guilty to guilty to the reduced charge of robbery in the third degree. He admitted his guilt and, upon the prosecutor\u2019s insistence, agreed to withdraw all previously made motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">At the sentencing on January 20,1972, the defendant\u2019s lawyer, after relating the facts described above, declared that the assistant district attorney, on December 14, had informed him that there was no decision on the speedy trial motion and that, \u201c if we didn\u2019t take the deal now before that motion was decided * * * and if we didn\u2019t withdraw our motions, there would be no deal \u2019 \u2019, and the defendant \u2018 \u2018 would be forced * * * to go to trial some fifty-one (51) months after the crime allegedly occurred\u201d. The trial judge, stating that the motions \u201cwere withdrawn \u2019 \u2019, proceeded to pass sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">On appeal, the Appellate Division, one justice dissenting, affirmed on the ground that \u201c any right which defendant may have had with respect to a dismissal of the indictment on account of delay was expressly waived by him \u201d (40 A D 2d 540). In the view of the dissenting judge, \u2018 \u2018 the delay of over 51 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>between the filing of the felony information in the Yonkers City Court in August, 1967 and the return of [defendant] to the Westchester County Court for trial in November, 1971 was unreasonable as a matter of law and no good cause for the delay was established \u201d; he added that, although the right to a speedy trial could be waived if assent were freely and knowingly given, it appeared to him that the defendant \u2018 \u2018 was coerced into doing so by an unlawful exaction and by duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\n<em>Right to a Speedy Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">A defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial, guaranteed both by Constitution (U. S. Const., 6th and 14th Amdts.; see <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>398 U. S. 30, 37-38; <em>Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U. S. 374, 383; <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U. S. 213, 226) and by statute (CPL 30.20; Civil Rights Law, \u00a7 12), is violated if there is an excessive delay between institution of the prosecution\u2014whether by felony information or complaint, detainer warrant or indictment\u2014 and the trial. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U. S. 307, 320; <em>People </em>v. <em>Minicone, </em>28 N Y 2d 279, 281; <em>People </em>v. <em>Winfrey, </em>20 N Y 2d 138, 143-144; <em>People </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>309 N. Y. 353, 361.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Winfrey </em>(20 N Y 2d 138, <em>supra) </em>is, on this score, virtually identical with the present case. There the defendant was charged with the crime of forgery committed on or about April 8, 1958, and an information was sworn to in the District Court of Nassau County some three weeks later. In July of 1958, a detainer warrant was lodged with officials of an Alabama State prison where he was incarcerated on an unrelated matter. No effort was made to obtain his return to New York, and he was not indicted on the forgery charge until January of 1963. Brought back to this State in October of that year, he moved, in January, 1964, to dismiss the indictment for \u201c lack of prosecution \u201d (20 N Y 2d, at p. 139). In reversing the Appellate Division and upholding the trial judge\u2019s grant of the motion, this court, in an opinion by Judge Bbeitel, declared (pp. 143-144): \u201c From a constitutional aspect, it appears that the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and a half years\u2019 delay in prosecuting defendant prior to his indictment, but after the initiation of criminal proceedings, deprived him of due process of law. Prior to the <em>Klopfer </em>decision <em>([Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386 U. S. 213] <em>supra) </em>it was established that a State denies a defendant due process of law if it unreasonably delays his prosecution, after the initiation of criminal proceedings * * * It may be that this doctrine has now been incorporated in the <em>\u2018 </em>speedy trial \u2019 guarantee of the Sixth Amendment pursuant to the <em>Klopfer </em>rule; but it is only of limited analytical importance whether the right is one of a <em>\u2018 </em>speedy trial \u2019 or of \u2018 due process of law \u2019. In either event, this delay of four and a half years * * * is unreasonable, since no effort was made to secure defendant\u2019s release or transfer.\u201d It is for the prosecution, the court continued, to establish a reasonable basis for postponing the trial (20 N Y 2d, at p. 144):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201c Moreover, there is staleness in a nine-year-old charge of crime with all the consequences of difficulties of proof from the side of the defendant as well as the prosecution. To be sure, the People have the untrammeled power to institute a prosecution any time within the limitations period\u2014at least five years in the case of this felony\u2014but <em>once having instituted the prosecution by detainer warrant, indictment or other initiatory process, they have the obligation of advancing it unless there is a reasonable ground for delay.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Only the fact that the defendant in the <em>Winfrey </em>case was in an out-of-state prison distinguishes that case from the one now before us. On this appeal, the People do not even attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to excuse the four-year delay by claiming that they were unable to locate him. Having discovered him in the Queens jail where the warrant was lodged, the Westchester authorities had only to make a simple inquiry of the court in Queens County to ascertain his subsequent location and bring him to trial. Accordingly, there can be no question but that the defendant was denied the right to be speedily tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\n<em>Waiver and Plea</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">A defendant may, of course, waive his right to a speedy trial (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Dwight S., </em>29 N Y 2d 172, 175; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chirieleison, </em>3 N Y 2d 170, 173; <em>Becker </em>v. <em>State of Nebraska, </em>435 F. 2d 157, 158, cert. den. 402 U. S. 981), but the waiver of a constitutional right, like any other, must be both <em>1 </em>\u2018 knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U. S. 514, 529; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mulligan, </em>24 N Y 2d 948, 949; cf. <em>Matter of Lawrence S., </em>29 N Y 2d 206, 209; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 464-465; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marcello, </em>423 F. 2d 993, 1004-1005, cert. den. 398 U. S. 959.) Nor may his guilty plea be coerced, either by actual physical compulsion, threats and the like or <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>by the duress of circumstances.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>30 N Y 2d 315, 317; see, also, <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>404 U. S. 257, 261; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>390 U. S. 570, 581-583; Alschuler, Plea Bargaining, 36 U. Chic. L. Rev. 50, 85 <em>et </em>seq.; cf. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U. S. 25, 31; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U. S. 742, 748; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>397 U. S. 790, 801-802 [per Brennan J., concurring in result in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United </em>States]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>27 N Y 2d 601, 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In the case before us, the element of coercion present not only in the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to a speedy trial but also in his plea of guilt to a lesser crime renders each defective and illegal. This is not a situation where the viability df a defendant\u2019s claim of deprivation of a right to a speedy trial \u201cwas mistakenly assessed \u2019 \u2019 or- where he was \u2018 \u2018 erroneously advised \u2019 \u2019 by counsel. <em>(McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U. S. 759, 769.) Nor is it one where he had \u2018 \u2018 full opportunity to assess the advantages and disadvantages of a trial as compared with those attending a plea of guilty [with] no hazard of an impulsive arid improvident response to a seeming but unreal advantage.\u201d <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U. S. 742, 754, <em>supra.) </em>Rather, it is a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>where the defendant had no time to apprehend the \u2018\u2018 relevant circumstances and likely consequences \u201d of his waiver. <em>(Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U. S. 742, 748, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Matter of Lawrence S., </em>29 N Y 2d 206, 208, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The defendant, having been returned to West\u00f3hester County Court for arraignment on November 15, 1971, and having been assigned counsel, pleaded not guilty and was given 30 days in which to file motions. His speedy trial motion \u2014 after the delay in asserting this claim, caused by the abortive article 78 proceeding\u2014was returnable December 17, only two days after his case was set for trial. In addition to pushing forward the trial proceedings one day to December 14, the prosecutor at that point presented defense counsel with the offer of a lesser plea, contingent, however, upon immediate acceptance. Particularly highhanded was his limitation that the defendant\u2019s decision be given before the outcome of the speedy trial motion or the <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 deal was off and this, after the trial judge had moved up the return date of the motion to December 15, the original date set for trial as well as the 30-day adjournment date.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The use of plea bargaining presupposes, in the words of the Supreme Court in <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York </em>(404 U. S. 257, 261, <em>supra), </em>\u201cfairness in securing agreement between an accused and a prosecutor.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s conduct might not, perhaps, have been so unfair had the circumstances be\u00f3n altered: had the defendant\u2019s rights not been so egregiously violated and had he \u2014 and his counsel\u2014been given ample opportunity to weigh the relative merits of the plea offered against the hazards of a trial. However, the district attorney\u2019s maneuvering may only be characterized as unfair and over-reaching. Even after taking into consideration the inescapable element of coerciveness inherent in all plea bargaining, it must be concluded that the defendant\u2019s plea was arrived at as a result of \u201c undue pressure \u201d. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>27 N Y 2d 601, 604, <em>supra.) </em>In the words of Judge Breitel in the <em>Flowers </em>case (30 N Y 2d 315, 319, <em>supra), </em>the \u201c State is not so short of grist for its criminal mill that it must absorb convictions obtained in the * * * circumstances present here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Since the defendant was, as a matter of law, clearly denied a right to a speedy trial (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>26 N Y 2d 371, 374; <em>People </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>40 A D 2d 563 <em>[supra, </em>p. 395, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>n. 2]), he is entitled to reversal of his conviction and dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the indictment dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Judges Burke, Breitel, Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. The defendant was asked both to \u201c withdraw all previously made motions \u201d and \u201cto waive his right to appeal\u201d. The trial judge did not approve this second waiver and advised the defendant of his right of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\">. One codefendant \u2014 Robert Simmons-\u2014was tried separately, convicted and appealed. The Appellate Division reversed his conviction and dismissed the indictment, declaring that the \u201c delay of almost four years between August, 1967, when felony informations were filed in the [Yonkers court] apd July, 1971, when appellant was returned from Clinton Prison * * * for trial, was unreasonable as a matter of law and no good cause for delay was established\u201d. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>40 A D 2d 563.) The other codefendant apparently pled guilty to a reduced charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">. The district attorney also claimed that the defendant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and not discovered until the defendant was \u201cultimately traced\u201d to Greenhaven Prison where he was incarcerated for other crimes. The Yonkers authorities, however, had been advised, at least by February 20, 1968, that the defendant was then in the Queens House of Detention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. A defendant \u2014 at least while without counsel \u2014 does not have the burden of seeing to it that he is speedily brought to trial. \u201c [T]he mere failure of the defendant to take affirmative action to prevent delay may not, without more, be construed or treated as a waiver.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>309 N. Y. 353, 358, supra; <em>cf. Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U. S. 514, 528.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. In the ease before us, it is of little moment whether initiation of the prosecution be deemed to have begun when the information was sworn\u2014in August, 1967, one month after commission of the crime \u2014 or February 10, 1968, when the detainer warrant was lodged with the Queens House of Detention. The lapse of just over four years rather than four and a half years before the December, 1971,- trial proceedings, still involves an indisputably excessive delay. In any event, under the new Criminal Procedure Law, there can no longer be any doubt\u2014if ever there was \u2014 that the \u201c filing of the felony complaint in the lower court * * * commences the action \u201d (Denzer, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 11A, CPL, p. 364: see, also, CPL 1.20, subd. 17; 100.05).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
