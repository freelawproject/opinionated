Corp.], </em>19 N Y 2d 1.) This appeal, here by our leave, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>calls upon us to decide whether the same result follows where employees engage in a strike or work stoppage which has been declared \u201cunlawful\u201d by statute (Labor Law, \u00a7 713). In our view, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The facts are quickly told. The employer, appellant Presbyterian Hospital, is a voluntary non-profitmaking hospital. The claimant-respondent, Felix Rodriguez, was employed as. a worker in the hospital\u2019s food service department for some five months. About 12 o\u2019clock on January 9, 1971, when the noonday meal was being prepared and served to hospital patients, the claimant and other workers on duty in the hospital\u2019s main kitchen participated in a mass work stoppage to protest the disciplinary action taken against two other employees. Although most of the workers returned to their jobs shortly after the stoppage began, Rodriguez and more than 20 others continued to refuse to work. Rodriguez also refused, despite orders from hospital officials, to leave the premises and, indeed, he did not depart until approximately 7:00 p.m. The hospital thereupon discharged him and a number of other participants in the work stoppage.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Rodriguez filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits and was found eligible. The hospital objected and, on its application, a hearing was conducted before a referee. Although he found that the claimant engaged in \u201c a mass work stoppage \u201d, he concluded that it \u2018 \u2018 must be considered an industrial controversy accordingly, he overruled the employer\u2019s objection and held that the claimant was entitled to unemployment benefits. The Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed that decision\u2014citing the <em>Heitzenrater </em>case (19 N Y 2d 1, supra)\u2014the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed the board\u2019s determination (39 A D 2d 1015) and, as noted, the appeal is before us by our permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">It has long been the policy of the courts of this State to prohibit and enjoin concerted activities such as strikes, work stoppages and picketing directed against non-profitmaking hospitals. (See, e.g., <em>Jewish Hosp. of Brooklyn </em>v. \u201c <em>John </em>Doe\", 252 App. Div. 581; <em>Beth-El Hosp. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>34 Misc 2d 1045; <em>Society of N. Y. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>185 Misc. 937.) Recognizing this long-standing policy, the Legislature, when it enlarged the coverage of the New York State Labor Relations Act in 1963 to include employees of non-profitmaking hospitals and residen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tial care centers (L. 1963, ch. 515, \u00a7 4, amdg. Labor Law, \u00a7 715, s\u00fcbd. [3]), it also amended section 713 of that statute (Labor Law, \u00a7 713) to expressly confirm the prohibition against all forms of strikes and work stoppages at such hospitals (L. 1963, ch. 515, \u00a7 3). After reciting that <em>\u201c </em>[n] othing in this article shall be construed * * * to interfere with, impede or diminish in any way the right of employees to strike or engage in other lawful, concerted activities,\u201d section 713, as amended, goes on to provide, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\"><em>\u201c </em>it shall continue to be unlawful for the employees of a non-profitmaking hospital or residential care center, or their representatives, or any other persons to engage in or to induce or encourage, or to attempt to engage in or to induce or encourage any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of goods or services by such employees or other persons at such hospital or residential care center \u2019 \u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The primary purpose of the court-developed policy thus codified was to protect the public, and particularly hospital patients, from the potentially disastrous consequences of such activity. It is noteworthy that the Legislature did not merely prohibit work stoppages; it also established alternative peaceful methods for resolving those disputes\u2014for instance, by compulsory arbitration (Labor Law, \u00a7 716; see, also, Labor Law, \u00a7\u00a7 703-706) \u2014 and, by so doing, removed the only justification for the conduct proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Since the claimant participated in a work stopage which was expressly and absolutely prohibited by section 713, it follows that \u2014 in contradistinction to the situation in the <em>Heitzenrater </em>case (19 N Y 2d 1, <em>supra) </em>\u2014he engaged in legislatively defined \u2018 \u2018 misconduct in connection with his employment \u2019 \u2019 (Labor Law, \u00a7 593, subd. 3). In <em>Heitsenrater, </em>we decided that mere participation in a strike in violation of a no-strike clause in a private collective bargaining agreement did not constitute such \u201cmisconduct \u201d, within the sense of section 593 as to deprive employees of unemployment insurance benefits, primarily because, to hold otherwise, would have required those administering the Unemployment Insurance Law\u2014the Division of Employment \u2014 to resolve complicated issues of labor relations properly reserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>to other agencies. Thus, in the course of our opinion in that case (19 N Y 2d, at p. 7), we declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Actually, \u2018 fault \u2019 or \u2018 misconduct \u2019 is not a meaningful concept to apply to a work stoppage which results when the parties, in negotiating a collective bargaining agreement, cannot reach an understanding as to wages, hours or working conditions. If there by any * fault \u2019, it is often attributable to both parties. Furthermore, even in those disputes which are precipitated by the apparent breach of an existing agreement, the determination of fault or misconduct involves questions of labor relations that are frequently complicated and recondite. It would have been decidedly unwise to vest in officials of a social welfare agency\u2014like those administering the Unemployment Insurance Law\u2014the power to decide such matters. They are best left to agencies especially qualified to deal with them \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In cases such as the one before us, however, the absolute nature of the prohibition insures that no \u2018 \u2018 complicated \u201d or \u201c recondite <em>\u201d </em>questions of labor relations law can arise. The simple fact is that the Legislature itself resolved all such issues by explicitly proscribing and expressly stamping as unlawful strikes and work stoppages by employees of non-profitmaking hospitals or, for that matter, by public employees (Civil Service Law [Taylor Law], \u00a7 210, subd. 1). It would constitute a strange rule of statutory construction to hold that one provision of the Labor Law should be interpreted to require payment of benefits to an individual who has been discharged for engaging in conduct in indisputable violation of another, and later enacted, provision of that same statute. (See, e.g., <em>East End Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Otten, </em>255 N. Y. 283, 286-287; <em>Gwynne </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>259 N. Y. 191, 197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The fact and legal issues in this case are clear and uncomplicated, and the statutory scheme, far from requiring a policy of \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>governmental neutrality \u2019 \u2019 between contending private parties <em>(Matter of Heitzenrater [Hooker Chem. Corp.], </em>19 N Y 2d 1,7, <em>supra) Matter of Ferrara [Catherwood], </em>10 N Y 2d 1, 8), commits the State to an active role in prohibiting a threatened injury to the public interest when the conduct engaged in has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>been expressly declared \u2018 \u2018 unlawful \u2019 \u2019 by the Legislature. A basic public policy of the State\u2014the prevention of disruption of essential services\u2014would be defeated and violated were we here to sanction the payment of unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The order appealed from should be reversed, without costs, the determination of the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board in favor of the claimant annulled and the employer\u2019s objection to the claimant\u2019s eligibility for unemployment benefits sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Judges Burke, Bbeitel, Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Waohtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
