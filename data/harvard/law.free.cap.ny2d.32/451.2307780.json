No constitutional mandates were violated by the arresting officer, either at the earlier time when appellant\u2019s person was searched and contraband discovered, or later, when entry was made into the motor vehicle within which additional contraband \u25a0 was found. Violation of section 422 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law justified the search of appellant\u2019s person and the seizure of the contraband which such search disclosed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>29 N Y 2d 324; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>26 N Y 2d 547; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>28 N Y 2d 94; <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.

The later search of appellant\u2019s car was also lawful since it was predicated, not only upon the altered VIN, but also upon the marijuana found on appellant\u2019s person. <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U.

In making a routine inquiry, the patrolman requested defendant to produce his operator\u2019s license and registration. The vehicle identification number on the registration coincided with the identification number on the vehicle but a further check with the National Auto Check Book revealed that the number did not call for the vehicle in question, whereupon the officer arrested defendant \u201c on the charge of altered identification number \u201d and, without further inquiry, immediately conducted a search of the defendant\u2019s person. The nature and extent of the search is best described by the officer\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. When you placed the defendant under arrest, tell us how you searched him? # # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Q. Officer, did you frisk him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cA. I placed the defendant\u2019s two hands on the roof of the radio car and I went through his person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Q. So it\u2019s more than just a frisk. You actually went into his pockets?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\"><em>\u201c </em>A. I searched him, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">This search disclosed marijuana in his coat pocket; and a search of the car, conducted immediately thereafter, disclosed additional marijuana, a scale and a quantity of manila envelopes. The defendant was thereafter arraigned on charges of possession of the marijuana and possession of a motor vehicle with an altered identification number.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">We are called upon to consider the validity of a warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s person, followed by a search of his vehicle, incident to his arrest for a violation of section 422 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which, in pertinent part provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>that 1 <em>\u2018 </em>any person having possession for more than thirty days of a motor vehicle * * # the identification number of which has been destroyed, removed, [or] defaced * * * without having made application to the commissioner for permission to make or stamp on new number * * * shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and punishable by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than fifty dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment guarantee against illegal searches is reasonableness <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, 19-20; <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 63; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, 471 </em>F. 2d 1082, 1091, 1097) and, in assessing the test of reasonableness, our courts, as well as those of our sister States <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>have refused to establish a uniform rule to govern all searches accompanying valid arrests, but rather have examined the nature of the offense and the surrounding circumstances to determine whether the search was warranted \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>19 111. 2d [11], <em>supra </em>at p. 18) \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>20 NT 2d 98,103).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Initially, it should be carefully noted that it is not, and indeed could not be, contended that the search of the defendant was a mere frisk, or that the officer was in jeopardy, or that the contraband seized was in plain view, or, in fact, that there were any suspicious movements (cf. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U. S. 1, <em>supra-, Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U. S. 40; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 234; <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>451 F. 2d 230; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>289 F. Supp. 364). The prosecution based its sole authority and claim to conduct the search on the initial traffic arrest and, in fact, stipulated at the suppression hearing that \u201c the basis of any search or seizure in this case was the fact that the defendant was placed under arrest for the 422 violation \u201d and, more importantly, it was further conceded that \u2018 \u2018 the officer, for the purposes of this motion, did not have probable cause independent of that violation \u2019 \\</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">A search may not of course be exploratory in nature but must be specific in its initiation and its scope (see <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U. S. 56, 62-63, supra); and the lawfulness of an arrest will not always justify an otherwise illegal search and, in fact, \u2018 \u2018 General or exploratory searches are condemned even when they are incident to a lawful arrest. United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>at 62 \u201d <em>(Amador-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 F. 2d 308, 313; <em>Carlo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>286 F. 2d 841, 846).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As noted, the defendant\u2019s person was first subjected to a search which was the predicate for and led to the subsequent search of the car. It is generally accepted that, based on reasonable grounds, the legitimate objective of a warrantless search incident to arrest are to permit the \u2018 \u2018 (1) seizure of fruits, instrumentalities and other evidence of the crime for which the arrest is made in order to prevent its destruction or concealment; and (2) removal of any weapons that the arrestee might seek to use to resist arrest or affect his escape \u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>471 F. 2d 1082, 1093, <em>supra; </em>see, also, <em>Preston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>376 U. S. 364, 367; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>26 N Y 2d 547, 552).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> None of these grounds is here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Having produced his license and registration and in the absence of any showing that the defendant was unable to explain satisfactorily or answer any questions concerning the identification number, it is unlikely and certainly unreasonable to assume that, in the circumstances of this case, a search of the defendant\u2019s person was properly an incident to the arrest. Lacking is any foundation for a justifiable belief that a search would satisfy the constitutionally protected requirements therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We hold in this case that a violation of section 422 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, without more, will not sustain this search. In reaching this conclusion we have carefully weighed the need to search along with the governmental interest to justify the search, against the intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The order of Appellate Term should be reversed and the order of the Criminal Court of the City of New York should be reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> In <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(403 U. S. 443, 454-455) the court further delineated the rules by stating that \u201cthe most basic constitutional rule in this area is that <em>1 </em>searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 The exceptions are 1 jealously and carefully drawn\u2019, and there must be 1 a showing by those who seek \u00e9xemption * * that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative \u2019. <em>\u2018 </em>[T]he burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Jasen, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Aed\">I would sustain the search and seizure in the instant case as incident to a lawful arrest and, accordingly, affirm the order of the Appellate Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Involved is an unquestionably lawful custodial arrest for operation of a motor vehicle with an illegally changed serial number. The offense, albeit arising under the Vehicle and Traffic Law (\u00a7 422), is not a mere traffic infraction, but a <em>misdemeanor. </em>The incidental search in this case is, thus, readily distinguishable from that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(20 N Y 2d 98), where this court condemned a search incident to an arrest for failure to answer a speeding summons \u2014 an infraction. In <em>Marsh, </em>the court noted that \u201c the Legislature never intended to authorize a search of a traffic offender unless, when the vehicle is stopped, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the officer is in danger or there is probable cause for believing that the offender is guilty of a <em>crime </em>rather than merely a simple traffic infraction. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>at p. 101 [emphasis added].) Hence, even under <em>Marsh </em>there was a right to search the defendant because there was 6 <em>\u2018 </em>probable cause for believing that the offender [the defendant] * # * [was] guilty of a crime rather than merely a simple traffic infraction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In contrast to <em>Marsh, </em>the crime in this case was not minor. It came to light in a traffic situation, but was not a traffic matter. Granted, in the usual traffic offense there are no fruits or instrumentalities justifying an evidentiary search. But this was not a truly routine traffic offense \u2014 such as running a stop sign or exceeding the speed limit\u2014which any at sometime may commit. Involved is an illegally changed serial number, primary and strong evidence that the vehicle had been stolen. There was at least a reasonable probability that a search of the vehicle would produce evidence of prior ownership or that it was stolen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Under the circumstances, a custodial arrest was called for. Indeed, the officer would have been remiss if he had failed to take the defendant into custody. The hour was late, the offense involved serious enough in its own right and indicative of an even more serious offense. For his own safety, the officer was justified in making a protective search for weapons before tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ing the defendant into custody. In this regard we cannot be unmindful of the large number of police injuries which have accompanied ostensibly routine automobile stops.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In sum, whatever reasons there may be for a rule that bars searches incident to minor traffic arrests (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>471 F. 2d 1082, 1112, 1116 [Wilkey, J., dissenting] [D. C. Cir.], cert. granted 410 U. S. 982), I find them inapplicable in the context of this case. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>302 A. 2d 728 [D. C. C. A.].) Although we should not condone a search of an arrestee irrespective of the offense which gives rise to the arrest, this search was reasonable in its inception and unreasonable in its scope. The deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule are not well served by condemning it as constitutionally unreasonable. The contraband seized should be admissible into evidence against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Accordingly, I would affirm the order of the Appellate Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Burke, Jones and Wachtler concur with Judge Gabrielli; Judge Jasen dissents and votes to affirm in a separate opinion in which Judge Beeitel concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">. It should also he noted that, under specified circumstances, subdivision 2 of section 423 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law mandates the seizure of vehicles with illegally changed serial numbers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-12\">. As the Supreme Court recently noted, in 1971, 125 policemen were murdered, all but five by gunfire. And according to one study, 30% of police shootings occurred when a police officer approached a suspect seated in an automobile. (See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U. S. 143, 148, n. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
