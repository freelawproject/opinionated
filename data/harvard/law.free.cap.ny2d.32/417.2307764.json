While this question was previously resolved in favor of the reservists in <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman </em>(34 A D 2d 6, affd. no opn. 28 N Y 2d 667), which purportedly accorded reservists \u201c membership \u201d status in the armed forces of the United States thus entitling them, upon meeting the other qualifications, to section 85 preferences, the apparent failure of the <em>Sullivan </em>courts to take cognizance of the definition of a \u201c member of the armed forces \u201d set forth in section 13-a of the General Construction Law has resulted in various interpretations of the preference provisions (compare <em>Matter of Rahill </em>v. <em>Bronstein, </em>40 A D 2d 636, with <em>Matter of Loughran </em>v. <em>Bronstein, </em>N. Y. L. J., Jan. 2, 1973, p. 2, col. 3 [Sup. Ct., New York County, Culkin, J.], and <em>Matter of Sloane </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>40 A D 2d 1016, mot. for lv. to app. den. 32 N Y 2d 609; see, also, 1971 Opns. Atty. Gen. 14).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We take this opportunity to reconsider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">On February 28, 1970, petitioners, members of the New York City Police Department, took and passed promotional examination number 9580 for advancement to the position of Lieutenant. Each having been an honorably discharged member of a reserve component of one of the various branches of the armed forces, who served therein during time of war,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> * petitioners applied for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and received veterans \u2019 preference credits pursuant to section 85 of the Civil Service Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of the preference credits, petitioners were so placed on the eligible list that they were soon promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. Thereafter, the respondents determined that, as reservists with no active duty other than for training, petitioners were ineligible for veterans\u2019 preferences, and notified them that their credits were disallowed, their certifications revoked, and their ranks reduced to Sergeant (pursuant to rule 4.7.6 of the Rules of the New York City Civil Service Commission). Petitioners then commenced this article 78 proceeding seeking to annul that determination as being arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In granting the petition and annulling the respondents \u2019 determination disallowing the petitioners veterans\u2019 preference credits, Special Term relied upon <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman </em>(34 A D 2d 6, affd. 28 N Y 2d 667, <em>supra), </em>wherein a reservist, injured while on two weeks\u2019 active duty for training, was held to be a \u201c member of the armed forces of the United States \u2019 \u2019 within the meaning of article V (\u00a76). Constrained by the identity of issue, Special Term concluded that the respondents herein erred in finding the petitioners \u2019 service in the reserves to be outside the scope of the preference provisions, stating: \u201c In <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman </em>(34 A D 2d 6, affd. 28 N Y 2d 667) the Appellate Division held that \u2018 The armed forces are constituted by statute. There is a statutory provision for the Army Reserve ([34 A D 2d, at] p. 9) * * * Neither the constitution nor the Civil Service Law requires an evaluation of the merit, length or place of the service. That the service was not at the front is happenstance. The preference is based on the risk or exposure, and not the type of duration of service ([34 A D 2d, at] p. 10) * * * Courts are reluctant to import into the Constitution that which is not there \u2019 <em>(People ex rel. Gilbert </em>v. <em>Wemple, </em>125 N. Y. 485, 489). \u2018Where, as here, the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>of the Constitution admittedly, literally, brings petitioners within its scope, there is no occasion to search beyond the Constitution that which is not there \u2019 <em>(People ex rel. Gilbert </em>v. 3 N Y 2d 686, 689) ([34 A D 2d, at] p. 9).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The Appellate Division, however, in a unanimous opinion, reversed the judgment and dismissed the petition, proffering a dual rationale, the first segment of which superimposed upon <em>Sullivan </em>the additional requirement that reservists have served on active duty, other than active duty for training, in order to qualify for 1 \u2018 membership in the armed forces of the United States \u201d within the meaning of article V (\u00a7 6) and section 85 of the Civil Service Law. Citing section 13-a of the General Construction Law\u2014which was neither raised nor considered in <em>Sullivan </em>\u2014 the court simply noted that none of the instant petitioners had any full-time active duty, and that the annual training duty which reservists undergo <em>1 \u2018 </em>is not considered * * * active duty in the armed forces \u201d (40 A D 2d 637). Moreover, the court added, none of the petitioners met the \u2018 \u2018 <em>Sullivan </em>specifications \u201d since their reserve service allegedly occurred outside <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>a section 85 time of war \u2019 \u2019. On the record before us, this latter conclusion has no basis in fact (see n. 3, p. 420).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On appeal, petitioners rest upon the rationale of <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman, </em>and properly argue that under that case, they, as honorably discharged \u2018 \u2018 members of the armed f orces of the United States \u201d, who served therein during time of war, are entitled to preference credits under section 85 of the Civil Service Law. While we find merit in that contention, an examination of the history and policy underlying the preference provisions leads us to the conclusion that <em>Sullivan </em>overextended the scope of the preference provisions, which should, as the Appellate Division here noted, be limited to those whose wartime service was \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>full-time active duty \u2019 \u2019. To the extent, therefore, that the term \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>member of the armed forces \u2019 \u2019 must be given a more restrictive interpretation, <em>Sullivan </em>must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Article V (\u00a7. 6) of the State Constitution provides that appointments and promotions within the civil service system in this State shall be by competitive examination. By way of an exception to that rule, the same section provides, however, that: \u201c any member of the armed forces of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>who served therein in time of war, who is a citizen and resident of this state and was a resident at the time of his entrance into the armed forces of the United States and was honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from such service, shall be entitled to receive five points additional credit in a competitive examination for original appointment and two and one-half points additional credit in an examination for promotion nr, if such member was disabled in the actual performance of duty in any war, is receiving disability payments therefor from the United States veterans administration, and his disability is certified by such administration to be in existence at the time of his application for appointment or promotion, he shall be entitled to receive ten points additional credit in a competitive examination for original appointment and five points additional credit in an examination for promotion.\u201d (N. Y. Const., art. V, \u00a7 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Section 85 of the Civil Service Law then gives effect to the article V (\u00a76) exception, defining veteran (\u00a7 85, subd. 1, par. [a])<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and disabled veteran (\u00a7 85, subd. 1, par. [b])<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as provided in the Constitution, and providing for the appropriate preference credits (\u00a7 85, subd 2, par. [a], els. <em>[1] &amp; </em>[2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The <em>\u201c </em>veteran\u2019s preference \u201d has been a constitutionally prescribed part of our civil service system since post-Civil-War days (N. Y. Const. [1894], art, V, \u00a7 9; see, also, <em>Matter of Barthelmess </em>v. <em>Cukor, </em>231 N. Y. 435; <em>Matter of Keymer, </em>148 N. Y. 219). Justified as a discharge of our <em>\u201c </em>debt of gratitude \u201d for the sacrifices of those who served our country during time of war, this exception to the constitutional mandate that civil ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>vice placement and advancement be by competitive examination has regularly withstood constitutional attack on equal protection grounds <em>(Matter of Bateman </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>188 Misc. 189, affd. 271 App. Div. 813, affd. 296 N. Y. 849; <em>Matter of Potts </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>264 N. Y. 110; <em>Matter of Gianatasio </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>142 Misc. 611, affd. 257 N. Y. 531, app. dsmd. 284 U. S. 595; <em>Matter of Barthelmess </em>v. <em>Cukor, </em>231 N. Y. 435, <em>supra). </em>Historically, however, the constitutionality of the preference provisions has been insured by a consistently restrictive construction, comporting as fully as possible with the competitive injunction of article V (\u00a7 6) (see <em>Matter of Rubin </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>273 App. Div. 559, affd. 298 N. Y. 711; <em>Matter of Barthelmess </em>v. <em>Cukor, </em>supra; <em>Matter of Keymer, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In 1948, the courts, in <em>Matter of Rubin </em>v. <em>Conway </em>(273 App. Div. 559, affd. 298 N. Y. 711, <em>supra), </em>had occasion to construe the preference provisions of article Y (\u00a7 6)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in terms of the underlying legislative intent. Factually, the case involved a claim for preference credits on the basis of the petitioner\u2019s temporary membership in the United States Coast Guard Reserve. The Appellate Division, culling its rationale from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s construction of similar provisions of the Federal Veteran\u2019s Preference Act of 1944 <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>333 U. S. 411), concluded that while a literal reading of the provisions might bring the temporary reservists within their coverage (as it would these petitioners) such a reading would ignore the obvious intent of the provisions. Noting that \u201c [a]ny preference is of course repugnant to the theory of civil service \u2019 \u2019, the court held that only in the case of \u2018 \u2018 full time military service \u201d, in time of war, is such a preference justified. There, \u201cit is justified equitably and morally by the sacrifice and disruption of normal civil life which accompanied full time military service\u201d (273 App. Div., at p. 561). In thus delimiting the constitutional phrase <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 members of the armed forces \u201d to those who served full-time active duty, the Appellate Division quoted as follows from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mitchell </em>decision: \u201c \u2018 Throughout the legislative reports and debates leading to the birth of this statute is evident a consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>desire to help only those who had sacrificed their normal pursuits and surroundings to aid in the struggle to which this nation had dedicated itself. It was the veterans or ex-servicemen who had been completely divorced from their civilian employment by reason of their full-time service with the armed forces who were. the objects of Congressional solicitude. Reemployment and rehabilitation were considered to be necessary only as to them. There is nothing to indicate that the legislative mind in this instance was directed toward granting special benefits or rewards to those who performed military service without interference with their normal employment and mode of life. As to them, assistance in reemployment and rehabilitation was thought unnecessary. Their civilian employment status remained unchanged by reason of their military service. And since their civilian life was substantially unaltered, there was no problem of aiding their readjustment back to such a life. Indeed, to have given them preference rights solely because of their part-time military service would have been inconsistent with the professed aims of the statutory framers. Such preference would have diluted the benefits conferred on those ex-servicemen who have made full-scale sacrifices; and it would have been inequitable to the many civilians who also had participated voluntarily in essential war and defense activities but who had not been directly connected with a branch of the armed forces.\u2019 \u201d (273 App. Div., at p. 562.) Quite clearly, the reasoning applied to the temporary reservists in <em>Rubin </em>is equally applicable to regular reservists under consideration here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Tn deciding <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman </em>(34 A D 2d 6, affd. 28 N Y 2d 667, <em>supra), </em>which granted to reservists\u2014who are not torn away from their homes \"and jobs by full-time active duty \u2014 preference credits in civil service examinations, the courts overlooked not only the General Construction Law but, more importantly, the constitutional construction given these very preference provisions in <em>Matter of Rubin </em>v. <em>Conway (supra). </em>In doing so, preference credits have been extended to a now privileged class of employees\u2014wartime reservists \u2014 who were not the intended beneficiaries of the exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>article V constitutional directive that civil service positions be competitive. This extension not only dilutes the benefit to those veterans who, by virtue of their sacrifices, are entitled to such preferential treatment, but it creates a class\u2014wartime reservists\u2014who are accorded preferential treatment which is unjustified by the \u2018 \u2018 debt of gratitude \u2019 \u2019 which underlies the preferences given full-time, active-duty war veterans (see <em>Matter of Bateman </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>188 Misc. 189, affd. 271 App. Div. 813, affd. 296 N. Y. 849, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">We find unconvincing the argument, first advanced in <em>Sullivan, </em>that the constitutional term \u2018 \u2018 members of the armed forces \u2019 \u2019 must be given its broadest effect so as to include reservists (34 A D 2d, at p. 9). The thrust of article V (\u00a76) of the Constitution is that the civil service system is to be competitive. The term <em>\u201c </em>members of the armed forces \u201d is included in that section only by way of defining an exception to the general requirement that appointments and promotions be by competitive examination. As an exception to a constitutional mandate, the term 1 \u2018 members of the armed forces \u2019 \u2019 should be given the narrowest interpretation consistent with the intent of the framers. This is particularly true here, where the provision for a preference is, by definition, repugnant to the competitive scheme of article V (\u00a7 6) (see <em>Matter of Barthelmess </em>v. <em>Cukor, </em>231 N. Y. 435, <em>supra </em>[opn. per Cardozo, J.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, <em>Matter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman (supra) </em>is overruled, and the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Breitel, Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones and Wachtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Order affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-5\">. After noting that <em>\u201cMatter of Sullivan </em>v. <em>Hoberman </em>* * appears not to have considered \u00a7 13-a of the General Construction Law \u201d, the Attorney-General concluded that <em>\u201c </em>a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States may not be accorded veterans\u2019 preference unless he has served on a full-time active duty basis other than active duty for training purposes\u201d (1971 Opns.

Respondents\u2019 own brief indicates each of these petitioners was a member of the reserves during those statutorily defined periods of war (see Respondent Brief, pp. 5-7). Rahill was discharged from the reserves October 31, 1965; O\u2019Donnell entered February 3, 1953; Jenkins entered the reserves June 30,1949 and was discharged March 19,1954; Mulderrig entered April 18, 1953; and Cass was discharged September 6, 1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">.
