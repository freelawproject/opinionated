S. 442; <em>King </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F. 2d 289; <em>Newsom </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 F. 2d 237; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ligouri, </em>284 N.

All three moved for dismissal of the indictment. The court at Criminal Term denied Santana\u2019s application but granted the motions of the other two, and a divided Appellate Division affirmed the resulting order (40 A D 2d 1021). This was error; the motion should have been denied and the indictment sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The grand jury minutes reveal that Santana disembarked from a ship on Pier 3 in Brooklyn at about 4:00 o\u2019clock in the morning on September 12, 1969, carrying 10 pounds of mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>juana in a large plastic bag and that Feliciano and Gonzalez were parked nearby in an automobile. The minutes further disclose that, as Santana, discarding the bag, sought to flee from pursuing customs officers\u2014who had stationed themselves on Pier 3 following receipt of information that an attempt would be made to \u201c land \u201d marijuana from a ship berthed at that pier \u2014Feliciano and Gonzalez started up their vehicle and headed for Santana and that the latter, when the car came abreast of him, \u201c got in \u201d the rear seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In our view, the evidence before the grand j\u00fary was \u2018 \u2018 legally sufficient\u201d, within the sense of the applicable statute (CPL 190.65), <em>\u201c </em>to establish \u201d that Feliciano and Gonzalez committed the offense charged against them: prima facie, such \u00e9vidence supported the inference that they were parked where they w'ere, and acted as they did, to aid and abet Santana\u2014who physically possessed the marijuana\u2014to commit the crime charged of possessing a dangerous drug in the third degree. In other words, the testimony before the grand jury was sufficient to stamp the defendants-respondents before us as accomplices and accessories of Santana and, by that token, principals in the commission of the offense with which they were charged (Penal Law, \u00a7 20.00). At the very least, though, as the dissenting Appellate Division justices observed (40 A D 2d, at p. 1022), it was <em>\u201c </em>sufficient * * * to establish that * *\u25a0 * they had committed the lesser included crime of an attempt to commit the crime charged in the indictment \u201d. (See CPL 210.20, subd. 1, par. [b].)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We need not at this time consider the lawfulness of either the arrest of the defendants or the search and seizure of evidence. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>21 N Y 2d 55; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U. S. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The order appealed from should be reversed and the indictment against defendants Feliciano and Gonzalez reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Judges Bxtbke, Bbeitel, Jasen, Gabbxelli, Jones and Wachtlek concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
