The presumption of knowledge, as applied in this ease, is unconstitutional. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weingarten, </em>50 Misc 2d 635, 55 Misc 2d 681, 25 N Y 2d 639; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>23 N Y 2d 778; <em>People </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>11 N Y 2d 300.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-5\">Breitel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqN\">A so-called adult comic magazine called <em>Zap No. 4 </em>has been found obscene and for its sale two booksellers in separate cases tried together have been convicted of a violation of section 235.05 of the Penal Law. Each of the defendants was fined $500 and if the fine was not paid to serve 90 days in jail. The fines were paid. The Appellate Term affirmed, and defendants appeal by leave of an Associate Judge of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The fact of obscenity need not be dwelt upon at this time. Most of this court agree with the courts below that the material sold was obscene, and its nature was discussed by the trial court in its elaborate opinion determining the case. What remains at issue, with disagreement in this court, is whether the record contained sufficient evidence to establish that the booksellers knew of the obscene contents and by way of alternative <em>ratio decidendi </em>whether the statutory presumption that a seller of obscene materials knows the contents of what he sells is valid (Penal Law, \u00a7 235.10, subd. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The trial court both found actual knowledge and applied the statutory presumption. After having completed in its opinion its treatment of the statutory presumption it detailed the testimony of the booksellers in which they admitted personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>selling many copies of the magazine. It also noted that each defendant had ordered and reordered the magazine when a new issue came out or on exhaustion of the current supply. It wrote: <em>\u201c </em>Such facts are similar to those presented in <em>People </em>v. <em>Weingarten </em>(50 Misc 2d 635, 640, affd. 55 Misc 2d 681; revd. on other grounds 25 N Y 2d 639) and where held there, as I hold the stated facts here, to constitute sufficient knowledge by the defendants, Dargis and Kirkpatrick, of the contents and character of <em>Zap No. 4, </em>although they may have never read through it. \u201d (64 Misc 2d 1055, 1071.) Assuming that one may fail to read the sentence in question as conveying the meaning suggested here, reference to the <em>Weingarten </em>case, cited by the trial court, negates any straining at ambiguity. The <em>Weingarten </em>case involved no presumption and the trial court there weighed the evidence to reach the inference of <em>scienter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The trial court\u2019s problem was of course to decide the motion to dismiss and to rule on the entire case. Hence, the recourse to discussion both of the presumption and the inference of fact. The presumption justified denial of the motion to dismiss even as of the time of its making. The inference of fact, regardless of the presumption, but supportive of it in a sense, justified the finding of guilt on the whole case. Thus, the trial court\u2019s resort to alternative <em>rationes decidendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Of course, as will be noted shortly, the inference of <em>scienter </em>from possession alone of contraband would have sufficed to deny the motion to dismiss at the close of the People\u2019s case. Certainly, the trial court chose not to make the inference of <em>scienter </em>on the People\u2019s case and that omission may not be supplied on appeal. With equal certainty however it made the inference of fact in evaluating the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Most, if not all, of the evidence relating to the defendants\u2019 knowledge was introduced by them after the court reserved decision on their motions to dismiss at the close of the People\u2019s case. However, it is settled that a defendant who does not rest after the court fails to grant a motion to dismiss at the close of the People\u2019s case, proceeds with the risk that he will inadvertently supply a deficiency in the People\u2019s case.

C. Cir.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Earlier, while ,still discussing the statutory presumption, and to establish that the presumption had not been rebutted, the trial court pointed out that with its conspicuous display the magazine stood out <em>\u201c </em>like a sore thumb \u201d from the other publications handled by the booksellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It is evident then that the trial court found <em>scienter </em>both by reason of the statutory presumption not having been rebutted and by its own inference of the fact of knowledge from the evidence. Since the attack on the validity of the presumption rests in part on the probabilities of knowledge by the booksellers of what kind of material they were selling, it necessarily follows that the probabilities supporting the validity of the presumption, the failure to rebut it successfully, and \u00bfhe inference of knowledge overlap. The conviction should be affirmed on either view of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Defendant Dar gis was the manager and sole employee making purchases for a bookshop in which the magazine was sold. In particular, he ordered and reordered the magazine, personally unpacking copies and positioning them on the shelves. He sold 20 to 25 copies himself, and admitted saying to customers that he <em>\u201c </em>was surprised to see that a comic book sold so well.\u201d He also admitted he had glanced at <em>\u201c </em>the ending pages \u201d of <em>Zap No. 4, </em>and had looked at the garish cover with the legend \u201c Adults Only \u201d. Defendant Kirkpatrick was the comanager of his bookshop in which the magazine was also sold. He did the ordering and reordering of various issues of <em>Zap, </em>including the ordering of 150 copies of <em>Zap No. 4. </em>He admitted personally having sold 25 to 30 copies of <em>Zap No. 4. </em>The characteristic drawings of the magazine are largely of the same kind from the first page to the last, so that any sampling would have been illustrative of the bulk. It is undisputed that each of the bookshops was a purveyor of large quantities of legitimate publications, kept in stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>in the many thousands, with a wide range of serious literature, fiction and periodicals. '</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Because it is the simpler of the two issues, the first to be discussed is the permissible inference in a criminal case that one in possession of contraband knows the contraband nature of his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The principle was most recently discussed by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reisman </em>(29 N Y 2d 278). Treating of the possession of a large commercial quantity of marijuana picked up as a shipment at an air terminal by the defendant and consigned to his care, it was said: <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>The crime of possessing dangerous drugs requires a physical or constructive possession with actual knowledge of the nature of the possessed substance (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 220.05-220.20). Knowledge, of course, may be shown circumstantially by conduct or directly by admission, or indirectly by contradictory statements from which guilt may be inferred (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Groom, </em>60 Cal. 2d 694, 696; <em>People </em>v. <em>Embry, </em>20 Ill. 2d 331, 332; 72 C. J. S., Poisons, \u00a7 7, subd. c., par. [2]). Generally, possession suffices to permit the inference that the possessor knows what he possesses, especially, but not exclusively, if it is in his hands, on his person, in his vehicle, or on his premises (e.g., 2 Wigmore, Evidence [3d ed.], \u00a7\u00a7 244-245, 260; cf. <em>Kuchlik </em>v. <em>Feuer, </em>239 App. Div. 338, 339). This, of course, is an elemental inference based on common experience and all but universal probabilities. Thus it is an ancient rule of inference of rebuttable presumption of fact that the recent and exclusive possession of the fruits of any crime warrants the inference of guilt, including, when material, knowledgeable possession (Wigmore, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 152, vol. 9, \u00a7 2513; Richardson, Evidence [9th ed.], \u00a7 88 and cases cited). In the case of contraband its possession is a crime per se, and hence the inference of guilt, that is, knowledgeable possession, is as strong as is the case for instance, with stolen goods (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>12 N Y 2d 220, 222; <em>People </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>260 App. Div. 687, 689-690, affd. 285 N. Y. 811; Wigmore, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 152; Richardson, <em>loc. cit., supra).\u201d </em>(29 N Y 2d, at pp. 285-286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Needless to say, the inference of knowledge rests on the probabilities of human transactions. It is rare that one does not know what one possesses. Since the inference of knowledge is but that, the burden of going forward and negativing the inference is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>a slight one and, by the nature of things, rarely is there occasion to invoke it. It must be an extraordinary circumstance which prevents one from knowing what one possesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">When one moves to the alternative ground for the trial court\u2019s conviction and for this court\u2019s affirmance, that of the statutory presumption, there are parallel analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">It has always been the law, and the only difference today is that the doctrine is more sharply circumscribed, that a statutory presumption in a criminal case, even if rebuttable, must have a supporting foundation in the probabilities. Otherwise, persons charged with crime could be required unfairly to prove their innocence and in some cases compelled as a practical matter to testify in their own behalf. On the other hand, statutory presumptions that do no more than codify accepted rules of inference (as in knowledge of the contraband nature of contraband possessed) have always been held valid (Penal Law, \u00a7 165.55; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>260 App. Div. 687, affd. 285 N. Y. 811; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elfe, </em>37 A D 2d 208). So too, presumptions designed to prevent persons closely associated in time and space from avoiding responsibility by any one of them for the contraband (as in the case of guns found in a vehicle occupied by two or more persons) have been consistently sustained in this court and the United States Supreme Court (e.g., <em>People </em>v. Terra, 303 N. Y. 332, 335, app. dsmd. for want of a substantial Federal question 342 U. S. 938). The cases which have analyzed statutory presumptions and have justified them on the grounds of <em>\u201c </em>fair \u201d, <em>\u201c </em>natural \u201d and \u201c rational \u201d connections with elements of a crime or on the probabilities bearing on criminality have been discussed in <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaleb </em>(25 N Y 2d 394, 400-404; see, also, Ann., Lottery Device \u2014 Statutory Presumption, 17 ALR 3d 491, 494-495).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Most important for purposes of this case is to recognize, as was said in the <em>McCaleb </em>case, that the Supreme Court in <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States </em>(395 U. S. 6) did not cast-all statutory presumptions in criminal cases in any doubt at all. The difficulty in that case was that a double inference was required to sustain the presumption there, namely, that the marijuana was imported and that defendant knew of such importation, and only the first part of the double inference was supported by the probabilities <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaleb, supra, </em>at pp. 401-402).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>This does not mean that a statutory presumption has no greater effect than a permissible inference based on probabilities. The truth is that a presumption will require less in the way of probabilities to support it. In short, unlike the inference, it need not establish the ultimate fact to which it is addressed beyond a reasonable doubt, often the case with the simpler inference <em>(People </em>v. <em>Reisman, </em>29 N Y 2d 278, 286, <em>supra; </em>cf. McCormick, Evidence [1954], \u00a7 313; 22A C. J. S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 579, pp. 331-332; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tutalo, </em>99 R. I. 14, 17-20).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">On this view, it is hardly arguable that by a purely logical test the presumption of knowledge in an obscenity statute is amply supported by the probabilities. Even the largeness of the bookshop does not lessen the probabilities; if anything, with respect to egregiously packaged or conspicuously bizarre material it will stand out, as the trial court said, \u201c like a sore thumb \u201d, in a staid collection of books. Nor should the test be easier for the large bookseller as contrasted with the small one. Indeed, the small one may well be victimized by tie-in sales or lack of knowledge of his wares because his books and magazines are only a small part of his stock. In any event, no merchant, regardless of the size and scope of his inventory, can survive economically unless he knows his stock. This is a truism and an ancient one.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Although no courts have made the distinctions it would seem too that in sustaining legislatively enacted presumptions one must look to counterbalancing factors. It is one thing to have presumptions in crimes punishable by long imprisonment, or even capital punishment. It is another to utilize presumptions in minor crimes and offenses where the policing problem is aggravated and the escape of responsibility by studied ignorance or denial too easy. Moreover, one must look to the ease with which a presumption may be rebutted. If it is easy for the defendant to rebut, then the presumption is a tolerable burden (see <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaleb, </em>25 N Y 2d 394, 401, <em>supra; </em>McCormick, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 313, pp. 662-663). Of course, the corollary principle, favoring the defendant, is that a plausible rebuttal may very well place the burden and going forward again on the prosecution if it is to sustain its over-all burden of persuasion which is to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The logic of proof aside, there is an added policy consideration in the use of a presumption in any case involving a limitation on speech or press. This policy consideration concerned the Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California </em>(361 U. S. 147) and it is the concern of the dissenters in this court. That concern is also shared by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The fear is that any censorship of obscene materials will inhibit the bookseller from open dissemination of only possibly obscene material. That fear, however, is not to be confused with the holding of the <em>Smith </em>case which rejected out of hand a State statute which made the seller of obscene material guilty, regardless of his knowledge or ignorance of the contents. No such statute, of course, is involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Mr. Justice Brennan wrote the majority opinion in the <em>Smith </em>case which made clear that the purpose of the holding was not to emasculate prosecution for obscenity. After express disavowal of such an effect the opinion went on to say: \u2018 \u2018 Eyewitness testimony of a bookseller\u2019s perusal of a book hardly need be a necessary element in proving his awareness of its contents. The circumstances may warrant the inference that he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial \u201d (361 U. S., at p. 154).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The quoted comment embraces of course the alternative ground for sustaining the convictions in this case based on the inference of fact. But Mr. Justice Bbennan went on to envisage the possibility of a burden placed on a bookseller to go forward and explain his possession of the contraband\u2014the presumption in short. He said: \u201c We need not and most definitely do not pass today on what sort of mental element is requisite to a constitutionally permissible prosecution of a bookseller for carrying an obscene book in stock; whether honest mistake as to whether its contents in fact constituted obscenity need be an excuse; whether there might be circumstances under which the State constitutionally might require that a bookseller investigate further, or might put on him the burden of explaining why he did not, and what such circumstances might be. Doubtless any form of criminal obscenity statute applicable to a bookseller will induce some tendency to self-censorship and have some inhibitory effect on the dissemination of material not obscene, but we consider today only one which goes to the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>eliminating all mental elements from the crime. \u201d (361 U. S., at pp. 154-155).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Notably, the opinion recognized that any obscenity statute applicable to a bookseller will induce some tendency to self-censorship, but also indicated that the decision did not require meeting the problem. The importance of the expressed restraint is of course that otherwise any effective control of obscenity would become impossible. The <em>\u201c </em>hardcore \u201d obscenity to which modern efforts are directed is largely of the kind where the authors and publishers are or would be largely anonymous or disguised. It is at some point of distribution that the offense may be uncovered and only sometimes worked backward to the makers of the contraband. In any event, so long as the Supreme Court has not viewed obscenity as beyond legislative control, it behooves the courts to sustain rational efforts at control and not, indirectly on attenuated constitutional speculations, to overthrow serially every restrained effort at control. So long as obscenity measures are restricted to the type of material now involved, the social redeeming value qualification retained, and only rebuttable presumptions based on rational connection or probabilities are utilized, the risk to constitutionally protected speech or press is invisible.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b59-7\">Chief Judge Fuld, (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"A_J\">Subdivision 1 of section 235.10 of the Penal Law provides that a person who sells obscene material in the course of his business is presumed to do so with knowledge of its content and character. Since I believe that that presumption is unconstitutional and that the trial court, in adjudging the defendants guilty, relied on it, I would reverse the convictions and dismiss the informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Before turning to the question of constitutionality, it is first necessary to demonstrate that the trial court relied upon the presumption in finding <em>scienter </em>and did not, contrary to the majority\u2019s hypothesis, find as a fact, separate and apart from the presumption, that the defendants had <em>\u201c </em>actual knowledge \u201d of the offending magazine\u2019s content and character.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The defendants were the managers of two neighborhood bookstores located in Manhattan, the New Yorker Bookstore on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>upper west side and the East Side Bookstore on the lower east side. The New Yorker Bookstore, where Kirkpatrick was employed, carried more than 10,000 different titles and 25,000 volumes of hard-cover and paperback books on all manner of subjects, While the East Side shop carried about 16,000 titles and from 50,000 to 60,000 volumes. The only evidence introduced at the trial on the People\u2019s case was that given by each of the arresting police officers that he had purchased the magazine <em>(Zap Cornice No. 4) </em>\u2014which contained the legend on its cover, \u201c Adults Only \u201d\u2014for 50 cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Despite the indisputable fact that there was not a word- of testimony or evidence presented during the People\u2019s case that either defendant knew the content or nature of <em>Zap No. 4, </em>the trial judge, after the prosecution rested, reserved decision on the defense motion to dismiss on the ground that evidence of <em>scienter </em>was lacking. This ruling demonstrates that the judge necessarily relied on the statutory presumption of knowledge; had he not done so, he would, of course, have granted the motion. In any event, after decision on their motion had been reserved, the def\u00e9ndants took the stand quite obviously to attempt to rebut that presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Each defendant denied having any familiarity with the contents of the magazine. More specifically, Kirkpatrick testified that, although he had sold some 25 copies, he had never read, indeed, had not even \u201c looked inside \u201d of the magazine. And, contrary to the intimation in the court\u2019s opinion (p. 21), Kirkpatrick had never \u201c reordered\u201d <em>Zap No. 4. </em>The other defendant, Dargis, stated that he had ordered that magazine, as he put it, \u201c blind,\u201d from an order form furnished by the supplier which merely listed, without description, the titles of the \u201ccomics\u201d available. Although Dargis acknowledged that he had \u201c glanced \u201d at its \u201c ending pages \u201d and had reordered the magazine after the original supply (of 100) had been exhausted, he denied that he had ever read it or had ever discussed its contents with anyone. I would but add that it does not have an obscene cover and that no claim is made that either store dealt in sex-oriented books or in material such as is currently being purveyed in the Times Square area of New York City. As indicated, the trial court found both defendants guilty of selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>obscene material, knowing its content and character, in violation of section 235.05 of the Penal Law (64 Misc 2d 1055).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">I deem it unnecessary to consider whether the evidence in the record would have supported or justified an affirmative finding of <em>scienter </em>since, in my view, the trial judge\u2019s treatment of the case, as reflected in his opinion, demonstrates that, in deciding that the defendants were guilty, he placed his reliance upon the statutory presumption of knowledge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the first place, under the caption, \u201c the issues \u201d, he declared that he had to pass on two questions with respect to the subject of <em>scienter, </em>namely, \u201c (a) * * * Is that presumption unconstitutional, as defendants claim? # <em>* * </em>[and] (b) Assuming its constitutionality, have the defendants satisfactorily rebutted the presumption? \u201d (64 Mise 2d, at p. 1058). In the second place, after deciding that it was valid (pp. 1063-1068), the judge categorically stated that \u201c The circumstances here clearly indicate that the defendants have not satisfactorily rebutted the presumption \u201d (p. 1070).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">This certainly is not the language a court would use if it had found as an affirmative fact that each of the defendants, independent of the presumption, actually knew the sort of publication he was selling. In point of fact, had the judge believed that the evidence adduced established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendants had actual knowledge of the assertedly obscene nature of the magazine, he would not have found it necessary to treat in depth the constitutionality of the presumption and explicitly announce, as he did, that the defendants had not \u201csatisfactorily rebutted \u201d that presumption. In light of all this, the single sentence in the course of the trial court\u2019s 30-page opinion \u2014 to which the majority points to support its conclusion that the trial judge \u201c found actual knowledge \u201d (opn., p. 20) \u2014 can only mean that, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the presumption had not been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In short, implicit both in the court\u2019s conduct of the trial and in its treatment of the case is a determination that, absent reliance upon the presumption, the proof offered did not establish that the defendants knew the allegedly obscene nature of the material. This being so, our court may not make a new finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>fact even though we were to assume that the trial judge could have made such a finding. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>259 N. Y. 170, 175-177; <em>Murray Co. </em>v. <em>Lidgerwood Mfg. Co., </em>241 N. Y. 455, 458; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>DuBois, </em>90 N. Y. 95, 99; see, also, Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals, pp. 496-497, 751.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">I turn, then, to the question of the constitutionality of the presumption created by section 235.10 of the Penal Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That statute\u2014providing as it does that one who sells obscene material in the course of his business <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>is presumed to do so with knowledge of its content and character <em>\u201d </em>\u2014 enables the prosecution to convict the bookseller of selling obscene material, no matter how large his establishment, or how numerous and varied the publications on his shelf, without any proof whatsoever that he knew the content or character of such material, solely as a result of the presumption of knowledge created by the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In my judgment, such a presumption, on its face and certainly as applied to the facts of this case, not only offends against the due process requirements of the Federal Constitution (14th Arndt.) and the State Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 6) but also contravenes the guarantee of freedom of expression (U. S. Const., 1st Amdt.; N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A statutory presumption violates due process, the Supreme Court has held, if there is <em>\u201c </em>no rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the inference of the one from proof of the other is arbitrary because of lack of connection between the two in common experience. * * * [W]here the inference is so strained as not to have a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>relation to the circumstances of life as we know them, it is not competent for the legislature to create it\u201d. <em>(Tot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U. S. 463, 467-468; see, also, <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 U. S. 398, 416; <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U. S. 6, 36; <em>People </em>v. <em>McCaleb, </em>25 N Y 2d 394, 403; <em>People </em>v. <em>Terra, </em>303 N. Y. 332, 335.) In other words, the <em>\u201c </em>upshot \u201d of the decided cases, the Supreme Court wrote in <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States </em>(395 U. S. 6, 36, <em>supra), </em>is that a <em>\u201c </em>criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as <em>1 </em>irrational \u2019 or \u2018 arbitrary, \u2019 and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">It is most unlikely that a bookseller \u2014 especially in a store such as those in which the defendants were employed\u2014would have knowledge of the content of the publications being offered for sale. To say that booksellers in the circumstances of this case are <em>\u201c </em>more likely than not \u201d to know the character and content of all the material they sell is to ignore not only the record evidence regarding the manner in which books and magazines are ordered but the very <em>\u201c </em>circumstances of life \u201d itself. The New Yorker Bookstore \u2014 in which Kirkpatrick was employed \u2014 carried over 10,000 titles, while the East Side shop\u2014where Dargis worked\u2014carried about 16,000 titles. Reason and experience tell us that it would be impossible for a bookseller in either store to acquaint himself with the content and character of so large a number of titles. In any event, it may not be said with <em>\u201c </em>substantial assurance \u201d \u2014 as required by the cases\u2014that such booksellers may be \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>presumed \u2019 \u2019 to know the content and character of a publication merely upon proof that they sold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">However, even if the statutory presumption were able to withstand an attack based on due process grounds, I would be impelled to stamp it unconstitutional as an infringement on the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U. S. <em>147; Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>357 U. S. 513.) The presumption violates that amendment because it creates and occasions a system of \u201c self-censorship \u201d on the part of booksellers which affects the sale and distribution of all books \u2014those that are constitutionally protected as well as those that are obscene. It is hardly necessary to state that no comparable injury to the fundamental guarantee of free expression is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>involved where the presumption permits an inference of knowledge from presence in a stolen car <em>(People </em>v. McCaleb, 25 N Y 2d 394, <em>supra), </em>possession of marijuana <em>(Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U. S. 6, <em>supra) </em>or of machine guns <em>(People </em>v. <em>Terra, </em>303 N. Y. 332, <em>supra) </em>or even food or the merchandise of ordinary trade. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California </em>(361 U. S. 147,152-153, <em>supra), \u201c </em>There is no specific constitutional inhibition against making the distributors of food the strictest censors of their merchandise, but the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of speech and of the press stand in the way of imposing a similar requirement on the bookseller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Indeed, it was the danger of self-censorship in the sale of books that prompted the court in <em>Smith </em>(361 U. S. 147, <em>supra) </em>to make clear its insistence on the requirement of knowledge by the bookseller. The court there invalidated a California statute which made it unlawful for a bookseller to have obscene material in his store, even though he had no knowledge of its content or character. In holding that the elimination of the requirement of <em>scienter </em>would inhibit and stifle free expression, the Supreme Court declared (361 U. S., at pp. 153-154):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u2022 <em>\u201c </em>By dispensing with any requirement of knowledge of the contents of the book on the part of the seller, the ordinance tends to impose a severe limitation on the public\u2019s access to constitutionally protected matter. For if the bookseller is criminally liable without knowledge of the contents, and the ordinance fulfills its purpose, he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected; and thus the State will have imposed a restriction upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene literature. * * * And the bookseller\u2019s burden would become the public\u2019s burden, for by restricting him the public\u2019s access to reading matter would be restricted. If the contents of bookshops and periodical stands were restricted to material of which their proprietors had made an inspection, they might be depleted indeed. The bookseller\u2019s limitation in the amount of reading material with which he could familiarize himself, and his timidity in the face of his absolute criminal liability, thus would tend to restrict the public\u2019s access to forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>of the printed word which the State conld not constitutionally suppress directly. The bookseller\u2019s self-censorship, compelled by the State, would be a censorship affecting the whole public, hardly less virulent for being privately administered. Through it, the distribution of all books, both obscene and not obscene, would be impeded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Penal Law provision here challenged attempted to avoid the <em>Smith </em>problem by creating a rebuttable presumption of knowledge instead of absolute liability. The trouble with this procedural tactic is that it does not come to grips with the problem of self-censorship raised in the <em>Smith </em>case, namely, that the bookseller will tend to limit his stock to books which he has read and can guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is, of course, not necessary that there be eyewitness testimony that the bookseller had read a book in order to prove his knowledge of its contents but it seems clear that legislation, such as section 235.10, which sanctions conviction of the bookseller for selling obscene material without any proof whatsoever that he knew or was familiar with its nature, is afflicted with precisely the same vice and produces the same objectionable result as the statute struck down in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California </em>(361 U. S. 147, <em>supra). </em>In other words, such legislation requires the bookseller to go forward with affirmative proof that he had no knowledge of the content of the publication in order to prevent a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">I would emphasize that making the presumption rebuttable does not make it less effective as a restraint. In either case, a bookseller would be compelled to become a censor and, under compulsion of the statute, would tend to restrict the books to those he read or investigated. In consequence, the State is permitted to indirectly suppress what it could not suppress directly. Thus, the rationale underlying the decision in Smith\u2014 the very real danger of self-imposed restriction of freedom of expression\u2014also renders the presumption in this case impermissible and unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Although the State may generally regulate the allocation of the burden of proof through legislation, it is clear that a statute may not, where the First Amendment is involved, declare a person presumptively guilty of a crime or presume that he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>committed one of its material elements. (See <em>Speiser </em>v. <em>Randall, 357 </em>U. S. <em>513, </em>523-524, <em>supra; Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U. S. 147, 150-151, <em>supra; Grove Press </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>306 F. Supp. 1084,1087-1088; see, also, Note, Obscenity Prosecutions, 41 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 791, 797.) Freedom of speech is to\u00f3 important a right to allow it to be seriously impeded or impaired by a presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">The convictions should be reversed and the informations dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Judges Burke, Jasen and G-abrielli concur with Judge Breitel ; Chief Judge Fuld dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judges Jones and Wachtler concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\">.
