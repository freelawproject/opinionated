Nor is the tax certificate of that character of property which required a trial by jury before it can be rescinded. The certificate is created by force of a law which regulates its issuance, and is subject to the provisions of that law as to its validity and cancellation. The applicant takes it with all its privileges, but subject to all the burdens of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Motion granted with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
