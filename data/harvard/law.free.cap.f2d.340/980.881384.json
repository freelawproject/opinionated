An auxiliary reverse gear actuated back up warning light for vehicles having a back-up light switch and a battery, comprising a light housing positioned on the top of the vehicle adjacent the rear window, a warning light in said housing, and a connection from said warning light to said battery through said back-up switch whereby said light is actuated when the vehicle is put in reverse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">\u25a0Claim 2 recites a \u201cflasher\u201d to impart an intermittent action to the warning light, claim 3 adds an interior \u201cindicator light,\u201d claim 4 adds an interior \u201cmanual switch,\u201d and claim 5 recites that the light housing is \u201camber colored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">The references relied on are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-8\">Smith (British) 761,727 Nov. 21, 1956</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-9\">Slater 2,866,175 Dee. 28, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-10\">Hallman 2,205,169 June 18, 1940</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Smith discloses a safety reversing siguial for motor vehicles which comprises a bright blue light fitted in such position on the roof of the vehicle as to .serve as a warning signal to anyone who may be near the vehicle. The light is controlled from the gear lever when placed in reverse, or from the dash-hoard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Slater discloses a vehicle signal system which combines back-up lights, turn signals and a park signal. The back-up lights may be actuated by \u201ca combined \u25a0dashboard mounted hand lighting and/or reverse gear lighting back-up signal switch.\u201d The turn signals are connected through a conventional <em>blinker </em>mechanism. In backing up, the combination \u2022of \u201cPark,\u201d blinking directional and back-up signals indicates what the signalling vehicle is about to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">Hallman discloses a signal light housing mounted on top of an automobile and having three portions indicating stops, right turns and left turns. One portion is amber colored. The patentee says that \u201csuitable switch and tell tale means are necessary and should be located adjacent the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">The board and the examiner found claim 1 to be fully met by the patent to Smith saying, \u201cthe introductory clause * * stating that the appellant\u2019s back-up light is an \u2018auxiliary\u2019 warning light has no patentable significance but in any event the use of multiple light signals is common practice, as evidenced by the use of dual stop signals on automobiles.\u201d The board further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-17\">\u201cWe further note that auxiliary signal lights designed to be used in conjunction with the usual stoplights, operated jointly with the vehicle brakes, were a common item of commerce available at most of the chain stores specializing in the direct sale of automobile accessories to the driving public. These auxiliary stop-lights were arranged in the rear window of the vehicle to enhance the visibility of the signal. We view this arrangement, of which we take judicial notice, to make obvious the conjoint use of both the conventional back-up lights and the signal light of the British patent for one who chooses to provide a greater visibility of a signal light.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-18\">Claim 2 was held to add only obvious structure to that of claim 1 since it was believed to be \u201cwell known that emphasis can be given to any signal light by flashing\u201d with a device as shown, for example, in Slater.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-19\">Claim 3 was held to add obvious structure to that of claim 2 in that it recites only the \u201cnormal or expected function\u201d of a tell-tale light as in Hallman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-20\">Claim 4 was held to add obvious structure to that of claim 3 since Smith discloses the control of the back-up light by either the reverse gear mechanism or the manual switch. To provide both was believed to be \u201cmerely following the usual practice of shunting an automatic switch with a manual switch as is the case of the manual and door operated switches for the dome light of the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-21\">The amber color of the back-up light, as set forth in claim 5 was held to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>without \u201cpatentable merit\u201d in view of the Hallman patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">We agree with the board\u2019s decision as above set forth in all respects and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
