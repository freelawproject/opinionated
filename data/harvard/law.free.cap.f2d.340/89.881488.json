There was no diversity of citizenship between the parties. Upon motion of the defendant, Judge Metzner dismissed the second and third causes, on the ground that they did not arise under federal law, and that they were not pendent to the first cause, which did arise under federal law. The opinion is reported at 229 F.Supp. 191. Upon reargument, Judge Metzner adhered to his original determination, and also tacitly denied plaintiff\u2019s request contained in the petition for re-argument for leave to amend the complaint. Plaintiff appeals from these orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-30\">If plaintiff\u2019s three \u201ccauses of action\u201d constitute a single \u201cclaim for relief,\u201d the order of the district court dismissing only two of the causes is not appealable. See 6 Moore, Federal Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tice ff\u00edf 54.33, 54.12[1] (2 ed. 1953). If the three \u201ccauses of action\u201d constitute a multiple \u201cclaim for relief,\u201d the order of the district court is appealable, but only if accompanied by a Rule 54(b) certificate. See 6 Moore, Federal Practice if 54.28 [2]. The district court has not issued a Rule 54(b) certificate in this proceeding. Furthermore, whether plaintiff\u2019s three \u201ccauses of action\u201d constitute a single or a multiple \u201cclaim for relief,\u201d the order of the district court denying leave to amend the complaint is not appealable. See 6 Moore, Federal Practice ffif 54.30[1], 54.12[1],</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s request that we keep his present appeal on our docket while he seeks a Rule 54(b) certificate from the district court <em>nunc pro tunc, is </em>denied. Plaintiff\u2019s alternative request for permission, once he procures a Rule 54(b) certificate, to proceed here on the same papers as he filed in this appeal, will be determined if and when he procures such a certificate, and appeals again.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
