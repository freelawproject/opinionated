Shephard, deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">Mr. Shephard, a resident of Columbus, Ohio, owned practically all of the capital stock of a small family corporation, Croppers Laundry, Inc. He entered into a contract to purchase this stock on January 31, 1944, for $29,000, making an initial cash payment of $8,000, and executing eighty-four promissory notes of $250 each, plus interest in the amount of $46.80, payable monthly. Although the stock was purchased personally by Mr. Shephard and registered in his name, the corporation became a joint obligor on these notes and executed a chattel mortgage on its physical assets as security therefor. The corporation paid most of the notes as they became due and advanced additional sums of cash to Mr. Shephard over a period of several years. Also, some of the notes were paid personally by Mr. Shephard as they fell due. In this way he acquired almost all of the capital stock of the corporation, partly with his own money and principally with money advanced by the corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">The money expended by the corporation for the payment of notes which had been issued for the purchase of the stock, and for cash advances made to Mr. Shephard, were carried on the corporation books as \u201cAccounts receivable, Clarence E. Shephard.\u201d Mr. Shephard made only two payments to the corporation on this account, totaling $3,050. The debit balance on this account as of the date of Mr. Shephard\u2019s death was $24,241.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">For a number of years the books and records of the corporation had been kept and maintained in the office of the corporation\u2019s accountant, and entries were made by him and his employees as transactions occurred and came to his attention. When the accountant for the corporation made inquiry of the administrator of Mr. Shephard\u2019s estate concerning this account, the administrator in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>formed him that it would not be paid. The accountant thereupon charged off this account receivable against the corporation\u2019s earned surplus. This action was taken by the accountant on his own initiative, without authorization by the officers and directors of the corporation, but was reflected in financial statements submitted every four weeks by the accountant to the corporation. Mr. Shephard\u2019s estate was solvent, the principal assets being his shares of stock in the corporation and real estate valued at $25,000. No contention was made in the Tax Court or in this court that the debt was not fully collectible from the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Tax Court held that the cancellation of Mr. Shephard\u2019s indebtedness to the corporation constituted a distribution of property to his estate in 1958, and as such was a taxable dividend for that year, under Sections 301, 316(a) and 317 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Petitioner contends that money paid out by the corporation constituted dividends in the year in which payments were made, and that the taxes due thereon have been barred by limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">It is undisputed that the payments of notes and other advances were carried on the books of the corporation as debts-due from Mr. Shephard, and that Mr. Shephard recognized this indebtedness by making two payments thereon prior to his death. The petitioner made no-showing before the Tax Court that Mr. Shephard declared any of these advances as income for tax purposes for any year during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-18\">The Tax Court said (omitting citations) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-19\">\u201cWhereas the entries may have been made without specific instruction from the corporation acting through its officers, directors or stockholders, it is clear that shortly thereafter the corporation and the Estate knew about the action and accepted, ratified and affirmed it. Petitioner has produced no evidence-to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-20\">\u201cThe petitioner has not met her burden of proof either to establish that the respondent\u2019s determination was wrong, * * * or to support her contention that advances toShephard from the corporation were-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>dividends in the years they were made. * * * Both parties to the transaction prior to Shephard\u2019s death in 1957 treated the transaction as an indebtedness and not as a distribution of earnings. The corporation carried the account on its books as a receivable and for all of its fiscal years from 1945 through 1957 carried the balance due as an asset on its balance sheets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">-X- * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201cThe decedent recognized his debt to the company on at least two occasions by making payments on the account and the payments he made were reflected on the corporate books as credits against the balance then due. Petitioner produced no evidence as to how Shephard treated the advances to him on his own tax returns through the years if he did so at all, and we cannot assume in the absence of such evidence that he reported them as dividends at any prior time. Both parties therefoi-e, so far as this record shows, always treated the transaction as one of corporate loans to the majority stockholder and the petitioner made no showing of other treatment by either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">This court has held that cash withdrawals fi\u2019om a corporation made by a stockholder constitute taxable dividends in the taxable year during which corporate action was taken canceling or charging off such accounts against surplus. Hudson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 99 F.2d 630 (C.A.6), cert. denied, 306 U.S. 644, 59 S.Ct. 584, 83 L.Ed. 1044; Cohen v. Commissioner, 77 F.2d 184 (C.A.6), cert. denied Rosenbaum v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 610, 56 S.Ct. 129, 80 L.Ed. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Petitioner contends that a \u201cconstructive dividend\u201d requires proof of \u201ceconomic benefit,\u201d relying upon Whitfield v. Commissioner, 311 F.2d 640 (C.A.5). It seems obvious to us that by the cancellation of this indebtedness there was an economic benefit both to the estate of Mr. Shephard and to petitioner as transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">It is our opinion that the findings of the Tax Court are not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218, but to the contrary are clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\">. Twenty-five shares of stock were paid for by Mr. Shephard\u2019s sister-in-law. One qualifying share was held in the name of Scott Reed but actually belonged to Mr. Shephard.
