Inside the oval at the top is the silhouette of a girl\u2019s head facing to the left, underneath which and below the center of the oval are the words</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">CHILDREN SHAMPOO</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-20\">There is a disclaimer of record reading, \u201cApplicant disclaims the words \u2018Children Shampoo\u2019 separate and apart from the mark as shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-21\">Opposer, Hans Schwarzkopf, a German Company of Hamburg-Altona, Germany, relies on two existing registrations, No. 627,141 of May 15, 1956, on a mark consisting solely of the silhouette of a woman\u2019s head looking to the left, for shampoo, and No. 317,195 of September 18, 1934, on a mark consisting of two silhouettes of women\u2019s heads spaced apart and facing each other between which is the word \u201cHairgloss.\u201d The latter mark is said by the board (the registration not being of record) also to be for shampoo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-22\">Appellee\u2019s brief concedes that the products of the parties would be sold in the same channels of trade to the same class of purchasers and also that if there is any doubt as to the correct decision in this case it should be resolved against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-23\">Appellant suggests that we treat the issue as though it involves only an application to register the silhouette portion of the mark, referring to the disclaimer and also to a passage in the stipulation of facts reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-24\">\u201cSaid application [appellee\u2019s] is one for trade mark registration of the silhouette of a human head, which silhouette is used by applicant to designate the John H. Breck, Inc. hair shampoo products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-25\">As to the disclaimer, this does not have the effect of removing from the mark sought to be registered, or from our consideration, the words \u201cCHILDREN SHAMPOO.\u201d It disclaims only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>any <em>exclusive right in </em>those words <em>per se. </em>Appellant seems to recognize this in the following passage in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\"> \u201cIt is of course well established that disclaimed material forming part of a trademark cannot be ignored in determining whether the marks are confusingly similar. Sleeper Lounge Co. v. Bell Manufacturing Co. (9th Circuit) 253 F.2d 720, 117 USPQ 117.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">We agree with that statement. With respect to the passage in the stipulation entered into by the attorneys, the record shows what the mark sought to be registered is and facts cannot be stipulated to be other than what they are shown by the record to be. We therefore treat the mark as we have described it at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The sole issue is as stated by the board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">\u201cThe only question for consideration is whether or not, as used on shampoos, applicant\u2019s mark so resembles the marks of opposer as to be likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The board gave as reasons for deciding that issue in the negative its view that the marks of the parties are readily distinguishable, opposer\u2019s silhouettes being of a woman while applicant\u2019s is obviously intended to be that of a child, and the fact that the representation of a human head is \u201cobviously of a highly suggestive nature\u201d in connection with a shampoo and necessarily entitled only to protection of limited scope as a tx-ademark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">We agree with the board and do not feel that the mere inclusion in appellee\u2019s mark of a silhouette of somewhat different appearance from those in appellant\u2019s marks would be sufficient to make confusion, mistake, or deception likely within the meaning of section 2(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
