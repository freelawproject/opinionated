We find the order invalid because not based on substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and deny the petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">Abbey Auto Parts Corporation (Abbey) with nine employees, and Bethpage Auto Parts, Inc. (Bethpage) with two employees, had withdrawn from a multiemployer collective bargaining arrangement with the Union a sufficient time prior to the signing of a new agreement with the other employers. Shortly thereafter, in April 1962, Abbey and Bethpage pursuant to Section 9(c) (1) (B) of the NLRA filed individual petitions with the Board asserting their timely withdrawal from the multi-employer unit and requesting elections to determine union representation. The Board agreed and on April 15, 1963 ordered elections. A week prior to the date set for elections at Abbey the Union sent the company a letter wherein it stated that it would picket the premises for the purpose of informing the public that the establishment was non-union, but would not in any way interfere with Abbey\u2019s business and was not at all interested in organizing Abbey\u2019s employees, the Union\u2019s purpose being only to protect union interests in the general area. Picketing commenced on May 6, 1963 with the Union representatives carrying two types of placards, one of which read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-15\">To the Public Please Be Advised Abbey Auto Parts is Non-Union</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-18\">This Jeopardizes our Union Standards Please Do Not Patronize</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-19\">Local 239, IBT</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-20\">and the other,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-21\">Don\u2019t Buy at Abbey Non-Union Local 239, Teamsters</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>The Union also distributed handbills to Abbey customers as they entered an adjacent parking lot. On May 10, 1963, the Union resoundingly lost the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The picketing and handbilling continued after the election, and in addition many of Abbey\u2019s customers were approached and x-equested not to do business with Abbey. In the meantime the election had not yet been held at Beth-page, and the Union commenced picketing around that establishment with signs identical to those used at Abbey except for the name, and an identical letter was sent to the Bethpage management. On July 3, Bethpage\u2019s employees also voted the Union down; however, the picketing continued as it had at Abbey. But Beth-page and the Union reached an accord and entered into an agreement about a month later after picket Lewis Sherman, the brother of the Local\u2019s president, informed Bethpage that a possible way to eliminate the picketing would be to sit down and meet with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">After the agreement was signed by Bethpage, Lewis Sherman was assigned to the Abbey picket line. Abbey\u2019s president claimed that Sherman, while present at Abbey, approached him and told him that unless Abbey sat down with the Union, as Bethpage had done, the Union would never leave Abbey alone. Meanwhile, on May 29 Abbey had filed unfair labor practice charges against the Union alleging that the Union\u2019s picketing violated \u00a7 8(b) (7) (B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The Trial Examiner found that the Union engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (7) (B) by picketing Abbey for recognitional and organizational purposes at a time when a valid election under \u00a7 9(c) had been conducted within the preceding twelve months. The Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions and X'ecommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">The Examiner relied on Sherman\u2019s statement, on the withdrawal of pickets at Bethpage after agreement was reached, and on the language of one of the picket signs, \u201cDon\u2019t buy at Abbey. NonUnion. Local 239, Teamsters.\u201d The Examiner found that Bethpage was located directly across the street from Abbey. The Board concedes that this was error, since the two shops are actually more than a mile apart, but held that the error had no effect on the correctness of the decision or its concurrence therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">As against this evidence, it is uncontroverted that in a letter of May 3, 1963 the Union declared its purpose in the picketing to be infoi\u2019mational and not recognitional, and promised to correct any violation of instructions by pickets promptly on being advised. The Union enclosed a copy of its instructions to pickets to patrol peaceably in front of consumer entrances only, and not to have any employees stop work or any deliveries interrupted. The only instance of violation of instructions was the claimed statement by Sherman, who, although a brother of the Local\u2019s president, was not an officer of the Union, but a hired picket on his first such employment in the Bethpage and Abbey picketing. There was no interference with deliveries or with Abbey\u2019s employees. No report was made to the Union of Sherman\u2019s claimed violation of instructions. When a Union member making delivery by truck refused to cross the picket line, a picket reported to a representative of the Local, who came and told the driver to make the delivery. The picketing of Abbey lasted more than 100 days. Some 70 customers of Abbey were visited by Union representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">The Sherman incident was the sole occurrence in even arguably union activity which could be said to give a recognitional color to the picketing. While a union may be bound by actions of its agents other than its elected officers,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we should be hard put to find any such agency here. The other facts relied on are similaxdy weak. The use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>term \u201cnon-union\u201d on the signs was thought by the Examiner to show a desire to change Abbey\u2019s status from nonunion to union and so recognitional. We cannot agree. While it is of course true that any effort to divert business from non-union to union shops has some tendency to make an employer consider the advisability of unionizing, it is not so directly aimed to that end as to support a finding of forcing or requiring an employer to recognize or bargain, and so a \u00a7 8(b) (7) violation. Language similar to that used here has been held to be within the exemption of \u00a7 8(b) (7) (C) and therefore could not serve as evidence of an illegal purpose. McLeod v. Chefs Local 89, 280 F.2d 760, 2 Cir. 1960; N. L. R. B. v. Local 3, IBEW, 317 F.2d 193, 2 Cir. 1963. While this is an 8(b) (7) (B) case, the same tests must be applied in determining whether picketing is solely informational, an exercise of the right of free speech, or whether an object thereof is the forbidden one of forcing or requiring an employer to recognize or bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The evidence of the Union\u2019s effort, generally successful, to keep the picketing of Abbey on an informational rather than coercive plane far outweighs that relied on by the Board. We cannot find that the Board\u2019s conclusions were based on substantial evidence on the record as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R.
