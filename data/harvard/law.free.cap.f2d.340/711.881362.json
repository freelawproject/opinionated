While the trial court was justified in overruling the motion to suppress for the reasons set out in connection with this same search in the opinion affirming the conviction of this defendant on the substantive offense, Hardin v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 324 F.2d 553, the appellant\u2019s contention here is without merit for the further reason that even though the motion to suppress was overruled after a hearing in the absence of the jury, no evidence of the fruits of the search was ever offered in the jury\u2019s presence. The court\u2019s charge was correct and fair, and there is not sufficient merit in the objection to it to warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-22\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
