It will suffice to say that the record considered as a whole amply supports the-Board\u2019s finding that the respondent violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3), by threateningly interrogating some-of its employees with respect to their union activities and by discriminatingly laying off some union sympathizers- and failing to reinstate them to substantially equivalent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-25\">The respondent\u2019s contention that the evidentiary use of the statement attributed to its manager that the Union <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> undertaking to organize its plant \u201cwouldi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>get the boys in trouble\u201d or the statement to an employee attributed to its foreman that he had \u201cbetter not get caught with a Union leaflet\u201d would violate the First Amendment and \u00a7 8(c) of the Act is groundless. Neither \u00a7 8(c) of the Act, 61 Stat. 142, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c) nor the First Amendment prohibits the evidentiary use of statements by management which contain a \u201cthreat of reprisal.\u201d See NLRB v. Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co., 314 U.S. 469, 477, 478, 62 S.Ct. 344, 86 L.Ed. 348 (1941). When considered with the surrounding facts and circumstances the statements quoted above were properly, indeed necessarily, found to contain such a threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-26\"> International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, AFD-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
