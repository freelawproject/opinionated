While so engaged his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\u2022drivers were harassed by men assembled in groups along the highways, the coal in their trucks was in some instances \u25a0dumped, and the drivers molested. All of this had to do with a campaign throughout the area to stop the mining and hauling of coal produced by persons other than signers of the amended National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of the defendant United Mine Workers of America. There was no attempt by defendant to organize plaintiff\u2019s drivers. Indeed, they were neutral to the dispute concerning the amended wage agreement. The defendant\u2019s activities, so far as plaintiff\u2019s drivers were concerned, were \u25a0directed towards forcing the plaintiff to \u25a0cease doing business with non-union coal \u25a0operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">As a result of the activities described, plaintiff\u2019s drivers became apprehensive for their safety and ceased working for plaintiff. His trucking business was forced to shut down (he began driving a truck for an interstate motor freight line) and his trucks were repossessed. In the action before us he sought damages for the business loss resulting. The District Court, trying the ease without a jury, awarded plaintiff compensatory damages in the sum of $15,000.00 and judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Defendant\u2019s appeal argues that there is neither warrant in the record for finding that it was responsible for the treatment of plaintiff\u2019s drivers and their cargoes of coal, nor for the amount of the judgment. The attack upon the judgment is based upon the contentions that plaintiff\u2019s business profits resulted in part, at least, from his payment of sub-standard wages under the Fair Labor Standards Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> combined with the illegal hauling of overweight loads of coal. In addition it is argued that his \u201cequity\u201d in his trucks was overvalued by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> Upon all of the matters controverted there was conflicting evidence, together with evidence in mitigation and exculpation. The District Judge heard it all, he scrutinized it with care and he rendered his judgment, giving to the various factors in testimony, pro and con, such weight as, in his judgment, they deserved. The fact situation with which we are here confronted does <em>not </em>vary in material principle from others heretofore considered by us. Gilchrist v. United Mine Workers of America, 6 Cir., 290 F.2d 36; White Oak Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers of America, 6 Cir., 318 F.2d 591; Allen v. United Mine Workers of America, 6 Cir., 319 F.2d 594. We have reviewed the record, and we have concluded that the findings of the District Judge were supported by substantial evidence and were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-18\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. as amended.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
