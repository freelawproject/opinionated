His motion was based on the claim that, due to the influence of narcotics, he had been unable to understand the nature of the charges against him or to assist in his own defense during the three-day trial. Judge Edelstein found that he had possessed \u201csufficient mental competency to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and was able to assist in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-25\">It appears not to be disputed that Tom was taking narcotics at the time of the trial. But the record does not show, and we have no reason to believe, that the use of narcotics per <em>se </em>renders a defendant incompetent to stand trial. Whether it had such an effect in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>case was an issue of fact, as to which the petitioner had the burden of proof. Johnston v. United States, 292 F.2d 51 (10 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 906, 82 S.Ct. 186, 7 L.Ed.2d 100 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">There is adequate evidentiarysupport for Judge Edelstein\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner did not sustain the burden of proving his incompetency. Norman Lau Kee, Esq., who represented Tom at the trial and had known him for a number of ye\u00e1rs, noticed \u201cnothing unusual\u201d in his appearance or demeanor at trial, and he testified that Tom \u201cappeared to respond to my questions without too much difficulty.\u201d These observations were supported by the testimony of Mr. Rosner, who had represented the government, and Leslie Hall, a medical technician who had talked with Tom at the close of the trial. In addition, Tom conceded that he had worked evenings as a dealer in a card game during the course of the trial, and his statements at the time of sentencing do not indicate that he was then incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
