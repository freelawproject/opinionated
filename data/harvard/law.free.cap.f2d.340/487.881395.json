S.C.A. \u00a7 95a(3) of willfully violating Executive Order No. 6260, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 95a Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-26\">Subsection (1) of 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 95a authorizes the President to regulate transactions in gold \u201c[djuring the time of war or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d Subsection (3) makes willful violation of provisions of section 95a \u201cor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of any * * * regulation issued thereunder\u201d a crime. Executive Order No. 6260, issued by President Roosevelt October 28, 1933, declared the existence of a national banking emergency and, among other things, prohibited the acquisition or possession of gold without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">On December 16, 1950, President Truman proclaimed the existence of a national emergency arising out of the menace of communist aggression. Proclamation No. 2914, 64 Stat. A454 (1950). On November 29, 1960, President Eisenhower declared the continued existence of this emergency, and specifically confirmed Executive Order No. 6260 and the regulations issued thereunder. Exec. Order No. 10896, 25 Fed.Reg. 12281 (1960). Similar action was again taken by President Eisenhower on January 14, 1961 [Exec. Order No. 10905, 26 Fed.Reg. 321 (1961)], and by President Kennedy on July 20, 1962. Exec. Order No. 11037, 27 Fed.Reg. 6967 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Appellants contend that subsection (1) of section 95a conferred regulatory authority upon the President only during the banking emergency of 1933. Since the Government concedes that crisis has long since ended, if appellants\u2019 construction of section 95a(l) were correct Executive Order No. 6260 would no longer be effective (despite the subsequent declarations of Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy based upon the emergency arising from communist aggression), and appellants could not be punished for violating its terms. We cannot accept appellants\u2019 narrow construction of the grant of executive authority in section 95a(l) for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">1. It is contrary to the clear language of subsection (1), which empowers the President to act during time of war, or \u201cany other period of national emergency declared by the President.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">2. Congress re-enacted these words in 1940 and again in 1941 when we can at least say that it was highly unlikely that the intended reference could have been to a continuation of the banking crisis of 1933. Joint Resolution of May 7, 1940, 54 Stat. 179 (1940); First War Powers Act, 1941, 55 Stat. 838 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">3. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy, in issuing the proclamation and executive orders noted above, construed the language of section 95a (1) as conferring regulatory authority in periods of peacetime emergency other than the 1933 banking crisis. So too did President Roosevelt in issuing Executive Order No. 8389, 5 Fed.Reg. 1400 (1940), for the emergency in which President Roosevelt acted was not the banking crisis of 1933, but rather a prewar emergency relating to neutrality and defense. See Proclamation No. 2352, 54 Stat. 2643 (1939). And Congress, though presumably aware of the presidential interpretation reflected in these officially published orders, evidenced no disagreement with it, thus affording \u201cat least some evidence of Congressional approval.\u201d Laycock v. Kenney, 270 F.2d 580, 589 (9th Cir. 1959). See also Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 511, 79 S.Ct. 524, 3 L.Ed.2d 462 (1959)/<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">4. The adoption of the Joint Resolution of May 7, 1940, 54 Stat. 179 (1940), approving Executive Order No. 8389, 5 Fed.Reg. 1400 (1940), was a specific ratification of President Roosevelt\u2019s exercise of section 95a(l) power in an emergency other than war or the 1933 banking crisis. The legislative history of the Joint Resolution reflects a congressional understanding that section 95a(l) authorizes executive action in any peacetime emergency proclaimed by the President. See, e. g., S.Rep. No. 1496, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. (1940); 86 Cong.Rec. 5006, 5172 (1940) (remarks of Senator Wagner); 86 Cong.Rec. 5182 (1940) (rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>amendment to terminate the Joint Resolution on May 1, 1941).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">5. The context in which section 95a appeared in the First War Powers Act, 1941, 55 Stat. 838 (1941), indicates that the use of general language in subsection (1) of section 95a was deliberate. The subsection (1) grant of presidential authority to regulate gold during war or \u201cany period of national emergency\u201d appeared in that Act as section 301 of Title III. Section 303 of the same title granted the President power to censor communications, but only \u201cduring the present war.\u201d Similarly, section 401 of Title IV limited the authority conferred by Titles I and II (but <em>not </em>Title III) to \u201cthe continuance of the present war and for six months after the termination of the war.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Appellants point to two circumstances in support of their thesis that Congress intended the \u201cduring any other period of national emergency\u201d language of section 95a(l) to mean \u201cduring the banking crisis of 1933 * * * \u201d First, the title to the Act of March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1 (1933), which added the quoted words to section 95a(l), reads: \u201cAn Act to provide relief in the existing national emergency in banking, and for other purposes.\u201d Second, the legislative discussion of the measure was concerned largely with the imperative need for action posed by the then existing banking crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">A desire to provide a means for dealing with future emergencies, as well as the 1933 crisis, may reasonably be included among the \u201cother purposes\u201d referred to in the statute\u2019s title. If the title cannot be so construed, we hold that the present case is an appropriate one for application of \u201cthe wise rule that the title of a statute * * * cannot limit the plain meaning of the text.\u201d Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; O. R.R. Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528-529, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1392, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The fact that the brief legislative discussion dealt largely with the banking crisis which provided the immediate occasion for legislative action is little indication that Congress intended to similarly confine the availability of the statutory remedy. There is no direct statement that Congress intended such a limitation, and there are some intimations to the contrary \u2014 for example, Senator Gore\u2019s suggestion that the effectiveness of the bill should be limited to that session of Congress so that its provisions might be given the mature consideration appropriate to permanent legislation (77 Cong. Rec. 62 (1933)); and Congressman Steagall\u2019s statement that the provision simply conferred upon the President the same regulatory power over gold as the President already had in time of war under the Act of October 6, 1917, \u201cregardless of whether or not the country is involved in war.\u201d 77 Cong.Rec. 79 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Since we conclude that the power conferred upon the President by section 95a(l) was not confined to the 1933 banking crisis, but extends to any national emergency proclaimed by the President, the contrary holding in United States v. Briddle, 212 F.Supp. 584 (S.D.Cal.1962), must be disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Appellants concede that, as a factual matter, the emergency declared by Proclamation No. 2914 and reaffirmed by Executive Orders Nos. 10896, 10905, and 11037, still exists. We therefore do not reach appellee\u2019s argument that the existence of a national emergency declared by the President is a political question not reviewable by the courts, and that Bauer v. United States, 244 F.2d 794 (9th Cir. 1957), was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\">.
