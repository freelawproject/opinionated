Although consideration of the report of the presentence investigation, prior to the appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty, was proscribed by the terms of Rule 32(c) (1), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we find such prior consideration by the sentencing Court to be harmless under the circumstances of this case. The appellant had consented to disposition of the case in the district of his arrest, and had expressed his intention to plead guilty, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 20, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and it is clear from the record that his substantial rights were not affected by the District Court\u2019s consideration of the report after consent under Rule 20, but before arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-22\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
