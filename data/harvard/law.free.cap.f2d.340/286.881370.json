A jury verdict was returned in favor of Schilling in the sum of $10,411. Judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">The question here, in simple terms, is: Was the conduct of the union and the picketing which took place at the gate to the job site done with the object of forcing or inquiring Jones to cease doing business with Schilling? In answer to a specific interrogatory the jury said \u201cyes\u201d. The jury answered another interrogatory holding that the picketing had no other object. The broad question presented by this appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to present a factual question for the jury. Appellant contends that its picketing activities were, as a matter of law, legal and not proscribed. The dividing line between forbidden secondary activity and protected primary activity has been the subject of intense litigation both before and after the 1959 amendments to 8(b) (4), which broadened the coverage but also added the express exception that \u201cnothing contained in this clause (B) shall be construed to make unlawful, where not otherwise unlawful, any primary strike or primary picketing.\u201d We need not detail the course of this sometimes complex litigation. It suffices to say that the object of picketing is not something which can always be evaluated mechanically. The vex-y nature of the problem as illustrated by the jurisprudence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>veals that for the facts of this case there is no definitive rigid formula which can be accepted as conclusive. (Local 761, Intern. Union Elec. Radio and Mach. Workers of America AFL-CIO v. N. L. R. B., 366 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 1285, 6 L.Ed.2d 592; Brown Transport Corp. v. NLRB, 5 Cir, 1964, 334 F.2d 334 F.2d 30; Superior Derrick Corp. v. NLRB, 5 Cir, 1960, 273 F.2d 891).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Having in mind that on appeal the evidence and all inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and in support of the jury verdict, the facts \u25a0may be set forth as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">1. On October 3, 1961, J. A. Jones \u25a0Construction Company commenced work \u25a0on a project in Miami, Florida, known .as the Eastern Air Lines major jet overhaul facility. Jones employed subcontractors to perform portions of the work. 'Total employment on the job approximated 600 men. All these personnel belonged to labor organizations and the job was considered to be \u201c100% union\u201d, \u25a0except for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">2. As subcontractors for ready-mixed \u2022concrete, Jones chose two suppliers\u2014 Maul\u00e9 Industries, which had a collective bargaining contract with the appellant 'Teamsters Union; and Schilling, who had no contract with any union and was considered non-union. Both of these \u25a0companies commenced servicing the job in the latter part of October, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">3. As the deliveries continued, J. A. \u25a0Jones became dissatisfied with the service \u2022of Maul\u00e9 Industries, but was well pleased with the service furnished by Schilling. Jones cancelled Maul\u00e9 Industries\u2019 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">4. Schilling was advised that henceforth, it would supply the entire job requirements of ready mixed concrete. Thereafter, Schilling made only six deliveries before trouble developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">5. On May 16, 1962, at about 7:55 A.M, two pickets appeared at the job site. One was the president of the Union, The other had been employed for the sole purpose of picketing. The picketing commenced as Schilling\u2019s truck entered the job site. The sign carried stated: \u201cTruck Drivers of I. E. Schilling Company, come and join us. Teamsters\u2019 Local 290.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">6. While on the job site, Schilling\u2019s truck drivers and trucks were not visible to the pickets and the effect of the picket sign on Schilling\u2019s drivers was limited to the time it took the driver to go through the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">7. On this first morning of picketing, Appellee\u2019s president, Schilling, had driven from his plant, less than a mile away, directly to the J. A. Jones job. The Schilling plant at that specific time was not being picketed. This plant was Schilling\u2019s primary place of business and picketing could readily be carried on there and was, periodically.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">8. Schilling watched his first truck arrive and saw the two pickets emerge from cars. As the picketing continued, all \u201ccrafts\u201d left the job, in number between 500-600 men.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">9. Jones delayed further pours until approximately one week later, May 22, 1962. On that date Schilling arrived at the J. A. Jones job site 15-30 minutes before his truck was scheduled to arrive. At the job site, he noted a picket already waiting; the picket was sitting in an automobile. When the truck entered the job site, the picket emerged and commenced picketing. Again, there was a general work stoppage, with 500-600 men leaving the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">10. The next morning, a g-roup of job stewards, representing a number of building trades unions whose members were employed on the job, met with the J. A. Jones, project manager.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They stated that \u201cthe men would not work on the job while J. A. Jones was pouring concrete with those trucks, and they wanted assurance * * * (that J. A. Jones) * * * would stop pouring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>with those trucks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pro j ect manager, knowing that the only method of getting his job going again was to remove appellee Schilling, sought another supplier, Acme Concrete, after assuring himself that Acme used Appellant Teamsters drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">11. During the period between the first picketing at J. A. Jones \u2014 May 16\u2014 and the second picketing \u2014 May 22 \u2014 appellant picketed other jobs being serviced by Schilling. However, this picketing was conducted in quite a different manner. Thus, an appellant picket would appear on a job, picket for a time, but when he found that no secondary employees walked off, he would leave. Similarly, when a job had once been picketed and no walkout by secondary employees occurred, that job would not be revisited by.the picket.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">12. The purpose of picketing at the plant and jobs of Appellee (according to Appellant) was \u201c * * * in the hopes that it (would) embarrass the employer to the extent that he (would) file a charge and a petition for an election * * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">A review of the record, and especially the facts heretofore recited, discloses that the proof was sufficient to create issues for the jury. These issues were submitted on a clear and correct charge. This Court\u2019s function as to a resolution of those issues was exhausted when, as here, an evidentiary basis was apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Appellant vigorously argues that \u201cthe N. L. R. B. dismissal of the 8(b) (4) charges is res judicata and/or collateral estoppel to this action under Section 303(a).\u201d Here, there was no adjudication by the Board. Schilling filed a charge. The general counsel declined to issue a complaint. Surely, the mere refusal by the general counsel to issue a complaint is not res judicata and can n\u00f3t constitute a collateral estoppel. The failure of the general counsel to issue a- complaint is not necessarily based on the evidence or the merits of a case. (Dunn v. Retail Clerk\u2019s International Association, 307 F.2d 285, 6 Cir., 1962). To dismiss a damage suit on the proposition that the general counsel had refused to proceed would be to deny to the employer his day in court in clear contradiction to the requirements of Section 303 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">The trial court submitted a special interrogatory and thus determined that the jury included $3,846.00 as attorney\u2019s fees in its damage award. We agree with appellant that there was no proof to support this award. This is true because the record clearly reveals that the sum total of attorney\u2019s fees was $1,684.27. This amount would have been recoverable. (Local Union 984, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers of America, AFL-CIO v. Humko, 287 F.2d 231, 6 Cir., 1961). Although the record reveals a fair and impartial attitude by the presiding judge, in denying the motion for a new trial there-was a failure on his part to recognize the disparity between the proof and the jury\u2019s award on the question of attorney\u2019s fees, which technically constituted an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. However, we are of the opinion that justice will better be served if, instead of now remanding the cause for a new trial, we give appellee, in lieu of such remand, the opportunity of remitting the amount of $2,161.73.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">The judgment will stand remanded for a new trial, unless appellee files a remittitur within thirty days in this court for $2,161.73, in which event the judgment will stand affirmed (28 U.S.C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u00a7 2106;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Texas Company v.
