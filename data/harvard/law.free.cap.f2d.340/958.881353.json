American Oil Co., 324 F.2d 903 (7th Cir. 1963), cert. granted, 377 U.S. 930, 84 S.Ct. 1336, 12 L.Ed.2d 294 (May 18, 1964). Following oral argument on June 3, 1964, we ordered that further action \u201cbe withheld until the Supreme Court has acted on the Independent Petroleum Workers\u2019 case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-18\">The Supreme Court on certiorari to this court in Independent Petroleum Workers of America, Inc. v. American Oil Co., on November 23, 1964, 85 S.Ct. 271, affirmed this court\u2019s judgment by an equally divided Court. Because of the similarity of issues, the Supreme Court decision in Independent Petroleum Workers is determinative of the issue presented in the instant case. On that basis the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
