Holmes, has appealed his conviction in a bench trial of selling narcotics in violation of Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a) and of receiving, concealing, buying, selling and facilitating the transportation, concealment and sale of narcotics in violation of Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174. The Trial Judge imposed a sentence of six years on each of the two counts to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-22\">The record discloses, <em>inter alia, </em>that after a conversation relative to purchase of narcotics between Agent Donald W. Tucker and Emerson Williamson, the latter took Agent Tucker on a search for his \u201cconnection.\u201d When defendant was seen approaching Emerson Williamson, he identified him as his connection, \u201cRick.\u201d After a conversation between the defendant and Emerson Williamson, the latter told Agent Tucker that the \u201cdeal\u201d was set, and promised defendant that he and Agent Tucker would return. They did return after Agent Tucker secured some money from the U. S. Government. They picked up defendant who directed them to drive to several locations one after the other. Of one, he said, \u201cThe man I am copping from owns that station,\u201d and went in. He came back saying, \u201cWe just missed my man.\u201d At another place, he said, \u201cMy man owns a joint, or a tavern at that location,\u201d but after walking around the comer, he came back with the comment, \u201cWe just missed him again.\u201d When Agent Tucker asked defendant about the quality of the narcotics, the defendant told him it was very good: \u201cthe same stuff\u201d as he got on the street and that he sold from two to three \u201cspoons\u201d per day. Defendant in his testimony denied that he made those state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ments, presenting an issue of credibility for the Trial Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">At the last location to which he directed them, the defendant asked for $80 to purchase narcotics and received official government funds from Agent Tucker. Defendant himself testified that he received the funds from Williamson. After twenty minutes he came back and handed Emerson Williamson a package with the remark, \u201cHere is the stuff.\u201d The package was subsequently passed to Agent Tucker in the defendant\u2019s presence. In a statement made by the defendant after his arrest, and admitted into evidence at his trial, he admitted that he had directed Agent Tucker and Williamson to the various different locations to make them think that he was looking for his \u201cconnection.\u201d He also stated at the trial that he acquired the narcotics from a \u201cMr. Foots,\u201d whom he previously knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Defendant contends that the evidence shows him to have acted merely as procuring agent and not as a seller and that there was a fatal variance between the indictment charging a sale to Agent Tucker and the evidence which he feels shows only a sale to Williamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> However, we need not decide these issues because there is no question in our minds that defendant was properly found guilty of violating Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 as set out in Count II of the indictment, which did not need to contain the name of a purchaser. Jackson v. U. S., 8 Cir., 1963, 325 F.2d 477, 478; Robison v. U. S., 9 Cir., 1964, 329 F.2d 156, 157. Contrary to the argument of defendant, the Trial Judge could on this record have found defendant guilty of receiving, concealing, and facilitating the transportation, concealment and sale of narcotics. Washington v. U. S., 5 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 687, 690, in which Coronado v. U. S., 5 Cir., 1959, 266 F.2d 719, 720, is cited with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The sentences were concurrent and even if we concluded, as we do not, that the evidence did not support conviction of an illegal sale under Count I, the conviction must be affirmed. Hirabayashi v. U. S., 320 U.S. 81, 85, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
