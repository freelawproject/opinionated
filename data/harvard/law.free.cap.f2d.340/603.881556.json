The prisoner\u2019s petition alleges in substance that the respondent has refused to mail his letters addressed to the N.A.A.C.P. and the Office of the Attorney General of the United States seeking legal assistance. In addition he asserts that some enclosures were extracted by prison authorities without his knowledge or approval from certain of his letters which were mailed. Finally, the petitioner claims that he \u201cis being denied his right of access to the courts\u201d and that he has been \u201csubjected to personal reprisals\u201d for seeking to acquire counsel to assert his rights under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\"> Some of these allegations are concededly rather vague and general,, and the petition contains no particularized statement of background facts and conduct. However, we feel that claims of legal substance should not be forfeited because of a failure to state them with technical precision. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 502, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (separate opinion of Frankfurter, J.). Coleman's petition alleges nonfrivolous matters which, if true, entitle him to the requested equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">We think the district court should either offer the petitioner counsel to assist him in amending his petition or afford him an opportunity to particularize his allegations. The court may then consider whether the petition sufficiently supports its general allegations of non-frivolous matters to justify an evidential hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
