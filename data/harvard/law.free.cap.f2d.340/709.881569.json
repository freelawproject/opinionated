The judgment is based upon a jury finding that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in the operation of his automobile which was involved in a collision with the defendant\u2019s car. While the question is not without some doubt, we think this record contains evidence upon which reasonable men could disagree concerning negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s part. As such, that question was properly one for the jury to decide. McClure v. Price, 300 F.2d 538, 543-544 (4 Cir. 1962); Crosby v. Meredith, 300 F.2d 323, 324 (4 Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
