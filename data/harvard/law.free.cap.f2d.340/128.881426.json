DAVIES, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b179-20\">This action was first instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri to review administrative action taken by the District Director of Immigration and Naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-21\">The appellants, Dr. Manuel Mendez and Teresa Lastra de Mendez, his wife, are Mexican nationals who, accompanied by a son, were admitted into the United States in 1955 as exchange visitors under the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While residing in Baltimore, Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>a second son was born to them, August 31, 1956. In that same year the Information and Educational Exchange Act under which the appellants were admitted<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was amended<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\u201cNo person admitted as an exchange visitor under this section * * * shall be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa * * * or for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, until it is established that such person has resided and been physically present in a cooperating country or countries for an aggregate of at least two years following departure from the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In 1957 Dr. Mendez applied for an extension of his temporary stay in the United States. By letter dated October 2, 1957, he was informed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A04\">\u201cPresent law and regulations provide that any alien who. was admitted to the United States after June 4,1956, as an Exchange Visitor, or otherwise acquired the status of an Exchange Visitor after that date shall not be eligible to apply for and receive an immigration visa, for permanent residence, or a non-immigrant visa as a trainee or to perform temporary services in the United States, or for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, unless the Consular Officer is satisfied that such an alien has resided and been physically present abroad for an agree-gate of at least two years since his departure from the United States, following the termination of his Exchange Visitor\u2019s status, in a country or countries cooperating in the Exchange Visitors Program. This includes any Exchange Visitor who is granted an extension of his temporary stay in the United States after September 21, 1956.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">After acknowledging that he had been informed of the conditions that would attach if he were granted an extension, Dr. Mendez again submitted his application for extension of temporary stay in this country which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">In 1961 the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was amended by adding Sec. 212(e), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(e),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to provide for a waiver by the Attorney General of the United States of the two year x*esidence abroad requirement upon favorable recommendation of the Secretary of State made pursuant to x'equest of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization after he had determined that departure from the United States would impose exceptional hardship upon the alien\u2019s spouse or child if the spouse or child were a citizen of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">In August of 1962 after the extension of their temporary stay had expired, Dr. Mendez and his wife each applied to the Distx\u2019ict Director of Immigration and Natux'alization <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for a waiver of the two year foreign residence requix*ement, basing their applications upon the alleged exceptional hardship it would impose upon their United States citizen son if compliance were enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">The District Director concluded that the \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d standard had not been met, and he declined to submit a request to the Secx-etary of State for a recommendation to the Attorney Genei\u2019al that the waiver be granted. Upon a subsequent motion to reconsider the applications, the District Director again found that the degree of hardship requix-ed by the statute had not been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">Predicating jurisdiction upon the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, appellants brought this action seeking judicial review of the Distx\u2019ict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Director\u2019s refusal to submit the waiver applications to the Secretary of State. It was contended in Count One of the Amended Complaint that the District Director\u2019s ruling was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, a usurpation of legislative power and contrary to law. Equitable relief was sought in Count Two by requesting cancellation of. their Exchange Visitor visas, and in effect changing their status to that of \u201cnon-quota immigrants\u201d under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a) (27) (C). The District Director\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. Mendez v. Major, D.C., 226 F.Supp. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">An appeal was then perfected to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In view of the 1961 amendment to See. 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1105a (a), which provides for initial review in the Circuit Courts of Appeals of \u201call final orders of deportation heretofore or hereafter made against all aliens within the United States pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 1252(b) of this title * * * \u201d, we must first determine whether the Court below had jurisdiction to review the denial by the District Director of the relief sought under Sec. 212(e). The phrase \u201cfinal orders of deportation\u201d has recently been construed by the United States Supreme Court in Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281, the Court holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201cIt can hardly be contended that the meaning of the phrase \u2018final orders of deportation\u2019 is so clear and unambiguous as to be susceptible of only a narrow interpretation confined solely to determinations of deportability. If anything, the literal language would appear to include a denial of discretionary relief, made during the same proceedings in which deportability is determined, which effectively terminates the proceedings. In arriving at the intended construction of this language, we must therefore inevitably turn to the purpose of Congress in enacting this legislation. The fundamental purpose behind \u00a7 106(a) was to abbreviate the process of judicial review of deportation orders in order to frustrate certain practices which had come to the attention of Congress, whereby persons subject to deportation were forestalling departure by dilatory tactics in the courts. \u2022x * -\u00bb\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did not view the decision in Foti as indicating an intention to include within the scope of See. 106(a) all discretionary determinations relating in any way to deportation proceedings and declined initial jurisdiction to review a denial of a petition for a waiver under Sec. 212(e) which was made prior to and separate from any deportation proceedings. Sa\u00ednala v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 5 Cir. 1964, 336 F.2d 7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The appellee neither denied nor explained by answer any of the allegations contained in the Amended Complaint, but instead relied upon the administrative record in support of his motion for summary judgment which the District Court granted. We think that such procedure was entirely proper. Todaro v. Pederson, D.C., 205 F.Supp. 612, aff\u2019d 6 Cir. 1962, 305 F.2d 377, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 891, 83 S.Ct. 190, 9 L.Ed.2d 124; Kalatjis v. Rosenberg, 9 Cir. 1962, 305 F.2d 249. Cf. Montgomery v. Ffrench, 8 Cir. 1962, 299 F.2d 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">The contention of appellants that to enforce the two year residence abroad requirement would be in violation of their United States citizen son\u2019s constitutional rights is without substance. There can be no doubt that Congress has the power to determine the conditions under which an alien may enter and remain in the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956; Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586; United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 70 S.Ct. 309, 94 L.Ed. 317; even though the conditions may impose a certain amount of hardship upon an alien\u2019s wife or children. See Swartz v. Rogers, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 254 F.2d 338; United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir. 1956, 233 F.2d 705, aff\u2019d 353 U.S. 72, 77 S.Ct. 618, 1 L.Ed.2d 652; Papageorgiou v. Esperdy, S.D.N.Y.1963, 212 F.Supp. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">There is no merit in appellants\u2019 contention that it was improper for the District Director to resort to the legislative history of Sec. 212(e) in construing the phrase \u201cexceptional hardship\u201d. It cannot be said that the phrase is so clear and unambiguous as to be susceptible of only one meaning, and it was, therefore, necessary for the District Director to look to the intent of the Congress in passing the Section to determine the proper standard to apply. Though he did find that there was a degree of personal hardship and inconvenience to appellants\u2019 citizen son, his further determination that it was not the degree of exceptional hardship contemplated by the statute was neither capricious, arbitrary nor an abuse of discretion. Talavera v. Pederson, 6 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The remaining contention of any substance is that the appellants were entitled to equitable relief because when they entei-ed the United States as Exchange Visitors they <em>could </em>have entered as immigrants pursuant to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a) (27) (C), and no one, including the personnel of the United States Consulate who granted their visas, informed them of this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Nowhere do we find any requirement that <em>all </em>possibilities under the Nationality and Immigration Act be explained to an alien who desires to enter the United States, Diminich v. Esperdy, 2 Cir. 1961, 299 F.2d 244, and as was said in Kalatjis v. Rosenberg, 305 F.2d 249, \u201c * * the government made no misleading statement to appellant[s], nor had it taken any misleading position on which appellant[s] could or did rely to his [their] detriment.\u201d The appellants here were fully informed of the consequences if an application for an extension of stay were granted and, this being so, they are not entitled to the equitable relief which they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-22\">. 62 Stat 6 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. 62 Stat. 6 (1948), amended 66 Stat. 276 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\">. 70 Stat 241 (1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-17\">. 75 Stat. 527-535 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-18\">. 22 C.F.R., Sec. 63.6 (j) (which sets forth procedure).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">.
