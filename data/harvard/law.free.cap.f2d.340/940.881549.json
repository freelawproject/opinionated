(\u201cthe bankrupt\u201d), appeals from a District Court order confirming a Referee\u2019s order declaring null and void a chattel mortgage of the bankrupt held by her. Relying on Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110, the trustee in bankruptcy sought to avoid the mortgage on the ground that it was voidable under New York law because there was an unreasonable delay between delivery and filing. We reverse because, in this case, the two-week time lapse was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">On April 23, 1959, Mrs. Fishman, a widow acting without the advice or assistance of counsel, loaned $20,000 to her long-time employer\u2019s corporation, the bankrupt, which at the time conducted a mailing, printing and advertising service. In return, she received a promissory note and, as security, an assignment of accounts receivable and a chattel mortgage, both subject to prior instruments. The chattel mortgage \u2014 initialled by both parties \u2014 was dated April 27, 1959, and acknowledged by a notary on April 29. Although the employer promised to assume the duty of complying with further formalities, the instrument was not filed in the Queens County Register\u2019s Office until May 13, 1959. Some eight months later Raymond Service, Inc. was adjudicated bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">In the hearings and arguments before both the Referee and the District Court, and indeed on this appeal, the parties focused on the validity of Mrs. Fishman\u2019s contention that there was no delay whatever because the mortgage was delivered on May . 13, the date it was filed. But, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the propriety of the Referee\u2019s finding that delivery occurred two weeks before filing, we are persuaded, on the record before us, that it was error to hold that this hiatus required voiding the chattel mortgage. The Referee simply stated, without more, that \u201cunder the reported decisions\u201d there was an \u201cunusual and unnecessary, and an unwarranted delay in filing\u201d; the District Court in its opinion accepted this statement without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">We read the authorities quite differently. During the period relevant to this case, the New York Lien Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 33, made chattel mortgages which were not filed as provided therein void as against creditors of the mortgagor and subsequent good faith purchasers and mortgagees for value, but specified no time for filing. \u00a7\u00a7 230, 232.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The New York courts, however, repeatedly held that filing was required within a reasonable time after ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>eeution of the instrument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What constituted a reasonable time presented a question of fact to be determined upon all the circumstances in each case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Some courts have, however, held as a matter of law that a one week delay is not unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And we have not been directed to a single case holding that a delay in filing of only two weeks is unreasonable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of these authorities and the special facts of this case, we do not believe the fortnight delay justifies voiding the chattel mortgage. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be, as one New York court declared, \u201can improper exercise of a legislative function, inj'ecting into the statute something apparently not within the legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Considering the virtually fiduciary duty owed by the bankrupt to Mrs. Fishman and her good faith reliance on the promise to file the instrument within the proper time, it would be Draconian to set aside the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">It is true that some cases allude to the relevance of claims intervening during the period of delayed filing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And here two claims, totalling $28.62, did arise during the two-week period. Nevertheless, we do not deem this factor controlling when applied to the particular situation before us. First, the language in Huber v. Ehlers, 76 App.Div. 602, 79 N.Y.S. 150 (1902), upon which the supposed significance of intervening claims rests is dictum for the decision rested on the ground that the rights as between the intervening creditor and the mortgagee had been conclusively determined in a prior suit. And surely'the mere existence of an intervening claim is not alone determinative,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for otherwise a one-day delay might be fatal without even a showing of unreasonableness in the total context.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-20\">Finally, reasonableness must be j'udged in light of the objective of the filing requirement \u2014 to enable diligent creditors to know the truth regarding their debtors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And the \u201cconsequences to the mortgagee of his neglect should,\u201d as Judge Learned Hand once remarked, \u201cbe measured by its result upon others.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But on the record before us the trustee, who stands in the shoes of the pre-filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>creditors, has made no showing whatever that they were prejudiced in any way by the two-week delay. Indeed, it would be unrealistic to assume that creditors with <em>de minimis </em>claims of $22.50 or $6.12 were in the least concerned with the bankrupt\u2019s secured obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\">.
