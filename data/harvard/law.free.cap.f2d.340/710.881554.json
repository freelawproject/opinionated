On appeal he asserts a number of errors, including the insufficiency of the evidence relating to one count of the indictment and the prejudicial effect of certain statements made by the court in its charge to the jury. In addition, he complains of the admission into evidence of a tape recording of a telephone conversation between the appellant and certain government agents, asserting the Government did not lay a proper foundation for the admission of the recording and that, since certain portions of the tape were unintelligible, the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>abused his discretion in allowing the jury to hear the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">After a careful review of the record, we find no fatal error in the proceedings in the District Court. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
