He brought this diversity negligence action in that district seeking to recover damages for his personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-24\">The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of defendant, and the trial judge subsequently denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-25\">The motion for judgment n. o. v. was properly denied. There was sufficient evidence to justify the defendant\u2019s verdict and we find no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s claims that he is entitled to a new trial because of allegedly prejudicial errors in the admission of testimony at the trial. He contends that it was improper in this civil suit to permit a Rochester police officer who took charge at the accident scene, investigated the accident, and who freed plaintiff from the wrecked truck, to testify to oral admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>sions plaintiff made to the officer at the scene and some few minutes later at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">These admissions, relating to whether plaintiff entered the intersection against the red light, were contradictory to plaintiff\u2019s testimony at trial. As such, in plaintiff\u2019s civil suit, they were admissible against plaintiff under well-known exceptions to the hearsay rule, even though the officer testified that he had not told plaintiff that plaintiff might remain silent, and at the conclusion of the hospital visit told plaintiff he was \u201cgoing to give him a ticket for going through a red light.\u201d IV Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 1048ff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
