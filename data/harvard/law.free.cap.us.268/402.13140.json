Lombard, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">The necessary inference from the repealing clause, Act of 1918, \u00a7 2, is that in subdivision 7 we shall find some class specified which but for the words \u201c except as specified \u201d would be restricted by Rev. Stats. \u00a7 2169. Obviously this must refer to a class of persons who under prior laws were not subject to naturalization. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>12 Wheat. 419 at page 438.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">Looking at subdivision 7, what persons are specified? None of its provisions has any bearing on the question except as they, show that every provision of the 7th subdivision h,as in view the speedy naturalization of those engaged in any public service of the United States having relation to the conduct of the War. The natural meaning of these words is that any Filipino and any alien and any Porto Rican, all having the qualifications set forth, are the persons \u201c specified \u201d in the 7th subdivision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-8\">As both. Filipinos and Porto Ricans were already eligible to naturalization and needed nothing to save them from the limitation of Rev. Stats. \u00a7 2169, the words \u201cexcept as \u2019specified \u201d must have had reference to- \u201c any aliens\u2019\u201d as the class as to which that section was repealed or enlarged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">This construction of the Act of May 9, 1918, is the only one which will give effect to all the words. From the language, it is clear that Congress intended to enlarge \u00a7 2169 as to certain persons. That section does not set forth the qualifications\u2019necessary to obtain naturalization, but spates the races to whom the privileges of naturalization are limited.- Therefore, any enlargement of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>must extend the privileges of naturalization to some race or races not heretofore .eligible \u2014 not to all members of the race, released from the limitations of \u00a7 2169, but only to those bearing the qualifications required by subdivision 7<em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">The Government has argued that the addition was solely the inclusion of Filipinos and Porto* Ricans. This cannot have been the fact because Filipinos arid Porto Ricans could already be naturalized under \u00a7 30 of the Act of June 29, 1906, and therefore as to them any addition would be unnecessary and superfluous. <em>In re Bautista, </em>245 Fed. 765; <em>In re Giralde, </em>226 Fed. <em>826; In re Mallari, </em>239 Fed. 416; <em>In re Monico Lopez, </em>Naval Digest 1916, p. 207 (Supreme Court of D. C. 1915); 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 12; Letter of Solicitor Gen. Davis to Secretary of Labor, January 4, 1916, reaffirming opinion of Atty. Gen. Bonaparte.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASI\">All other aliens except Asiatics could of course be naturalized under \u00a7 2169; so, unless the words \u201c except as specified \u201d refer to \u201c any aliens \u201d as specified in subdivision 7 and these words in turn include in their meaning <em>\u201c </em>Asiatics,\u201d the entire exception becomes superfluous. The words \u201c any alien \u201d as used in the naturalization laws are nowhere defined, and retain their natural meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">The Act of 1918 repealed part of the Act of June 30, 1914, and part of the Act of June 25, 1910, restating the repealed parts but omitting in the re-enactment of the Act of 1914 significant words used in the former act. Such omission implies an alteration in the purpose. As the language of the Act of May 9, 1918, is clear, congressional debates and committee reports are not admissible to influence the interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aou\">The weight of authority is in favor of the naturalization of the appellant. The records of the Bureau of Naturalization show that at least eighty-seven Asiatics have been naturalized in continerital United States under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the Acts in question divided among ten naturalization districts. All but nine of these were naturalized prior to the enactment of the statute of July 19, 1919. In addition two hundred and thirteen Asiatics were naturalized by the United States. District Court for the District of Hawaii.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlVY\">The construction placed upon a statute by an executive department charged with its administration is entitled to great weight. The fact that, after the war was over and the need for further recruits had ceased, the Department altered the interpretation formerly placed on the Act of 1918, is of little value in showing the construction contemporaneously with its passage. Aliens-having rendered military service upon promise of citizenship should not later have the citizenship withdrawn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">Appellant is entitled to naturalization under the Act of July 19, 1919.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-6\"><em>Mr. Assistant Attorney General </em>Donovan, with whom the <em>Solicitor General </em>was on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-7\">Mr. Justice Butler</author>\n<p id=\"AH0\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A8T\">Hidemitsu Toyota, a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, entered -the United States in 1913. He served .substantially-all-the time between November of that year and May, 1923, in the United States Coast Guard Service. This was a part of the naval force of the United States nearly ail of the'time the United States was engaged in the recent war. He received eight, or more honorable discharges, arid, some \u00f3f therii were for service during the war. May 14, 1921, he filed his petition for naturalization in the United States district court for the district of Massachusetts. The petition was granted, and a certificate of naturalization was issued to him. This case arises on a petition to cancel the certificate -on the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>it was illegally procured. \u00a7 15, Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596, 601. It is agreed that if a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of \u00a7 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1918, c. 69, 40 Stat. 542, or under the Act of July 19, 1919, c. 24, 41 Stat. 222, Toyota is legally naturalized.

An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and that court under \u00a7 239, Judici\u00e1l Code, certified to this court. the following questions: (1) Whether a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of \u00a7 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1918, and (2) whether such subject may legally be naturalized under the Act of July 19, 1919. The material provisions of these enactments are printed in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Until 1870, only aliens being free white persons were eligible to citizenship. In that year,, aliens of African nativity and persons of African descent were made eligible. See <em>Ozawa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>260 U. S. 178, 192. The substance of prior legislation is expressed in \u00a7 2169, Revised Statutes, which is: \u201c The provisions of this Title [Naturalization] shall apply to aliens being free white persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent.\u201d A person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, is not eligible under that section. <em>Ozawa </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>198.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It has. long been the rule that in ord\u00e9r t\u00f3 be .admitted to citizenship, an alien is required, at least two years prior to his admission, to declare his intention to become a citizen, and to show that he has resided continuously in the United States for at least five years immediately preceding his admission.

But at different tim\u00e9s, as to specially designated aliens serving in the armed forces of the United States, Congress modified and lessened these requirements. \u00a7 2166, Revised Statutes (Act of July 17, 1862, \u00a7 21, c. 200, 12 Stat. 594, 597); Act of July 26, 1894, c. 165, 28 Stat. 123, 124; Act of June 30, 1914, c. 130, 38 Stat. 392, 395. In each of the first two of these acts,, the-phrase \u201cany alien\u201d is used'as a part of the description of the. person for whose benefit the act was passed. In the last, the language is \u201c any alien . . . who may, under existing law, become a citizen, of the United States.\u201d Prior to this act, it had been held .that the phrase \u201c any alien,\u201d used in the earlier acts, did not enlarge the classes defined in \u00a7 2169, <em>In re Buntaro Kumagai, </em>(1908) 163 Eed. 922; <em>In re Knight, </em>(1909) 171 Fed. 299; <em>Bessho </em>v. <em>United States, </em>(1910) 178. Fed. 245; <em>In re Alverto, </em>(1912) 198 Fed. 688. The language used in the Act of 1914 merely expresses what was implied in the earlier provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The seventh subdivision of \u00a7 4, of the act of 1918, per-: mits \u201c any native-born Filipino \u201d or \u201c any alien, or any Porto Rican not a citizen of the United States \u201d belonging respectively to the classes there described, on presentation of the required declaration of intention,, to pen tition for naturalization without proof of five years\u2019 residence within the United States; and the act permits \u201c any alien \u201d serving in the forces of the United. States \u201c during the tim\u00e9 this country is engaged in the present, war \u201d to file his petition for naturalization without making the preliminary declaration of intention and without proof of five years\u2019 residence in the United States. The act of. 1919 gave \u201c any person of foreign birth \u201d there mentioned,\" the benefits of the seventh subdivision of \u00a7 4. Evidently, a principal purpose of these acts was to facilitate the naturalization of service-men of the classes specified, there is hothing to show an intention to eliminate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>definition of eligibility in \u00a7 2169 the distinction based on color or face. Nor is there anything to indicate that, if the seventh subdivision stood .alone, the words \u201c any alien \u201d should be taken to mean more than did the same words when used in the acts of 1862 and 1894. But \u00a7 2 of the act of 1918 provides that nothing in the act shall repeal or in any way enlarge \u00a7 2169 <em>\u201c </em>except as specified in the seventh subdivision of this Act and under the limitation therein defined.\u201d This .implies some enlargement of \u00a7 2169 in respect of color and race; but it also indicates a purpose.not to eliminate all distinction based on color .and race so long continued in the naturalization laws. If it was intended to make such change and to extend the privilege of naturalization to all races, the provision of \u00a7 2 so limiting the enlargement of \u00a7 2169 would be inappropriate. And if the phrase \u201c any .alien \u201d in the seventh subdivision is-read literally, the qualifying words \u201c being free white persons \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>of African nativity \u201d in \u00a7 2169 are without significance. See <em>In re Para, </em>269 Fed. 643, 646; <em>Petition of Charr, </em>273 Fed. 207, 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">When the act of 1918 was passed, it was doubtful whether \u00a7 30 of the act of 1908 extended , the privil\u00e9ge of naturalization to all citizens \"of the Philippine Islands. They were held eligible for naturalization in <em>In re Bautista, </em>245 Fed. 765, and in <em>In re Mallari, </em>239 Fed. 416. And see 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 12. They were held not eligible in <em>In re Alverto, </em>198 Fed. 688, in <em>In re Lampitoe, </em>232 Fed. 382, and in <em>In re Rallos, </em>241 Fed. 686. But we hold that until the passage, of that act, Filipinos not heing \u201c free white persons \u201d or \u201c of African nativity \u201d were not eligible, and that the effect of the act of 1918 was to make eligible, and to.authorize the naturalization of, nativebom Filipinos of whatever color or race having the qualifications specified in the seventh subdivision of \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Under the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain, December 10, 1898, 30 Stat. 1754, Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>was'authorized to determine the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the Philippine Islands. And by the act of July 1, 1902, \u00a7 4, c. 1369, 32 Stat. 691, 692, it was declared that all inhabitants continuing to reside therein who were Spanish subjects on April 11, 1899, and then resided in the Islands, and their childreq born subsequent thereto, <em>\u201c </em>shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine Islands and as such entitled to the protection of the United States, except such as shall have elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain,\u201d according to the treaty. The citizens of the Philippine Islands are not aliens. See <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>192 U. S. 1, 13. They owe no allegiance to any foreign government. They were not eligible for naturalization under \u00a7 2169 because not. aliens and so not within its -terms. By \u00a7 30 of the Act of 1906, it is provided: <em>\u201c </em>That all the applicable provisions of the naturalization laws of the United States shall apply to and be held to authorize the admission to citizenship of all persons not citizens who owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and who may become residents of any State or organized Territory of the United States, with the following modifications: The applicant shall not be required to renounce allegiance to any foreign sovereignty; he shall make his declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States at least two years prior to his admission; and residence within the jurisdiction of the United States, owing.such permanent allegiance, Shall be regarded as residence within the United States within the. meaning of the five years\u2019' residence clause of the existing law.\u201d. (34 Stat. 606.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Section 26 of that act repeals certain sections of Title XXX of the Revised Statutes, but leaves \u00a7 2169 in force. It is to be applied as if it were included in the act of 1906. Plainly, the element of alienage included in \u00a7 2169 did not apply to the class made eligible by \u00a7 30 of the act of 1906. The element of color and race included in that section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>is not specifically dealt with by \u00a7 30, and, \u00e1s it has long been the national policy to maintain the distinction of color and race, radical change is not lightly to be deemed to have been intended. \u201c Persons not citizens who owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and who may become residents of any State \u201d may include Malays, Japanese and Chinese and others not eligible under the distinction as to color and race. As under \u00a7 30 all the applicable provisions of the naturalization laws apply, the limitations based on color and race remain; and the class made' eligible by \u00a7 30 must be limited to those of the color and rac\u00e9 included by \u00a7 2169. As Filipinos are not aliens and owe. allegiance to the United States, there are strong reasons for relaxing as to them the restrictions which do not exist in favor of aliens.who are barred because of their color and race. And in view of thojpolicy of Congress to limit the naturalization of aliens to white persons and to those of African^nativity or descent the implied enlargement of \u00a7 2169 should be taken at the minimum. The legislative history of the act indicates that the intention of Congress was not to enlarge \u00a7 2169, except in respect of Filipinos qualified by the specified service. Senate Report No. 388, pp. 2, 3, 8. House Report No. 502, pp. 1, 4, Sixty-fifth Congress, Second Session. See also Congressional Record, vol. 56, part 6, pp. 6000-6003. And we hold that the words \u201c any alien \u201d in the seventh subdivision are limited by \u00a7 2169 to aliens of the color and race there specified. We also hold that the phrase \u201c.any person of foreign birth \u201d in the act of 1919 is not more comprehensive than the words \u201c any alien \u201d in the act of 1918. It follows that the questions certified must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The answer to the first question is: <em>No.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The answer to the second question is: <em>No.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"AEx\">The Chief J\u00a1ustice dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> \u201cSeventh.
