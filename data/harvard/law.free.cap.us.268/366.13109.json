A part of this charge was the amount paid the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway for transporting the car from the line of the Missouri Pacific to the warehouse of the respondent. This switching rate was properly a part of the <em>\u201c </em>freight charges \u201d and, therefore, the St. Louis-San Francisco shared in the freight charges. Notwithstanding the absolute liability of the initial carrier, under the Interstate Commerce Act, a presumption arises, in the absence of proof as to where the loss or damage to the shipment occurred, that the delivering carrier was negligent, in a suit against an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>mediate or delivering carrier. <em>Georgia etc. R. R. </em>v. <em>Blish Milling Co., </em>241 U. S. 190. In a suit for loss or damage to freight in transit, there is no presumption against an intermediate carrier, which is neither the initial nor the delivering carrier, that the loss or damage occurred on its line, and a recovery may be had against it only upon actual proof that the loss or damage occurred on its line. <em>Oregon, Washington R. R. </em>v. <em>McGinn, </em>258 U. S. 409. The Interstate Commerce Commission has power to fix the charges for delivering cars on a private track. <em>Terminal Railroad </em>v. <em>United States, </em>266 U.

This Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Penna. R. R., </em>266 U. S. 191, upheld the power, of the Commission to treat movements such as this as transportation and to regulate them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\">The Missouri Pacific had not directly contracted with th\u00e9 respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">Under the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by the Transportation Act, \u00a7 15, Pars. 3 and 4, 41,Stat. 485, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved a tariff fixing.the rate that the St. Louis-San Francisco might charge for moving this car under its own control and with its own locomotive and over its own line of railroad, to the door of respondents warehouse. Prior to the time Congress entered this field, the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company might have made a private contract with the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company for such movement, but as the case stands the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway was performing a service as a common carrier under a tariff approved by the Irit\u00e9rstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to authority granted it by an act of Congress.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Messrs. Joseph M. Hill', Harry P. Daily, </em>and <em>John P. Woods, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b412-6\">Mr. Justice Brandeis</author>\n<p id=\"AjB\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">This action was brought in a state court of Arkansas by Reynolds-Davis Grocery Company against the Missouri Pacific Railroad to recover for the loss of part of a carload of sugar shipped from Raceland, Louisiana, to Fort Smith, Arkansas, on a through bill of lading. The loss occurred within the city of Fort Smith while the car was in the possession of the jSaint Louis-San Francisco Railroad. This carrier had been employed by the Missouri Pacific to switch the car from a point on its lines within the city to the consignee\u2019s warehouse, which lay within the city on the lines of the switching carrier. The Missouri Pacific, relying upon <em>Oregon-Washington Railroad &amp; Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>McGinn, </em>258 U. S. 409, requested the trial court to rule that, as the bill of lading provided that no connecting carrier should be liable for any damage which did not occur on its own lines, and delivery at the consignee\u2019s warehouse was part of an interstate shipment, the defendant w\u00e1s not liable, because it was neither the initial nor the delivering carrier. The court refused to rule as requested; the jury found for the plaintiff; and the judgment entered -on the verdict was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. 161 Ark. 579. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. 265 U. S. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The joint through rate covered delivery at the warehouse of the consignee. The bill of lading named Morgan\u2019s. Louisiana &amp; Texas Railroad and Steamship Company as the initial carrier and the route designated therein named the Missouri Pacific as the last of the connecting carriers. Its lines enter Fort Smith but do not extend to the consignee\u2019s warehouse. It employed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Saint Louis-San Francisco to perform the necessary-switching service. And it paid therefor $6.30, the charge fixed by the tariff on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission. The switching carrier was not named in the bill of lading and did not receive any part of the joint through rate. It was simply the agent of the Missouri Pacific for the purpose of delivery. The Missouri Pacific was the delivering carrier and is liable as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
