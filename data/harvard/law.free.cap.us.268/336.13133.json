The Department of Labor is of opinion that the Act requires the exclusion of these, appellants. The Department of State is of opinion that the Act and the Treaty together require their admission. In view of tbe importance, of this case, counsel for the Government feel it their duty to submit reasons, in support of both opinions. Accordingly, in their brief is set forth the reasoning in support of the exclusion' theory maintained by the Department of Labor; in an appendix, the opposing arguments of the State Department, \u00e1s. embodied in a memorandum prepared by. the Solicitor for that Department. The appellants are clearly \u201c aliens ineligible to' citizenship.\u201d They are therefore excluded by \u00a7 13(c) qf .the Act, unless they can establish their right to enter' as \u201ctreaty merchants\u201d under \u00a7 3(6). Section 3(6) grants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>admission to \u201c an alien entitled to enter the United States, solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of the provisions of a present existing treaty of commerce and navigation.\u201d Can it be said that the wife or the minor child of a merchant.comes here \u201c solely to carry on trade \u201d ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa-M\">The agent of a merchant is not himself entitled to enter as a merchant. <em>Tulsidas </em>v. <em>Insular Collector, </em>262 U. S. 258; And this Court in the <em>Gue Lim Case </em>did not hold that the wife of a merchant was entitled to enter \u201c solely to carry on trade,\u201d but merely decided that she was entitled to enter solely to reside with her husband, as she then had the right to do. The purpose of \u00a7 3(6) was to take away that right by granting the right of entry only to actual merchants, and not, as formerly, to merchants and their families. Any other construction would deprive the section of its meaning. At the time when the <em>Gue Lim </em>decision was rendered, no statutory definition existed of the term \u201c merchant \u201d; and the Court accordingly construed the language of the treaty as including both merchants and their families. The Court might have decided the <em>Gue Lim Case </em>differently had \u00a7 3(6) then been in existence. It was inserted at the request of the Secretary of State, for the purpose of safeguarding treaty rights, but in its- final form is very different from the provision which the Secretary originally suggested; and it is possible that the effect of the alteration is to.exclude the wives and children of merchants. Whatever might have been the result had Congress enacted, <em>totidem verbis, </em>either of the Secretary\u2019s suggestions, it is submitted that the case must be judged upon the law as. it is written. The Committee Report indicates that Congress intended to \u201c tie the exemptions to those persons properly exempted and entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of all existing treaties of commerce and navigation.\u201d The effect of \u00a7 3(6), as actually passed by Congress, may be to deny the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>entry to all who do not come here \u201c solely to carry on trade.\u201d In opposition to this view counsel cite the case of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Watt, </em>138 U. S. 694, 706, and other cases holding that the. domicil of the husband is the domicil of the wife, and that the identity of the wife is, in a sense, merged in that of the husband. But has not this theory lost much of its force since the enactment of the Act of September 22, 1922, c. 411, 42 Stat. 1021, under which the citizenship of the wife no longer follows that of the husband? And the Immigration Acts often operate to prevent husband and wife from residing together in this country. Yet this Court, when appealed to on the ground of hardship, has declined to interfere. <em>Commisisoner of Immigration </em>v. <em>Gottlieb, </em>265 U. S. 310; <em>Chung Fook </em>v. <em>White, </em>264 U. S. 443; <em>Yee Won </em>v. <em>White, </em>256 U. S. 399.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3j\">In the next place \u00a7 5 of the Act provides \u201cAn alien who is not particularly specified in this Act as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant shall not be admitted as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.\u201d It may well be that the appellants have no right of entry in and of themselves; their right of entry is dependent, not upon their own status, but upon that of their husbands or fathers. And. if that is so, then they are excluded by the operation of \u00a7 5. Congress has been careful to grant admission to the families of Chinese government officials \u00a7 3(1), and to the families of Chinese clergymen or professors \u00a7\u00a7 4(d), 13(c) (2); and from this fact it may be inferred that Congress did not intend to grant admission to the families of Chinese merchants, according to the maxim <em>expressio unius. Lapina </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>232 U. S. 78, 92; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goldenberg, </em>168 U. S. 95, 103. It is conceded that a strong presumption exists in favor of maintaining treaty rights. The right of these appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to enter this country is a right conferred, if not by the letter of the treaty, at least by the treaty as interpreted by this Court. But it is submitted that even treaty rights can not prevail against the language of the Immigration Act of 1924. And under \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 13(c) of that Act, it is doubtful whether these appellants can enter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-4\">Such is the contention of the \u2019Department of Labor; but this Court should also consider the careful and well-reasoned opinion of the Solicitor for the Department of State, before answering the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-5\">The following is excerpted from a memorandum by <em>Hon. Charles Cheney Hyde, </em>Solicitor for the State Department, which was appended to the brief of appellee:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">Wives and minor children of alien merchants entering the United States for purposes of trade and commerce under a present existing treaty of the United States are themselves clothed with a treaty right to enter. The courts of the United States, when interpreting the treaties of their country, act on the assumption that it was the design of the contracting parties not to contravene principles of morality and fairness, <em>Ubeda </em>v. <em>Zialcita, </em>226 U. S. 462, 454; that their agreement should be interpreted \u201c in a spirit of <em>uberrima fides, </em>and in a manner to carry out its manifest purpose,\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Alexandroff, </em>183 U. S. 424, 437; and that its terms should be liberally construed, <em>Asakura </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>265 U. S. 332, 342; <em>Haunstein </em>v. <em>Lynham, </em>100 U. S. 483; <em>Geofroy </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>133 U. S. 258; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Alexandroff, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-7\">The commercial treaties of the United States providing for the entrance and residence of nationals of one contracting party into the territories of the other for the purposes of trade, have not made mention of the wives and minor children of such individuals. It seems to have been taken for granted that there is such unity of interest in the- individual family that the head thereof, if given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the right to enter a country for purposes of trade, is the representative of an entity embracing his wife and children who are not to be dissociated from him. This conclusion is fortified by the fact that treaties with Japan, China, and other countries contemplate prolonged and undetermined residence for the purposes of trade, the occupation of dwellings, and by necessary inference the establishment of homes. [Citing treaties-.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-4\">It would scarcely be suggested that each, of these treaties should be interpreted differently in accordance with the exact words used. Such literal construction could not give effect to the intent' of the contracting parties, nor could it avail tovcarry out the general purposes for which such treaties are concluded. It is believed that the varying terms of all these treaties may be properly paraphrased thus: \u201c The contracting .parties agree that their citizens and subjects, respectively, shall have a right to come into the territories of the other for the purpose of carrying on international trade, and they are accorded the privilege of remaining indefinitely in the country, of establishing their homes and of bringing with them for this purpose the members, of their families so long as they are here for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao3\">An examination of the original signed copy of the treaty of 1880 with. China, in the archives of the Department of State, reveals that there is nothing therein which can be regarded as a title, although in Malloy\u2019s compilation (Vol. 1, p. 237) it is given the caption, \u201c Immigration Treaty.\u201d In so far as the Chinese treaty refers to merchants, and provides for their entry into the United States, it seems entirely reasonable and proper to consider it as a \u201ctreaty of commerce and navigation.\u201d It would be unreasonable to assume in the absence of convincing evidence that the United States and Japan, for example, sought, on the one hand, to give traders the right to enter, remain, and reside for an indefinite period for the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of trade, and, on the other, to isolate them while exercising that privilege from their wives and minor children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-5\">An important social policy well recognized in the Anglo-American system lies at the foundation' of this principle. Our courts have recognized the identity. of interest which exists between husband and wife. The wife is an integral part of the husband\u2019s sphere of activity. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Watt, </em>138 U. S. 694. The Supreme Court of the United States in deciding <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mrs. Gue Lim, </em>176 U. S. 459, interpreted the treaty between the United States and China of November. 17, 1880 (22 Stat. 826), in a manner that sustains this conclusion. See <em>In re Chung Toy Ho, </em>42 Fed. 398; <em>Ex Parte Goon Dip, </em>1 Fed. (2d) 811; <em>Ex Parte So Hakp </em>Yon, 1 Fed. (2d) 814; <em>Yee Won </em>v. <em>White, </em>256 U. S. 399; <em>Woo Hoo </em>v. <em>White, </em>243 Fed. 541; see also <em>In re Chin Hern Shu, </em>D. C. Mass., Dec. 11, 1924 (unreported).</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-6\">It is never to be supposed that an Act of Congress overrides the provisions of a treaty unless its -words are so clear that there is no escape from that conclusion. <em>Chew Heong </em>v. <em>United States, </em>112 U. S. 536. Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act of 1924 classifies as a non-immigrant \u201c an alien entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of the provisions of a present existing treaty of Commerce and Navigation.\u201d Section 13(c) provides that \u201cno alien ineligible to citizenship shall be admitted to' the United States unless such alien ... is not an immigrant as defined in Section 3.\u201d If we assume that aside from the Act wives and minor children of merchants are given by the treaty a right V.o enter the United States, it is obvious that no argument for their exclusion under the Act could arise except for the words. \u201c solely to carry on trade,\u201d which appear in\" \u00a7 3(6). It is argued that this phrase was directed against the wives and children of merchants, on the ground that any other construction, deprives this phrase of all meaning. However, such is not the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>In view, of its legislative history, it is believed; that this phraseology was adopted with \u00e1 desire to grant full rights to persons entitled to enter under treaties of commerce and navigation \u2014 to show that the treaty provisions referred to were only those provisions respecting privileges of commerce and navigatio\u00f1, and that the; class of persons referred to was the merchant class within the scope of those provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-4\">There is another apparent reason for the use of the phrase \u201csolely to carry on trade\u201d as used in \u00a7 3(6). The various treaties of commerce and navigation do. not refer exclusively to merchants. A right of entry is also accorded to ships (and-necessarily-to their crews) and to temporary visitors. Congress had already provided for., alien seamen in .\u00a7 19 of the Act and for visitors or travelers in \u00a7 3(2). The phrasing of \u00a7 3(6) seems-to have been adopted partly to avoid a conflict with or repetition of \u00a7\u00a7 3(2) and 19, and was designedly supplemental thereto. The evidence is abundant and convincing that Congress itself not only had no desire to curtail the treaty right, but also deliberately undertook to respect the treaty right to enter of all who were clothed therewith.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Mr. Henry W. Taft Sled </em>a brief as <em>amicus curiae </em>by special leave of Court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AZ6\">Mr. Justice McReynolds</author>\n<p id=\"AEY\">delivered the opinion of'the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Petitioners are alien wives and minor children, of resident Chinese merchants lawfully domiciled within the United States. - They departed from China on the Steamship President Lincoln, and upon arrival at San Francisco, July 11, 1924, sought permanent admission to the United States. The Secretary of Labor denied-th\u00e9ir-applications and gave the following reasons therefor\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u201c Neither the mercantile status of the husband and father, nor the applicant\u2019s relationship, to him, has been-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>investigated for the reason that even if it were conceded that both these elements exist the applicants would be inadmissible as a matter of law. This is made necessary because of the inhibition against their coming to the United States as found in Paragraph (c) of Section 13 and that portion of Section 5 which reads as follows: \u2018An alien who is not particularly specified in .this Act as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant shall not be admitted as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The court below has inquired, Jud. Code \u00a7 239: \u201cAre the alien Chinese wives and minor children of Chinese merchants who were lawfully domiciled within the United States prior to July 1st, 1924, such wives and minor children now applying for admission, mandatorily excluded from the United States under the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Prior to July 1, 1924, petitioners, if otherwise unobjectionable, might have been admitted notwithstanding their, race and nationality. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mrs. Gue Lim, </em>176 U. S. 459, 466, 468; <em>Yee Won </em>v. <em>White, </em>256 U. S. 399, 400, 401. But it is said they are absolutely excluded by the \u201cAct to limit the immigration of aliens into the United States, and for other purposes,\u201d approved May 26, 1924, c. 190, 43 Stat. 153, applicable provisions of which follow\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u201c Sec. 13. . (c) No alien ineligible to citizenship, shall be admitted to the United States unless such alien (1) is admissible as a non-quota immigrant under the provisions of subdivision (b), (d), or (e) of section 4, or (2) is the wife, or the unmarried child under 18 years of age, of an immigrant admissible under such subdivision (d), and is accompanying or following to join him, or (3) is not an immigrant as defined in section 3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u201c Sec 3. When used in this Act the term \u2018 immigrant \u2019 means any \u00a1alien departing from any place outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>United States destined for the United States, except . -. . (6) an alien entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance of the provisions of a present existing treaty of commerce and navigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u201c Sec. 5. When used in this Act the term \u2018 quota immigrant \u2019 means any immigrant who is not a non-quota immigrant. An alien who is not particularly specified- in this Act as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant shall not be admitted as a non-quota immigrant or a non-immigrant by reason of relationship to any individual who is so specified or by reason of being excepted from the operation of any other law regulating or forbidding immigration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The present existing treaty of commerce and navigation with China, dated November 17, 1880, 22 Stat. 826, 827, provides\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cArticle II. Chinese subjects, whether proceeding to the United States as teachers, students, merchants or fro'm curiosity, together with their body and household servants, and Chinese laborers who are now in the United States shall be allowed to go and come of their own free will and accord, and shall be accorded all the rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are accorded to the citizens and subjects of the most favored nation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">An alien entitled to enter the United States \u201c solely to carry on trade \u201d under an existing treaty of commerce and navigation is not an immigrant within the meaning of the Act, \u00a7 3(6), and therefore is not absolutely excluded by \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The wives and minor children of resident Chinese merchants were guaranteed the right of entry by the treaty of 1880 and certainly possessed it prior to July first when the present Immigration Act became effective. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mrs. Gue Lim, supra. </em>That Act must be construed with the view to preserve treaty rights unless clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>annulled, and we cannot conclude that, considering its history, the general terms therein disclose a congressional intent absolutely to exclude, the petitioners from entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In a certain sense it is true that petitioners did not come \u201c solely to carry on trade.\u201d But Mrs. Gue Lim did not come as a \u201c merchant.\u201d She was nevertheless allowed to enter, upon the theory that a treaty provision admitting merchants by necessary implication extended to their wives and minor children. This rule was not unknown to .Congress when considering the Act now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Nor do we think the language of \u00a7 5 is sufficient to defeat the rights which petitioners had under the treaty. In a very definite sense they' are specified by the Act itself . as \u201c non-immigrants.\u201d They are aliens entitled to enter in pursuance of a treaty as interpreted and applied by this court twenty-five years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The question propounded by the- court below must be answered in the <em>negative.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
