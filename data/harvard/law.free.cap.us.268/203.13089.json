Benton, </em>Attorney General, was on the brief, for the defendant in error. The tax, so far as measured by the value of the corporate excess employed within the Commonwealth, is valid as to foreign corporations engaged solely in interstate commerce. It is well established that property of a non-resident located within a State is.subject to taxation by it, although the property is used exclusively in interstate commerce, except when it is actually in the course of an interstate journey, if the tax is laid without discrimination. Apparently the petitioner concedes the application of this rule to tangible personal property, but contends that the rule is otherwise With respect to intangible assets such as a corporate franchise and credits due from residents. So far as the franchise is concerned, the point seems to be concluded by the decisions of this court. <em>Atlantic &amp; Pac. Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, </em>190 U. S. 160; <em>Horn Silver Mining Co. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>U. S. 305; <em>Postal Telegraph Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>155 U. S. 688, 696.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-3\">The objection to a tax on credits due from residents to non-residents may be based upon the contention either that intangible property is not subject to the foregoing rule or that a tax on such credits is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. As to the second point it submitted that the petitioner is concluded by numerous decisions sustaining state taxation of credits due to non-, residents. <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>Stempel, </em>175 U. S. 309; <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Washington County, </em>177 U. S. 133; <em>Board of Assessors </em>v. <em>Comptoir National D\u2019Escompte, </em>191 U. S. 388; <em>Metropolitan Life Ins.

S. 37, 52.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">The fact that such credits arise from and are used exclusively in interstate commerce, it is submitted, makes no difference. The rule with respect to the taxation of property used in interstate commerce does not distinguish between tangible and intangible property. The validity of the tax does not depend on the connection of the property with some local business but on the. remoteness of any burden or. effect upon interstate commerce. See <em>Western Union Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>125 U. S. 530; <em>Postal Telegraph Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>155 U. S. 688; <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Ohio State Auditor, </em>165 U.

S. 330.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asqr\">If a tax on tangible and intangible assets, including the corporate franchise of a foreign corporation, employed, in a State, although ernployed exclusively In interstate commerce, is vaiid, an excise tax measured by such property should also be valid. A tax measured by property may be valid when a tax on the property itself would be invalid. <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Stone Tracy Co. </em>220 U. S. 107, 165; Baltic, <em>Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>231 U. S. 68, 87. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>converse is not true.

The court below upheld the tax and definitely ruled that it was not repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment or the Commerce Clause of the federal Constitution. 244 Mass. 530; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>248 Mass. 156. With negligible exceptions the assessments followed the Corporation Tax Law (Gen. Acts 1919, c. 355), now codified in Gen. Laws, c. 63. Chapters 361 and 493, Gen. Acts 1921, are subsidiary and demand no particular notice. Record No. 327 discloses how the assessments were calculated; also the essential facts hereinafter stated. The opinion in No. 103 discusses the fundamental questions of law; the later one is supplementary and explanatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The statute provides that \u201c every foreign corporation shall pay annually, with respect to the carrying on or doing of business by it within the Commonwealth, an excise equal to the sum of . . . five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it.within the Commonwealth\u201d and \u201ctwo and one-half per cent, of that part of its net income . . . which is derived from business carried on within the Commonwealth;\u201d provided that the total tax shall be not less than an amount equal to one-twentieth of one per cent, of such proportion of the fair cash value of its capital stock as its assets employed within the State shall bear to the total assets. Annual returns, and additional information when demanded, must be filed with the Commissioner. He is empowered to determine, under prescribed rules, the net portion of income from business within the Stated But if dissatisfied any corporation may file \u201c a statement in such detail as the Commissioner shall require, showing the amount of its annual net income derived from business- carried on within the Commonwealth.\u201d Credit for five per cent, of dividends paid to inhabitants of the State is authorized.

Its business is the manufacture and sale of cement. Its principal office is at Easton, Pennsylvania. Its mills are located in several other States outside of Massachusetts, from which shipments are made to various parts of the United,States and to foreign countries. It maintains an office in Boston in charge of a district sales manager, with a clerk, where its correspondence and other natural business activities in connection with the receipt of orders and shipments of goods for the New England States are conducted. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>office is used as headquarters for travelling salesmen, who solicit orders in Massachusetts and the other New England States. Orders so taken are transmitted at the Boston office by mail to the principal office at Easton, Pennsylvania, where exclusively they are passed upon, and if accepted, the goods are shipped and invoices sent directly to the customer. Remittances usually are made to the petitioner at Easton, though in exceptional instances prepayments or collections are made, by the salesmen and immediately transmitted- to Easton. No samples or other merchandise are kept in this Commonwealth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The only property of the petitioner in Massachusetts is its office furniture, valued at $573. It maintains no bank account here, its salaries and office rent being, paid from its principal office. Incidental expenses are paid from an account not exceeding $1,000 kept by the district sales manager in his own name. No corporate books, records, or meetings are in Massachusetts. There is no controversy as to the facts, valuations or computation of the tax. The issues between the parties relate solely to the correct interpretation of our corporate tax law as to foreign corporations and to the constitutionality of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>law in its application to the petitioner. . . . It is rightly conceded by the Attorney General that the petitioner was engaged in this Commonwealth exclusively in interstate commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Having ascertained the necessary items, the Comptroller made the- calculations indicated below. The corporation\u2019s total net income returned for federal taxation, after allowances, amounted to $707,577.98; $7,602,090.21 (although not quite accurate) was treated as the total value of intangible assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\n<em>Amount of t\u00e1x measured by net income.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Average value of tangible property in Mass., $573.

Real estate and machinery used in manufacture by such corporations alone are subject to a local property tax in the city or town where situated. All other personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is exempt from direct or local taxation. The amount of the excise tax is measured. as to a foreign corporation, \u00a7 39, by the sum of \u2018An amount equal to five dollars per thousand upon the value of the corporate excess employed by it within the Commonwealth,\u2019 and \u2018An amount equal to two and one half per cent of that part of its net income, as'defined in section thirty and in this section, which is derived from business carried on within this Commonwealth,\u2019 with a further provision that a minr/num tax [shall be paid] of not less than one twentieth of one per cent of such proportion of the fair cash value-of its shares of capital stock as its assets employed in business in this Commonwealth bear to its total assets employed in business. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"AhK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201c The statute is an attempt to measure the excise on foreign corporations solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done within this Commonwealth. This excise tax is in place of any other tax on personal property within the Commonwealth from which, except as to machinery used in manufacture or in. supplying and distributing water, foreign corporations (and also domestic corporations) are expressly exempted by G. Luc. 59, \u00a7 5, cl. 16. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u201c The present tax act imposes the excise with respect to the carrying on of business by foreign corporations within the Commonwealth. It is an excise for the privilege of having a place of business under the protection of our laws and with the financial, commercial and other advantages flowing therefrom, measured solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done here by a foreign corporation. The excise is measured by two factors, (1) the value of the corporate excess employed within the Commonwealth, and (2) the net income derived from business within the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u201c 1. The value of the corporate excess employed in the Commonwealth as . a factor of the tax is not measured by the capital stock of the corporation. If it were, it would be invalid. <em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>246 U. S. 135. It is measured by the value of the property of the foreign corporation, including its franchise, employed in the Commonwealth, after certain deductions are made. .It seems to us that this factor of the . tax stands under the protection of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. . . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u201cIt is manifest as matter of common business knowledge that commerce within this Commonwealth yielding to the petitioner annual gross receipts of $424,982.70 must have, involved credits, bills receivable and obligations to it-of considerable amounts. No contention to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>trary has been urged by the petitioner. Such credits, bills receivable and obligations might be made subject to direct taxation. within the Commonwealth by appropriate legislation under numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Such, credits, bills receivable and obligations constitute a part of \u2018 the value of the assets \u2019 of the.petitioner \u2018employed in . . . [its] business within the Commonwealth \u2019 used as the basis of ascertaining \u2018 the corporate excess \u2019 of the petitioner \u2018 employed within the Commonwealth \u2019 upon which this factor of the .excise is calculated. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201c 2. The tax, as measured by the net income from business transacted in Massachusetts as a factor, is dependent upon net profits derived solely from interstate commerce. . But there is no discrimination in the statute against interstate commerce. - This net income is used as a measure applicable to all corporations alike. While not an income tax according to strict definition, in substance it affects net income alone, is measured by net income alone, is reasonable in amount and incidence, and is payable out of net income. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201c The tax considered as a whole with both its. riiain factors is general in nature and reasonable in amount. The tax upon the petitioner in substance and effect, so far as concerns the factor of its corporate excess employed within the Commonwealth, is levied upon its tangible, personal property within-the Commonwealth, upon the. credits due it from debtors within this Commonwealth, and upon the exercise of its franchise within this Commonwealth, and, so far as concerns the factor of its in-, come, upon the net income derived from business in this Commonwealth after all losses and expenses have been paid. It is not directed \u00bfgainst interstate commerce or property outside the State but is confined to business done, property located, capital employed and net income earned within the Commonwealth. It affects interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>commerce indirectly and is not an immediate burden upon it. It affords to the State only a fair and reasonable revenue for the maintenance of the government, the benefits from the protection of which the petitioner enjoys. Our conclusion is that the law thus construed, as applying to a foreign corporation using a part of its property exclusively for interstate commerce within the Commonwealth, violates no guaranty established by the Constitution of the United States. The tax statute, therefore, is interpreted as applying to a corporation engaged in business within the Commonwealth as' is the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AN_\">Counsel for the Commonwealth assert: \u201c The present tax law imposes an excise on foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business in Massachusetts under the protection of its laws and with the financial, commercial and other advantages flowing therefrom, measured solely by the property and net income fairly attributable to the business done within the State. Payment of the tax is not made a condition precedent to the doing of business.. Collection of the tax is to be made by ordinary methods. There is no discrimination either against foreign corporations or against interstate commerce.\u201d \u201c The taxes complained of were excises and not property taxes.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>Being excises these taxes are not taxes <em>on </em>property or net income, but taxes <em>measured by </em>property and net income, used in or derived from business done in Massachusetts.\u201d See <em>Judson Freight Forwarding Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>242 Mass. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">This view of the nature of the exaction was adopted by the court below, and we think it is the correct one. The right to lay taxes on tangible property or on income is not involved; and the inquiry comes to this: May a State impose upon a foreign corporation which transacts only interstate business within her borders an excise tax measured by a combination of two factors \u2014 the proportion of the total value of capital shares attributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>transactions therein, and the proportion of net income attributed to such transactions?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><em>Cheney Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>246 U. S. 147, 153, 154, necessitates a negative reply. Under St. 1909, c. 490, Part III, \u00a7 56, the State demanded an excise of a foreign corporation which transacted therein only interstate business. The excise was laid upon the corporation and th\u00e9 basis of it the same as in the present cause. This court said: <em>\u201c </em>We think the tax on this company was essentially a tax on doing an interstate business and therefore repugnant to the commerce clause.\u201d Here also the excise was demanded on account of interstate business. A new method for measuring the tax had been prescribed, but that cannot save the exaction. Any such excise burdens interstate commerce and is therefore invalid without regard to measure or amount. <em>Looney </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>245 U. S. 178, 190; <em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>246 U. S. 135, 142; <em>Heisler </em>v. <em>Thomas Colliery Co., </em>260 U. S. 245, 259; <em>Texas Transport &amp; Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>264 U. S. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><em>International Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>considered an excise upon a corporation doing both local and interstate business, measured by its capital stock. St. 1909, c. 490; St. 1914, c. 724. Pertinent cases were cited and discussed and the tax declared \u201c unconstitutional and void as placing a prohibited burden on interstate commerce and laid on property of a foreign corporation located and used beyond the jurisdiction of the State.\u201d Payment as a condition precedent to the doing of any business was not a controlling circumstance. The opinion recognizes the State\u2019s right to demand excises of foreign corporations in respect of intrastate business unless the' exaction is really a tax on interstate business or property beyond the State. Under this, principle certain of the complaining corporations in <em>Cheney Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra, </em>were properly taxed. Plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>error did no local business, and there was no proper foundation for the excise.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">It must now be regarded as settled that a State may not burden interstate commerce or tax property beyond her borders under the guise of regulating or taxing, intrastate business. So to burden interstate commerce is prohibited by the Commerce Clause; and the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit taxation of property beyond the State\u2019s jurisdiction. The amount demanded is unimportant when there is no legitimate basis for the tax. So far as. the language of <em>Baltic Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>231 U. S. 68, 87, tends to support a different view it conflicts with conclusions reached in later opinions and is now definitely disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\"><em>Union Tank Line Co. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>249 U. S. 275, 282, <em>seq., </em>pointed out the limitations which must be observed when property used in interstate commerce is valued for purposes of taxation by a State. We there declined to follow the rule applied in <em>Pullman's Palace Car Co. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>141 U. S. 18, 26, and held that determination of real value with fair accuracy is essential. Many methods adapted to that end have been accepted, but this does not tend to support an excise laid upon a foreign corporation on account of interstate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The local business of a foreign corporation may support an excise measured in any reasonable way, if neither interstate commerce nor property beyond the State is taxed. <em>Underwood Typewriter Co. </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>254 U. S. 113, approved such an excise measured by income reasonably attributed to intrastate business;- but nothing there said was intended to modify well established principles. It must be. read with the essential facts in mind. Local business was a sufficient basis for the excise, and there was no taxation of interstate commerce or property beyond the State. Of course, the opinion does not support the suggestion that the present statute is free from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the fatal objections to the former one because payment of the tax is no longer a condition precedent to carrying on any business. It cites approvingly <em>St. Louis S. W. Ry. </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>235 U. S. 350, 364; and there this court said\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"ATu\">\u201c So far as the commerce clause is concerned, it seems to us that the principles upon whose application the present decision must depend are those set forth in <em>Postal Tel. Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>155 U. S. 688, 695, where the court, by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said: \u2018It is settled that where by way of duties laid on the transportation of the subjects of interstate commerce, or on the receipts derived therefrom, or oh the occupation or business of carrying it on, a tax is levied by a State on interstate commerce, such taxation amounts to a regulation of such commerce and cannot be sustained. But property in a State belonging to a corporation,, whether foreign or domestic, engaged in foreign or interstate commerce, may be taxed, or \u00e1 tax may be imposed on the corporation on account of its property within a State, and may take the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchises within the State, if the ascertainment of the amount is. made dependent in fact on the value of its property situated within the State (the exaction, therefore, not being susceptible of exceeding the sum which might be leviable directly thereon), and if payment be not made a condition precedent to the right to carry on the business, but its enforcement left to the ordinary means devised for the collection of taxes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aeok\">The excise challenged by plaintiff in error is not materially different from the one declared unconstitutional in <em>Cheney Brothers Co. </em>v. <em>Massaehusetts, </em>and cannot be enforced against a foreign corporation which does nothing but interstate business within the State.
