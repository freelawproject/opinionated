S. 205; <em>Panama R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>264 U. S. 375. The statute requires the amount - of damages sustained by the plaintiff and the proportion .thereof that should be diminished by reason of his contributory negligence to be determined by a jury, and also that the question of .the negligence of the defendant shall be determined by a jury. There is no possibility of reconciling these provisions, with the inherent admiralty jurisdiction over maritime causes of action. Again\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-14\">Since the decisions of this. Court in the <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Cases </em>(207 U. S. 463), holding the act uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>stitutional as general legislation, and in <em>El Paso etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>215 U. S. 87, and <em>Washington etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>236 U. S. 190, upholding the act as local legislation for the territories, its application to maritime torts will offend against the. uniformity rule which this Court has repeatedly held to be a constitutional requirement of any congressional l\u00e9gislation modifying or altering the rules of the maritime law. At any rate,. a construction of the statute as applied to maritime causes of action plainly raises grave questions regarding its constitutional validity. <em>Panama Railroad Company Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-4\">If the act was applicable to maritime torts at the time of its enactment, it was repealed-by implication or superseded by the Act of April 22, 1908, the Second Employers\u2019 Liability Act, Cong. Rec. 60th Cong., 1st Section, 1347.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\">This Act of 1908 is a revision of the prior Act of June, 1906. <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>40 N.

S. 140, the rule of uniformity in admiralty and maritime law was considered, and <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>244 U. S. 205, and <em>Chelentis </em>v. <em>Luckenback Steamship Co., </em>247 U. S. 372, examined and quoted, arid in these three cases the foundation of the rule was stated to be based upon the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress and the federal courts over admiralty and maritime cases, and not upon any supposed rule of exact uniformity in congression\u00e1l enactment. See <em>Waring </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>4 How. 441; <em>Workman </em>v. <em>New York, </em>179 U. S. 552; <em>Western Fuel Co. </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>257 U.

The object in vesting in the General Government the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States was to insure uniformity of regulation and to prevent discriminating state legislation. <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>91 U. S. 275; <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>103 U. S. 344; <em>Mobile Co. </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>102. U. S. 691. Congress undoubtedly has -authority under the commercial power if no other to introduce such changes as are likely to be needed. <em>The Lottawanna, </em>21 Wall. 558; <em>Butler v. The B. &amp; S.

S. 101, this court, said: \u201cthe best interests of a detached territory may often demand that its ports be treated Very differently from those within the States. And we can find nothing in the Constitution itself or its history which. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>compels the conclusion that it was intended to deprive Congress of the power so to act.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b70-6\">Mr. Justice McReynolds</author>\n<p id=\"AGI\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The court below has certified two questions of law concerning which it desires instruction. <em>Judicial Code, </em>\u00a7 <em>289. </em>The first question follows. Our answer to it renders a reply to the second one unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u201c1. Is the owner of a ship, a common carrier engaged in coastwise commerce trade in the territory of Alaska, liable to one of its employees, a stevedore, for damages which have resulted by reason of a defect or insufficiency due to the owner\u2019s negligence in an appliance furnished to the employee as provided under sections 1 and 2 of the Act of June 11, 1906, Ch. 3073, 34 Stat. 232, comr monly known as the First Employers\u2019 Liability Act?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The designated statute is entitled, \u201cAn Act relating to liability of common carriers in the District of Columbia and Territories and common carriers engaged in commerce between the States and between the States and foreign nations, to their employees,\u201d and provides\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Sec. 1. \u201c That every common carrier engaged in trade or commerce in the District of Columbia, or in any Territory of the United States, or between the several States, or between any Territory and another, or between any Territory or Territories and any State or States, or the District of Columbia, or with foreign nations, or between the District of Columbia and any State or States or foreign nations, shall b\u00e9 liable to any of its employees, or, in the case of his death, to his personal representative for the benefit of his widow and children, if any, if none, then for his parents, if none, then for his next of kin dependent upon him, for all damages which may result from the negligence of any of its officers, agents, or employees, or by reason of any defect or insufficiency due to its negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>gence in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed, ways or works.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u201c Sec. 2. That in all actions hereafter brought against any common carriers to recover damages for personal injuries to an employee, or where such injuries have resulted in his death, the fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not'bar a recovery where his contributory negligence was slight and that of the employer was gross in comparison, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion. to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee. All questions of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Sec. 3. No contract of employment, insurance, etc., shall constitute a defense to an action brought to recover damages for injuries or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u201c Sec. 4. That no action shall be maintained under this Act, unless commenced within one year from the time the cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\"><em>\u201c </em>See. 5. That nothing in this Act shall.be held to limit the duty of common- carriers by railroads or impair the rights of their employees under the safety-appliance Act of March second, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, as amended April first, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, and March second, nineteen hundred and three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Cases, </em>207 U. S. 403, held that, \u201c conceding the power of Congress to regulate the relations of employer and employee engaged in interstate commerce, the [above-quoted] Act was unconstitutional in this, that in its provisions regulating interstate commerce, Congress exceeded its constitutional authority in undertaking to make employers responsible, not only to employees when engaged in interstate commerce, but to any of its employees, whether engaged in interstate commerce or in commerce wholly within a State.\u201d <em>El Paso &amp; Northeastern Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>215 U. S. 87, 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>The case last cited declared the Act valid and controlling in so far as it relates to the District of Columbia and the. Territories, although invalid as to accidents within a State. It was there said, p. 97: \u201cWhen we consider the purpose of Congress to regulate the liability of employer to employee, and its evident intention to change certain rules of the common law which theretofore prevailed as to the responsibility for negligence in the conduct of the business of transportation, we think that it is apparent that had Congress not undertaken to deal with this relation in the. States where it had been regulated by local law, it would have dealt with the subject and enacted the curative provisions of the law applicable to the District of Columbia and the Territories over which its. plenary power gave it the undoubted right to pass a controlling law, and to make uniform regulations governing the subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">This Court has never held the act applicable to marine torts. To give it such construction would give rise to a grav\u00e9 constitutional question as to its validity and cause much confusion and uncertainty concerning the reciprocal rights and obligations of ships and those who work Upon them. <em>Knickerbocker Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>253 U. S. 149; <em>Panama R. R. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>264 U. S. 375, 386, 390. The language employed \u2014 \u201cnegligence in its cars, engines, appliarices, machinery, track, roadbed, ways or.works;\u201d \u201c actions . . . to recover damages for personal injuries;\u201d \u201c all questions of negligence and contributory negligence shall be for the jury\u201d \u2014 and the \u201cevident intention to change certain rules of the common law which theretofore prevailed as to the responsibility for negligence, in. the conduct of the business of transportation,\u201d oppose the suggestion that the purpose was to regulate purely maritime matters, from time immemorial subject to the law of the sea, which recognizes. and enforces rights and remedies radically different from, those of .the common law.
