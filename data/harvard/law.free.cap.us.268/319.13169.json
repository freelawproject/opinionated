There are limitations on the power of the legislature to fix the price of commodities or of services, or to limit the right to contract with regard to them. <em>People </em>v. <em>Budd, </em>117 N.

If the licensing provision of the act standing by itself were constitutional, the defendant could not be charged with a misdemeanor for non-compliance therewith if the price-fixing clauses of the act are invalid and he would be precluded from attacking them, because of his compliance with the licensing provision. <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.

That a statute unconstitutional in a part essential and vital to its whole scheme ca\u00ed\u00f1not be enforced by the courts in its other provisions is likewise a well settled principle. <em>Lemke </em>v. <em>Farmers Grain Co., </em>258 U.

The provision in \u00a7 174 of the statute \u201c that in case it is judicially determined that any section of this article is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>shall not affect its validity or effect of the remaining provisions of the article \u201d does not militate against the authorities considered under the foregoing subdivisions of this point. \u2019 <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>259 U.

In none of the courts below was there any attempt to sever the license provision from the price-fixing provision.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-6\"><em>Mr. Robert- D.

They are copied in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Section 168 directs: \u201cNo per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>son, firm or corporation shall resell or engage in the business of reselling any tickets of admission or any other evidence of the right of entry to a theatre, place of amusement or entertainment, or other places where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held without having first procured a license therefor from the comptroller.\u201d And \u00a7 173 declares every-violation of the inhibition' shall be a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">By ,an information in the Court of Special Sessions, New York City, the District Attorney accused plaintiff in error of engaging in the business, of reselling theatre tickets without the license required by law. The evidence showed he was engaged in that business, and it was conceded he had never taken out a license or complied with Chapter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>590. His defense rested upon the claim that the statute is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court adjudged him guilty and imposed a fine of twenty-five dollars. This was affirmed by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals. 207 App. Div. 337; 237 N. Y. 316. In an extended opinion the latter court upheld the challenged enactment, but said nothing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>possibility of sustaining the license provisions if those relating to resale prices' were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Counsel for plaintiff in error now insists that the two provisions are inseparable; that those which undertake to establish resale prices are. clearly invalid; and, consequently, the whole Act must fall. On the contrary, counsel for the people maintain that the power of the State to require such licenses is clear and that we need not determine the validity of the price restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">It is not and, we think, it cannot seriously be urged that the State lacked power to require licenses of those engaging in the business of reselling theatre tickets. The conviction and sentence were for failure to observe that requirement. In the absence of an authoritative announcement of another view by some court of the State we shall hold this provision severable and valid. <em>Brazee </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>241 U. S. 340. The statute itself declares (\u00a7 174): \u201cIn case it be judicially determined that any section of this article is unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such determination shall not affect the validity or effect of the remaining provisions of the article.\u201d If \u00a7 172, which restricts resale prices were eliminated, a workable plan would still remain. See <em>Dorchy </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>264 U.
