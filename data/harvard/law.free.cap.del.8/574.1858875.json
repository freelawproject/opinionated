The title of William Deputy to the tract of land in question, was not known to any of the parties to the proceedings in' the Orphans\u2019 Court at the time when it was instituted or when it was concluded; and as it was assigned to the widow for her dower, and she held it during her life and was now dead, and the heirs at law, in any event, take all the land they get from him by descent and without it costing them anything, there could be no wrong or injury done to any of them by recognizing in this suit, the legal title to have been in the widow for the term of her life, and after her death, in the defendants in fee, as it really was under the deed of James R. Hudson to her, executed in 1841, and in less than twelve years after the equitable title to it had been conveyed by the alienation bond of his father to the intestate, William Deputy, notwithstanding the ignorance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of all the parties as to the legal effect of it until after the conclusion of the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court-1 <em>Gree.nl.

And this was sufficient of itself, without saying any thing more, to determine the present case. But as a deed had been put in evidence by the defendants, from James R. Hudson executed since the death of William Deputy, and purporting to convey the particular tract in controversy, to Elizabeth Deputy for life, and after her death, in remainder to the defendants, in fee, and bearing date December 24th. 1841, but not recorded until the year 1867, the court would simply say in regard to it, that there was no evidence that Elizabeth Deputy ever claimed or pretended to own or hold the land under it, or that she was ever in possession of it, or even knew of its existence in her life time, and that it was not recorded until after her death. And yet, if the contrary of all this had been proved,it could not have altered the legal aspect and conclusion of the case; for in that event, she would have been no less estopped than the defendants were by the record of the proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and by her assent to, and long acquiescence in the assignment of her dower under it, from pretending or asserting that she held the premises by virtue of any other right or title whatever. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to recover the one undivided third part of the premises in question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
