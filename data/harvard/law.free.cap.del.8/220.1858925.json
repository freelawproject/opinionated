The Farmers\u2019 Bank is the legal plaintiff in the action, which is in its name for the use of the administratrix of Barclay Wilson, who was one of the joint sureties in the 'bond on which the judgment was entered. To this action the defendants have pleaded payment in brief upon the record, but which, of course, imports payment to the plaintiff in the action, and the proof is direct that it had been paid to the Bank by the administratrix in the mode stated by the cashier of it; and if such is the ease, then the plea is a good defence and an absolute bar to the action. <em>Porter use of Herdman v. Morris\u2019 Exr. </em>2 <em>Harr. </em>509. 7 <em>T. R. </em>663. The assignment of the judgment was not such as will enable the assignee under the statute, to main- . tain an action upon it in her own name. Besides, the assignment of it on the record is under the hand of the cashier, with a scroll annexed as his private seal, and attested by two subscribing witnesses; but that is not the seal of the Bank, nor can it be considered or regarded as such. <em>Ang.

There is no legal remedy or. action at law in such a case, except under the provisions of the statute referred to, which must he strictly conformed to in the requisitions prescribed by it, in regard to the assignment of the judgment; and when the assignment in such a case is by a bank, as it was in this instance, which is a corporation with an actual public seal provided for by the law creating the institution, and by which it is held to speak, and to perform such functions, it should be under such seal and the signature of the President of it, who is, in contemplation of law, the proper keeper or custodian of such seal, and in the presence of two credible witnesses at least, who should subscribe it as such.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
