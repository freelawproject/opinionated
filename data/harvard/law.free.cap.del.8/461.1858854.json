As, for instance, where there is a devise to a person.and his heirs, and if he dies without heirs, remainder to another, the remainder is void, and the first devisee takes the land in fee simple absolutely discharged and relieved of the remainder 6 <em>Cruise Dig. </em>296. <em>Fearne </em>179. 2 <em>Pr. Wms. </em>369. The devise over was inconsistent with the first devise and was therefore void in law. But admitting for the sake of argument, that the first devisee in this ease, the present Benjamin Black, did not take an estate in fee under the devise in question, but only an estate tail general in the premises, what estate did George May take in the remainder given to him in the devise, if Benjamin Black, the first devisee, should die without any heir ? He took but an estate for the term of his natural life merely, for the want of. any appropriate words of limitation in the devise over to him, to give him any larger or greater estate under it.

And he took it by way of remainder, and not by executory devise, because it was evident from the other provisions of the will and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the fact that Ms grandson, George May, was a cousin, and consequently, a collateral heir at law to Ms grandson, Benjamin Black, that it was the intention of the testator to provide for the indefinite failure of the heirs of his body, and not of his heirs entirely, and that the devisee over should take the premises and all the right and property which could then be held or owned in them, which would constitute a remainder over in fee simple io George -May expectant on the determination of the estate tail in the first devisee, Benjaman Black. <em>Ide v. </em>Ide, 5 <em>Mass. </em>501. The testator mentions all his children and grandchildren in his will, and it is manifest from the various provisions of it, that he intended to make a final disposition of all his property and all his estate in it, by virtue of the several bbquests and devises as contained and expressed by him in it. If the devise over to George May is not in fee, but only a life estate, upon his death, his daughter, Sarah May, and mother of George May, would have been from the time of the testator\u2019s death, an heir at law of the intestate residue of his estate in the premises, contrary to the express bequest of the the small legacy and no more of his property to her, and the ruling of the court in the case before cited, of <em>Cordry v. Adams &amp; Wife </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>441. But there is no residuary devise of real estate, and can be none under the will, for it cannot be so considered under the devise in the fourth item of it, in which he says \u201cI give and bequeath to my son David Black, all the lauds I have right to, not heretofore disposed of,\u201d under the will, of course, he means, to his grandsons, Benjamin Black and George May in the first item of it; and where there is no residuary devise of the testator\u2019s real estate in the will, a general devise ^Without words of limitation, will be enlarged to a fee to carryout the evident intention of the testator. <em>Doe d. Harrington v. Dill, </em>1 <em>Houst. </em>410. The grandson, George May, was furthermore, manifestly the third special object of the testator bounty, and the first after the death of his son,David, and his grandson, Benjamin Black, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>out heirs of their bodies and their name, for they were the only devisees who bore his name, and because in that event, all his lands, those devised to his son, David Black, in the fourth item, as well as the land devised to his grandson, Benjamin Black, in the first item, are devised over to him in the same identical language, that is to say, all shall be in that case, \u201c the right and property of my grandson, George May.\u201d And those words clearly refer according to his intendment, understanding and application of them, to his interest and estate in them, and not simply to the corpus of the property, and will be so considered and construed by the court. 1 <em>Houst. </em>410. But if he did not take an estate in fee under it, he must have taken by executory devise under it, and that is a construction which a court will never give to a devise when it can be construed to be good by way of remainder. <em>Ide v. Ide, </em>5 <em>Mass. </em>501. <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>386, 393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-4\">\n<em>Layton replied.</em>\n</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>Bates, Chancellor, announced the opinion of the court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aac\">Upon this case stated there are reserved two questions touching the construction of a devise in the will of George Black, deceased, expressed thus.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201c First, I give and bequeath to my grandson Benjamin Black, son of Benjamin Black deceased, one lot of ground, with all the buildings and improvements thereunto belonging &amp;c.

It is governed by a rule settled as far back as the reports of <em>Croke James, </em>and never doubted. The term \u201c heirs,\u201d though appropriate to pass the fee simple, may be quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>fled \"by any subsequent words which shew the intention of the testator to give only an estate tail. <em>Cruises\u2019 Dig. Tit. </em>38. <em>CL </em>12. <em>sec. </em>7 :\u2014and such is the effect where after a devise to one and his heirs there is a limitation over upon his death without heirs, to a person who would be a collateral heir to the first devisee. As the collateral heir is to take after the extinction of the heirs of the first devisee, it is clear that by the latter, the testator meant a class of heirs exclusive of the devisee over, which must be heirs of the body. This manifest intention the law gives effect to, and this is done the more readily because this construction saves the devise over, which as a limitation after a fee simple, and to take effect upon a general failure of heirs or issue, would be void, but is good as a remainder after an estate tail. This rule has been applied in cases stronger than the present one ; as where the first devise was to one and his heirs forever. <em>Tyte v. Willis Cases temp. Talb. </em>1. <em>Doe v. Black </em>1 <em>E. C. L. R. </em>460, or to one and his right and lawful heirs and assigns. <em>Morgan v. Griffeths, Cowp. </em>234. <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>350 <em>Cruises\u2019 Dig. Tit. </em>38. <em>Ch. </em>12. <em>sec. </em>20. If Benjamin Black\u2019s dying without any heir, could he restrained to dying without issue living at his death, then and then only, might the first devise stand as a fee simple determinable on his death without issue surviving, with an executory devise over to George May. But this construction is inadmissible under the rule which requires express words to restrain the words \u201c dying without issue or heirs\u201d to the death of the first devisee. \"We were pressed in the argument to hold that the limitation over is void and not to be at all considered in the construction of the first devise, because it is repugnant to the nature of the estate first devised, that being a fee simple. But this begs the very question to he decided, which is whether the first devisee, Benjamin Black, does take the fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">The Court is of opinion, in answer to the first .question reserved, that Benjamin Black under this devise takes an estate tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The second question is, whether the remainder limited to George May after the devise in tail to Benjamin Black, is a fee simple, or an estate for life ? This turns upon the construction of the testator\u2019s direction that upon the death of Benjamin Black without any heir, the lot should be the right and property of his grandson, George May. We do not find it necessary to decide the general question whether such words as \u201c\"right and property\u201d when applied to a devised estate, are sufficient <em>proprio vigore, </em>unexplained by the context or the scope of the will, to pass a fee. For even supposing these words when standing alone, must be held to be ambiguous, as applicable either to an estate in fee, or an estate for life, still it is apparent to the Court on the face of this will that the testator used them in the sense of absolute ownership and with the intention to give the fee simple; and it is our duty to construe the words in the sense in which the testator used them.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The whole frame of this will manifests a definite purpose on .the part of the testator, to dispose of his entire estate, and that his family should take under his will, and not otherwise, all the provision to come to them from his estate. He first devises specifically the lot in controversy to his grandson, Benjamin Black in tail, with remainder to May. Considering so much of his real estate as disposed of, he devises what remains of it to his son, David Black in tail, with remainder in the same words to his grandson, George May. Of his personal e-tote, he divides his household furniture between two grand-daughters, Haney Iiolleger and Elizabeth Black. To his two daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah each, he gives a nominal legacy, clearly intended to be all they should receive from his estate, so expressed to he in the bequest to one of them. The residue of the personal estate he bequeaths to two grandchildren, Benjamin A. Holleger and Mary E. Holleger. He left no other descendants, and no widow. Here is evident pains on the part of the testator to embrace within the will, every kind and parcel of his estate, and to name and provide for (so far as he meant to benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>them) all his descendants, being all the persons who would have taken under an intestacy. This evidence of the testator\u2019s , intent gathered from the general scope of the will, is strongly confirmed by the two clauses dispos-\u00ab ing of his real estate considered together, the first and fourth items of it. The first clause devises the lot in controversy, to Benjamin Black in tail with remainder to May. The fourth devises his other lands to David Black in tail with like remainder to May. Blow, the languageof the fourth clause strongly implies that the small lot before devised to Benjamin Black and May, had been fully disposed of by the first clause, so as to carry all the testator\u2019s estate in it. Such is the natural sense of the words of the fourth clause: \u201c I give and bequeath to my son David Black all the lands that I have right to not heretofore disposed of &amp;c. \u201d But in addition to the force of these words, as evidence that the testator intended in the first clause to dispose of his whole estate in the lot,, there is another consideration. It is most certain that the testator meant to leave no real estate intestate to descend among his heirs at law ; but that it should all pass, first to the descendants bearing his own name, the Blacks, and after them to May. The fourth clause was drawn as a residuary devise of all his real estate ; and if its phraseology does not aptly apply to a partial estate in the land before devised, this is only because no such estate in the land before devised, was thought to have been left undisposed of. Sow, the consideration to which we refer, and it is one of much force, is this,\u2014that for the testator to leave under the first clause an undisposed of remainder after a life estate in George May, to pass as part of the residue of his real estate under the fourth clause, (which according to his plain purpose in the disposal of his real estate it must do) would involve a result too absurd for a sound mind to have intended. The effect would be that an undisposed of remainder to take effect upon George May\u2019s death, is expressly so limited that the property would return to him long after his.death, and after an intermediate estate tail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>in David Black, to be again held by May during his life ; and then too, after all this manifest effort to dispose by will of a three acre lot, there would at last be a remainder intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">We do not decide that a testator\u2019s intention to dispose of his whole estate thus collected from his will, should be executed by raising a fee in a case where he has failed \"to use any words capable by construction of passing the fee. Such was <em>Denn v. </em>Gaskin, <em>Cowp. </em>657, a leading case of that class, but were such the case here, we could only say, as did Lord Mansfield there, <em>quad valu-t, non dixit. </em>Except in a few special cases of estates in fee, arising by implication from provisions in the will which cannot receive effect without the fee, some expressions descriptive of the estate given, tantamount to words of limitation, have been held to be necessary ; and such is the weight of authority, though some decisions have overstepped this limit, as <em>Bates v. Clayton, </em>8 <em>East </em>141, and <em>Corry a. Adams, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>439. Again, we do not decide that such ah intention collected at large from the will, should be carried into effect in the face of an express limitation for life. But this testator has employed words, which, even if they do-not necessarily import a devise in fee simple, may, at least, bear that construction,\u2014a construction which certainly does no violence to the text, and perhaps,is really the most natural one. ' Let us examine the words. The direction is that the premises' in a certain event \u201c shall be the right and \"property of George May.\u201d This implies more than do the terms of a general devise, such as \u201c I give a lot &amp;c.\u201d The words \u201c right and property \u201d are here used to measure or describe the estate given ; as if it were said, \u201c I give all that lot &amp;c. to be the right and property of George May,\u201d\u2014or \u201cto George May to be his right and property\u201d\u2014\u201cBight\u201d and \u201cproperty,\u201d it is true, are words which in the mind of a lawyer, apply to an estate of 'any quantity, inheritable or for life, or even, to a less estate ; but outside of the bar, they are commonly used, and especially the word \u201cproperty,\u201d to express the absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ownership, and to the popular understanding they carry that idea. In this very will in the fourth clause the word \u201cright\u201d is used as descriptive of the testator\u2019s entire estate in the lands there devised. An unprofessional draftsman ignorant of the technical words for limiting a fee simple, might naturally lay hold of such expressions. Such was the writer- of this will. His mode of using the word \u201c heirs,\u201d in both the first and fourth clauses, shews that he supposed it to include only descendants ; while his studious selection and use in both clauses, of the phrase \u201c right and property,\u201d to describe the estate limited over, is an evident labor after expressions to carry a larger estate than those first limited, the estates tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">Thus it is clear to the Court from the context and. the general scope of the will that the words of this devise were used by the testator with an intent to pass the fee simple ; and, therefore, we must so construe them. Ho rules of law are plainer or better settled than those which govern this whole subject. In wills technical terms are not required\u2014words of inheritance are not essential in order to pass a fee simple. Any language, however informal, will be sufficient, if used with a clear intent to pass the fee. In construing the words <em>used, prima fade </em>technical terms will be held to bear their legal sense, and popular expressions will be taken in their ordinary acceptation; but this presumption rests upon the supposed intention of \u25a0the testator so to use them. His real meaning is open to be explained by anything apparent on the face of the will, and the sense, thus ascertained, in which a testator has employed the words or expressions, must prevail, if the operation to be given them is consistent with the rules of law. This is the result of the whole course of decisions. They are collected in the text hooks and need not be cited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
