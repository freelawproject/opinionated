H. Apartments, Inc., Respondent, v. Beachcliff Realty Corp., Appellant.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"A_Xn\">Appeal from so much of a judgment entered after trial before an Official Referee (1) as declares that parcels \u201cC\u201d and \u201cE\u201d have an easement of right of way over a strip of land in the City of New Rochelle, known as Beach Avenue, from Davenport Avenue to the waters of Long Island Sound, as shown on a designated map made in 1853, inuring to the benefit of respondent, tenants and guests occupying designated units of apartments, for all lawful purposes, including ingress and egress, picnic and recreational purposes, sunbathing, boating and bathing, (2) as enjoins appellant from interfering with such uses over the strip of land, and (3) as directs the removal forthwith of an existing fence and gate. Judgment modified on the law (1) by striking from the first decretal paragraph the words \u201c Parcels \u2018 A \u2019, \u2018 B \u2019 and \u2018 D and by substituting therefor the words \u201cParcels \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018D\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019\u201d, (2) by striking from the second decretal paragraph everything following the words \u201cNew Rochelle, N. Y.\u201d and by substituting therefor the words and figures \u201c and the occupants of the two southerly units of building numbered 4, which are constructed upon Parcel 1 C \u2019 and Parcel 1 E \u2019, known as 39 and 43 Davenport Avenue, New Rochelle, N. Y., are enjoined and restrained from using Beach Avenue, with the right to the plaintiii', its successors or assigns, as to the two westerly nnits of building numbered 3, known as 25 and 29 Davenport Avenue, and as to the two southerly units of building numbered 4, known as 39 and 43 Davenport Avenue, to apply for relief at the foot of this judgment consistent with the decision of the court dated September 20, 1957, if and when these four units are reconstructed; and it is further\u201d, (3) by striking from the third decretal paragraph the words \u201c Parcels \u2018 C <em>\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018 </em>E and \u201c have \u201d and by substituting therefor respectively the words \u201c Parcel 1 C \u2019 \u201d and \u201c has \u201d, (4) by striking from said third decretal paragraph everything following the words \u201c Bryson Map \u201d and by substituting therefor the words \u201cand it is further\u201d, (5) by striking from the fourth decretal paragraph everything beginning with the words \u201c three units \u201d and ending with the words \u201c boating and bathing \u201d and by substituting therefor the words and figure <em>\u201c </em>one unit, known as 35 Davenport Avenue, New Rochelle, N. Y., which building is constructed upon Parcel \u2018 C \u2019, are entitled to the free and unobstructed use of Beach Avenue as a right of way to Long Island Sound\u201d, and (6) by striking from the fifth decretal paragraph everything following the words \u201crestrained from\u201d and by substituting therefor the words \u201cerecting and maintaining any fence, posts, gate or obstruction barring access to Beach Avenue unless a gate therein along Davenport Avenue be left open for the use of those persons who are hereinabove adjudged to be entitled to easement rights\u201d. As so modified, judgment insofar as appealed from affirmed, with costs to appellant. The findings of fact are affirmed. No easement was ever granted in favor of Parcel \u201c E \u201d, There was no subsequent conveyance with reference to the filed map showing Beach Avenue and the subject parcels <em>(Newman </em>v. <em>NelUs, </em>97 N. Y. 285, 289-290; 28 C. J. S., Easements \u00a7 39, pp. 701-702). The use d\u00a3 the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>'&lt; appurtenances \u201d in the conveyances of the parcels did not serve to create an easement <em>(Parsons </em>v, <em>Johnson, </em>68 N. Y. 62, 65-66; <em>Swezey </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>143 Mise. 372, 375). The fence presently on the property should be allowed to remain so long as it is left open to afford access to those entitled thereto. It enables appellant to keep out intruders <em>(Pouy </em>v. <em>Manila, </em>234 App. Div. 897). The action was brought to have an easement of right of way declared. The easement depends on the language in the 1853 deed providing for \u201ca right of way * * <em>* </em>from Davenport Avenue * * * to Long Island Sound\u201d. It was error to enlarge this right of way to include uses foreign to the grant, i.e., \u201call lawful purposes, including * * '* picnic and recreational purposes, sunbathing, boating and bathing\u201d, <em>(Grafton </em>v. <em>Moir, </em>130 N. Y. 465, 471; <em>People ex rel. Bryan </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Tax </em>Comrs., 67 Misc. 508, 509, affd. 142 App. Div. 796.) Wenzel, Acting P. J\u201e Murphy, Ughetta and Kleinfeld, JJ\u201e concur; Hallinan, J., concurs in the deletions and substitutions made in the first, second, third and fifth decretal paragraphs and in the deletion from the fourth decretal paragraph of the words \u201c three units, known as 39, 43 and 35 Davenport Avenue, New Rochelle, N, Y., which building is constructed upon Parcel 1 C \u2019 and Parcel \u2018 E \u2019\u201d and in the substitution therefor of the words \u201cone unit, known as 35 Davenport Avenue, New Rochelle, N. Y., which building is constructed upon Parcel \u2018 Cbut dissents from the deletion of the words \u201c for all lawful purposes, including ingress and egress, picnic and recreational purposes, sunbathing, boating and bathing\u201d from said paragraph and from the substitution therefor of the words \u201cas a right of way to Long Island Sound \u201d, and votes to modify the judgment as so indicated, and as so modified to affirm the judgment insofar as appealed from, with the following memorandum: The majority construes the \u201cright of way\u201d granted in the 1853 deed as a right of passage and nothing more. It is, however, well settled that the meaning of words varies with the context <em>(Taggart </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>53 N. Y. 233). Here the very name of the easement area (Beach Avenue) suggests that it was intended to be used for activities usually associated with beaches. Logic has compelled appellant to concede that the beach portion of the \u201cAvenue\u201d may be used for normal beach purposes, even though this use is not mentioned in the grant. There is nothing to show that the intent of the grant was any different with respect to the rest of the easement, or where a dividing line was intended to be drawn. Therefore, the Referee's determination in this respect should not be disturbed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
