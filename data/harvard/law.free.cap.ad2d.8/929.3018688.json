Memorandum: The allegations of the complaint do not state a cause of action at law for the return of the purchase price based upon a prior rescission. There is no prior rescission alleged in the complaint. Moreover, the prayer for relief asks for a rescission. Likewise, the allegations of the complaint do not state a cause of action for damages based upon an affirmance of the contract. There is no allegation of damage nor is the prayer for relief consistent with that type of action. We conclude that the complaint states a cause of action in equity for a rescission and return of the purchase price. The prayer for relief is also consistent with that type of action. (See <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>118 N. Y. 297, 302, 303; <em>Goldsmith </em>v. <em>National Container Corp., </em>287 N. Y. 438, 442; 3 Carmody-Wait, New York Practice, \u00a7 34, p. 547.) All concur. (Appeal from an order of Monroe Special Term, denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike the cause from the Trial Term Calendar and granting plaintiff's motion to strike out a certain paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>from the complaint and ordering the cause to proceed to trial.)
