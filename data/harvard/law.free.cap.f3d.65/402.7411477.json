The district court issued an order dismissing both claims or in the alternative granting summary judgment against Wilson. She appeals the court\u2019s ruling on the Title VII claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">On December 17, 1991, Wilson filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging that her supervisor had sexually harassed her during her employment with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The EEOC found her application untimely and dismissed her complaint. Wilson\u2019s attorney received notice of the EEOC decision on May 3, 1993, and mailed a copy to Wilson in Germany. Wilson received the decision on May 25, 1993, and mailed a letter to the EEOC on May 28, 1993, discussing information relating to her claim. On June 7, 1993, Wilson\u2019s attorney submitted a Form 573 to the EEOC, requesting an appeal of the Agency\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The EEOC found that the notice violated the thirty-day time limit on such appeals and denied the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Subsequently, Wilson brought this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Secretary moved for summary judgment, arguing that because Wilson\u2019s request for appeal had been untimely, she had failed to exhaust her Title VII administrative remedies, thereby barring her from bringing an action in district court. The Secretary also argued that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the FTCA claim. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the Title VII claim, and it dismissed the FTCA claim with prejudice. Wilson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">Wilson contends that the district court should not have granted summary judgment on her Title VII claim, arguing that the Agency erroneously dismissed her appeal because (1) her letter of May 28 was a notice of appeal filed within the statute of limitations, and (2) alternatively, equitable considerations entitle her to a tolling of the statute. We exercise de novo review of the grant of a summary judgment. <em>Duffy v. Leading Edge Prods., Inc., </em>44 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.1995). Summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Wilson argues that the EEOC incorrectly decided that her appeal was untimely. \u201cIf an EEOC charge is untimely filed, a suit based upon the untimely charge should be dismissed.\u201d <em>Barrow v. New Orleans S.S. Ass\u2019n, </em>932 F.2d 473, 476-77 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Templeton v. Western Union Tel. Co., </em>607 F.2d 89, 91 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>see also National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. City Pub. Serv., </em>40 F.3d 698, 711 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[C]ourts have no jurisdiction to consider Title VII claims as to which the aggrieved party has not exhausted administrative remedies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We will reverse an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations only if the decision is arbitrary or capricious. <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2866, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (\u201cThe scope of review under the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d); <em>Wilson v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>991 F.2d 1211, 1215 (5th Cir.1993) (looking \u201cat the agency\u2019s decision to determine if it was reached in an arbitrary or capricious manner\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1296, 127 L.Ed.2d 649 (1994). \u201cA decision is arbitrary or capricious only when it is \u2018so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>991 F.2d at 1215 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, </em>463 U.S. at 43, 103 S.Ct. at 2867). \u201cThe agency decision need only have a rational basis, and it does not have to be a decision which the court would have made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Wilson argues that her letter to the EEOC on May 28 was an appeal and should have satisfied the statute of limitations. EEOC regulations provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">The complainant, agent, grievant or individual class claimant (hereinafter complainant) must file an appeal with the Director, Office of Federal Operations, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, at P.O. Box 19848, Washington, DC 20036, or by personal delivery or facsimile. The complainant should use EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition, and should indicate what he or she is appealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.403(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Wilson asserts nothing more than that this court should consider her letter an appeal. Wilson provides no authority, however, to support excusing her failure to comply with the regulations. Also, the letter did not state that she was appealing the EEOC\u2019s decision. We therefore hold that the Commission\u2019s decision that Wilson did not file a timely appeal was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">Wilson alternatively contends that equitable considerations merit a tolling of the thirty-day time limit on filing an appeal to the EEOC. EEOC regulations allow that \u201c[t]he time limits in this part are subject to waiver, estoppel and equitable tolling.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.604(c). A complaining party in a Title VII case bears the burden of providing the justification for application of equitable tolling principles. <em>Nowlin v. RTC, </em>33 F.3d 498, 503 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Blumberg v. HCA Mgmt. Co., </em>848 F.2d 642, 644 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 789, 102 L.Ed.2d 781 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">In <em>Chappell v. Emco Machine Works Co., </em>601 F.2d 1295 (5th Cir.1979), we discussed three possible bases for tolling: (1) the pendency of a suit between the same parties in the wrong forum; (2) plaintiffs unawareness of the facts giving rise to the claim because of the defendant\u2019s intentional concealment of them; and (3) the EEOC\u2019s misleading the plaintiff about the nature of her rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1302-03. None of these apply in this ease, but <em>\u201cChappell </em>does not hold that these three are the only bases for tolling-\u201d <em>Blumberg, </em>848 F.2d at 644-45. Therefore, Wilson\u2019s inability to satisfy one of the bases for tolling under <em>Chappell </em>is not necessarily fatal to her claim. However, we \u201chave generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.\u201d <em>Irwin v. Department of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 463, 458, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990); <em>see also Baldwin County Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, </em>466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 80 L.Ed.2d 196 (1984) (per curiam) (\u201cOne who fails to act diligently cannot invoke equitable principles to excuse that lack of diligence.\u201d); <em>Pacheco v. Rice, </em>966 F.2d 904, 906 (5th Cir.1992) (requiring due diligence to warrant equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Wilson argues that despite all \u201cdue diligence,\u201d overseas mailing delays caused her appeal to be untimely. Such delays, she contends, are clearly a \u201ccircumstance beyond complainant\u2019s control\u201d and entitle her to equitable tolling. Wilson claims to have acted with all due diligence but she provides no support for this contention. She fails to explain why she could not have notified her attorney of her intent to appeal in the event of an unfavorable decision by the EEOC. She also fails to explain why she could not have avoided overseas mail and communicated via telephone or facsimile machine. Because it was within Wilson\u2019s power to ameliorate the circumstances that resulted in her untimely filing, we agree with the D.C. Circuit that overseas delays do not warrant tolling. <em>See Rao v. Baker, </em>898 F.2d 191 (D.C.Cir.1990) (holding that mailing delays to Philippines did not justify tolling or excuse lack of diligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Indeed, to some extent, we question the relevance of the overseas delays to Wilson\u2019s claim for equitable tolling, because her attorney could have responded for her. Notice to her attorney constituted notice to Wilson, <em>Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458; <em>see also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.402(b) (\u201cIf the complainant is represented by an attorney of record, then the 30-day time period ... shall be calculated from the receipt of the required document by the attorney.\u201d), and Wilson offers no explanation for her attorney\u2019s failure to protect her rights. Accordingly, Wilson\u2019s counsel\u2019s inaction does not warrant an extension of the limitations period. <em>See Irwin, </em>498 U.S. at 96, 111 S.Ct. at 458 (refusing to toll a 30 day statute of limitations in a Title VII case, where the plaintiff was late in filing because his attorney had been out of the office when the EEOC notice was received, and holding that \u201cprinciples of equitable tolling ... do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect\u201d). Wilson has failed to meet her burden to show that the EEOC should have applied equitable tolling to her appeal; therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\">. Form 573 is the EEOC\u2019s \"Notice of Appeal/Petition\u201d form. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.403(a). Under the applicable regulations, \u201d[t]he complainant should use EEOC Form 573, Notice of Appeal/Petition, and should indicate what he or she is appealing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-16\">. The Commission used May 3 \u2014 the date when Wilson's attorney received notice of the denial of her application \u2014 and June 7 \u2014 the date that Wilson\u2019s attorney filed the Form 573 with the EEOC \u2014 to establish that she had not appealed within the thirty-day limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
