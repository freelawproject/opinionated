The district court, relying upon <em>United States v. Awalt, </em>728 F.2d 704, 705 (5th Cir.1984), rejected Montes\u2019 argument that failure to receive notice constituted \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Fed.RApp.P. 4(b). Because the district court did not have the benefit of a recent decision which modifies the holding in <em>Await, </em>we vacate and remand the order denying Montes\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b118-21\">In March of 1993, Montes pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute marijuana and aiding and abetting money laundering. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 210 months for each offense, three years of supervised release, a $20,000 fine, and a $100 special assessment. This court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal but remanded the case to the district court for a determination of whether Montes was entitled to an additional one-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">On remand, the district court issued a written judgment denying an additional one-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Montes filed a motion for leave to file a notice of appeal out-of-time, alleging that he did not receive notice of the entry of the district court\u2019s order. The district court denied Montes\u2019 motion, holding that the delay in filing the notice of appeal was not due to excusable neglect. Montes timely filed a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for leave to file a notice of appeal out-of-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-24\">Rule 4(b) provides that where a criminal defendant\u2019s notice of appeal is not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>within the prescribed ten-day period, \u201c[u]pon a showing of excusable neglect the district court may ... extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). The district court considered and rejected Montes\u2019 claim that his failure to receive notice constituted excusable neglect. The district court, quoting <em>Await, </em>stated that \u201ccase law establishes that lack of notice \u2018is not a basis for a plea of excusable neglect and does not excuse noncomplianee with Rule 4(b).\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The district court correctly applied the law of this circuit as it existed at the time of its order. However, since that time this circuit has enunciated a different standard for determining when \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d exists. The Supreme Court, reviewing the excusable neglect standard of Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1), chose to adopt a more permissive standard for determining when excusable neglect exists. <em>Pioneer Inv. Serv. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). This court subsequently extended the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d in <em>Pioneer </em>to Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). <em>United States v. Clark, </em>51 F.3d 42 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In <em>Clark, </em>we stated that <em>\u201cPioneer </em>does allow somewhat more room for judgment in determining whether mistakes of law are excusable than does the strict standard for excusable neglect espoused by some of our prior decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44. We also expressly disapproved our prior decisions that had strictly interpreted excusable neglect, to the extent they conflicted with <em>Pioneer. Id. </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">In light of the fact that the court below did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Clark, </em>we remand this case for reconsideration by the district court of its order denying Montes\u2019 motion to file a late notice of appeal. In no way does our opinion address whether the facts of this case constitute \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
