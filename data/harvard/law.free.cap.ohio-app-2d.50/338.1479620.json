S. Code <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff-appellee (plaintiff), Continental Acceptance Corporation, filed this action in the Cleveland Municipal Court on December 13,1974, against defendant-appellant (defendant), Guadalupe Rivera for the recovery of $511.87, plus costs and interest. That amount was owed by defendant on a promissory note. Defendant filed an answer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a motion for summary judgment, which was overruled by the court. The case was tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">At trial it was disclosed that defendant had entered into a contract with the Steel Workers Credit Union, on May 15, 1970, for the extension of a consumer credit loan, together with credit insurance charges, to be paid in installments totaling $1,959.97. The loan agreement specified that the \u201cAmount Financed\u201d was $1,686.36, the \u201cFinance Charge\u201d was $273.61, and the \u201cAnnual Percentage Rate\u201d was 12%.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As part of the transaction, but in a separate document, defendant agreed to pay $72.99 for group credit life insurance and group disability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The Credit Union subsequently filed for bankruptcy at a time when defendant had amassed savings of $1,021,11 at the Credit Union, and still owed the Credit Union $623.58 on the loan agreement. Pursuant to the Stipulation of Plan of Settlement, accepted by the Bankruptcy Court, defendant, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>member of the class bound by the agreement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was to receive credit for less than 31% of Ms savings. Upon setting off the adjusted savings figure against the loan balance, it was determined that defendant owed $406.57 on the loan. The Bankruptcy Court approved the sale and transfer of the Credit Union\u2019s loan portfolio (including defendant\u2019s loan agreement) to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff in the amount of $511.87<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> upon finding that defendant\u2019s answer, raising the Truth-in-Lending defenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201c* * * was (1) foreclosed to Defendant by paragraph 5 of the Stipulation of Plan of Settlement limiting the right of set-off and (2) precluded by the one-year Statute of Limitations of the Truth in Lending Act, Section 130(e), 15 U. S. C. A. $1640(e).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Defendant timely appeals raising two assignments of error. For reasons assessed below we find both well taken. We reverse and remand with instructions to enter judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Assignment of Error No. </em>I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201cI. The court below erred in its failure to find that the consumer credit transaction upon which plaintiff-appellee brought suit violated the Truth-in-Lending Act in that the constituent parts of the \u2018amount financed\u2019 and to [sio] the \u2018finance charge\u2019 were not separately itemized and that such itemization did not include the cost of credit insurance charged to the defendant-appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Section 1601, Title 15 U. S. Code, <em>et seq., </em>was enacted for the purpose of compelling creditors to fully disclose to borrowers the specific terms of consumer credit agreements, see Section 160.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Title 15, U. S. Code; see also <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Beneficial Finance Co. of Eugene </em>(1975, D. Ore.), 395 F. Supp. 9, 12, and <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Clearview Dodge </em>Sales, <em>Inc. </em>(1974, E. D. La.), 384 F. Supp. 722, 726. Specifically, the Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to it<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> require, in pertinent part, that the agreement separately state the total \u201camount of credit,\u201d all charges (individually itemized) included in the credit amount but not part of the finance charge, and the amount of the \u201cfinance charge,\u201d Section 1639(a), Title 15, U. S. Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Each category must include individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>itemizations of the charges which comprise the total, Regulation Z, 12 CFR Section 226.8(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In the instant case defendant agreed, in a document separate from the credit, agreement,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to pay for credit insurance. The credit agreement fails to specify whether the credit insurance was computed as part of the \u201camount financed\u201d or the \u201cfinance charge.\u201d The agreement contains no itemizations to disclose where the credit insurance charge was computed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Regardless of where the credit in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>sur anee cost was included, plaintiff\u2019s failure to itemize the charge in the credit agreement violated the express requirements and underlying purpose of the Truth-in-Lending Act. Similar failures to itemize particular charges have consistently been held violative of the Act. See, <em>e. g., Simmons </em>v. <em>American Budget Plan, Inc. </em>(1974, E. D. La.), 386 F. Supp. 194, 198;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Clearview Dodge Sales, Inc. </em>(1974, E. D. La.), 384 F. Supp. 722, 725;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Associates Finance, Inc. </em>(1974, S. D. Ill., N. D.), 369 F. Supp. 1121, 1122.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The first assignment of error is well taken.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. II:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u201cII. The court below erred in denying defendant-appellant statutory Truth-in-Lending damages up to the amount of appellee\u2019s demand where the appellant\u2019s claim for such damages arises from the subject of the appellee\u2019s complaint and is raised in defense by way of recoupment; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>specifically erred in its reliance upon a statute of limitation, 15 U. S. C. A. \u00a71640(e), and upon an inapplicable stipulation of settlement approved in an unrelated bankruptcy action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">This assignment of error raises two principal issues: First, whether the defensive truth-in-lending' counterclaim, asserted by defendant, is barred by the Statute of Limitations, Section 1640(e), Title 15, U. S. Code, and second, whether the Stipulation of Plan of Settlement, executed in the separate bankruptcy proceeding, bars the defensive pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">A. <em>Statute of Limitations: </em>Defendant concedes that the Statute of Limitations, Section 1640(e), Title 15, U. S. Code,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\" barred defendant from asserting his truth-in-lending claims in an original action. However, defendant argues that his counterclaim is, in effect, a defense by way of recoupment which is not barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Defendant\u2019s Truth-in-Lending counterclaim is a recoupment, not a setoff, because it arises out of the same transaction as plaintiff\u2019s claim, <em>i. e. </em>the loan agreement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The counterclaim of recoupment is not barred by the one-year Statute of Limitations for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Statute of Limitations does not bar a defense, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>as recoupment,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which is based on facts arising out of the transaction which is the subject of the complaint,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and which does not require affirmative action of the court, cf. <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Connolly </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 396, 405. In <em>Summers </em>the court drew the distinction between \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cpure\u201d defenses, to which the Statute of Limitations bar does not apply, and those which are not strict defenses, such as setoff, to which the bar is operative. The \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cpure\u201d defenses are those in which the \u201c* * * matters pleaded in defense grow out of or are connected with the matters pleaded in the petition, so that the establishment of the facts so pleaded in defense would defeat recovery * * *.\u201d <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra. Summers </em>is not dis-positive here because that case involved a setoff not recoupment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In the instant case the defense of recoupment is not barred by the Statute of Limitations because the establishment of the Truth-in-Lending violations emerges from the transaction upon which plaintiff\u2019s complaint is based, and defeats the entire amount of plaintiff\u2019s $511.87 claim (see fii. 15). However, the right to assert recoupment is defensive only. It will not support affirmative relief.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Summers </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In addition holding that the Statute of Limitations bars the defense of recoupment would frustrate the fundamental policy of the Truth-in-Lending Act. That policy is designed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">\u201c* * * assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit * * Section 1601, Title 15, U. S. Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">If defendant\u2019s claim of Truth-in-Lending violations is barred by the statute there is the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">\u201c* <em>* </em>* potential for creditors to avoid largely the proscriptions of the Act merely by waiting one year to bring suit against the defaulting debtors. This would run directly contrary to the stated purpose of the Act. * * <em>Ballew </em>v. <em>Associates Financial Services Company of Nebraska, Inc. </em>(1976, U. S. Dist. Ct. D. Nebraska), CV 75-L-119, unreported p. 3. See also <em>State Employees Credit Union </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(Mich. Dist. Ct., 1976), Case No. 35265, unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ported p. 2; <em>Wood Acceptance Co. </em>v. <em>King </em>(1974, Ill. App. Ct.), 18 Ill. App. 3d 149, 151.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">For these reasons we conclude that the court below erred. The Statute of Limitations does not bar defend\u00e1nt\u2019s claim of recoupment based on the alleged' Truth-in-Lending violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">B. <em>Plan of Settlement in Separate Bankruptcy Proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Plan of Settlement in the bankruptcy case- provided in paragraph 5: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201cNo member of the class shall have the right to set off against any loan balance remaining after credit to it as provided in Section 4 hereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this prohibition against set off [sic] shall apply in any action before any court \u2022 brought by the Trustee or his assignee for collection of.said-loan balance and interest accrued thereon * * A\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The Plan of Settlement set forth the formula by which savings are to be reduced at a percentage of actual value and then set off against the amount of the loans outstanding for that member of the Credit Union. The prohibition against future setoffs, read in the context of the entire Plan of Settlement, means that no future setoffs could be asserted by a member of the class at a ratio higher than that set forth in the Settlement. The term \u201cset off,\u201d as used in the agreement, is limited and does not bar all possible claims arising out of the loan transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">However, even if the term meant all setoffs of any kind, the provision does not affect the instant defendant because he is asserting a claim of recoupment, not setoff. If the effect of the Plan of Settlement is deemed to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>a recoupment, it frustrates the aim of the federal statute. This is an impermissible result.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The court below, therefore, erred in concluding that the Plan of Settlement barred the instant claims of Truth-in-L\u00e9nding violations. The second assignment of error is well taken for the reason that neither the Statute of Limitations nor the Plan of Settlement bars defendant\u2019s counterclaim defense of recoupment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter judgment for defendant.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b370-7\">Jackson, C.
