J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atx\">This is an appeal from a conviction for aggravated burglary in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">The defendant, Adolph S. Higgins, assigns as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1cz\">\u201cI. Where, in a jury trial, the state attempts to introduce a taped confession allegedly made by the defendant, and where the defendant objects to the introduction of said tape, and where the trial court, without an independent hearing as to the voluntariness of said confession overrules the defendant\u2019s objection and permits the introduction of said tape, said conduct, on the part of the trial court is a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the-United States Constitution and is ground for reversal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">We overrule the claimed error. The record reveals that the defendant never availed himself of a pre-trial motion as required by Crim. R. 12(B)(3). Defendant\u2019s objection is deemed waived under Crim. R. 12(G) unless he offered the court \u201cgood cause\u201d to show why the waiver should not be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The record shows that while the state was presenting\u2019 evidence, defendant objected to the introduction of the taped confession on the grounds of its trustworthiness and reliability, and suggested that the defendant was under the influence of drugs at the time of the confession. All of these are objections which should be made .by pre-trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The \u201cgood cause\u201d required by Crim. R. 12(B) to obtain relief from the waiver must be such as to show that the defendant had a \u201cgood excuse\u201d for sleeping on his right's in failing to file pre-trial motions. The defendant offered none to the trial court nor did he request an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The testimony of the detective who took the tape recording indicates a compliance with \u201cMiranda\u201d and a willingness with understanding on the part of the defendant to waive his right to remain silent. Evidence in the record indicates that the waiver was not the result of any threats, coercion, promises, etc. It was, therefore, properly admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We find that Crim. R. 12(B)(3) does not conflict with <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1964), 378 U. S. 368 nor <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>(1967), 385 U. S. 538. The defendant was not denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-8\">Hunsicker and Doyle, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Hunsicker and Doyle, JJ., retired, were assigned to active duty under authority of Section 6(C), Article IV, Constitution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
