The defendant was indicted for the August 16, 1975, shooting death of Joim Allen, a Columbus resident, along the east bank of the Scioto River in southern Delaware County.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">The prosecution\u2019s case included the testimony of Patricia Epley, an eye witness to the shooting and the key prosecution witness. She had lived with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>for three and one-half years. The defendant was the father of one of Patricia Epley\u2019s three children. She testified that the defendant, accompanied by the victim, Johnny Allen, returned to their apartment on the day of the shooting, a Saturday afternoon, and indicated a desire to go fishing. She volunteered to drive the defendant and Allen to the fishing site. While enroute, the defendant removed a hand gun from his clothing and informed Allen that he was going to kill him. After Epley pulled the vehicle off State Route 257, close to the Scioto River in southern Delaware County, the defendant marched Allen to the edge of the river and shot him twice, leaving him dead where he was later discovered the same day. Patricia Epley testified that she had been ordered by the defendant to accompany them after they departed from the car and thus she saw the shooting. The defendant and Epley then returned to the vehicle and drove back to Columbus, stopping on the return trip to pick up Epley\u2019s three children whom she boarded out during the week while she worked. The next day, Sunday, Epley visited her sister in Columbus and advised her of the shooting. Epley\u2019s sister contacted the Columbus Police. The Columbus Police went to the apartment of Epley and the defendant and after failing to get a response at the door of the apartment, began to tow Epley\u2019s car. At this point, Patricia Epley left the apartment and went to the parking lot where she advised the Columbus police officers of - the killing. The officers returned to the apartment and apprehended the defendant. Epley testified that she had hidden the defendant\u2019s revolver before she went down to check with the police officers in the parking lot. She returned to the apartment and retrieved the twenty-five caliber revolver for the investigating officer. Additional testimony established that the defendant had purchased the revolver and it was this gun that was ballistically identified with a bullet fragment taken from the body of the victim and the twenty-five- caliber casing found- at the scene-.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Epley testified that the defendant advised the victim, Allen, that he was going to kill him because Allen had failed to pay a note the defendant, had guaranteed. \u25a0 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>prosecution introduced testimony establishing that the defendant had guaranteed the payment of a note due Household Finance on which Allen was the principal obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The defendant denied the shooting, claiming he was alone in the apartment on Saturday afternoon. He admitted being with Allen earlier in the day but not at the apartment. However, another tenant in the apartment, Ida Farmer, testified that she had seen the defendant and Allen together at the apartment on the Saturday afternoon at issue, corroborating Epley\u2019s testimony and contradicting the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We turn first to a consideration of the second assignment of error by which the defendant claims that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the defendant a transcript of the grand jury testimony of Patricia Epley.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The appellant first sought Patricia Epley\u2019s Grand Jury testimony by a pre-trial motion filed October 14, 1975, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u201cNow comes the defendant through his counsel and moves the court for an order to require the prosecuting attorney to furnish to counsel for the defendant a transcript of the testimony of Patricia Epley before the Delaware County Grand Jury in the above entitled case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">On October 20, 1975, the day the trial commenced, the trial court ordered the court reporter of Delaware County to produce for examination by the court the transcript of the testimony of Patricia Epley taken before the Grand Jury of Delaware County, Ohio, on September 8, 1975, and deliver the same in a sealed envelope to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The trial court did not rule on the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion until after the prosecutor concluded the direct examination of Patricia Epley. Then the trial court denied the motion during the following colloquy which took place outside the hearing of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">\u201cThe Court: Let the record show that the defendant is present with his counsel. Mr. Shaw, did you have anything at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\u201cMr. Shaw: No, Your Honor. I believe the witness, Patricia Ann Epley is ready for cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Wickham, I believe you have a mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tion here with respect to Grand Jury testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">\u201cMr. Wickham: Well, I did, yes, file a written motion to ask the Court to permit us to have the transcript of her Grand Jury Testimony, Patricia Epley\u2019s, in order to be able to determine whether that testimony varies from her testimony at the preliminary hearing in the Delaware Municipal Court and also her testimony here at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\u201cMr. Shaw: If I may be heard on that, the rules just absolutely don\u2019t say that. In my memorandum which I filed and, I believe, is a part of the official file in this case, the discovery inspection of Grand Jury proceedings are governed by Buie 6 E and there must be a motion made or a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the Grand Jury. And there is utterly \u2014 well, this record is devoid of anything that even remotely approaches that. The rule does not provide for the in-camera inspection absent that motion. I don\u2019t think that is either shown or can be shown. And I think the rule, 6 E, specifically precludes the request that the defendant has made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">\u201cThe Court: I might say for the record that I ordered the Court Beporter to transcribe the testimony of Miss Epley before the Grand Jury. I have examined the testimony given in the preliminary hearing in the Municipal Cdurt. I have read the transcript as prepared by the Court Beporter of Miss Epley\u2019s testimony before the Grand Jury and listened to her testimony here on the witness stand. Mr. Wickham, I can find very little variations all the way through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">\u201cMr. Wickham: We have exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">\u201cThe Court: We will deny your motion. I feel as though I owed it to you to do that. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The Ohio Buies of Criminal Procedure provide authority for the defendant to obtain transcripts of grand jury testimony only as to his or a co-defendant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury. See Criminal Buie 16(B)(1)(a) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">However, defendant contends that his right to the grand jury testimony of Patricia Epley arises because of the defendant\u2019s \u201cparticularized need\u201d for such testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and therefore he is not bound by the limitations of Criminal Rule 16 (B)(1)(a) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">We find this case to be one of first impression in Ohio.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 360 U. S. 395, and <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 855, dealing with the concept of \u201cparticularized need\u201d for grand jury testimony, notwithstanding the traditional secrecy protection that attends grand jury testimony, merit critical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>involved a Sherman Act prosecution. The defendant corporation moved for the delivery of the grand jury testimony of an important government witness after securing from the witness, on cross-examination, the admission that he had appeared before a federal grand jury on the subject of the' prosecution three times. The defendant cited as authority for \u201cthe automatic delivery of the grand jury testimony\u201d the ease of <em>Jencks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957), 353 U. S. 657.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Justice Clark, writing for the five man majority, declared that the ruling in <em>Jencks </em>did not apply nor did the so called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U. S. C. (Sup. V 1950) Section 3500, which was characterized as excluding grand jury minutes from its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Justice Clark held that any right to disclosure of grand jury testimony was covered by Rule 6(e)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. He stated, at page 399:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201cIn fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge. Our cases announce the same principle, and Rule 6(e) is but declaratory of it. As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \u2018to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\u2019 as instances of \u2018particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble, </em>356 U. S. 677 (1958).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Justice Clark also rejected the defendant corporation\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s discretion under Rule 6(e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of <em>Jencks, </em>so that a mere showing that the government\u2019s witness testified before the grand jury would give the defense the right to the delivery of the testimony, declaring such a procedure to run contrary to the \u201clong established policy of secrecy\u201d for grand jury proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">However, Justice Clark recognized the principle of a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for grand jury testimony but placed the burden on the defendant to show such a \u201cparticularized need\u201d as he stated, at page 400:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">\u201cThe burden, however, is on the defense to show that \u2018a particularized need\u2019 exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a (right) to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Finally, Justice Clark refused to consider the defendant\u2019s claim of error in that the trial court failed to examine the grand jury transcript for inconsistencies as no such request had been made of the trial judge, but only a claim of an absolute right to the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The dissent in <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>sheds little light on what is required to establish a \u201cparticularized need\u201d in order to obtain disclosure of grand jury testimony other than the description of the witness in question as \u201cthe principle prosecuting witness \u2019 \u2019 and an argument that the need for secrecy as to the witness\u2019s grand jury testimony no longer existed. Additionally, Justice Brennan in his dissent, approving of the <em>Jencks </em>method, stated the belief that where \u201cparticularized need\u201d is demonstrated, the grand jury transcript should be given to the defense counsel for his inspection and use rather than to provide for a preliminary inspection by the trial court and judicial determination as to what portion of the transcript would be useful for purposes of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States next addressed the issues surrounding \u201cparticularized need\u201d in <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966), 384 U. S. 855, a ease involving a charge that the defendants conspired fraudulently to obtain the services of the National Labor Relations Board for their labor union by filing false non-communist affidavits. A unanimous court held that the trial court committed reversible error by denying the defense motion- for the production of the the grand jury testimony of certain government witnesses because the defense had made a showing of \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the production of the grand jury testimony by the following, at page 872:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201c1. The events as to which the testimony in question related occurred between 1948 and 1955. The grand jury testimony was taken in 1956, while these events were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>latively fresh. The trial testimony which petitioners seek to compare Avith the 1956 grand jury testimony Avas not taken until 1963. Certainly, there was reason to assay the latter testimony, some of which is 15 years after the event, against the much fresher testimony before the grand jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u201c2. The motions in question involved the testimony of four of the eight government witnesses. They were key witnesses. The charge could not be proved on the basis of evidence exclusive of that here involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u201c3. The testimony of the four Avitnesses concerned conversations and oral statements made in meetings. It was largely uncorroborated. Where the question of guilt or innocence may turn on exactly Avhat was said, the defense is clearly entitled to all relevant aid Avhich is reasonably available to ascertain the precise substance of the statements,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201c4. Tavo of the Avitnesses were accomplices, one of these being also a paid informer. A third had separated from the union and had reasons for hostility toward petitioners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c5. One witness admitted on cross-examination that he had in earlier statements been mistaken about significant dates. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In <em>Dennis, </em>the Supreme Court again addressed the issues of the procedure to be folloAved by the trial court upon the determination that a \u201cparticularized need\u201d had been demonstrated, holding at page 874:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201cIn <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass, supra, </em>the Court reserved decision on the question whether <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial judge is an appropriate or satisfactory measure when there is a shoAving of a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for disclosure. 360 U.S., at 401. This procedure, followed by production to defense counsel in the event the trial judge finds inconsistencies, has been adopted in some of the Courts of Appeals. In the Second Circuit it is available as a matter of right. <em>While this practice may be useful im enabling the. trial court to rule on a defense motion for production to it of grand jury testimony </em>\u2014 and <em>we do not disapprove it for that </em>purpose^it' by no means disposes of the matter. Trial judges ought not to be burdened with the task or the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sibility of examining sometimes voluminous grand jury testimony in order to ascertain inconsistencies with trial testimony. In any event, \u2018it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness.\u2019 <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass, </em>360 U. S., at 410 (dissenting opinion). Nor is it realistic to assume that the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the utility of material for impeachment or other legitimate purposes, however conscientiously made, would exhaust the possibilities. In our adversary system, it is enough for judges to judge. The determination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be made only by an advocate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">But for the passing reference in <em>State </em>v. <em>Laskey, supra, </em>to the concept of \u201cparticularized need\u201d we find no other reference to the subject or the procedure to be utilized by the Ohio courts. Clearly, the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure are silent on the subject, except for the phrase \u201cbut may disclose such matters only when so directed by the court preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,\u201d in Crim. R. 6(e), which may inferentially permit the Ohio courts to disclose the grand jury testimony of a witness upon a showing of a \u201cparticularized need.\u201d We so find and proceed to a further consideration on the various issues that arise aliunde.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">At the outset, the decisions of the United Stafes Supreme Court on the subject of \u201cparticularized need\u201d are predicated on the supervisory power of that court over the inferior federal courts, rather than on constitutional grounds requiring state court compliance by reason of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The issues that require resolution follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Does the burden to establish \u201cparticularized need\u201d for- a disclosure of the grand jury testimony of a witness rest with the defendant <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\"><em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>clearly places the burden on the defendant to establish \u201cparticularized need\u201d before grand jury testimony may be disclosed, and we adopt such a rule. The disclosure of grand jury testimony is an exception to the historical rule of secrecy that protects grand jury proceedings and he who would strip the mantle of secrecy from the proceedings must bear the burden of showing the need for such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">What showing is required to establish a \u201cparticularized need\u201d so as to require a disclosure of the grand jury testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>is authority for the proposition that the fact that the witness is a key witness, standing alone, is an insufficient basis to require disclosure of his grand jury testimony to the defendant. <em>Dennis, </em>on the other hand, points to a series of facts and events which were sufficient to establish \u201cparticularized need.\u201d Important facts in that determination included the passage of approximately seven years from the time of the grand jury testimony to the trial and also the fact that the subject matter of the court room testimony included the conversations and oral statements which we re critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Some of the discussions on the subject of \u201cparticularized need\u201d suggest that the only predicate for disclosure is a showing that the grand jury testimony might assist in impeaching the court room testimony. We reject such a broad interpretation of \u201cparticularized need.\u201d For if that be the test, every defendant in every criminal case could argue the existence of \u201cparticularized need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We find and we so hold that a \u201cparticularized need\u201d requires a showing that it is probable that the defendant will not obtain a \u201cfair adjudication of the allegations placed in issue by the prosecution\u2019s witness\u201d absent disclosure of the grand jury testimony of the witness. Such a test is consistent with the conclusions reached in <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>Dennis, and <em>Laskey, supra. </em>In passing, we believe that it might be possible hypothetically for the defendant to demonstrate a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for grand jury testimony for purposes other than impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Once a trial court finds and declares a \u201cparticularized need\u201d to have been established, how and and on what basis is the defendant to be granted disclosure?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Where the request for the disclosure of grand jury testimony of a prosecuting witness is clearly limited to the impeachment purpose,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find that the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court as reflected in <em>State </em>v. <em>White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 146, and as later codified in Criminal Rule 16(B) (1) (g), to be contrary to the procedure promulgated by the United States Supreme Court, in Dennis, for federal district courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Thus, we hold that where the \u201cparticularized need\u201d is limited to the impeachment purpose, then the trial court should proceed with the disclosure of the grand jury testimony in a manner consistent with the procedures estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>lished by Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(g), rather than to deliver the grand jury transcript to the defense counsel to be used consistent with the practice advocated by <em>Dennis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">When the trial court examines the grand jury testimony absent a declaration that the defendant has established \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the testimony, what rights, if any, accrue to the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The trial court has no obligation to examine the grand jury testimony of a witness notwithstanding a defense request for the production of the same, absent a defense showing of a \u201cparticularized need.\u201d However, where the trial court, in such circumstances, undertakes such an examination, unassisted by counsel and absent a declaration that he has found \u201cparticularized need\u201d to have been established, we find that no right accrued to the defendant by the mere fact of a judicial examination other than the right to have the grand jury testimony made a part of the record for appellate review, where the trial court denies disclosure to the defendant. It is conceivable that the trial court may conclude that even where the defendant is unable or has failed to meet the burden of showing a \u201cparticularized need,\u201d the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, under the particular circumstances of the case at hand, may be further protected by such an independent judicial review, or as suggested by the dissent in <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass, supra, </em>such a review might assist the court in determining the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We turn now to the case at hand. The defendant\u2019s motion for the production of the grand jury testimony of Patricia Epley was insufficient to demonstrate a \u201cparticularized need.\u201d The motion is silent as to the reason for the request and was subject to summary rejection as in <em>State </em>v. <em>Laskey, supra. </em>The motion did not describe Patricia Epley as the state\u2019s sole eye-witness to the killing. The motion did not declare that the defense had been unable to interview Patricia Epley. The motion did not disclose that the defendant was unable to prepare a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>absent the grand jury testimony. In fact, the defendant had the opportunity to and did confront the witness, Patricia Epley, at the preliminary hearing. Further, the subject of Patricia Epley\u2019s testimony was not limited to oral conversations and circumstances in the long distance past, as in <em>Dennis. </em>In short, the trial court would have been justified in a summary rejection of the motion for Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">However, the trial court, following the direct testimony of Patricia Epley, extended to the defendant an additional opportunity to pursue his motion for the grand jury testimony. At that point, defense counsel indicated that the defense interest was limited to a consideration of whether her grand jury testimony \u201cvaried\u201d from her preliminary hearing testimony and trial testimony. Thus, the issue for the trial court came into sharp focus with such a specific request for the grand jury testimony. The trial court then had before it Patricia Epley\u2019s direct testimony demonstrating that she was a companion of the defendant, an eye witness to the killing, and a person who had indirectly led the police to the defendant and the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On the issue of whether the defendant has met the burden of showing a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the disclosure of Patricia Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes, the trial court had for his consideration the substance of Patricia Epley\u2019s direct testimony, the fact of only a sixty-five day passage of time between the victim\u2019s death and the trial and the fact of a prior defense confrontation of the witness Epley at the preliminary hearing. We find the foregoing insufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the disclosure' of Patricia Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony! \u2019 We find no basis upon which the trial court should have found that' it was probable that the defendant would not obtain a fair adjudication of the allegations placed in issue by the witness, Patricia Epley, absent a disclosure of her grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">' We turn now to a consideration of the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>trial court\u2019s independent and unilateral examination of the grand jury testimony of Patricia Epley conducted in the absence of a declaration by the trial court that a \u201cparticularized need\u201d had been shown by the defendant. We find no support for the proposition that the trial court had concluded prior to trial, when he ordered the transcript of Patricia Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony, that the defendant had made a showing of a \u201cparticularized need.\u201d The trial court\u2019s response to the attorney for the defense when he finally denied the motion for the production of the grand jury testimony is entirely consistent with our conclusion that the trial court ordered and examined the grand jury testimony of Patricia Epley as a result of his zealous desire to protect the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for Patricia Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Following oral arguments before this court, and upon the discovery that the trial court had ordered and read the transcript of Patricia Epley\u2019s grand jury testimony, this court ordered, pursuant to Appellate Eule 9(E), a supplemental record to include such grand jury transcript limited to the testimony of Patricia Epley and extended to counsel the opportunity to examine the same and submit supplemental briefs. After reviewing the grand jury testimony, appellant\u2019s counsel submitted a supplemental brief alleging a number of inconsistencies upon comparing the grand jury testimony with the trial testimony. Upon review, we find only three inconsistencies, all on 'minor points and dealing primarily with the victim, Allen. We find the inconsistencies to be insignificant. They do not go to the material allegations of Patricia Epley\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We conclude that where the trial court examines the grand jury transcript of a state witness, absent a showing by the defense of a \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the disclosure of the witness \u2019 testimony, and absent a declaration that the trial court found such a \u201cparticularized need,\u201d the defendant is not entitled to a disclosure of the transcript for impeachment purposes even though, as in this case, the transcript reveals' minor inconsistencies in the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>jury testimony and the trial testimony, not going to the material allegations of the witness\u2019 testimony. For the foregoing reasons, we overrule the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">We turn to a consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error which contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in permitting Chief Deputy William B. Lavery to testify as to Ms opinion of whethee or not the decedent knew he was going to be shot once it became clear that the sole basis of this opinion was the hearsay statements of Patricia Epley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201d3. The trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to repeatedly inquire on voir dire examination as to whether or not drinking or intoxication could excuse the defendant\u2019s actions even if he were determined to be otherwise guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201d4. The court erred in refusing the defendant the right to introduce certain reports on the behavior of Patricia Ann Epley during her confinement in several mental institutions and wMch reports were proffered to prove the impaired and feeble condition of the witness\u2019s mind and memory and further to impeach the credibility of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled. First, the defense initiated the inquiry of Deputy Sheriff Lavery as to his opinion concerning whether or not the victim knew he was going to be shot. Second, defense counsel succeeded in showing that Lavery\u2019s opinion was hased on hearsay rather than on Ms investigation of the murder scene; thus, he destroyed the effectiveness of Lavery\u2019s opinion. Assuming, arguendo, that it was error for the trial court not to sustain the defense motion to strike Lavery\u2019s opinion, once it developed that his opinion was based .on hearsay, the error became harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The third assignment of error is overruled. The question put by the prosecuting attorney to prospective jurors and the defendant\u2019s exception are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">&lt;;Q. If it is shown, to you on August 16, 1975, at the time the question of the shooting occurred, if it is shown to you that earlier in that day that the defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>drinking and you are otherwise satisfied of the defendant\u2019s guilt, would you excuse his act and find him not guilty simply because he had been drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">\u2018 \u2018 Mr. Wickham: Object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The question was not improper. Had the defense wanted to defend on the basis of \u201cintoxication to the extent that he was incapable of reflection or deliberation,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s question was not a barrier to such a defense or appropriate voir dire by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The fourth assignment of error is not supported by the record upon our finding that the defendant failed to lay a proper foundation for the admissibility of the hospital records. Specifically, no witnesses were called to identify, authenticate, or otherwise describe the records. Having so determined, we do not reach the issue of whether the records were admissible, notwithstanding the provisions of E. C. 5123.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-9\">Euthereord, P.J., and Putman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Laskey </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St. 2d 187, 191, The Supreme Court mentioned the concept of \u201cparticularized need,\u201d in passing, in finding no error when the trial court denied a defense motion in a first degree murder case for the production of grand jury minutes and transcripts. The court held, at 191:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cIn this ease, appellant sought discovery of the grand jury transcript before trial for purposes of preparation. Generally, proceedings before a grand jury are secret and an accused is not entitled to inspect grand jury minutes before trial for the purpose of preparation or for purposes of discovery in general. This rule is relaxed only when the ends of justice require it, such as when the defense shows that a particularized need exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1959), 360 U.
