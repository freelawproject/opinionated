Prior to any ruling on such motion for stay of proceedings, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. Upon the pleadings and affidavit of Mr. Glenn E. Hardbarger, assistant vice president of Huntington National Bank, as to the existence of the aforestated note, the statement of the amounts due and owing on such note, and upon the affidavit of the defendant relative to the sequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of events concerning the note and the specific contacts with the plaintiff bank, the trial court entered a summary judgment for the plaintiff Huntington National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Pursuant to Civ. R. 56, summary judgment, may not be properly granted by the trial court unless reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. In determining whether a summary judgment may be granted under the facts as presented in a given matter, the trial court must construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>First United Church of Christ </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Further, a summary judgment cannot appropriately be awarded upon motion unless one cannot reasonably draw any inference from the evidence that there may be a valid defense. Specifically in this regard, we find in the affidavit of the defendant Robert M. Watters, at section 6 thereof, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cDefendant executed a note to Plaintiff for said balance of the purchase price, and took possession of the automobile. However, before moneys were disbursed by Plaintiff to Rutherford Bros. Inc., Defendant discovered the defective nature of the automobile and contacted Plaintiff, and told Plaintiff not to disburse the funds to Rutherford Bros. Inc., because the car was defective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Further within the defendant Robert Watters\u2019 affidavit, we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201c7. Plaintiff\u2019s agent told Defendant that although .the funds had not been disbursed that they would not stop the pending disbursement based upon Defendant\u2019s claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Also, at section 8 of the defendant\u2019s affidavit, we find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cThereafter, Plaintiff disbursed the funds to Rutherford Bros. .Inc., directly contrary to Defendant\u2019s instructions and demands. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">We feel that such evidence submitted by this defendant by way of his affidavit does in fact present reasonable inferences that there may be .presented by this defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>a valid defense to the claim on this note. It is onr view that the plaintiff, a holder of the note, with knowledge of the failure of consideration of the maker\u2019s contract of purchase with Rutherford Brothers, and having received a request to stop payment, holds this instrument subject to the defense of failure of consideration in the same manner as such a defense would be available against Rutherford Brothers. Here the defendant raises the issues not only that the plaintiff was aware of the claim that there had been a failure of consideration because of the imperfections noted within the- automobile, but also that the plaintiff had been told prior to disbursement of the funds that they were not to disburse the funds because of the failure of consideration. These presented issues of fact which should have been determined by the trial court upon evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The plaintiff conversely argues that even assuming that the issues raised by the defendant, are genuine, there would be serious question about the materiality of such issues in that disbursement of funds against the appellant\u2019s order and with knowledge of the defects of the automobile would not be a defense to an action on the note. In support of such proposition, the plaintiff argues that Ohio has long recognized the existence of third-party beneficiary contracts upon which the outside party for whose benefit the contract was executed could maintain an; independent action. Citing <em>Emmitt </em>v. <em>Brophy </em>(1884), 42 Ohio St. 82; <em>Society of Friends </em>v. <em>Haines </em>(1890), 47 Ohio St. 423; and <em>Visintine &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Rd. Co. </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We recognize that Ohio has generally adopted the third-party beneficiary contract theory. We also are aware that there is case law in Ohio which holds that a legal obligation owing from the promisee to the third person is not essential to the maintenance of an action by a third person. See <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Northern Ohio Granite &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 373. This latter principle of law has :been applied in allowing recovery by third-party donees as 'against a second party promisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>However, we are not disposed to extend such theory to the facts of the instant case to defeat the defense of the maker of an instrument where, in an action by the holder bank, the maker had alleged that prior to the distribution of the monies to the third-party automobile dealer, he had in-informed the bank of the failure of consideration and had ordered the bank to stop payment upon such note.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In any event, we hereby hold that the evidence before the trial court upon this motion for summary judgment did in fact raise genuine issues of material facts so that the moving party was not entitled upon motion to a summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Based upon all of the foregoing, the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court is hereby reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings according to this decision and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b351-7\">Whiteside and McCormao, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b351-8\">Whiteside, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVO\">concurring. Although I concur in the opinion and judgment, there are some additional pertinent observations. Defendant executed a note payable to plaintiff bank in consideration for which plaintiff bank was to pay a stated sum of money to an automobile dealer in partial payment of an automobile being purchased by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Prior to such payment being made by the plaintiff bank, defendant notified plaintiff bank not to make the payment because defendant had discovered that the automobile being purchased was defective. Plaintiff bank refused to follow defendant\u2019s instructions, and, after such notice, made the payment to the automobile agency. (It might be noted that defendant\u2019s affidavit refers to the automobile agency as \u201cRutherford Bros., Inc.\u201d; whereas, plaintiff\u2019s affidavit refers to payment being made to \u201cUnited Auto Sales.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Plaintiff bank contends that it was entitled to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>payment to the automobile agency and hold defendant liable therefor, despite defendant\u2019s instructions to the contrary (which plaintiff does not concede it received), because the automobile agency was a third-party beneficiary of the contract (note) between plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">. Assuming that the automobile agency was a third-party beneficiary, plaintiff bank acted at its peril if it paid the agency after notification not to do so from defendant. Plaintiff bank, merely because it possesses a promissory note executed by defendant, is not entitled to, in effect, act as judge and jury and determine favorable to the agency the dispute between defendant and the automobile agency over the proceeds of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">When notified of the dispute as to whom the loan proceeds should be paid, plaintiff bank could no longer rely upon the original instructions from, and understanding with, defendant that the loan proceeds should be paid to the auto agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The controlling issue is whether the automobile agency is entitled to the loan proceeds by virtue of being a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between plaintiff bank and defendant. Obviously, if, as defendant contends, the circumstances are such as to justify cancellation of the purchase of the automobile, or that the sale contract was materially breached by the agency, then the agency would not be entitled to the loan proceeds. Plaintiff bank was not entitled to make this determination. Having done so, plaintiff bank can recover on the note only if it is determined to have made the correct determination of the dispute between defendant and the agency as to the agency\u2019s right to the loan proceeds. This issue cannot be resolved upon summary judgment predicated upon what was before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The foregoing is, of course, predicated upon construing the evidence favorable to defendant. The ultimate factual determinations may well reveal a different fact situation than that set forth above. However, at this stage of this case, there are most clearly genuine issues of material facts that must be resolved in plaintiff\u2019s favor before it could possibly be entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
