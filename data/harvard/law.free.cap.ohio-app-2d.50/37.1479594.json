This appeal is taken pursuant to App. R. 4(A) and is filed as a matter of right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">The record shows a complaint was filed by the Franklin County Children Services Board alleging Carrie Lynn Baumgartner was a neglected minor child, and seeking permanent commitment to the Franklin County Children Services Board for adoption. The case was heard before a judge of the Juvenile Division of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. At the hearing, the complaint was amended from neglect to dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The transcript shows essentially informal testimony which was not, however, incomplete, indicating that appellant, the mother of Carrie Lynn, was contacted by Mr. and Mrs. Curt Griffith regarding Carrie Lynn\u2019s future. It is apparent that Mr. and Mrs. Griffith showed concern about the child and, at the time, wished to adopt her. Appellant was also quite desirous for this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Hence, it was suggested to the. court by counsel for appellant that the temporary commitment to the Franklin County Children Services Boaj\u2019d be terminated, and that Carrie Lynn continue as a ward of the court, and that she be directly.placed with the Griffiths. In the alternative, it was suggested that the temporary commitment be continued, and that. Franklin County Children Services' be directed to place Carrie Lynn with the Griffiths. The child, at the \u2022time of the hearing, was four -years old and, the transcript Shows, had been in a foster home since August of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The trial court specifically noted this fact in its concluding remarks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201cThe Court: You know, you may have a situation where the foster parents get uptight about this too. You know a lot of times these foster parents want to adopt when the children become available. Many of our adoptions today are by foster parents. They might feel that they had done a yeoman\u2019s job with this child for the last year and seven months, so these are all the things that have to be considered by the Children\u2019s Services Board. Very frankly, one of the things that goes into adoption is the motivation of the adopting parents. \"What\u2019s their motivation? Is their motivation, you know, out of * * * because they don\u2019t have children and they want children? Because they want, you know, to have children and have a family and raise children? Is their motivation to save a marriage that\u2019s going on the rocks? Is their motivation to satisfy some psychiatric need that they have within themselves? All of those things are * * * people adopt children with all those motivations in mind. \"I\u2019m not capable, this Court isn\u2019t capable, of making those kind of determinations so I have to defer to the people- who are professionals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>this field. The court will make a permanent. commitment of this child, finds that the child is a dependent child, make a permanent commitment and place the child in the permanent custody of the Franklin County Children\u2019s Services Board. That\u2019s all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">In any event, appellant has perfected this appeal, assigning the following as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to consider the alternate plans of the mother of the child and in refusing to hear any testimony regarding the suitability of the proposed placement and in permanently committing appellant\u2019s child to Franklin County Children\u2019s Services Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We note at the outset there was no issue raised concerning the trial court\u2019s finding that Carrie Lynn Baumgartner was a dependent child. It is reiterated that we have repeatedly emphasized the rights of parents concerning children. This case, however, is distinguishable from sevr eral of the other eases decided by this court and cited by counsel for appellant. The trial court is not required to permit a mother of an admittedly dependent child to pick and choose the child\u2019s adoptive parents. Moreover, the entire context of the trial court\u2019s comments in the transcript shows awareness and consideration of the suggested alternative plans. In fact, the trial court specifically stated the proposed adoptive parents could mak\u00e9 application to the Children Services Board for adoption .or commitment of the child to their care. The key p.oint is that the professional agency is best able to consider who, among the prospective adoptive or foster parents, would be most capable of meeting the needs of the child. In essence, the court did not concede that the mother could formulate a plan for giving her child away after the child was adjudged dependent. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The trial court quite plainly acted within its statutory authority. We note E. C. 2151.353, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">\u201cIf the child is adjudged an abused, neglected, or dependent child, the court may make any of the following orders of disposition: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201c(D) Commit the child permanently to the county department of welfare which has assumed the administration of child welfare, county children services board, or to any other certified agency. Upon such commitment the natural or adoptive parents are divested of all legal rights and obligations due from them to the child or from the child to them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The trial court emphasized that it was not an adoption court by illustrating future problems and conflicts emerging from assuming such a role with poignant results. Simply stated, it was the crux of the trial court\u2019s judgment that the professional agency was best able to consider and determine the child\u2019s best interests. The net effect is that there are no options foreclosed, including ultimate adoption by the Griffiths. The trial court, aware of the alternatives, simply placed jurisdiction in the proper professional area.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Moreover, it was made quite plain that adoption was a separate proceeding within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court and should not be hampered in any manner by another court. These functions are, of course, related to separate and distinct jurisdictions. Therefore, we find the trial court acted within its statutory authority, considered the child\u2019s best interests, did not foreclose any option whatever, and placed the ultimate determination in the proper professional agency. Consequently, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Whereupon, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-8\">Strausbattoh, P.
