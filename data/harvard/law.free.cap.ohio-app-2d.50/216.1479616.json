L. Mahoney, the president of Columbus Coated Fabrics, Mr. Dewey Bennett, the safety director of such company, and Dr. William T. Paul, the physician of Columbus Coated Fabrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The defendant employer, as well as Mr. Mahoney, Mr. Bennett, and Dr. Paul, filed motions for summary judgment. Such motions were based upon Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, R. C. 4123.74, which-provisions preclude an action for damages by an employee against his own employer, and upon R. C. 4123.741, which precludes an action for damages by \u201cany other employee\u201d as ag\u00e1inst any \u201cemployee of any employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Upon granting summary judgment for these defendants herein named, the claims as against the manufacturers and distributors of the complained of chemicals were left pending for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">The assignments of error of the plaintiffs, appellants herein, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in sustaining the Defendants\u2019 Borden, Inc.,1 Edward :L. Mahoney, Dewey Bennett, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>William T. Paul\u2019s Motion for a Summary Judgment on the basis of the Ohio Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws, Article II, Section 35, Ohio Constitution; and Section 4123.74 and 4123.741, Revised Code, for these Sections unconstitutionally deprived the Plaintiffs of their 5th Amendment, U. S. Constitution, right to property without due process..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">\u201c2. The trial court erred in sustaining the Defendants\u2019 Borden, Inc., Edward L. Mahoney, Dewey Bennett, and William T. Paul\u2019s Motion for a Summary Judgment on the basis of the Ohio Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws, Article II, Section 35, Ohio Constitution; and Sections 4123.-74 and 4123.741, Revised Code, for these Sections unconstitutionally deprived the Plaintiffs of their 5th Amendment, U. S. Constitution, right to life and liberty without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201c3. The trial court erred in sustaining the Defendants\u2019 Borden, Inc., Edward L. Mahoney, Dewey Bennett, and William T. Paul\u2019s Motion for a Summary Judgment on the basis of the Ohio Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws, Article II, Section 35, Ohio Constitution; and Sections 4123.74 and 4123.741 Revised Code, for these Sections unconstitutionally deprived the Plaintiffs of their 14th Amendment, U. S. Constitution, right to equal protection of the laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Basically, such assignments of error, and the rather voluminous brief filed by the plaintiffs in support thereof, argue that the workmen\u2019s compensation law of the state of Ohio, as provided for by the Ohio Constitution and statutory enactment, is contrary to the Constitution of the United States in that such law denies these and other Ohio employees the due process of law as provided by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, and denies such employees the \u201cequal protection\u201d of the law as provided for by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We must reject all of the plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Much of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in support of their claim of the unconstitutionality of the workmen\u2019s compensation law is based upon their premise that the courts must review the purposes and the legislative intent of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>state laws in the light of the changing patterns of manufacturing processes, and the increased use of new, exotic, and' potentially physically dangerous types of chemicals and synthetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">The argument takes the form that such new and dangerous chemicals could not have been in the minds of the framers of the Constitution of Ohio and the minds of the legislature when the code sections were enacted, as such would relate to the right of action that employees should be ever granted where personal injuries have been received. Plaintiffs further emphasize that the continuing right to bring an action for injuries sustained in the course of one\u2019s employment should particularly not be denied where it is shown that the employer has not complied with certain safety standards for the protection of such employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">A number of cases cited by the plaintiffs in support of the aforestated propositions were decided prior to the adoption of the fountainhead for the authority of the original workmen's compensation provision, Section 35, Article II, of the Ohio Constitution, as adopted in 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">This constitutional provision provided generally for the elimination of rights of action by employees against employers for injuries received by the employees. It initially provided that rights of action could still be maintained where \u201clawful .requirements\u201d for the protection of lives, health and safety of employees had not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">However, effective January 1, 1924, this latter reference to rights of action where \u201clawful requirements\u201d had not been met was amended to specifically preclude a suit for damages by an employee against an employer covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, such amendment being in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">\u201c * * * Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premiuih or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries or occupational disease. * * *\u201d . \u25a0.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>This constitutional provision has been implemented by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act which prohibits negligence actions by employees against a covered employer for injuries received while in the course of their employment, but provides for compensation for injuries or death in conformity with the procedures, findings, and schedules of the Industrial Commission pursuant to the 'authorization of such chapter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Also, if there be a violation of specific -safety requirements as established by the commission, ah additional recovery may be awarded pursuant to the following provisions of this constitutional section: \u25a0 -. \u25a0,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201cSuch board shall have full power and authority to hear and determine whether or not an injhry, disease or death resulted because of the failure of the employer to comply with any specific requirement for the- protection of the lives, \u2019 health or safety of employes, enacted by the Generah Assembly or in the form of an order adopted by such board, \u00e1nd its decision shall be final; and for the purpose of such investigations and inquiries it may appoint referees.' When it is found, upon hearing, that an injury, disease, or death resulted because of such failure by the employer, such amount as shall be found to be just, not greater than fifty nor less than fifteen per centum of the maximum \u00e1ward established by law, shall be added by the board, to\u2019 the amount of the compensation-- that may be aw\u00e1rded on account of such injury, disease, or death, and paid in like manner as other awards * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In conformity with such constitutional authority, the General Assembly created the Industrial Commission of Ohio and enacted volume 41 of the Ohio Laws., and sections of law providing for the general standards-and duties of care owed by an Ohio employer to his employees, and to those known as \u201cfrequenters,\u201d who regularly come upon the premises of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The Supreme Court of Ohio, prior to the -1924 amendment of Section 35, Article - \u00cdI, held that thes\u00e9 workmen's compensation'laws, \u201cembodying in general terms duties-and obligations of care and caution,\u201d were lawful requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>within the meaning of. the Ohio Constitution,, and thence held, that an. action could be brought by an employee as against an employer. <em>The Ohio Automatic Sprinkler Co. </em>v. <em>Fender </em>(1923), 108 Ohio St. 149 .This interpretation bf the workmen\u2019s compensation laws was again followed in the case of <em>Winzeler </em>v. <em>Knox </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">However, as stated, the adoption of the amendment to Section 35, Article II, specifically precluded such a suit by an employee,'- and the language of the amendment stated in effect that the Compensation received by an employee pursuant to laws provided for the compensation of employee injuries, \u201cshall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation or damages * *</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In harmony with this provision of the Constitution, as amended, was , the enactment of R. C. 4123.74, which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cEmployers who comply with section. 4123.35. of the Revised Code shall not be liable to respond, in damages' at common law or by statute for any injury, or. occupational disease, or bodily condition, received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment, or for any death resulting from such injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition occurring during the period covered by such premium so paid into the state./insurance fund, or during the interval of time in which such employer is permitted to pay such compensation directly to his injured employees or the dependents of his killed employees, whether or not such injury, occupational. disease, bodily condition, or death is compensable under sections 4123.01 to. 4123.94, inclusive, of the. Revised Code.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Since such- constitutional amendment, and this specific code section, the Ohio Supreme Court, and other courts in Ohio, have uniformly held that an employee may not sue a complying employer for damages for injuries sustained in his employment. Example of such cases propounding such law are <em>State, ex. rel. Turner, </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity Co. </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 250; <em>State, ex rel. Engle </em>v. Indus. Comm. (1944), 142. Ohio St. 425; <em>Sebek </em>v. <em>Cleveland Graphite Bronze Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio. St. 693; <em>Bevis v. Armco Steel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Corp. </em>(1949), 86 Ohio App. 525; <em>Greenwalt </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 1; <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>MacGregor Co. </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St. 2d 89; and <em>State, ex rel. Allied Chemical Corp., </em>v. <em>Earhart </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">As noted here, the main thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in this- appeal is to the effect that these workmen\u2019s compensation laws, as interpreted by the Ohio courts, unreasonably limit the rights of an employee to be \u201cfully compensated\u201d for his injuries received within the course of his employment, and in effect force the employee to accept the smaller amount of compensation provid\u00e9d for by the workmen\u2019s compensation law. Such resultant, argue the plaintiffs, is- an unconstitutional denial of .the employee\u2019s right of \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cequal protection\u201d of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The initial portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, to the effect that \u201cfull compensation\u201d in the form of pain and suffering and punitive damages, has been denied an employee by the workmen\u2019s compensation laws, was early laid to rest by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>State, ex rel. Crawford, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1924), 110 Ohio St. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">No Ohio cases have been cited herein which speak directly to the federal constitutional arguments advanced by-these plaintiffs. However, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Courts of other states, have upheld other similar statutory provisions against claims of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">As- pointed out by the defendants herein, the United States Supreme Court considered three coordinated cases involving the constitutionality of the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of the states of New York, Iowa and Washington, in <em>New York Central R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White </em>(1917), 243 U. S. 188, <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Bleakly </em>(1917), 243 U. S. 210, and <em>Mountain Timber Co. </em>v. <em>State of Washington </em>(1917), 243 U. S. 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u2019 \u2019 In upholding the workmen\u2019s compensation law of New York,'the Supreme Court set forth the following in its, syllabus in <em>New York Central R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>White, supra</em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\"><em>\u201cHeld: </em>(I) That neither (a) in rendering the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>liable irrespective of the doctrines of negligence, contributory negligence, assumption of risk and negligence of fellow servants, nor (b) in depriving the employee, or his dependents, of the higher damages which, in some cases, might be recovered under those doctrines, can the act be said to violate due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\">\u201c (2) That viewed from the standpoint of natural justice, the system provided by the act in lieu of former rules is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201cThe common-law rules respecting the rights and liabilities of employer and employee in accident cases, viz., negligence, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, fellow-servant doctrine, as rules defining legal duty and guiding future conduct, may be altered by state legislation, and even set aside entirely \u2014 at least if some reasonably just substitute be provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In amplification of the rationale of these principles, we find the following within the decision, at page 197:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cIn considering the constitutional question, it is necessary to view the matter from the standpoint of the employee as well as from that of the employer. For, while plaintiff in error is an employer # # * the exemption from further liability is an essential part of the scheme, so that the statute if invalid as against the employee is invalid as against the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201cThe close relation of the rules governing responsibility as between employer and employee to the fundamental rights of liberty and property is of course recognized. But those rules, as guides of conduct, are not beyond alteration by legislation in the public interest. No person has a vested interest in any rule of law entitling him to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit. * * * The common law bases the employer\u2019s liability for injuries to the employee upon the ground of negligence; but negligence is merely the disregard of some duty imposed by law; and the nature and extent of the duty may be modified by legislation, with corresponding change in the test of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Bleakly, supra, </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>reviewing the workmen\u2019s compensation law of Iowa, said, in the syllabus, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201cA Workmen\u2019s' Compensation Act, which, prescribing the measure of compensation and the circumstances under which It is to be made, establishes a method of applying the measure to the facts of each case by due hearings before an administrative tribunal, whose action upon all fundamental and jurisdictional questions is subject to judicial review, is not open to objection upon the ground that it clothes the administrative body with an arbitrary and unbridled discretion in violation of due process of law.\u201d ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Similarly, in <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Texas Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1919), 249 U. S. 152, the Supreme Court of the United States reviewed the Texas workmen\u2019s compensation act, and it specifically rejected the assertion that workmen\u2019s compensation laws constitute a \u201cdeprivation of liberty and property without due process of law.\u201d It further rejected the claim that such act denied employees affected by the act equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Dravo Corporation </em>(C. A. 5, 1971), 441 F. 2d 1239 <em>(cert. denied </em>404 U. S. 1017), the plaintiff contended that \u201che was unconstitutionally deprived of a property right,\u201d and his \u201cright\u2019.\u2019 to sue his employer, and fellow servants for damages by the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In'rejecting this contention, the court stated, at page 1242, that \u201cone cannot be heard to question the sufficiency of due process if the rule of law, which merely held the potential to create a property right, was changed before any right vested,\u201d and concluded: \u201cThis latter' situation is precisely what obtains in the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Thiokol Chemical Corp. </em>(S. D. Ga. 1973), 368 F. Supp. 668, the claim that the workmen\u2019s Compensation law of Georgia denied \u201cdue.process\u201d and \u201cequal protection\u201d because of the denial of \u201call common law and other remedies to covered employees and their dependents\u201d was reject<em>ed</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">In <em>Kaznoski </em>v. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. </em>(W. D. Penn. 1974), 368 F. Supp. 1022, it was held that the West Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation act was not a violation of \u201cdue process\u201d by virtue of \u201cthe loss of one\u2019s right to sue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\">It is difficult, if not impossible, to enact perfect legislation pertaining to ajiy field of human endeavor or needs. The laws relating to workmen\u2019s compensation, the Industrial Commission, and the provisions of law enacted to compensate employees for their work-related injuries, and to provide for relief from civil suit to the covered employer, is no exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The workmen\u2019s compensation laws of Ohio may well not be perfection in their attempt to compensate employees for their injuries, but they do indeed provide a reasonably equitable balance between the rights, duties and privileges of both the employee and the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Although these statutes as written, and as administered by the administrator and the Industrial Commission, may need amendments in certain respects, such laws are not unreasonable or unfair in the constitutional sense. We believe that these laws have provided a fair and reasonable opportunity for employees to be compensated for their injuries, and an opportunity for the families of deceased \u25a0employees, who have succumbed from industrial injuries, to receive survivor benefits for their reasonable aid and care.; ,</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We find no unconstitutional denial of due process, nor a denial 'of the equal protection of the law, on the face of such statutes. Nor do we find that these plaintiffs have been treated unfairly or unreasonably in the interpretation or application of such laws to their claimed right to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Therefore, all of the assignments of error as set forth by the plaintiffs are hereby dismissed, and the judgment of the Court of Common .Pleas of Franklin County is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AEx\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-9\">Strausbaugh, P.
