Several months thereafter, plaintiff-appellee was called to replace a large broken window which had been intact at the commencement of the lease term. Goetz vacated the premises one month later without paying for the repairs performed by the appellee, who subsequently brought this action to recover such payment from the appellant, alleging the latter\u2019s unjust enrichment by the appellee\u2019s installation of the new window. Both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>parties filed motions for summary judgment with the trial court, which granted the appellee\u2019s motion and entered judgment thereon in its favor. This appeal was timely brought, presenting a single assignment of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Appellant essentially challenges the applicability of the doctrine of unjust enrichment to the instant case, arguing that where, as here, a property owner resumes possession of property which is in the same condition as when such possession was relinquished, no appreciable and, hence, compensable benefit has been conferred upon the property or its owner. We disagree. Appellee\u2019s replacement of the broken window permitted the appellant to later assume possession of a building which was secure and habitable, and which, in the absence of such repairs, would have remained neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">In addition, we find appellant\u2019s suggestion that it enjoys the superior equity in the instant case to be without merit. The appellee did not intervene officiously in appellant\u2019s management of its property, but rather performed the subject repairs at the behest of a caller whose identity was not disclosed in the proceedings below. Moreover, the appellee, if not permitted to recover the claimed amount, will have lost the value of the labor and materials which it invested in the subject repairs. The appellant, on the other hand, seeks to avoid payment for services which preserved the value of its property and which the appellant ultimately may have been required to perform upon its subsequent repossession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Thus, w'e think it readily apparent that the appellee has conferred an appreciable benefit upon the appellant which the latter may not justly be permitted to retain without payment therefor, and accordingly overrule appellant\u2019s assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-8\">Shannon, P.
