Plaintiff\u2019s auto was involved in a collision in Savannah, Georgia, with a city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Savannah sanitation department truck. The truck was uninsured and driven by a city employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The sole issue before this court is whether the trial court erred in finding the policy provision void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The defendant insurer argues that the exclusion of governmentally owned vehicles does not, in any way, affect plaintiffs ability to recover damages for his injuries. It says first, if the government unit involved invokes the doctrine of sovereign immunity, all the insurance in the world would make no difference, since the plaintiff would not be \u201clegally entitled\u201d to recover within the meaning of R. C. 3739.18. Second, where, as here, there is a statutory authority for a waiver of sovereign immunity, the plaintiff does not need insurance since he can look to the resources of the city for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments. As to the first, it fails to consider that the city\u2019s only liability would arise by virtue of the doctrine of respondeat superior and this would still leave plaintiff with an uninsured operator to sue. The second ignores that part of R. C. 3937.18 which states: \u201cfor the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of <em>uninsured </em>motor vehicles * * (Emphasis added). It does not mention owners or operators who are also uncollectable or who cannot respond in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The defendant further argues that the limitation here involved is a reasonable one and is a matter of contract under the theory of <em>Globe American Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Goodman </em>(1974), 41 Ohio App. 2d 231. We cannot accept that analogy. The Goodman case deals with contractually limiting the insured\u2019s right to sue the carrier on the uninsured motorist coverage to one year. It does not, in any way, affect the scope, amount, or creation of the fund under R. C. 3937.18. That case is clearly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Our Supreme Court said in <em>Barlett </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St. 2d 50, 52, 53 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">\u201cThe basic purpose of R. C. 3937.18 is clear. It \u2018is designed to protect persons injured in automobile accidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>from losses which, because of the tortfeasor\u2019s lack of.'liability coverage, would otherwise go uncompensated.\u2019 <em>Abate </em>v. <em>Pioneer Mutual Cas. Co. </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 161, 165, 258 N. E. 2d 429; <em>Curran </em>v. <em>State Automobile. Mutl. Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St. 2d 33, 266 N. E. 2d 566; see also, Note 1,20 Cleve. L. Rev. 10 (1971). In other words, the legislative purpose in. creating compulsory uninsured motorist coverage was to place the injured policy holder in the same position, with regard to the recovery of damages, that he would have been in if the tortfeasor had possessed liability insurance. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">\u201cAs suggested by <em>Abate </em>and <em>Curran, supra, </em>R. C. 3937.18, <em>db initio, </em>enunciated a public policy in this state. Private parties are without power to insert enforceable provisions in their contracts of insurance which would restrict coverage in a manner contrary to the intent of the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We find that this provision in the Dairyland policy restricts the amount and scope of coverage contrary to the intent of R. C. 3937.18. We hold that it is repugnant to the law of Ohio and, therefore, is void and unenforceable as a matter of public policy. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b130-7\">Victor, P. J., and Brenneman, <em>3., </em>concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
