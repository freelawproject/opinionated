J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE7\">On November 24, 1974, Learnas Smith was killed by a bullet fired from his own gun. His wife, Maggie Smith, the appellant .herein, was taken into custody and held by the police for two days without being charged. After a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the Court of Common Pleas, appellant was charged with voluntary manslaughter. Subsequently, on December 18, 1974, she was in-dieted for murder in violation of R. C. 2903.02. The appellant entered a plea of not guilty and a trial was had before a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">The state\u2019s theory of the case was that the appellant and her husband had had an argument which led her to shoot him. The state was unable to offer any evidence, either direct or circumstantial, in support of its theory that an argument had taken place.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the question of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>guilt in the murder, the state offered evidence to show that the appellant had possession of the murder weapon after her husband\u2019s death and had carried that weapon to a neighbor\u2019s home; that though the appellant had made oral statements to the police and had shown investigating officers the locations of three other guns in the home, she failed to tell them about the murder weapon which she left at the neighbor\u2019s home; that she made a statement to one police officer stating that she had neither handled nor fired a gun that evening ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that in referring to the body of her husband, appellant asked Officer Kuhin, \u201cAin\u2019t you moved that mother-fucker yet?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and that the results of a test devised and administered by Sergeant Kovacic of the Scien<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tifie Investigation Unit indicated that appellant had fired a weapon that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The appellant, took the stand in order to maintain her innocence and testified that, she had not had an argument with her husband on the evening in question and that she did not shoot him. She also presented numerous witnesses, including neighbors, the son of appellant and the victim, the daughter of the victim and the stepdaughter of appellant, and that daughter\u2019s husband, all of whom testified that she enjoyed a good reputation for truth and veracity; that they had never known appellant and her husband to have any violent arguments; and that appellant and her husband had a good relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">With respect to the murder weapon, appellant testified that she came downstairs from her bedroom after she had heard her husband arguing with another male and then heard shots fired; that she found her husband lying shot in the driveway;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the murder weapon was also in the driveway; and that she had picked the weapon up and given it to her neighbor. It was not disputed that the appellant simply handed the gun to her neighbor and that she did not ask the neighbor to conceal the weapon or withhold it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the police;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant testified that her act of picking np the gun froih the driveway and her failure to volunteer, information about that gun were the product of her extreme emotional distress caused by the death of her husband.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The appellant controverted the testimony of the one .police officer who claimed that she stated to him that she had neither handled nor fired a gun that evening. She stated that not only, had she not denied handling the weapon, but that the officer who testified had not even asked her any such question.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-19\">\u201cQ. I wish you could tell me why when the police officer asked you \u2018Did you handle or shoot a gun tonight\u2019 you said \u2018No.\u2019 ' \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-20\">\u201cA. They didn\u2019t ask me that. Only thing he asked me, \u2018Did you kill your husband?\u201d\u2019 .,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Further, appellant denied that she made' the alleged statement about'moving the body of her husband. Counsel for appellant was also able to severely -impeach the testimony' of Officer Kuhin. First, there was testimony to the effect that once appellant went into the house after the police hrrived'she did not return to the driveway where her husband was lying as Officer Kuhin testified, but stayed in the house the entire time until taken downtown to the police station. When questioned about this, Detective Mc-Kibben, who was interviewing the appellant while she was in the home, stated that he could not recall whether the appellant \u00e9ver left his presence and went back outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">Second,- Officer Kuhin testified. that the statement \u201cAin\u2019t you moved that mother-fucker yet?\u201d, was made to him on- November 24,' 1974. Even though he did not make any report cont\u00e1iriing the statement, Officer Kuhin' stated that he remembered the statement because it was an \u201cunusual\u201d one. for \u25a0 a .widow to make. In spite of the .potential significance .of such a statement Officer Kuhin did not tell <em>anyone </em>about it until March 11, 1975, the second day of the appellant\u2019s trial. Upon cross-examination Officer Kuhin said he'didn\u2019t make the alleged statement known to his superior before that time, because he assumed they already knew of its existence, even though, he made no report,-and-even -though he testified on direct that no one else was present when the statement was - made/ - -</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Third, Officer Kuhin testified that Mrs':, Smith' was \u201ccalm\u201d in the face of her husband\u2019s death.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Other witnesses testified that the opposite was true. Neighbor. Ezel Vaughn testified-that when appellant saw her.-husband in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the driveway under a flashlight when neighbors were'present she \"\u201cwent berserk\u201d and began, \u201cscreaming, crying, and hollering- V That same witness said that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t, handle her\u201d and that another neighbor had to grab her and take her into the house,. Once in the house witness Vaughn testified that appellant was. \u201cemotional\u201d when talking to the police and that she was crying periodically. Similar testimony was elicited from appellant\u2019s daughter, Eosa Thomas<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and neighbors George Hughes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Gertrude Hughes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Delores Foster.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Fourth, appellant presented the testimony of numerous witnesses that she did not use the type of language attributed to her by Officer Kuhin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>As discussed more fully in our treatment -of appellant\u2019s-first and second assignments of error, appellant also presented expert testimony to dispute the validity of the test conducted by Sergeant Kovacic.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">The appellant also' advanced her own theory of the Cause of her-husband\u2019s death. Testimony at trial established that th\u00e9 victim had played poker that evening with several other individuals. Also present was a Mr. \u201cT\u201d and two young males who accompanied him. Mr. \u2018 \u2018 T \u201d had previously been barred from playing in the game by the victim because Mr. \u201c T \u201d had been accused of cheating. But Mr. \u201cT\u201d was allowed to participate in the game on the evening of the murder. It was further established that the victim had won- money in the poker gave and that Mr. UT\u201d had been a loser. The appellant theorized that Mr. \u00a3 \u00a3 T \u201d was the man who she had heard arguing with her husband, and that he, or one of his two young companions, had shot her husband. Some corroboration for this theory was offered by the testimony of a neighbor that shortly after she heard the shots, she saw two young males -in appellant\u2019s back yard.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Though appellant\u2019s counsel had provided the police department in the person of Detective McKibbeii with the names and addresses of many of those who had attended the card game that evening, including the address of Mr. \u201cT\u201d,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Detective MeKibben testified oil the stand that he had not felt these matters important and had made no effort to investigate these leads.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, an examination of the record reveals that the police failed to conduct even the most minor of inquires \u2014 such as determining whether the blood upon the door seal of the house was of the same type as that of the victim, or checking the murder weapon or the knife found with appellant for fingerprints \u2014 and that once Mr. Kovacic\u2019s test showed a positive result for barium and lead on appellant\u2019s hands, the investigation was concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">With this evidence before it, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder. Appellant was sentenced to 15 years to life in the Ohio State Reformatory for Women. Upon appeal seven errors have been assigned.-</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The Court erred when it overruled appellant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of the state\u2019s \u201cScientific Witness, KMvacie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The Court erred in admitting into evidence testimony regarding the results of the \u201cGunshot Residue Tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Shortly after her arrest police officers had conducted a scientific test by which they hoped to determine whether or not appellant had fired a weapon that evening. That test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>involved having the appellant place her hands on filter paper; spraying the filter paper with diluted hydrochloric acid and then again placing the filter paper on the backs of the hands. Subsequently, the filter paper is then sprayed with a reagent which \u201creacts\u201d by changing colors if there are traces of lead and barium. The state contended that such a test was conducted; that the reaction occurred; and. that the test results Were consistent with the conclusion that appellant had fired a weapon on the evening in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The test administered to the appellant was one developed independently by Sgt. Kovacic. It had as its basis the Harrison-Gilroy Gunpowder Residue Test. Though at, trial Sgt. Kovacic was somewhat familiar with the Harrison-Gilroy test, he did not recall its proper name; did not recall the step-by-step procedures as set forth by its originators; and testified that he did not have any manual in his office which he could consult to determine what procedures should actually be used in administering the test. Nevertheless, Sgt. Kovacic testified that he used the Harrison-Gilroy test, after making two major modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">First, unlike Harrison-Gilroy which tested for three elements \u2014 lead, antimony and barium \u2014 in order to determine that a weapon had been fired, Sgt. Kovacic\u2019s test considered only the presence of lead, and barium. Second, while the Harrison-Gilroy test requires swabbing the areas of the hand with a tenth normal hydrochloric acide solution and cotton swabs, Sgt. Kovacic sprayed the diluted acid onto filter paper and then placed the filter paper on appellant\u2019s hands. This takes on added significance because appellant\u2019s expert witness testified that some filter paper contains some of the elements the test is designed to detect.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">These modifications were made because Sgt. Kovacic considered them to be logical improvements. While independent studies have been made to evaluate the reliability of the Harrison-Gilroy- test, there is no evidence in the record before us that anyone, including Sgt.. Kovacic, has ey\u00e9r conducted any experiments to \u00e1ttempt to objectively determine whether' Sgt. Kovacie\u2019s test was or was not . reliable. 1 ''</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In order to present evidence of the restdts of a scientific test such as the one at bar, the party offering such evidence must establish that:</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">(1) The test was based upon scientific principles which are accepted as dependable for the proposed purpose by the profession concerned in that branch of science or its related art and has \u201cgained general acceptance in the particular field into which it belongs.\u201d <em>E. Cleveland </em>v. <em>Ferell </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 298, 301; <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1963), 118 Ohio App. 359, 361; <em>Tiffin </em>v. <em>Whitmer </em>(1970), 32 Ohio Misc. 169; <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D. C. 1923), 293 F. 1013, 1014; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alston </em>(1974), 362 N. Y. S. 2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">(2) The apparatus and/or materials used to make the scientific test were constructed or produced according to an acceptable model and be in such a condition as to allow for accurate experimentation; <em>See, E. Cleveland </em>v. <em>Ferell, supra; Columbus </em>v. <em>Marks, supra; Tiffin </em>v. <em>Whitmer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">(3) The witness who conducted the test must be qualified to conduct the test by his training and experience. <em>See, E. Cleveland </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>supra; <em>Columbus </em>v. Marks, supra; <em>Tiffin </em>v. <em>Whitmer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In the case at bar the state failed to meet its burden of proof on the'first element set forth above. Based upon his thirteen years of experience with the Scientific Investigation Unit and his membership in various scientific associations, we believe fit is clear that Sgt. Kovaeic was properly qualified to; conduct tests such as the HarrisonGrilroy test or his own gunshot residue test as outlined above. However, an expert can testify as- an expert witness only in his field of expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">There is absolutely no evidence in the record from which it can be concluded that Sgt. Kovaeic was qualified either to testify as to the theoretical basis of a new test for determining the presence of gunshot residue or to give expert testimony that such a test was generally accepted in the scientific community. It must be remembered that both the Harrison-Grilroy and the Kovaeic tests are based upon principles of chemistry. This is not a situation, such as voice print analysis, <em>cf., People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(Cal. 1976), 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Cr. L. 2233, <em>with United States </em>v. <em>Baller </em>(4th Cir. 1975), 519 F. 2d 463, where the \u201cfield\u201d of inquiry is limited to law enforcement officers. Rather, there are a large number of individuals with the requisite background in chemistry to conduct adequate scientific experiments designed to ascertain the validity, if any, of the Kovacic test.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Under these circumstances we find that the results of the test conducted by Sgt. Kovacic should have been excluded upon the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">(1) There was no competent testimony that the Harrison-Gilroy test, as modified by Sgt. Kovacic, was based upon sound scientific principles;</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">(2) There was no evidence that the test had been proved dependable by controlled tests; and</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">(3) There was no testimony that Sgt. Kovaeic\u2019s modified version of the Harrison-Gilroy tests was known, much less accepted, by anyone in the scientific field of chemistry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Accordingly, we find merit in this assignment of error and reverse and remand for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The Court erred when it denied Defendant\u2019s request for an in camera inspection of the written report of a state witness who had refreshed his memory from the report before taking the stand to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">A.t trial appellant took the stand in her own behalf. Upon direct examination she testified that after discovering the body of her husband, she picked up the gun which caused his death and which was lying near the bumper of the car in the driveway. In rebuttal the state offered the testimony of Detective Eugene Volk that appellant had told him that she found the gun on the ldtchen floor. Upon cross-examination Detective Volk indicated that he had prepared a police report that contained his recollection of the conversation between himself and the appellant and that he, prior to testifying, used that report to refresh his memory. Upon cross-examination, appellant moved for ah in camera inspection of the police report to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>whether there were' any inconsistencies between the detective\u2019s testimony at trial and the facts as he recorded them in Ms report.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In considering whether such an inspection should be conducted the trial court indicated that it was a \u201cclose question,\u201d but concluded that even though the report appeared to contain \u201ccontrary\u201d statements, it was not subject to discovery under Criminal Buie 16.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Criminal Buie 16(B)(1)(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cIn camera inspection of witness\u2019 statement. Upon completion of a witness\u2019 direct examination at trial, the court on motion of the defendant shall conduct an in camera inspection of the witness\u2019 written or recorded statement with the defense attorney and prosecuting attorney present and participating, to determine the existence of inconsistencies, if any, between the testimony of such witness and the prior statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies exist, the statement shall be given to the defense attorney for use in cross-examination of the witness as to the inconsistencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">\u201cIf the court determines that inconsistencies do not exist the statement shall not be given to the defense attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ney and he shall not be permitted to cross-examination or comment thereon. * * *\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">And Criminal Rule 16(B)(2) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201cInformation not subject to disclosure. <em>Except as provided in subsections (B)(1) </em>(a), (b), (d), (f) and. <em>(g), </em>this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or his agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, or of statements made- by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">When these portions of Criminal Rule 16 are read together they make it clear that in camera \u201cinspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or his agents <em>[i. e., </em>the police] in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case\u201d <em>is mandated </em>when the person who prepared such report, memorandum or document takes the stand as a witness in a criminal proceeding to testify about the events of which he claims to have personal knowledge and which he recorded in that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Consequently, it is my opinion, in contrast to the reasoning of my two colleagues in the concurring opinions herein, that the trial court erred when it ruled that the police report used to refresh the memory of the state\u2019s witness was privileged from in camera inspection because it was an internal police report, and find merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The Court erred when it allowed three pistols, unrelated to the crime, to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The state, in its case in chief, presented testimony which, if believed by the jury, would establish that the appellant showed the police the location of three weapons kept in her home, but failed to explain to the jury that a short time before the appellant had taken a fourth weapon \u2014the murder weapon \u2014 to her neighbor\u2019s home. This was evidence from which the jury could conclude that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>lant was volunteering information concerning guns which were not material to the investigation of her husband\u2019s murder, and concealing material information in the form of the location of the murder weapon. If such a finding of fact was made by the jury, it could use it to infer that the appellant\u2019s conduct was evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In the course of introducing such testimony, the state introduced into evidence each of the four weapons. As we recognized in <em>State </em>v. <em>Roger Scott </em>(Cuyahoga Cty. Ct. App. Nov. 20, 1975), No. 33484, at 8, evidence, though relevant, should be excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission will cause undue or unfair prejudice. Without intending to deny that the introduction of the guns themselves add to any significant degree to the probative value of the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses, we nevertheless find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its decision to admit' the weapons into evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Accordingly, this assignment of error is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is as follows': \u25a0 The Court erred in refusing to allow evidence of the positive result of the appellant\u2019s polygraph examination to be presented to the jury. :</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">It is well established in Ohio that the results of a polygraph test are not admissible to attempt to prove the guilt or innocence of a defendant in a criminal proceeding. <em>E. g., State </em>v. <em>Jarosy </em>(1973), 39 Ohio App. 2d 35; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hegel </em>(1964), 9 Ohio App. 2d 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1963), 40 Ohio App. 2d 16; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1960), 178 N. E. 2d 605. <em>See, State </em>v. <em>Jaroszyk </em>(1973), 39 Ohio. Misc. 19 and the cases collected and analyzed , therein. <em>See also Parker </em>v. <em>Friendt </em>(1954), 118 N. E. 2d 216, <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Towns </em>(1973); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>35 Ohio App. 2d 237. Our examination of the record and the briefs of the parties fails to reveal any new theory of law or advancement in the reliability of the polygraph which would cause us to conclude that the trial court committed prejudicial error in excluding the results of the polygraph. Accordingly, we overrule this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"AE5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Court erred when it misstated testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Upon direct examination Sharon Rosenberg, an expert witness called by the state, testified that she had conducted various tests upon the hands of the decedent and that the results were negative. When asked to explain the significance of such negative results, Ms. Rosenberg replied as follows: \u201cOn the basis of this test I have no indication that the person did fire a gun recently.\u201d Thus, the testimony of Ms. Rosenberg concerned what the tests did <em>not </em>prove. There was absolutely no testimony in the transcript by which it could be said that Ms. Rosenberg gave an opinion that the failure of the tests to establish that the decedent had fired a weapon indicated that he had not, in fact, fired such a weapon. In effect, the testimony of Ms. Rosenberg leads one to the conclusion that such tests can prove that a weapon was fired, but that they cannot establish that weapons were not fired. We are not suggesting that under the proper conditions an expert could not testify as to his opinion as to whether an individual had fired a gun based upon such negative results. We are simply noting that the record in the case at bar contains no such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The state made much of these negative findings, and used them to argue to the jury that the victim had not used a weapon that evening and asked the jury to use that conclusion as circumstantial evidence in support of the state\u2019s theory that appellant had the victim\u2019s gun in her possession immediately prior to his death. In its instructions to the jury the trial court misstated the testimony of Ms. Rosenberg in the following manner: \u201cIn her opinion, he [the victim! bad not fired a gun recently.\u201d It is evident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that in instances such as this, such a misstatement may rise to the level of: prejudicial error. <em>Wuest </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio. </em>(1905), 5 Ohio C. C. (N. S.) 619, <em>See generally, Haase </em>v. <em>Ryan (</em>1955), 100 Ohio App. 285; <em>Heyman v</em>. <em>City of </em>Bell<em>evue </em>(1951), 91 Ohio App. 321. But in the case at bar there was no objection at the time the court made the error, nor at the end of the charge.

As to the third1 assignment of error, however, I concur in judgment only for these reasons. In this case Detective Eugene Volk testified as a prosecution rebuttal witness concerning an oral statement which appellant had made to him. The officer recorded the statement in an official police report. He testified that he had reviewed the report before taking the witness stand. He did not use the report while testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Since this officer used the police report to refresh his recollection, appellant, in h\u00e9r third assignment of error, claims that the trial judge erred in refusing to conduct an in camera inspection of the report after Volk testified on direct examination to determine the existence of inconsistencies between the report and his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Although the language of appellant\u2019s third assignment of error<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> is directed to the trial judge\u2019s failure- to conduct the requested in camera inspection of the report used by the witness to refresh his recollection, appellant, to support this assignment of error, also argues she had the right to have such inspection for the additional reason she. had filed a timely pre-trial discovery motion pursuant to Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(a)(ii).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In that motion she sought to inspect the written summaries of all oral statements made by appellant to the prosecutor or any law enforcement officer. She did not receive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The transcript of proceedings indicates that appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>in requesting an in camera inspection of 'Volk\u2019s report, was-doing so for;the following reasons: . .,</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">1. The .witness had used the report to refresh his recollection. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">,2. Appellant was entitled to inspect the report its a matter of right under Criminal Buie 16(B)(1) (a)(ii). \u2022_ The motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In the trial of a criminal case an accused\u2019s- counsel is not entitled to inspect a written police report where an officer does' not-, use- the report while testifying notwithstanding the fact that he has read it to refresh his recollection prior to taking the witness stand. <em>State </em>v. <em>Strain </em>(1948), 84 Ohio. App. 229; <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1947), 83 Ohio App. 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Notations made in official police reports are a part of the prosecution\u2019s internal work product and as such are not, subject to disclosure in a judicial proceeding. <em>Kott </em>v. <em>Perini </em>(1968), 15 Ohio Misc. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">For these reasons the trial judge was correct in deny^ ing appellant\u2019s motion for an in camera inspection .of the. police report merely because Detective Volk had used it to refresh his recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">However, consideration of appellant\u2019s second argument requires further analysis. Bule 16 of the Ohio Buies of Criminal Procedure has provided expanded discovery in criminal judicial proceedings. Upon motion duly made Criminal Buie 16(B)(1) (a) (ii) provides that the prosecuting attorney must permit inspection of the written, summaries of oral statements made by a defendant to a prosecutor or law, enforcement officer. A motion seeking such, discovery was made by the defendant in this ease. .</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Criminal Buie 16(B) (2), however, specifies information possessed by the prosecutor whieh is not subject to disclosure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Clearly this provision does not authorize or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>quire the disclosure of internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or state agents in connection with the pros\u00e9eution or investigation of a case except as otherwise specifically provided in the rule itself. In my view there is nothing contained in Criminal Rule 16(B)(1) (g)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which requires the court to conduct an in camerA inspection of material which is not subject to disclosure under Criminal Rule 16(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(g) which requires' an in camera inspection of witness\u2019 statements by \u00e1 trial judge is substantially the same as prior Ohio practice enunciated in the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 146. This rule requires the trial judge to conduct an in camera inspection of a state witness\u2019 prior written or recorded statement upon completion of his direct examination to determine the existence of inconsistencies between his testimony and the statement. Criminal Rule 16(B)(1)(g) is not applicable to reports, memoranda or other internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or his agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of a case. Criminal Rule 16(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">However, where a defendant, pursuant to Criminal Rule 16(B) (1) (a) (ii), has filed a motion for discovery requesting insp\u00e9ction of the written summaries of oral-statements made by him to a prosecutor or police officer, the proseeut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Ing attorney has a duty to permit such inspection without delay. The failure to do so may have an adverse effect upon a defendant\u2019s defense. For example, it may influence his decision in making a plea or in deciding whether or not to take the witness stand in the event of trial. It would be grossly unfair if the defendant were led to believe that no such statement exists and thereafter be confronted with one during trial. It is this type of situation which the criminal rules were expressly designed to prevent. When a defendant possesses this information he then has the ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision as to his course of conduct before and during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Under the provision of Criminal Rule 16(D)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the prosecuting attorney, immediately upon its discovery, had the duty to permit defense counsel to inspect the written summary of defendant\u2019s oral statement contained in Detective Volk\u2019s written police report. Absent such inspection, the trial judge, to insure the defendant a fair trial, also had the duty to order the inspection of Detective Voile\u2019s report or at a minimum to conduct an in camera inspection of that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Since the defendant was not permitted to inspect the report and since the trial judge failed to conduct an in camera inspection thereof to determine the existence of inconsistencies between the report and the witness\u2019 testimony, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\"The Court erred when it denied Defendant\u2019s request for an in camera inspection of the written report of a state witness who had refreshed his memory from the report before taking the stand to-testify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">\u201c(l) Information subject to disclosure</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">\u201c (a) Statement of defendant or co-defendant.
