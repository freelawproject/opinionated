The Board of Elections refused to place the issue upon the ballot upon the grounds that the petitions circulated for. signature stated the nature of the proposed amendment .in such a way as to be misleading to those y?ho were asked to place their -signatures upon the petitions. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">On December 3, 1975,.the relators.filed an original ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tion in this court seeking a writ of mandamus which would' compel the Board of Elections to place the issue upon the ballot at the next election. . -</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">As provided by statute, a mandamus is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">\u201c* * * a writ, issued in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board, or person, command-\u00bb ing the performance of an act which the law specially en-: joins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\u201d E. C. 2731.01</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">It has generally been said that the issuance of a writ of mandamus is authorized when there is no adequate remedy at law and where there is a clear right to have the act performed. <em>E. g., State, ex rel. River Grove Park, Inc., </em>v. <em>City of Kettering </em>(1962), 118 Ohio App. 143, 146. With respect to the latter requirement, this court has recently held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-7\">\u201cA party seeking a writ of mandamus assumes the burden of establishing that he has a clear right to the relief sought and that the party against whom the writ is directed has a clear duty to act, but has failed to do so.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Ardco, Inc., </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga County Board of Elections </em>(Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals, April 10, 1975), Case No. 33943, at 3-4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">There is no question in the instant case that if the allegations of the relators\u2019 claim are substantively correct, they are without a remedy in the normal course of law and mandamus would be a proper remedy. Therefore, the issues before this court are two-fold:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">(1) Is the Board of Elections required to place upon the ballot all referendum issues certified to it without regard to the sufficiency or validity of the petitions?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">(2) If the Board of Elections was not so required, did: it properly determine that the. petitions, in this instance, were misleading and therefore should not be. placed upon the ballot?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">E. C. 3501.11 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-13\">\u201cEach board of; elections shall exercise by a majority vote all powers granted to such board by Title XXXV [35] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>of,:the Revised,:Code,; shall perform \u00e1ll the duties 'imposed by,law,,and sh\u00e1llj:\u00a1*.*..\u2022i,;y <em>-u </em>\u2022 ;.:\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25a0 : - &gt; .v: -\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\">\u201c (K) Review, examine, and .certify the sufficiency \u00e1nd validity of petitions: faudmominaticm .papers Under these,:;.provisions: the county boards, of election have not only the rightvbut also the duty, to scrutinize referendum petitions tmdetermihe whether their sufficiency and validity, bah be qertified.

Janasik, </em>v. <em>Sarosy, su</em>pra.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><em>We </em>have reviewed the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court <em>in State ex rel. Polcyn, </em>v. <em>Burkhart </em>(1973), 33 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>St. 2d 7, where a'mandamus was filed'seeking to' compel \u00e1 city council to certify a referendum petition to the board of elections. In that ease the Supreme Court\u2019s examination of constitutional provisions relating to a charter city-and consideration of the past case law resulted in the conclusion that a city council\u2019s \u201cpower to examine initiative petitions for sufficiency has not been declared by this court' to extend beyond matters of form, or \u2018administrative determinations\u2019 concerning the number of valid signatures\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Polcyn, </em>v. <em>Burkhart, id., </em>at 10. While we are not unaware of the analogy that could be drawn between the powers of a city council and the powers of a board of election, we also realize the significant differences. Most important, we note that the very broad language of B. C. 3501.11 vests the board of elections with a power to go beyond the face of the petitions in determining validity and sufficiency, a power which neither city council nor township board of trustees are given. <em>State, ex rel. Diversified Realty, </em>v. <em>Board, supra, </em>at 58; 1971 Ohio Att\u2019y Gen. Op., No. 71-052.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Moreover, while we believe there is a substantive/procedural division between those matters into which the' Board of Elections may make inquiry, we conclude that <em>all </em>the requirements governing the petitions to be used for seeking a referendum, including the content of such petitions, are procedural in nature and thus subject to the scrutiny of the board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The substantive limitation is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that the board of elections has no power to determine that an issue should not be placed on the ballot because if passed it would be unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. <em>State, ex rel. McGovern, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections of Cuy. Cty. </em>(1970), 24 Ohio Misc. 135. We therefore find that the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections was under a duty to examine the referendum petitions in question and to make a determination as to whether they complied with the applicable standards for referendum petition. Thus, the writ of mandamus in the instant case cannot be granted upon the grounds that the Board of Elections chose to examine the petitions and found them to be deficient. Rather, the determination of the issuance of the writ must turn upon a consideration of whether the board was legally correct in holding that the petitions were not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The amendment upon which the referendum was sought had its origin in the request of Home Links Golf Course that the Olmsted Township Zoning Commission amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township to change the land owned by Home Links from pne-familiy-residential property to four separate and independent zoning districts consisting of: (1) ResidentialMulti-Family-Townhouse; (2) Residential-Multi-FamilyGarden-Apartment; (3) Two-Family-Residential (Cluster/Duplex); and (4) Local Business. The first three parts of this proposal were accepted by the Zoning Commission, but the proposed change of the fourth area of land to Local Business was rejected. These recommendations were forwarded to the Olmsted Township Board of Trustees as required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">On September 3, 1974, the Board of Trustees, at its public meeting, gave consideration to the Commission\u2019s recommendations. Although it is unclear as to the exact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>manner in which the various proposals Were presented , to the Board, an examination of Relator\u2019s Exhibit'2 indicates that each of the four proposals to create a new zoning district was made in a separately typed document which, by its nature and form, seemed to be a separate and self-contained resolution. In spite of the apparent independent nature of the four rezoning proposals, each of the. documents bears the identification \u201cA-74,\u201d and it is evident that the Board of Trustees treated them as one unified document. When the matter was brought to a vote, the Trustees voted in favor of denying the recommendations of the Zoning Commission by a vote of two to one. Since R. C. 519.12 requires a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees in order to deny the Commission\u2019s recommendations,' the recommendations of the Commission on Resolution A-74 were deemed adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Subsequently, referendum petitions were circulated to submit the issue of the desirability of the three-part amendment to the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The conflict over the sufficiency of the referendum petitions involves the question of whether the first page of each petition was misleading or not. In pertinent part, the language of the first page provides: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">\u201cWe, the undersigned, qualified voters residing in the unincorporated area of the Township, being not less than eight percent of the total vote cast for all candidates, for governor in this area at the last general election for. governor, hereby petition and request the board of township trustees of Olmsted Township to submit the zoning amendment passed by the Olmsted Township Zoning Commission on May 16,1974, and adopted by the board of township trustees of Olmsted Township at its meeting of September 3, 1974, to the electors of this area for approval at the next primary or general election:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201cThe following is a full and correct copy of the title of said amendment:'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">\u201cRESOLUTION A-74</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, whieh is a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Resolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1952 and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: to change from residential Rl-40 to RMF-A district certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Road designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-5-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Resolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1952, and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: to change&gt;from residential Rl-40 to RMF-T district certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Road designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-13-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Resolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1952 and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: to change from residential Rl-40 to LB a parcel of land located on the south side of John Road designated as part of permanent parcel No. 262-5-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Resolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1942, and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the'following zoning district: to change from residential Rl-40 to R2-25 district, certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Road designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-5-1 of Cuyahoge County maps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The Board of Elections found objection in the petition because of the inclusion of the third paragraph under the title \u201cResolution A-74.\u201d The Board quite correctly notes that this, independent portion of the resolution was not recommended for approval by the Zoning Commission, and hence was not adopted by Township Board of Trustees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The Board argues that the language of the petition\u00a1ther\u00e9f' fore\" misrepresented 'the issues before the - public and; rendered the petitions insufficient.;\u2022 . -.y-'i <em>Ac;\\*.i </em>-r;''</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The'rel\u00e1tofs contend that..this is not'the\u00bbcase.: They, maintain that they; have complied with the requirements far referendum, petitions under.

After noting the lack of standards under R. C. 519.12 the court indicated that the . petitions \u201cshould be sufficient for the parties to understand what they are signing * <em>* Sidwell </em>v. <em>Clepper, supra, </em>at 109. The court proceeded to hold that the petitions in that ease w\u00e9re adequate and declared that the board of elections should place the issue upon the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Another ease considering these same issues is <em>Pioneer Development &amp; Resources Corp. </em>v. <em>Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(Delaware Cty. Ct. App. April 14, 1971), No. 464, <em>appeal denied </em>(Ohio Supreme Court September 29, 1971), No. 71-541. The court\u2019s treatment of the matter was summarized in Note, <em>Township Zoning Referenda; Sufficiency of Contents of Petition, supra, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\"><em>u* * * </em>\u00a3ke court assumed the burden of developing its own standard of sufficiency by drawing an analogy between \u00a7519.12 and \u00a7731.31, which sets forth the standards required of referendum petitions for municipal ordinances. Since \u00a7731.31 requires that a petition seeking to have a municipal ordinance referred need only \u2018contain the number and a full and correct copy, of the title of the ordinance or measure sought to be:referred,\u2019 the <em>Pioneer </em>court concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201c \u2018Thus, it would seem by analogy that under the provisions of. Section 519.12, Revised Code, only the amendment or: supplement to be referred to the voters need be sufficiently designated without the necessity of .setting forth the text'thereof. <em>In the instant case the referendum petition sets forth the date.the amendment or supplement.was adopted by the Board.of Trustees and quotes verbatum the minutes \u00f3f. the;B oar d by which such change of zoning,was adopted/ .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cTherefore, the <em>Pioneer </em>court held that a zoning referendum: petition is sufficient if a single reference to the minutes; of the meeting ..at which the board of trustees approved the amendment is made.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) : .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">.Finally, in <em>Markus </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1970), 22 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>St. 2d 197, consideration was given by the Supreme Court to a R. C. 519.12 zoning referendum petition. While the court did not spell out specific criteria for such petitions it did point out that the procedures under R. C. 3501.38 <em>are </em>applicable. Further, the court set forth principles in that case which have applicability to all R. C. 519.12 petitions. It stated that the courts have a duty to preserve the \u201cintegrity\u201d of the right of referendum and found fault with the petition in that case because they \u201ccould have substantially misled those persons who signed them.\u201d <em>Id,., </em>at 200. Similarly, the court found that judicial intervention was justified because the \u201cpetitions failed to contain an accurate and unambiguous statement of the issue sought to be submitted to the electorate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 202. Subsequently, in <em>dictum </em>in <em>State, ex rel. Polcyn, </em>v. <em>Burkhart </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St. 2d 7, 11, the court indicated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">\u201cThe \u2018test,\u2019 regarding alleged -textual deficiencies in petitions such as the one at' bar, was stated in <em>Markus </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St. 2d 197, 259 N. E. 2d 501. That case held that the text \u2018must fairly and accurately present the question or issue to be decided in order to assure a free, intelligent and informed * * * [decision] by the average citizen affected.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Upon careful consideration of these cases, the relevant statutes and the public interest to be furthered, we hold that the following are requirements for a R. C. 519.12 referendum:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">(1) The petition must contain the number and a full and correct title of the zoning resolution;</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">(2) The petition must contain the affidavit of the person soliciting signatures for the petition certifying that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief each of the signatures is that of the person whose name it purports to be, that he believes such persons are electors of the township, and that such persons signed the petition with knowledge of its contents; and</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">(3) If the petition contains any additional information it must be of such a character as to promote the attempt to fairly and accurately present the question or issue and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>not in any way detract from a free, intelligent and informed choice by the average citizen who is requested to make a decision as to whether he should or should not sign such a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">In the case at bar relators \u2019 petitions were defective for failure to comply with requirements one and three above.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There is no question that the petitions in question contained the applicable resolution number. But they did not properly set forth the correct title of the resolution. \u201cTitle,\u201d in this context, is properly defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">\u201c* * # the title of a statute is the heading or preliminary part, furnishing the name by which the act is individually known. It is usually prefixed to the statute in the form of a brief summary of its contents; as \u2018An act for the prevention of gaming.\u2019 \u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th ed. 1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">As we have previously noted the documents presented to the Township Board of Trustees are constructed in such a manner as to more properly constitute four separate resolutions, each with its own title. For reasons not demonstrated by the record those documents were combined into one unified resolution without the benefit of a unified title which would encompass all four proposed zoning changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Under these circumstances this court can certainly \u00e1ppreciate the dilemma in which the relators may have found themselves in attempting to determine the title of the resolution. Because there was no general title for Resolution A-74, and in view of the existence of four subtitles, one for each of the proposed changes, we hold that the correct title of the entire resolution consists of the three sub-titles of each of the proposals which' would take effect, absent any adverse decision by the voters in a referendum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\u2019 The proper title would therefore read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cBESOLUTION A-74</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-4\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Besolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1952 and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: To change from residential Bl-40 to BMF-A district certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Boad designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-5-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Besolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1952; and amendments thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: to change from residential Bl-40 to BMF-T district certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Boad designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-5-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">\u201cA resolution to amend the zone map of the unincorporated area of Olmsted Township, Ohio, which is a part of Besolution No. 1-52, adopted the 20th day of July, 1942, and amendments- thereto, by changing the zoning to establish the following zoning district: to change from residential Bl-40 to B2-25 district, certain parcels of land located on the north and south side of John Boad designated as part of permanent parcel Nos. 262-5-2 and 262-5-1 of Cuyahoga County maps.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Since the referendum petitions circulated by the relators contained the additional paragraph involving the proposal for rezoning land to local business use which was not adopted as part of Besolution A-74, by the Olmsted Township Board of Trustees, we find that the petitions failed to state the correct title of the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Second, we find that a fair reading of the statement contained on page one of the referendum petitions by the inclusion of paragraph three under the heading \u201cBesolution A-74\u201d and the impression conveyed that all four paragraphs represented the title of a zoning amendment which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>been adopted, can lead to only one conclusion: that paragraph three of the purported title represented a portion of a zoning 'amendment that had rezoned part of the golf course property to a local business use. This was an incorrect representation] If the relators chose to include the paragraph in question \u2019anywhere in the petitions, they were required -to clearly and unambiguously indicate on the face of the petition that the specific portion of the orginal amendment had not been adopted by the Olmsted Township Board of Trustees, in order to comply with <em>Markus </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections, supra, </em>and hence be entitled to have the referendum issue placed upon the ballot. Because of their failure to do so, we hold that the statements contained in the referendum petitions did not fairly and accurately present the question; that it could have substantially misled those persons who signed the petitions; and that it detracted from a free, intelligent and informed choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the relators do not have a clear right to require the Board of Elections to place the referendum on the ballot. Accordingly, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-5\">Day and Corrgian, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Each of these,,cases involved situations, in which referendum. petir tions failed to comply with R.

Diversified Realty </em>v. <em>Board, supra </em>at 56, the relators sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Board of Elections to review referendum petitions to determine the applicability of relators\u2019 three objections, which were: \u201c(1) None of the signatures on these petitions had the date of signing or the name of the township in which he resided as required by R. C. 3501.38(C); (2) None of the affidavits of the circulators attached to these petitions conformed with R. C. 3501.-38(E) ; and (3) <em>The text of the referendum, petition does not fairly and accurately present the question or issue to be decided in order t\u00f3 assure a free, intelligent and informed vote by the average citizen affected.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The court stated that the \u201csole\u201d issue before it was whether the board had the authority and the duty to rule upon the sufficiency and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>validity of the petitions. It held that the board did have such power and duty under statute and case law and issued the writ of mandamus order to the board to \u201creview, examine and certify the sufficiency and validity of such referendum petitions prior to the date of the November, 1972 general election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b34-9\">In their argument that they were required to use all four sub-titles in order, to correctly state the title of. Resolution A-74, the relators rely on 1957 O. A. G. No. 255, p. 77. Such reliance is misplaced. That opinion simply states that a referendum cannot be had upon only one part of a zoning ordinance <em>which was </em>enacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b36-6\">Day, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">concurring. In this case the Board of Elections had already acted on relators\u2019 effort to get an issue on the ballot when the Mandamus petition was filed. That Board action effectively blocked any legally justifiable recourse to Mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">However, the relator attempted to use the writ to force the Board to act in a particular way. Mandamus relief would invade a discretionary area which Mandamus cannot reach. Moreover, the granting of the writ in such circumstances would effect appellate review of a substantive and discretionary exercise of the Board\u2019s powers and result in a violation of the fundamental proposition that Mandamus is not a substitute for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Accordingly, I agree with the action of the majority in denying the petition for Mandamus, but for different reasons.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
