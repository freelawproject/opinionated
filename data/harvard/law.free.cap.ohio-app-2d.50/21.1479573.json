Wason (defendant) was convicted of interfering with a police officer in performance of his duties in Warrensville Heights under an ordinance of that municipality. The ordinance provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">\u201cNo person shall resist, hinder, obstruct or abuse any \u2022official while such official is attempting to arrest offenders under this Traffic Code. No person shall interfere with any person charged under sueh sections with the enforcement of the iaw relative to. public streets.\u201d Section 303.03, Codified Ordinances of Traffic of Warrensville Heights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">The gist of the alleged offense was that defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>driving northbound on Dalebridge Road in Warrensville Heights, flashed his headlights at oncoming automobiles to warn them that they were approaching a radar speed trap. There was testimony that traffic slowed after the warning but the record indicates that none of the warned vehicles had been speeding before the warning, and none were exceeding the speed limit as they passed the radar. The lone state witness, a police officer, answered \u201cprobably not\u201d to the question whether defendant was doing \u201canything to interfere or slow down your only duty of being there that day? [sic].\u201d The officer also said he was not attempting to arrest anyone when he approached the defendant other than the defendant himself. Defendant\u2019s action occurred about twenty minutes after he had been clocked and cited for speeding southbound on Dalebridge Road. Defendant expressed some annoyance with the police for. devoting their energies to traffic violations rather than more serious crimes. These events occurred on April 25, 1975, shortly after 6:30 p. m. (or 7:30 p. m.).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Defendant claimed he was testing his headlights although he conceded they were not necessary for visibility. Defendant appealed assigning two errors which are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Because the assignments raise essentially a single issue, they are treated together. That issue becomes, based on the facts in this case and giving those facts an interpretation most favorable to the city, was defendant guilty of obstruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Our perception of the issue in this case begins with the propositions that defendant was neither assisting the police in the performance of their duties, nor testing his lights when he behaved as he did. Such excuses are too specious to warrant further comment. Our view of the case also proceeds on the assumption that illegal interference or obstruction can be established without actual physical hinderance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Relatively few reported decisions have addressed the issue in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three reported decisions do point the way toward resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">In <em>Bastable </em>v. <em>Little </em>(1906), 76 K. B. 77, police officers had marked off several furlongs with spaces between in order to gauge the speed of motor cars passing over the measured distances. The respondent used hand signals, augmented by a newspaper, and verbal warnings of the \u201cpolice trap\u201d to notify motorists of the police activity. He was convicted \u00f3f obstruction; The court reversed the conviction relying heavily upon the absence of evidence either that (1) the motorists were actually breaking the law at the time of respondent\u2019s action, or (2) that he was acting in concert with them. His knowledge that there was a police trap was apparently not enough,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> although this certainly-evidences intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In a second case, <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(1909), 79 K. B. 17, officers again were timing to detect automobile speeders. This activity was monitored by appellant Betts in his ea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>pacity as a \u201csergeant\u201d of patrols for the Automobile Association. Betts undertook to signal a slowdown to automobiles. Some of these were marked with \u201cA. A.\u201d insignia indicating membership in the association and apparently all slowed enough to come within the speed limit. When the police proceeded to two additional locations in sequence and set up to time speeders, the appellant went along and renewed his activity. On these occasions he warned persons who were <em>exceeding </em>the limit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was convicted of obstruction. The conviction was affirmed. The Justices disinguished <em>Bastable </em>v. <em>Little </em>on the ground that in that ease there was no evidence of unlawful speed at the time of the warning.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Apparently, neither the <em>Bastable </em>nor <em>Betts </em>court had any problem with the evidence of intent. It is clear, then, that the rationale of the cases depended upon two elements:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">(1) an intent to warn a third person of the police presence,</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(2) to prevent detection of an illegal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Research has disclosed only one Ohio printed report of a case whose facts approximate those in the present one. In that case, <em>Akron </em>v. <em>Matteson </em>(1972), 63 Ohio Op. 2d 146, 148, the court acquitted the defendant. He was charged under a state statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> couched in language substantially identical with that of the Warrensville Heights ordinance. The court in <em>Matteson </em>at 147-148, aware of <em>Bastable </em>and <em>Betts, </em>reasoned that because there was no evidence of speeders \u201cin or about the area when defendant flashed her lights,\u201d a rhetorical question had to be answered. That question was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\"><em>\u201c* * </em>* Can we say that these radar officers were \u2018attempting to arrest offenders\u2019 or that some other duties of theirs were affected?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">The acquittal provided a positive \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">An essential condition to quicken the obligation of policemen to enforce the law, whether it be a traffic violation or a more serious offense, is illegality. This does not mean that an officer must restrain himself until an illegal act has climaxed. For instance, he may detain a person flourishing a pistol without waiting for the gun to be fired. But the officer may not make a search for weapons simply because he suspects a person is armed unless and until the suspicion ripens into probable cause or, at least, until the circumstances justify a reasonable man in concluding that he must initiate search action for his own safety.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It follows that one of the elements of obstruction is the presence of an illegal act which generates the policeman\u2019s duty to enforce the law. An additional element is interference with intent to impede the performance of. that duty. In the present case it is conceded that the defendant did not warn persons who were violating the law. The drivers whom he signalled were not shown to be speeding. The officer was not proceeding, did not intend to proceed and did not have a basis for proceeding, against the persons warned.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Though the intent to warn was clear, the wam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ing was not directed to persons whom the evidence revealed to have be\u00e9ii either acting illegally or to have begun activity intended to eulniinate in illegality. Thus, only one of the two elements necessary to establish an offense was present and the offense was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-5\">Parrino, J., concurs in the judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b48-6\">Stillman, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1: \u201cThe trial court erred by finding Defendant-Appellant guilty of violating \u00a7303.03 of the Codified Ordinances of Traffic of the City of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, which Ordinance pertains to the misdemeanor of obstructing or interfering with a police officer while making an arrest or in the performance of his duties.\u201d :</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Assignment of Error No. 2: \u201cThe trial court erred by finding that Defendant-Appellant obstructed a police officer in the performance of his duties because such a finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The trial court was Bedford ^Municipal Court which has jurisdiction in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, R.

On April 25, 1975, appellant (hereinafter referred to as defendant) was arrested for interfering with a police officer who was seeldng to enforce the provisions of the Warrensville Heights Traffic Code. Defendant was charged under Section 303.03 of the Codified Ordinances of Traffic of Warrensr ville Heights. He was convicted of obstructing a police officer and was fined $50 and costs. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Prior to his arrest on the present charge, defendant had been issued a traffic ticket for speeding by the same police officer. At that time he stated to the police officer, .\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you out catching criminals, and out doing things instead of catching people with radar.\u201d Defendant also inquired of the police officer as to where he was when defendant\u2019s car had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The defendant left but the officer remained at his radar station. Shortly thereafter, d\u00e9fendant returned to the scene, positioned his car in front of the police ear to face oncoming traffic, and flicked his headlights to oncoming cars, obviously warning them of the officer\u2019s presence. It was daylight. There is no evidence that defendant knew any of the drivers of the oncoming vehicles. Though the officer, issued several- speeding citations prior to defendant\u2019s reappearance, he did not issue any after defendant\u2019s return. Defendant testified- that - he was only testing his lights. The trial judge was fully justified in rejecting the defendant\u2019s explanation as to why he was flicking his lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The ordinance under which defendant was charged provides as'follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-3\">\u201cNo .person shall resist, hinder, obstruct or abuse any official while: such official is attempting to arrest offenders under this Traffic Code. No person shall interfere with any person charged under such sections with the enforcement of the law.relative to public streets.\u201d Section 303.03, Codified Ordinances of Traffic of Warrensville Heights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">Although they relate to the same subject, each of the two sentences of this ordinance recites a separate and distinct offense. In essence, and for the purposes of this case, the first sentence makes it unlawful for anyone to obstruct a police officer who is attempting to arrest offenders violating the. Traffic Code. To sustain a conviction for obstruction under'this part of the ordinance, the prosecution must prove that' the obstruction took place at a time when the officer was attempting to arrest an actual and not a potential traffic offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that the officer was not attempting to arrest a specific traffic offender at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest. For these reasons, defendant\u2019s conviction cannot stand. <em>Bastable </em>v. <em>Little </em>(1906), 76 K. B. 77, <em>Betts v. Stevens </em>(1909), 79 K. B. 17, <em>Akron </em>v. <em>Matteson </em>(1972), 63 Ohio Op. 2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The second sentence of Section 303.03 contains a different offense. This provision makes it unlawful for anyone to interfere with a police officer who is seeking to enforce the traffic laws relative to public streets. Under this provision the prosecutor is not required to prove that the interference''took place at a time when an-officer is attempt ing to arrest \u00e1b actual offender. - \"</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Appellee- in its brief argues that part two of .this ordinance is applicable to this case and that defendant was indeed interfering with a police officer who was enforcing the traffic laws of Warrensville Heights; Such conclusion runs contrary-to the record in this case. The trial judge made a specific finding that the defendant was guilty of obstructing a police officer in the performance-of his duties. The tri\u00e1l court\u2019s judgment, therefore, was obviously ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>dered for a violation of the first part of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Let us assume arguendo that the defendant was charged with and found, guilty of interference with the police officer under the second branch of this ordinance. In such event, the conviction still cannot stand based on the testimony of the officer himself. The officer testified that the def\u00e9ndant did nothing to interfere with or slow down his duties at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">For these reasons, I find that defendant-appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b50-6\">Stillman, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">dissenting. The full text of local ordinance 303.03 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">\u201cNo person shall resist, hinder, obstruct or abuse any official while such official is attempting to arrest offenders under this Traffic Code. No persons shall interfere with any person charged under such sections with the enforcement of the law relative to public streets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We are concerned primarily with these words: \u201cNo person shall interfere with any person charged under such sections with enforcement of the law relative to public streets.\u201d A citizen who intrudes upon a police officer in the conduct of his proper duties is interfering with the officer, in violation of this ordinance. The First Amendment was not intended to permit a citizen to thwart a police officer in a legitimate exercise of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">There is a further concern in this situation. \u201cThe physical intrusion in this ease may have served to warn offenders other than possible speeders of the presence of the police. For all the intruding citizen knows, a bank robber may be fleeing from his crime, a narcotic offender may be under surveillance or observation, or some other lawbreaker may be in the vicinity. The intrusive act of the citizen in flashing his headlights could very well signal a warning, to potential or actual lawbreakers. Such activity is clearly not in the interest of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">The offense of obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty may be committed without the employment of force or violence. In <em>Athens </em>v. <em>Bromall </em>(1969), 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Ohio App. 2d 140, involving a sit-in demonstration at Ohio University, the Court stated: \u201cThere rests on all persons the duty to do nothing which might interfere with policemen as they go about their duties of protecting the public.\u201d The court cited with approval <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1879), 26 F. Cas. 1074, defining \u201cobstructs, resists or opposes\u201d in connection with the service or execution of process. In <em>McDonald, </em>the court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201cThe statute, however, does not limit the offense to resistance alone, it includes also willful acts of obstruction or opposition; and to obstruct is to interpose obstacles or impediments, to hinder, impede or in any manner interrupt or prevent, and this term does not necessarily imply the employment of direct force, or the exercise of direct means. It includes any passive, indirect or circuitous impediment to the service or execution of process.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>46 Ohio St. 2d 219, decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio on May 12, 1976, the Court held that a police officer who had pursued a traffic offender outside of the city limits had the right to arrest an intruder who attempted to interfere with the traffic arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">This ease presents a situation in which an officer is interfered with by verbal protestation constituting the obstruction- of official business in contravention of R. C. 2921.31. The act of the appellant in the instant case is enually obstructive in the light of all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Immanuel Kant\u2019s <em>Categorical Imperative, </em>charging .all people with the duty to conduct themselves so that they might will their conduct universal, should be a requirement of good citizenship. It was clearly transgressed by the defendant here and constitutes an act inimical to the enforcement of the law which should not be condoned. For these reasons, therefore, I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
