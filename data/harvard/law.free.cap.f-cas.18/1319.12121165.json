Firstly, the interest and right to know if any of the bankrupt\u2019s property, which otherwise might go towards the liquidation of their claims, has been wasted or squandered by him, perhaps in some manner which would give the assignee the right to recover it back, thereby swelling the assets; and, secondly, of opposing the discharge of the bankrupt, and of punishing him if he has rendered himself liable under the 44th section. I do not see how the \u201cdue settlement according to law\u201d of the bankrupt\u2019s estate can be made unless all the facts concerning it are made patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1322-6\">(Which statement of facts and opinions are respectfully certified and submitted to his hon- or the judge, for his decision and action.] <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1322-8\"> [From Bankr.
