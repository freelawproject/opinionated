New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, </em>117 N.H. 108, 370 A.2d 278 (1977), we declined to answer the question whether the superior court, in the exercise of its general equitable powers, can order a party who has instituted or prolonged litigation through bad faith or obstinate, unjust, vexatious, wanton, or oppressive conduct, to pay his opponent\u2019s counsel fees. That question is now presented to us, and we answer it in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">The plaintiff, James Harkeem, does not appear before this court for the first time. Part of the facts of this case have been previously recounted in <em>Harkeem v. Department of Employment Security, </em>115 N.H. 658, 348 A.2d 711 (1975), and need be summarized only briefly here. On March 23, 1973, Mr. Harkeem voluntarily retired from his employment with the Encore Shoe Company of Manchester, New Hampshire, having spent the preceding thirty-five years of his life working in the shoe industry of this state. He applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>denied on the grounds that he had voluntarily retired. No appeal was taken, and the determination became final. In August 1973, the plaintiff returned from retirement to work at the Melville Shoe Corporation in Dover, New Hampshire. This employment terminated on September 14, 1973, and Mr. Harkeem filed for unemployment compensation benefits on September 19, 1973. His claim was rejected by the department\u2019s certifying officer and appeal tribunal, on the basis that under RSA 282:4 K and the defendant\u2019s implementing Regulation 32, his prior voluntary retirement had cancelled Mr. Harkeem\u2019s accumulated wage credits. The validity of this interpretation was contested by the plaintiff in proceedings in the superior court and in this court, which on November 28, 1975, rendered a decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>Harkeem v. Dep\u2019t of Empl. Sec., </em>115 N.H. 658, 348 A.2d 711 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">During the pendency of the litigation of the plaintiff\u2019s September 1973 claim, Mr. Harkeem found new employment at the Abington Shoe Company in Newmarket, New Hampshire. This employment was terminated in May, 1974, after a three-month trial period, and Mr. Harkeem again filed for unemployment compensation benefits. This claim, which is the subject of the instant action, was denied by a certifying officer of the defendant, and by its appeal tribunal in June 1974. The sole basis for the denial was the same as that which supported the rejection of Mr. Harkeem\u2019s previous claim: that his voluntary retirement in March, 1973, cancelled the wage credits he had earned in his previous thirty-five years of employment, leaving him with insufficient credits to qualify for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Action on this second claim was held in abeyance at the trial court level by agreement of the parties pending this court\u2019s decision on the question of law presented by the plaintiff\u2019s first claim, which was also controlling in the second. When the decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor was rendered, a request was made by his counsel to the defendant that benefits be paid for the second claim period. The defendant refused, and a hearing was held in superior court on May 27, 1976. At that hearing, the defendant no longer pursued the wage credit question, as that issue had been conclusively settled against it. Instead the department sought to raise the entirely new ground that the plaintiff had failed to sufficiently expose himself to employment, as required by RSA 282:3 C. The Trial Court (Bois, J.) found that \u201cthe State of New Hampshire had no evidence whatsoever to indicate that there were any grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to disqualify the claimant but those based on the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of Regulation 32 A (2) prohibiting the payment of benefits on the basis of annual earnings prior to retirement\u201d; that \u201cthe defendants were arbitrary, capricious, frivolous and unreasonable in their conduct toward the plaintiff after November 28, 1975\u201d; and that \u201c[t]he defendants with premeditation ignored and violated any and all principles of fair play and equitable conduct by a sovereign with unlimited resources in relation to one of its citizens.\u201d Accordingly, the court awarded the plaintiff the benefits which he sought in the amount of $1,104. Furthermore, \u201cbased on its equity powers as well as on its duty to see justice done,\u201d the court assessed interest and costs incurred by the plaintiff subsequent to November 28, 1975, as well as counsel fees in the amount of one-third of the recovery. The defendant contends that the award of counsel fees does not lie within the court\u2019s powers in a case of bad faith conduct, and that in any event the finding of bad faith was not properly made on the facts of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Exceptions to the general rule that parties pay their own counsel fees have been judicially fashioned in the past. <em>See Guay v. Association, </em>87 N.H. 216, 177 A. 409 (1935). These exceptions are flexible, not absolute, and have been extended on occasion. <em>See, e.g., Concord Nat\u2019l Bank v. Haverhill, </em>101 N.H. 416, 145 A.2d 61 (1958); <em>Lavoie v. Bourque, </em>103 N.H. 372, 172 A.2d 565 (1961); <em>cf. </em>Doleac, <em>Court Awarded Attorneys\u2019 Fees Under New Hampshire Common Law, </em>17 N.H.B.J. 134 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\"> Underlying the rule that the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect his counsel fees from the loser is the principle that no person should be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit. An additional important consideration is that the threat of having to pay an opponent\u2019s costs might unjustly deter those of limited resources from prosecuting or defending suits. <em>Tau Chapter v. Durham, </em>112 N.H. 233, 237, 293 A.2d 592, 594 (1974); <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 718 (1967). However, when overriding considerations so indicate, the award of fees lies within the power of the court, and is an appropriate tool in the court\u2019s arsenal to do justice and vindicate rights. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 259 (1975); <em>Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite, </em>396 U.S. 375, 391-92 (1970); <em>see </em>RSA 491: App. R. 56 (Supp. 1975). Bad faith conduct held to justify the award of counsel fees has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>been found where one party has acted \u201cin bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons,\u201d <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, </em>890 U.S. 400, 402 n.4 (1968); 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 54.77 [27], at 1709 (2d ed. 1974), where the litigant\u2019s conduct can be characterized as unreasonably obdurate or obstinate, <em>Stolberg v. Members of Bd. of Trustees for State Col. of Conn., </em>474 F.2d 485, 490 (2d Cir. 1973), and where it should have been unnecessary for the successful party to have brought the action. <em>Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, </em>345 F.2d 310, 321 (4th Cir. 1965), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>382 U.S. 103 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Where an individual is forced to seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined and established right, which should have been freely enjoyed without such intervention, an award of counsel fees on the basis of bad faith is appropriate. Comment, <em>Court Awarded Attorney\u2019s Fees and Equal Access to the Courts, </em>122 U. Pa. L. Rev. 636, 661 (1974). Comment, 8 Conn. L. Rev. 551, 554-55 (1976). This principle, which merely shifts the cost of what should have been an unnecessary judicial proceeding to the responsible party, has long been recognized in New Hampshire in a related line of cases wherein attorneys\u2019 fees have been awarded on the basis of the courts\u2019 power to enforce their own decrees. <em>See, e.g., Manchester v. Hodge, </em>75 N.H. 502, 504, 77 A. 76, 77 (1910); <em>Fowler v. Owen, </em>68 N.H. 270, 39 A. 329 (1895). When an individual is of limited means, as is so often the case in unemployment compensation actions, the shifting of counsel fees to an opposing party who has acted in bad faith to prolong the litigation does not run counter to the policy of the general rule discussed above. Rather an award in such an instance will further the intent of the rule, because protection will thereby be provided against the danger that lack of funds will prevent needed access to the counts. <em>Rolax v. Atlantic Coastline R. Co., </em>186 F.2d 473, 481 (4th Cir. 1951); <em>Doe v. Poelker, </em>515 F.2d 541, 548 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">An unemployment compensation claimant is usually an individual without financial resources to cover litigation costs. Plaintiff\u2019s right to benefits was clearly established by RSA ch. 282, and by our decision in <em>Harkeem v. Department of Employment Security, </em>115 N.H. 658, 348 A.2d 711 (1975). That victory was hard won by him, for the diligence of the defendant compelled him to pursue his claim through every available legal channel before he obtained vindication. However, instead of ceding to him the fruits of his victory, the department, contrary to both statute and estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>lished case law on both the supreme and superior court levels, sought to subject him to further litigation by raising new arguments before the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">RSA 282:5 C (6), which deals with decisions of the department\u2019s appeals tribunal, requires that a written decision be prepared in all cases, setting forth \u201call the material findings necessary to support the [tribunal\u2019s] conclusions\u201d and determining \u201call things necessary to dispose of the case.\u201d The statute specifies that \u201c[t]he decision of an appeal tribunal shall be deemed to be the decision of the commissioner of the department of employment security for <em>all subsequent actions in connection therewith.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is provided that the decision \u201cshall become final\u201d upon the expiration of the tenth day following its mailing to the plaintiff. RSA 282:5 C (5). Although the decision may be reopened upon request of an interested party or upon the commissioner\u2019s own initiative, the legislature has expressly limited the further hearing to the introduction of evidence or argument \u201crelative to and concerning the factors which constitute the basis of grounds for the reopening.\u201d RSA 282:5 E (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Had the question of the scope of the superior court\u2019s review never before been raised the defendant could argue that it could not be found to be in bad faith herein, for it would be entitled to rely on its argument that the term \u201cde novo\u201d in RSA 282:5 G(3) authorized it to raise new grounds before the superior court. However, prior case law from this court has conclusively settled the question. In <em>Chaisson v. Adams, </em>114 N.H. 219, 317 A.2d 791 (1974), the defendant herein moved to dismiss a claimant\u2019s appeal to the superior court under RSA 282:5, arguing that the petition had failed to state a cause of action. We noted then that the appeal procedure, as expressly set forth in RSA 282:5 G(3), requires only that a claimant\u2019s petition set forth specifically the grounds upon which it is claimed the appeal tribunal\u2019s decision is in error. Thus the superior court\u2019s de novo review takes place within the parameters set by the claimant\u2019s petition. The introduction of new issues by the department at this stage is wholly inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Accordingly, the department, knowing that it was limited to its own stated reasons for denying Mr. Harkeem\u2019s claim, had no valid reason to deny the plaintiff benefits after this court\u2019s ruling of November 28, 1975. Its obdurate pursuit of further fruit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>less litigation showed a callous disregard for the rights of the plaintiff, and resulted in a needless drain upon the resources of the judicial system of this state. The award of attorney\u2019s fees against the defendant department in the instant case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b739-5\">BoiS, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
