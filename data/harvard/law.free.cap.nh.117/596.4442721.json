A hearing was held in district court, but no transcript thereof was made. The District Court <em>(Richard J. Talbot, </em>Special Justice) denied replevin, and plaintiff\u2019s exceptions have been reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">The outlines of the dispute are clear enough. Plaintiff purchased Gun in early 1974, apparently as a birthday present for her then husband. Several months thereafter, Gun was registered in the names of plaintiff and her husband. Husband and wife separated and later divorced; the husband remained in the house with Gun and planned to take care of the dog until plaintiff had relocated. These plans were soon changed; one month after the separation, the husband made a gift of Gun to the defendant, thereby undoubtedly delighting defendant\u2019s young son (Kerry). When plaintiff learned of the gift, she instituted this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">The district court found that at the time of the gift the husband and wife owned Gun jointly. In the absence of a transcript of the proceedings, we are not in a position to question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting this finding. <em>Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank v. Adams, </em>114 N.H. 46, 314 A.2d 664 (1974). The gift was effective to transfer the husband\u2019s interest. 20 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Co-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>tenancy and Joint Ownership </em>\u00a7 94 (1965). In these circumstances, the law is clear that replevin against the donee of a cotenant will not lie. <em>Witham v. Witham, </em>57 Me. 447 (1870); Annot., 93 A.L.R.2d 358 (1964). There was no error in denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
