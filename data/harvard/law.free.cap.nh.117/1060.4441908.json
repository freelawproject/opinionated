Cronin. The joint accounts were created by deceased during his lifetime and became the property of the defendant as survivor on his death. RSA 384:28; <em>In re Wszolek Estate, </em>112 N.H. 310, 295 A.2d 444 (1972); <em>see Boucher v. Johnson, </em>117 N.H. 343, 373 A.2d 349 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-16\">The Master <em>(Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) found that the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant induced the deceased to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>his bankbook by fraud or undue influence, that the deceased changed his bankbook knowingly, and that a joint account with rights of survivorship was what he intended. The master recommended judgment for the defendant. The report was approved by <em>Cann, </em>J., who transferred plaintiff\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The credibility of the witnesses was for the trial court and the evidence did not compel a different result. <em>New Bradford Co. Inc. v. Meunier, </em>117 N.H. 774, 378 A.2d 748 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
