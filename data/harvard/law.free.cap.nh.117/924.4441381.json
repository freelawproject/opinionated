We find that this regulation has not been preempted by the state and that the city of Portsmouth has acted within its statutory authority to regulate the transportation of hazardous materials inside city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">The defendants are employees of Northeast Cartage Company, Inc., a New Hampshire corporation. They were charged with violating Portsmouth\u2019s hazardous materials ordinance, Portsmouth Rev. Ordinances ch. 7, art. 8 (1975), which restricts passage of any \u201cmotor vehicle . . . designed to transport 4,000 or more gallons of liquified petroleum gas or liquified natural gas and [containing] liquified petroleum gas or liquified natural gas or the vapor fumes of either\u201d to certain designated routes. The complaints brought by the city alleged that the defendants were operating propane trucks on Route 1 in Portsmouth, which is not one of the desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>nated routes. The arrests were made on a portion of Route 1, a Class 1 highway, which is within the city limits but lies outside the compact zone. Defendants challenged the city\u2019s jurisdiction to enact the ordinance; the question was transferred without ruling by the Portsmouth District Court (Taylor, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The General Court has given the commissioner of public works and highways the authority to regulate \u201cthe use of Class 1 highways in . . . cities outside the compact portions thereof as determined by him.\u201d RSA 249:5 (Supp. 1975). Were the commissioner to promulgate regulations under the grant, any conflicting municipal ordinance would be voided, RSA 47:17 XV (Supp. 1975); <em>see State v. Boisvert, </em>117 N.H. 291, 371 A.2d 1182 (1977) (per curiam); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>102 N.H. 545, 162 A.2d 613 (1960); <em>State v. Paille, </em>90 N.H. 347, 9 A.2d 663 (1939). But he has yet to exercise his authority in this situation. Consequently any city ordinance not inconsistent with state statutes may stand unless the legislature has clearly manifested an intent to preempt the field of highway regulation. 6 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 21.34, at 269 (3d ed. 1969); <em>see, e.g., Keene v. Gerry\u2019s Cash Mkt., Inc., </em>113 N.H. 165, 168, 304 A.2d 873, 875-76 (1973); <em>Davy v. Dover, </em>111 N.H. 1, 4, 273 A.2d 849, 851 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We find no such intent. RSA 249:5 specifically provides that the commissioner \u201cmay\u201d regulate highways. Although the word \u201cshall\u201d would not necessarily denote preemption, its absence is evidence that the General Court did not intend to delegate exclusive power over highways to him. Furthermore, the legislature has specifically empowered municipalities to regulate the use of vehicles on particular highways within their limits, which includes the power to \u201cexclude such vehicles altogether from certain ways ....\u201d RSA 47:17 VIII. The city also may regulate the conveying of dangerous materials. RSA 47:17 IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">We conclude that in the absence of positive regulation by the commissioner of public works and highways, the city of Portsmouth was free to enact reasonable ordinances regulating the transportation of hazardous materials within the city limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b972-9\">Lampron, J., did not participate in the decision of this case; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
