Resolution of the issue turns on whether the storage of the equipment qualifies as an \u201caccessory use\u201d under the town zoning ordinance. The Superior Court <em>(Loughlin, </em>J.), after a hearing with a view and a recommendation by a Master <em>(Alvin E. Taylor, </em>Esq.), decreed that an accessory use had not been established and that the board of adjustment\u2019s decision must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>be reversed. The exceptions of the town have been reserved and transferred by <em>Mullavey, </em>J. We affirm the ruling of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The plaintiffs in this action are property owners in proximity to the barn who find the equipment storage offensive. The evidence regarding construction of the barn is undisputed and shows that it was constructed by Mr. Paul Fitzgerald on a lot he and his wife had acquired adjacent to their residential lot. Mr. Fitzgerald operates his own road construction business and the barn was constructed expressly for the purpose of housing the heavy equipment he uses. The equipment is moved back and forth between barn and work site numerous times over the course of the year, and the considerable noise from these moving operations is disturbing to the plaintiffs. There was evidence that certain other inhabitants of the residential and agricultural zone maintain commercial vehicles on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The town zoning ordinance permits \u201c[accessory uses and buildings customarily appurtenant to a principal permitted use such as incidental storage facilities.\u201d The ordinance defines \u201caccessory use\u201d as \u201c[a] use customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal use or building located on the same lot with such principal use or building.\u201d An accessory building is defined as \u201c [a] detached building on the same lot with the primary building, the use of which is clearly incidental to that of the primary building or use of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the use of the barn for storage of the road grader is not \u201ccustomarily appurtenant to\u201d a primary residential use. Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that even if the use were deemed \u201ccustomarily appurtenant,\u201d it would not qualify as an accessory use in view of the fact the storage facility is not \u201clocated on the same lot with such principal use or building.\u201d We have no need to consider this latter argument, since we agree with plaintiff\u2019s initial contention that the commercial storage here is not customarily appurtenant to the principal residential use.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Whether the disputed use is \u201csufficiently subordinate to the residential use of the defendant\u2019s property so as to qualify as an accessory use is a question of law upon which the court is not bound by the conclusions of the zoning board.\u201d <em>Gratton v. Pellegrino, </em>115 N.H. 619, 621, 348 A.2d 349, 351 (1975); USA 31:78.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u201cAn \u2018accessory use\u2019 has been defined as \u2018one which is dependent on or pertaining to the permitted principal use,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>a subordinate use of the property \u2018occasioned by the main use, and an incident of it, rather than a principal use of itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gratton v. Pellegrino, </em>115 N.H. 619, 621, 348 A.2d 349, 351 (1975); <em>Perron v. Concord, </em>102 N.H. 32, 35, 150 A.2d 403, 406 (1959). The definition of accessory use in the town ordinance (\u201ccustomarily incidental and subordinan!\u201d [sic]) involves several distinct elements. \u201cIncidental and subordinate\u201d incorporates the requirements that the accessory use be minor in relation to the permitted use and that the accessory use bear a reasonable relationship to the primary use. <em>Lawrence v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 509, 512, 264 A.2d 552, 554 (1969); <em>Harvard v. Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 275 N.E.2d 347 (1971). \u201cCustomarily\u201d imposes an additional requirement that the accessory use habitually has been established as reasonably associated with the primary use. <em>Id.; Lawrence v. Zoning Board of Appeals supra; see Gratton v. Pellegrino supra; Perron v. Concord supra; In re Diamond St. Telephone Co., </em>49 Del. 13, 108 A.2d 667 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">We hold that the master properly ruled as a matter of law that the storage of heavy commercial construction equipment cannot be said to bear a reasonable relationship to a residential use and to constitute a use customarily incidental thereto. <em>Dumais v. Somersworth, </em>101 N.H. 111, 134 A.2d 700 (1957). Storage of the equipment is in no way \u201caccessory\u201d to the residential use which the ordinance permits; rather it simply represents an effort by Mr. Fitzgerald to locate a portion of his commercial enterprise near his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In a factually similar case, we held that the storage in a three-stall garage of commercial oil trucks could not be deemed a use accessory to a residential dwelling. <em>Dumais v. Somersworth, </em>101 N.H. 111, 114, 134 A.2d 700, 701 (1957). Similar results have been reached in other jurisdictions. <em>Colabufalo v. Public Buildings Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Mass. 748, 127 N.E.2d 564 (1955); <em>Warwick v. Campbell, </em>82 R.I. 300, 107 A.2d 334 (1954); <em>Dolan v. DeCapua, </em>13 N.J. Super. 500, 80 A.2d 655 (1951); <em>New Rochelle v. Dandry, </em>79 N.Y.S.2d 126 (City Ct. 1948); <em>People v. Scrafano, </em>307 Mich. 655, 12 N.W.2d 325 (1943). These cases may be said to reflect the fact that zoning ordinances generally seek \u201cto avoid . . . the infiltration of residential areas with small businesses or their appurtenances.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>Muskegon Heights v. Wilson, </em>363 Mich. 263, 267, 109 N.W.2d 768, 771 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The defendant places considerable reliance on the evidence that, in this town of about 800 registered voters, about eight other property owners used their premises for the storage of commercial vehicles. This evidence was of limited value on the issue of local custom, since there was no indication of the proportion of business men engaged in the practice. It failed to establish that the use complained of has commonly, habitually, and by long practice been established as reasonably associated with the primary residential use in the town. \u201cIf the ordinance is not being enforced in certain instances this cannot alter the meaning of the ordinance.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Concord, </em>111 N.H. 413, 414, 285 A.2d 791, 792 (1971). We are of the view that the above evidence could not \u201cbootstrap\u201d to the status of an accessory use a use which has no reasonable relationship to a permitted use. <em>See Harvard v. Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 440, 275 N.E.2d 347, 352 (1971); <em>Lawrence v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 509, 513, 264 A.2d 552, 554-55 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">There is no contention that the barn itself is offensive. Plaintiffs\u2019 objection goes to the storage of commercial vehicles. We affirm the ruling of the superior court that the town zoning ordinance prohibits the use of the barn or property for such storage. <em>See Dumais v. Somersworth, </em>101 N.H. 111, 115, 134 A.2d 700, 702-03 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-7\">Douglas, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
