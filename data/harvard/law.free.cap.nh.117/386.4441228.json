Warren Pease, a reporter for the <em>New Hampshire Sunday News </em>newspaper, which deposition centered around a series of articles that Mr. Pease had written in June and July of 1976 concerning the operation of the New Hampshire Department of Probation and which contained statements made by one or more unnamed members of that Department; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-14\">\u201cWHEREAS, R.

May the Senate President and Council in an RSA 4:1 removal proceeding order a witness who is a news reporter to disclose the sources of information which he utilized in preparing a series of articles which relate directly to the performance of the official whose removal is sought?</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-9\">\u201c2. If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, can the Senate President and Council order that news reporter to disclose those names prior to his taking the stand as a witness?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-10\">\u201c3. If the answer to Question One is in the affirmative, and the Senate President and Council order a witness who is a news reporter to disclose his sources of information and he refuses, how do the Senate President and Council enforce their order?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-11\">\u201cAND BE IT RESOLVED that the Secretary of State be directed to submit six attested copies of this resolution to the Clerk of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-12\">The following answers were returned:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b433-13\">\n<em>To His Excellency the President of the Senate and the Honorable Council:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">The undersigned justices of the supreme court return the following answer to the questions contained in your resolution adopted May 4, 1977, and filed in this court on May 5, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Your first question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\">May the Senate President and Council in an RSA 4:1 removal proceeding order a witness who is a news reporter to disclose the sources of information which he utilized in preparing a series of articles which relate directly to the performance of the official whose removal is sought?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We answer your question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">RSA 4:1 is a statutory method by which state officials may be removed from office by the Governor and Council following a hearing. Removal petition action against the director of the department of probation is currently pending before the President of the Senate (the Governor having recused himself) and the Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Last summer, reporter R. Warren Pease wrote a series of articles about the probation department that contained employee criticism against Director John A. King. Some sources were not stated by name. On April 26 of this year counsel for Mr. King took the reporter\u2019s deposition but Mr. Pease then and now has declined to name the probation officers and employees quoted in his <em>New Hampshire Sunday News </em>articles. Mr. King\u2019s counsel has now asked for an order \u201ccompelling Mr. Pease to disclose the names of the individuals he has quoted in his articles\u201d and represents \u201cthat this information is essential to the preparation and presentation of his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">While some twenty-five states have some form of \u201cshield law\u201d to prevent reporters from being compelled to disclose confidential information, Comment, <em>Search Warrants and Journalists\u2019 Confidential Information, </em>25 Am. U.L. Rev. 938, 957 n.88 (1976), New Hampshire is not one of them. This state has three statutory privileges all of which are grounded on the same basis as confidential communications between attorney and client. <em>See </em>RSA 329:26 (Supp. 1975) for physicians and surgeons, RSA 330-A:19 for psychologists, and RSA 330-B:15 (Supp. 1975) for pastoral counselors. Even a statutory privilege is not fixed and unbending and must yield to countervailing considerations such as the rights to counsel and confrontation in a criminal case. <em>State v. Farrow, </em>116 N.H. 731, 366 A.2d 1177 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In the absence of a statutory reporter\u2019s privilege we turn briefly to the question of whether such a privilege exists at common law. \u201cAt common law, courts consistently refused to recognize the existence of any privilege authorizing a newsman to refuse to reveal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>confidential information to a grand jury.\u201d <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 685 (1972). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 7 A.L.R.Sd 591 (1966). No such general right existed at common law for civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665 (1972), the Supreme Court rejected by a five-to-four margin the proposition that a reporter\u2019s privilege existed when faced with inquiries before a grand jury. The newsmen involved in the <em>Branzburg </em>trilogy had asserted that a qualified privilege existed in grand jury proceedings unless the government could show (1) \u201cprobable cause to believe that the reporter possesses information relevant to a specific violation of law; (2) that the information sought cannot be obtained by alternative means from sources other than the reporter; and (3) that there is compelling and overriding governmental interest in the information.\u201d American Trial Law Foundation, Final Report, <em>The First Amendment and the News Media </em>43 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">However, in rejecting the proposed test in criminal proceedings before a grand jury the Court made clear that it was \u201cpowerless to bar state courts from responding in their own way and .construing their own constitutions so as to recognize a newsman\u2019s privilege, either qualified or absolute.\u201d <em>Branzburg, </em>408 U.S. at 706. The New Hampshire Constitution, part I, article 22 provides that \u201cliberty of the press\u201d is \u201cessential to the security of freedom in a state\u201d and ought, therefore, \u201cto be inviolably preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Our constitution quite consciously ties a free press to a free state, for effective self-government cannot succeed unless the people have access to an unimpeded and uncensored flow of reporting. News gathering is an integral part of the process. One study showed that more than ninety percent of the reporters surveyed believed protection of identity was more important than protection of contents. V. Blasi, <em>Press Subpoenas: An Empirical and Legal Analysis </em>63 (1972). Courts have recognized such a privilege in areas other than criminal proceedings. <em>See Baker v. F. &amp; F. Investment, </em>470 F.2d 778 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm. v. McCord, </em>356 F. Supp.1394 (D.D.C.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We hold only that in this civil proceeding involving the press as a nonparty, the balance is struck in favor of the press. <em>See </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 22. We need not decide the scope of the privilege, whether it is absolute, who is a reporter, what qualifies as \u201cpress,\u201d what the situation would be if criminal proceedings were at issue, or whether libel actions would require disclosure.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>James J.
