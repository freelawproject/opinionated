In accordance with a plea bargain agreement, the county attorney recommended a sentence of not more than fifteen years nor less than four years and that the sentence be served concurrently with any sentence or parole which the defendant was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-16\">The Trial Court <em>(Perkins, </em>J.) imposed the sentence recommended, but to run consecutively not concurrently with any sentence or parole which the defendant was then serving. Upon appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>cation to the sentence review division on November 12, 1976, its order was: \u201cThe Sentence is to remain as is; reference is made to <em>State v. Goodrich et al., 116 N.H. 477 </em>and RSA 651:20.\u201d On December 28, 1976, the Trial Court (Perkins, J.) denied defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider the sentence and transferred defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">The issue is the retroactivity of <em>State v. Goodrich supra, </em>which would allow the defendant to retract his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">\u201cThe past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.\u201d <em>Chicot County Dist. v. Bank, </em>308 U.S. 371, 374 (1940). In <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618 (1965), it was held that exclusion of evidence seized in violation of the search and seizure provisions of the fourth amendment does not operate retrospectively upon cases decided in the period prior to <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\"><em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293 (1967) at 297, sets forth the criteria guiding resolution of the question of retroactivity: (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards. <em>See also Tehan v. Shott, </em>382 U.S. 406 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\"><em>State v. Goodrich </em>was a departure from previously announced rules upon which trial courts have justifiably relied. We hold that <em>State v. Goodrich </em>does not apply to pleas of guilty entered prior to August 31, 1976. <em>See Holliday v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 831 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">Nothing in this opinion is intended to prevent the defendant from reapplying for a reconsideration of his sentence in accordance with RSA 651:20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\"><em>Exception </em>overruled.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1054-11\">Lampe\u00f3n, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
