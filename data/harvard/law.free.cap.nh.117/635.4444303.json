The appeal involves assessments made by eleven towns and the city of Franklin (the defendants herein) made as early as 1967 and as late as 1973. By stipulation of the parties, appeals for the years 1974 and 1975 are to be decided on the basis of the disposition of the prior appeals. In all of the towns the company has transmission and distribution facilities; in Bristol and Franklin plaintiff additionally has hydroelectric plants. The appeals from Ashland involve land used in connection with a hydroelectric plant located elsewhere; however, the board noted that the value of the land was not a significant part of that town\u2019s assessments. The board\u2019s rationale for the denial of relief, as detailed in its lengthy 34-page opinion, was plaintiff\u2019s failure to introduce evidence as to the \u201csubstitution\u201d cost of its facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Under RSA 75:1 (Supp. 1975) it is required that taxable property be appraised \u201cat its full and true value in money.\u201d <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, 114 </em>N.H. 594, 326 A.2d 698 (1974). In its attempt to prove the fair market value of property, plaintiff introduced evidence as to the net book value of the property <em>{i.e., </em>original cost less depreciation), capitalized earnings, and (as to the hydroelectric facilities) the value of an alternative source of equivalent power. The plaintiff was adamant in its position that reproduction cost less depreciation was irrelevant, because none of the plants would be reproduced; it acknowledges that \u201cin general it did not offer . . . evidence [as to reproduction cost less depreciation] .\u201d Largely because of this failure, the board found itself unable to determine market value (and thus unable to determine the propriety of an abatement). Plaintiff contends that it is not required to submit evidence on all methods of valuation, and that the board was compelled to make a finding of market value on the evidence before it. This narrow procedural dispute is the central issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>We have previously dealt at length with the extraordinary difficulties in placing a fair market value on the property of a regulated public utility. <em>Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. 142, 136 A.2d 591 (1957). \u201cThe establishment of market value as a test for taxation purposes presupposes a market. In instances such as this where only a part of an integrated system is involved, the difficulty, if not the impossibility of finding an actual customer, especially where as here, the owner has a lawful monopoly in the surrounding area, is obvious. [Citations omitted.] Yet it is plain that to hold there is no market value in such instances would mean that valuable property would entirely escape its just share of the burden of taxation. Such a policy would make neither good law nor good sense. Courts recognizing this have acted accordingly and have considered all factors calculated to influence an assumed buyer and seller in a free market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 136 A.2d at 595; <em>Concord Natural Gas Co. v. Concord, </em>114 N.H. 54, 314 A.2d 679 (1974); <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. 594, 326 A.2d 698 (1974); <em>see Barnet v. New England Power Co., </em>130 Vt. 407, 296 A.2d 228 (1972); <em>Kittery Electric Light Co. v. Assessors, </em>219 A.2d 728 (Me. 1966). We underscored the importance of considering all factors in <em>Concord Natural Gas Co. v. Concord supra, </em>wherein we disapproved of a stipulation by the parties limiting the assessment of utility property to specific measures of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\">There are five approaches to valuation potentially applicable to utility property: original cost less depreciation; reproduction cost less depreciation; comparable sales; capitalized earnings; and the cost of alternative facilities capable of delivering equivalent energy. <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. at 598, 326 A.2d at 701. All the approaches are valid, but all also have weaknesses. For example, even though net book value (original cost less depreciation) provides the \u201crate base\u201d upon which plaintiff\u2019s rate of return is calculated, \u201cthe value of the plant for tax purposes and the value for rate-making purposes need not be the same.\u201d <em>Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. at 149, 136 A.2d at 597; <em>Barnet v. New England Power Co., </em>130 Vt. at 412, 296 A.2d at 231; <em>Kittery Electric Light Co. v. Assessors, </em>219 A.2d at 735. The valuation of alternative sources of equivalent energy capacity is suspect since it critically depends on the validity of certain initial assumptions. <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. at 601-03, 326 A.2d at 702-03. Reproduction costs may be more or less relevant depending on the extent to which it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>make sense to presently reproduce the existing facility. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 326 A.2d at 702; <em>Concord Natural Gas Co. v. Concord, </em>114 N.H. at 56, 314 A.2d at 681. Given all the imponderables in the valuation process, \u201c[jjudgment is the touchstone.\u201d <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. at 599, 326 A.2d at 701; <em>Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. at 154, 136 A.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">In our view, the board\u2019s opinion in this case showed that it understood the difficulties and was prepared to exercise its judgment. It noted that \u201c[n]o factor has talismanic quality,\u201d and that \u201cmany factors . . . influence the determination of market value.\u201d It observed that \u201c[r]ate regulation has a significant bearing\u201d on market value; that net book, since it is based on \u201coriginal cost,\u201d is \u201cbut another factor to be considered\u201d and not \u201cipso facto equivalent to market value\u201d; and that \u201cthe remaining useful life of the property\u201d is an important consideration to any prospective buyer. These comments by the board indicate a disposition to take a flexible approach to valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The board was unable to find on the evidence before it a market value for the property. It was dissatisfied with the scope of plaintiff\u2019s proof. The primary deficiency, as the board saw it, was the lack of substantial evidence as to the cost \u2014 in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 of producing facilities roughly equivalent to those of plaintiff. While plaintiff introduced ample \u201cnet book\u201d evidence, this evidence gave no consideration to appreciation through inflation, since it reflected only \u201coriginal dollars.\u201d <em>See Public Service Co. v. New Hampton, </em>101 N.H. at 151, 136 A.2d at 598. The present-day valuation problem was complicated by the fact that the components in plaintiff\u2019s property varied widely in age and by the board\u2019s finding that, on the evidence presented, it could not deduce the average age of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The board recognized that present-day valuation in terms of reproduction or replacement cost per se would be of limited relevance, and thus it attempted to discern \u201csubstitution cost\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">We use substitution cost rather than replacement or reproduction cost because replacement and reproduction are ambiguous as applied to this case. The state of electrical power art which Taxpayer\u2019s system reflects is constantly changing. On balance Taxpayer does not reproduce or replace [in the sense that \u201creproduction cost\u201d refers to exact reproduction and \u201creplacement cost\u201d to functionally equivalent items].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The board admitted that this measure would set a \u201cmaximum value\u201d for the property but deemed it a \u201cfirst step\u201d in determining market value. Since it could not make this first step on the evidence presented, it did not proceed further with the valuation process and denied the abatement in all appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"> We cannot agree with plaintiff\u2019s essential contention that the board\u2019s failure to proceed was error. The board was properly interested in a measure of plaintiff\u2019s property in current dollars. We have repeatedly held that such evidence, in the nature of reproduction or replacement costs, is relevant to assessing market value. <em>Paras v. Portsmouth, </em>115 N.H. 63, 335 A.2d 304 (1975), and cases cited therein. As noted previously, such evidence may be more or less relevant depending on the extent to which the property would in fact be replaced or reproduced. However, the proper weight to be afforded such evidence is not before us here, but only whether the board could properly deem the evidence worthy of consideration. We cannot hold that such evidence was beyond consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Relying on <em>Vickerry Realty Co. Trust v. Nashua, </em>116 N.H. 536, 364 A.2d 626 (1976), plaintiff argues that the board was compelled to make a determination of market value on the evidence before it. In <em>Vickerry </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">Although under our cases all methods of arriving at market value are relevant and must be considered when presented [citations omitted] this does not require the taxpayer to introduce evidence on all methods in order to support her claim, and her failure to do so does not necessarily constitute a failure of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 539, 364 A.2d at 629. We note that <em>Vickerry </em>did not involve utility property where typically all relevant factors must be considered and that our observation therein was limited to the point that failure to introduce evidence on all methods does not <em>necessarily </em>constitute a failure of proof. The taxpayer has the burden of proof and it is the taxpayer\u2019s responsibility to satisfy the board as to the disproportionality of the tax burden imposed by the selectmen. \u201cThe burden was on the company to satisfy [the trier of fact] by a preponderance of the evidence that it was paying more than its proportionate share of the taxes . . . and thus entitled to an abatement.\u201d <em>New England Power Co. v. Littleton, </em>114 N.H. at 599, 326 A.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>We reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that it was necessary for the board to respond specifically to its several requests for findings of fact and rulings of law. The narrative opinion of the board disclosed the basis for its decision and enables adequate judicial review. <em>Berke v. Griffin, </em>116 N.H. 760, 367 A.2d 583 (1976); <em>see Society for Protection of N.H. Forests v. Site Evaluation Comm., </em>115 N.H. 163, 173, 337 A.2d 778, 786-87 (1975). Further, because the board never in fact reached the merits of the request for an abatement, we have no need to consider plaintiff\u2019s numerous arguments relating to the merits of its tax position.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">Finally, we do not address plaintiff\u2019s argument that inter-town variations in the assessment of its property result in a situation whereby residents of low-assessment towns subsidize through their electric rates the costs of government in high-assessment towns. This contention, involving the rights of third parties, is not properly raised in this case, and is in any event more properly addressed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b687-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
