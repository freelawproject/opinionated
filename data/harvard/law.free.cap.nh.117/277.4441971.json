The plaintiff as well as the defendant indorser filed motions for summary judgment together with supporting affidavits. After a hearing <em>Troisi, </em>J., JtSA 502-A:5 (Supp. 1975), granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion. The defendant appealed. All questions of law were reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The defendant indorser\u2019s only argument is that the plaintiff was guilty of laches and therefore should be barred from relief. However, the plaintiff seeks only legal, not equitable, relief. \u201cLaches is a doctrine peculiarly applicable to suits in equity.\u201d 2 J. Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 419a n.7 (5th ed. S. Symons 1941). Thus, it has no applicability here. \u201c[W]here only strictly legal rights are in controversy no neglect in asserting the right, short of the time prescribed by the statute of limitations, will bar the appropriate legal remedy.\u201d <em>Aronovitch v. Levy, </em>288 Minn. 237, 242, 56 N.W.2d 570, 574 (1953), <em>quoted in </em>E. Re, Equity and Equitable Remedies, Cases and Materials 1139 (1975); <em>see </em>Note, <em>Laches in Federal Substantive Law: Relation to Statutes of Limitations, </em>56 B.U.L. Rev. 970, 970 &amp; 974-75 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
