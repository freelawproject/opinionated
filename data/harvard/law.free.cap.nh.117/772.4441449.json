He contends that he was (wrongfully) not told of RSA 262-A:69-m (Supp. 1975), providing in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he director . . . <em>may </em>in his discretion reissue a license . . . prior to the expiration of ninety days when such person is not found guilty of a violation of RSA 262-A:62.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He argues that the language of RSA 262-A:69-c(3), which directs a law enforcement officer to inform an arrested person \u201cof the consequences of his refusal to permit a test,\u201d mandates that he should have been informed of this discretionary reinstatement procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We are not persuaded by these contentions. The defendant overlooks the fact that the legislature has specifically provided a warning which is sufficient to inform an arrested person of the consequences of refusing to submit to a test. That warning, contained in RSA 262-A:69-e(6) (Supp. 1975), is that \u201crefusal to permit the test will result in revocation of his license. . . .\u201d If the legislature had wanted an arrested person to be advised of all possible consequences, it could have so legislated. This it did not do but instead required only the advice of the outer penalty of refusal, <em>i.e. </em>revocation. This mandate was satisfied in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">We hold that the warning given the defendant satisfied the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b819-9\">Kenison, C.
