Services were to be charged for by the foot, and after more than 500 feet of drilling the plaintiffs had produced only a \u201cdry hole.\u201d The project was abandoned and plaintiffs then presented defendants with a bill for $3,005, representing full charges for 450 feet of drilling, the plaintiff having waived any claim for the balance. Defendants refused to pay and suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Plaintiffs claimed the entire 450 feet of drilling had been authorized and must be paid for. The defendants maintained that they had authorized drilling only to a depth of 175 feet. The evidence on authorization was conflicting, but the Trial Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.) found that \u201cdefendants never agreed to pay plaintiffs for any drilling below a depth of 175 feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The defendants conceded they had authorized drilling to a depth of 175 feet, but the court ruled the defendants were entitled to rescind the contract and that no payment was due plaintiffs. The ruling was based on the court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs had not performed in a workmanlike manner, which it expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">Testimony from the defendants indicates that on the morning of the second day of drilling the plaintiff reported that \u201c. . . There was 15 gallons of water in the pipe and that they had evidently gone through a water vein ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The Court finds that at this particular point of time, the plaintiff had produced a well, not at the 175-foot depth originally estimated, but at a depth of some 55 feet, and thus met his obligations under the agreement. However, uncontroverted testimony from the defendants indicates that contemporaneously with plaintiff\u2019s asserting the presence of \u201cwater in the pipe,\u201d the plaintiff also informed the defendants that this amount of water was insufficient and that he was going to continue drilling deeper. There is no evidence in the record to show that any further activity by the plaintiff, which resulted in a dry hole drilled to an alleged depth of 550 feet, was the subject matter of any agreement between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">The Court therefore finds that as a matter of law, not only were any and all activities by the plaintiff, following that point where there was \u201c. . . 15 gallons of water in the pipe . . .\u201d, done solely at the plaintiff\u2019s peril and expense, but plaintiff\u2019s subsequent unworkmanlike performance constituted a breach of the agreement and grounds for rescission of the contract. The plaintiff, having drilled a well of some 55 feet in depth within the terms of their oral agreement with the defendants, and then unilaterally, outside the terms of that agreement, made an unworkmanlike decision to pursue additional drilling activities which resulted in a virtual destruction of that well leaving a dry hole of some 500 feet in depth, this court finds for the defendants and judgment is entered accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 exception was noted and all questions of law raised transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The difficulty with the finding by the court that plaintiffs performed in an \u201cunworkmanlike\u201d manner is that this finding is not supported by any evidence. As contended by the plaintiffs, the record is devoid of evidence indicating what meaning, if any, should be attributed to plaintiffs\u2019 observation that \u201c15 gallons of water [were] in the pipe.\u201d There is no evidence controverting plaintiffs\u2019 assessment that the vein struck was insufficient to bother with. Defendants did not allege nor did they offer evidence to the effect that plaintiffs had acted carelessly or negligently in disregarding the struck vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>We have held that findings supported by evidence will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Vittum v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>117 N.H. 1, 369 A.2d 184 (1977); <em>Spectrum Enterprises, Inc. v. Helm Corp., </em>114 N.H. 773, 329 A.2d 144 (1974). The finding here of \u201cunworkmanlike performance\u201d is not supported by any evidence contained in the record, and must be held to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\">The evidence conclusively establishes that the defendants authorized 175 feet of drilling, and that plaintiffs gave no guarantee that water would be found. The court\u2019s finding that there was no authorization for drilling beyond 175 feet is amply supported. We conclude that the plaintiffs are entitled to remuneration for 175 feet of drilling at the contract price of $6.50 per foot for a total of $1,137.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 exception sustained in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-5\">Grimes, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
