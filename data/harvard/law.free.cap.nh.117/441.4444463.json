Under the terms of the several written agree-, ments, the plaintiffs allowed the defendant to remove earthfill from a certain site on their farmland at a specified unit charge. The agreements imposed upon the company the obligation to restore the \u201cpit\u201d (excavation area) upon completion of its operations. The defendant was obligated, <em>inter alia, </em>to leave the area \u201creasonably level with all back slopes no steeper 6:1\u201d; to replace all topsoil; to spread all disturbed areas \u201cwith the original topsoil or strippings, or with some other material capable of supporting vegetation\u201d; to fertilize and seed the pit area; and to clean up all areas disturbed by the operation to the owners\u2019 specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The plaintiffs were fully paid for the fill removed but were dissatisfied with defendant\u2019s restoration of the land. Suit was brought to recover damages alleging defendant was in breach of its restoration obligations. The Trial Court (Douglas, J.) found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $17,520. Defendant\u2019s exceptions to the ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>diet and various rulings by the court have been reserved and transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The evidence was undisputed that the defendant had failed to render the back slopes \u201cno steeper than 6:1.\u201d There was also substantial evidence that much of the original topsoil from the pit area had been \u201clost\u201d during the removal operation, and that topsoil depth had deteriorated from twelve inches before the operation to four inches or less after. Finally, there was evidence that the area had been the source of a substantial hay crop prior to the removal, but was later able to support only a meager stand of grass. The trial court found that the Emerys had ^sen damaged in the following amounts:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">1. $3,000 for the cost of 2,000 cubic yards of fill needed to bring the back slopes to the specified grade;</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">2. $10,500 for the cost of 6,000 cubic yards of topsoil required to restore the topsoil to its original depth;</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">3. $3,000 as the fair and reasonable value of lost hay crops for the years 1972 to 1975; and</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">4. $1,020 as the fair and reasonable cost of plowing, harrowing, disking, fertilizing, seeding and feathering the disturbed area (as specified by the owners) in order that the fertility of the topsoil would be restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Defendant\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the court erred in considering certain parol evidence relative to plaintiffs\u2019 understanding that their land would be restored so as to be usable as a hayfield. The written agreements made no mention of use of the land as a hayfield, and defendant contends that the oral statements should have been excluded under the \u201cparol evidence rule.\u201d This common law rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">When two parties have made a contract and have expressed it in a writing to which they both assented as the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing. 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 573, at 357 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">We find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention. The written agreements provided that the defendant would replace all topsoil and otherwise prepare the soil to the owners\u2019 specifications. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>these undertakings had been performed, the land would have been usable as a hayfield. Thus the parol evidence in question did not vary or contradict contractual duties as expressed in the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> The defendant may not complain that the trier of fact considered the hayfield evidence. In awarding damages, it was incumbent on the court to grant compensation for those injuries the defendant had reason to foresee as a probable result of its breach when the contract was made. \u201c \u2018If the injury is one that follows the breach in the usual course of events, there is sufficient reason for the defendant to foresee it; otherwise, it must be shown specifically that the defendant had reason to know the facts and to foresee the injury\u2019.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Waisman Bros., </em>93 N.H. 133, 135, 36 A.2d 634, 636 (1944); Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 330 (1932). The court could properly consider the hayfield evidence in determining whether the claimed lost crops were a probable result of the defendant\u2019s breach. There was no damage limitation provision in the written agreements, and the evidence cannot be said to present any parol evidence problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The defendant also complains that the court erred in using the ordinary contract measure of compensatory damages. Under this measure, an effort is made \u201cto put the injured party in as good a position, so far as money damages can put him, as he would have occupied had the defendant fully performed.\u201d <em>Dunn &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Paragon Homes of New Eng. Inc., </em>110 N.H. 215, 218, 265 A.2d 5, 8 (1970); <em>Salvucci &amp; Sons Inc. v. State, </em>110 N.H. 136, 154, 268 A.2d 899, 911 (1970); <em>Coos Lumber Co. v. Builders Supply Co., </em>104 N.H. 404, 406, 188 A.2d 330, 331 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The defendant relies on a tort case, <em>Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., </em>114 N.H. 505, 323 A.2d 906 (1974), involving damages to real property occasioned by flooding resulting from the breach of a dam. In <em>Moulton </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">These plaintiffs allege that their properties have unique value to them and that they do not seek to sell, but rather restore them. If it can be found on the evidence that these properties can and will be restored to their prior conditions without costs disproportionate to the actual injury, the cost of such restoration is the measure of damages. If restoration is impracticable, the difference between the value of the properties before and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>injury is the measure of damages. 114 N.H. at 513, 323 A.2d at 911.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9H\">The defendant here argues that \u201cthere is no evidence that the plaintiffs will restore the premises to their alleged prior condition if awarded damages,\u201d and thus that compensatory damages are inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"> We note initially that <em>Moulton </em>is a tort case and it is thus readily distinguishable: \u201cIn a case of tort . . . the general purpose of compensation is to give a sum of money to the person wronged which, as nearly as possible, will restore him to the position he would be in if the wrong had not been committed. In the case of a breach of contract, the goal of compensation is not the mere restoration to a former position, as in tort, but the awarding of a sum which is the equivalent of performance of the bargain\u2014 the attempt to place the plaintiff in the position he would be in if the contract had been fulfilled.\u201d C. McCormick, Law of Damages \u00a7 137, at 560-61 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Further, assuming that the <em>Moulton </em>standard were applicable here, the court denied the defendant\u2019s proposed finding to the effect that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the plaintiffs would restore the land. It is a fair inference from plaintiff husband\u2019s testimony that restoration is contemplated, and we cannot say that the denial of the requested finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We agree that there are occasions when it would be economically wasteful to place the aggrieved party under the contract in the \u201csame place\u201d he would have occupied had the contract been fully performed, and on such occasions the ordinary measure of contract damages may not be employed. For example, in the context of a construction contract, the usual measure of damages may be withheld if \u201cphysical reconstruction and completion in accordance with the contract [would] involve unreasonable economic waste by destruction of usable property or otherwise.\u201d J. Calamari and J. Perillo, Contracts '\u00a7 230, at 363 (1970); <em>see Danforth v. Freeman, </em>69 N.H. 466, 43 A. 621 (1898). It is said that the \u201ctrue rationale\u201d underlying this rule of damages is one of unjust enrichment since \u201c[i]n all likelihood if the owner were to recover this [disproportionate] amount in such circumstances he would pocket the recovery.\u201d J. Calamari and J. Perillo supra. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>there is no showing of disproportionality in this case. A valuable income-producing asset has been rendered unproductive; the damages awarded constitute a reasonable means of bringing that asset back to life. If the plaintiffs choose to \u201cpocket\u201d their recovery, they will have foregone the restoration of their land; they will not have been unjustly enriched.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The defendant further complains that the damage award is excessive in that the plaintiffs failed to mitigate and avoid damages. Relying on testimony by the plaintiff husband that he witnessed the defendant\u2019s deficient restoration of the topsoil, the defendant argues that plaintiff should \u201chave spoken up at that time\u201d; additionally, defendant argues that plaintiffs could have taken steps to do what had to be done for the damaged land. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s proposed findings on this issue, holding that the' expenditures required by plaintiffs would have been prohibitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We find no reason to disturb the rulings of the trial court. The law requires reasonable efforts by a plaintiff to curtail his loss. <em>Murray v. Boston &amp; Maine R. R., </em>107 N.H. 367, 375, 224 A.2d 66, 72 (1966); <em>Novak v. Company, </em>84 N.H. 93, 96, 146 A. 525, 526 (1929). Recovery will not be permitted of damages which could have been \u201cavoided by reasonable effort without undue risk, expense, or humiliation.\u201d Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 336(1) (1932). The evidence in this case is clear that no hay crop would be possible without the restoration of topsoil. Since this would involve a $10,500 expenditure it was not error for the court to conclude that the expenditure was not within the plaintiffs\u2019 duty to mitigate. <em>See Chambers v. Belmore Land Co., </em>33 Cal. App. 78, 164 P. 404 (1917). This case is obviously distinguishable from the situation where the required expenditure is one for seed only. Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Wavra v. Karr, </em>142 Minn. 248, 172 N.W. 118 (1919), is thus misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Nor can we agree that plaintiff failed to \u201cspeak up.\u201d The evidence shows that the following events occurred as defendant completed its restoration efforts in the fall of 1971. Defendant\u2019s superintendent told plaintiff that he should \u201csquawk\u201d in the spring if the disturbed area failed to come up \u201cgreen and good.\u201d An officer of the defendant, when presented by the plaintiff with a partial listing of additional contractual work that needed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>done, told him that \u201che would see us in court before we got any more money.\u201d On this evidence, one could reasonably conclude that the defendant was fully aware of deficiencies in its performance but simply chose not to remedy them. We will not disturb the finding of the trier of fact. <em>Cf. Fuller v. Brown, 67 </em>N.H. 188, 34 A. 463 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Defendant contends the court prejudicially erred in observing holes dug by both parties on a view of the premises after the conclusion of the trial testimony. We note that this evidence, which showed shallow levels of topsoil, merely confirmed trial testimony to the same effect. Moreover, defendant, if it felt it had any meaningful rebuttal to this evidence, could have moved for the reopening of the testimony. We find no error here. <em>See Flint v. Company, </em>73 N.H. 483, 62 A. 788 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We further reject defendant\u2019s contentions that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding of deficient performance and its award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-7\">Douglas, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
