The Trial Court <em>(King, </em>J.) dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the labor commissioner\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s petition for review, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The plaintiff does not dispute the fact that he had received his last lump-sum payment more than five years before he filed his petition for review, but he asserts that he accepted all the payments under duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The list of grounds entitling a person to petition for a review of an award by the labor commissioner and the time within which the grounds may be presented by petition are set forth in RSA 281:40 (Supp. 1975): \u201cAny party in interest . . . may petition the labor commissioner to review ... an award ... by a petition filed . . . not later than the fourth anniversary of the date of . . . the last payment of compensation under such award . . . upon the ground of... undue influence, or coercion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal as one barred by RSA 281:40 (Supp. 1975) was a correct application of the statute to the facts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">The right to compensation is purely statutory and, while the legislation is to be liberally construed, we cannot read words into it which the legislature did not see fit to insert or which directly contradict its plain language. <em>Prassas v.
