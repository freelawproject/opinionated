We hold that it is not. Israel Lee Esken, a minor aged 16, was employed by the defendant as a dishwasher during the summer of 1973. On July 14, 1973, Esken drowned while using one of the camp\u2019s canoes. Decedent\u2019s funeral bill of $595 was paid to decedent\u2019s father and sole heir, Marcel Esken, by defendant\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier. After plaintiff filed the action for wrongful death, defendant moved for dismissal on the grounds that the action was barred by RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1975). The motion was granted, and all questions of law were reserved and transferred by the Trial Court <em>(King, </em>J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The statute provides that \u201c[a]n employee . . . shall . . . have waived his rights of action at common law to recover damages for personal injuries against his employer. . . .\u201d Plaintiff in this case is not an employee, but the administrator of the deceased employee\u2019s estate. The only rights of action which are waived by the employee under RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1975) are <em>his </em>rights, and those of his spouse to recover for consequential damages. An administrator is not an employee within the definition of RSA 281:2 III (Supp. 1975); neither the plaintiff nor Marcel Esken, decedent\u2019s father and sole heir, is a dependent within the statutory definition of RSA 281:2 IX (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">New Hampshire\u2019s exclusionary liability clause is extremely narrow. 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws \u00a7 66.10 (1976). \u201cOur law could have provided, as do the statutes of many states, that common-law actions by parents, dependents and next-of-kin, are also excluded when the employee receives a compensable injury. Our law does not so provide, either expressly or by fair implication.\u201d <em>Archie v. Hampton, </em>112 N.H. 13, 16, 287 A.2d 622, 624 (1972). \u201cThe statutory definition of \u2018employee\u2019 operates to restrict rather than to enlarge the purview of the section. . . .\u201d <em>Gagne v. Greenhouses, </em>99 N.H. 292, 295, 109 A.2d 840, 842 (1954). Prior to its amendment and its enactment in 1947 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>a revised workmen\u2019s compensation law, House bill 35 (1947) proposed that the definition of the word \u201cemployee,\u201d in what is now RSA 281:2 III (Supp. 1975), include the employee\u2019s legal representatives, dependents, and other persons to whom compensation may be payable. However, the definition was amended and narrowed to include only the employee himself. <em>Gagne, </em>99 N.H. at 297, 109 A.2d at 844. As the administrator of the deceased employee\u2019s estate, plaintiff is not barred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Furthermore, the statute bars only the employee\u2019s common-law actions. \u201cAn action for wrongful death was unknown to the common law.\u201d <em>Tanner v. King, 102 </em>N.H. 401, 402, 157 A.2d 643, 644 (1960). <em>See also Burke v. Burnham, </em>97 N.H. 203, 84 A.2d 918 (1951); <em>Niemi v. Railroad, </em>87 N.H. 1, 173 A. 361 (1934). Thus, plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action does not fall into the proscribed category under RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1975). New Hampshire\u2019s survival act statute reverses the common-law rule that personal actions die with the person, and allows the decedent\u2019s representatives to initiate suits which accrued to the decedent for the benefit of his estate. Franklin, <em>Wrongful Death and Survival Actions in New Hampshire, </em>6 N.H.B.J. 305 (1964). If the decedent had survived the accident, his common-law suit for tortious injury would have been foreclosed; because plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action was created solely by statute, it is not foreclosed by RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1975). The workmen\u2019s compensation exclusionary statute was passed in 1947, sixty years after wrongful death actions were statutorily created. Had the legislature wished to bar statutory actions in addition to common-law actions, it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The contract of employment which the deceased signed stated that any accident liability would be limited by workmen\u2019s compensation regulations. As plaintiff\u2019s suit is not barred by RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1975), decedent\u2019s release is not a bar to plaintiff\u2019s action for wrongful death. In this ease, no discharge of <em>this </em>cause of action was given by the decedent before his death. <em>See Burke v. Burnham, </em>97 N.H. 203, 84 A.2d 918 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b784-8\">Grimes, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
