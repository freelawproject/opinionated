McNamara, </em>assistant attorney general (Mr. <em>McNamara </em>orally), for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1042-15\"><em>Raymond K.

We hold that he does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-17\">Defendant was indicted for aggravated felonious sexual assault by engaging in sexual penetration of a fifteen-year-old female by forcing her to commit the act of fellatio upon him. He moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>dismissal on the grounds that there was no \u201csexual contact\u201d or \u201csexual penetration\u201d as defined by RSA 632-A: 1IV, V. The motion was denied and defendant\u2019s exceptions were transferred by <em>Dun-fey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Aggravated felonious sexual assault is defined by RSA 632-A: 2 (Supp. 1975) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-6\">A person is guilty of class A felony if he engages in sexual penetration with another person under any of the following circumstances ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">One of the circumstances is overcoming the victim through force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">\u201cSexual penetration\u201d is defined by RSA 632-A: 1 V (Supp. 1975) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-9\">\u201cSexual penetration\u201d means sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of the actor\u2019s body or any object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal openings of the victim\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">Defendant contends that although \u201cfellatio\u201d is specifically included it does not include the act committed by the defendant because of the latter part of the definition \u201cor any intrusion, however slight, of any part of the actor\u2019s body or any object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal openings of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d He argues that because no part of his body is alleged to have intruded into the genital or anal openings of the victim, his act is not included. He contends that \u201cfellatio\u201d as used in the statute can apply to the act between a male and a female only when the female is the \u201cactor.\u201d We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">The latter part of the statute relied on by defendant to modify the express language of the first part clearly relates to acts not otherwise covered and was not intended to limit sexual penetration to the genital or anal openings of the victim. It was intended to cover the intrusion of other parts of the body not included in the specific acts enumerated in the first part of the definition and to also include \u201cobjects\u201d other than parts of the actor\u2019s body. It is to these acts and these acts only that the limitation to the \u201cgenital and anal\u201d openings apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">\u201cSexual contact\u201d as defined in RSA 632-A: 1 IV (Supp. 1975) is not a necessary element of the crime with which defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>ant is charged as defendant contends but is included only in sections 3 and 4 which define offenses separate from the one here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">This construction is consistent with RSA 625:3, providing that strict construction shall not apply but rather all provisions \u201cshall be construed according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice,\u201d as well as RSA 21:2. <em>See State v. Bill, </em>115 N.H. 605, 347 A.2d 445 (1975); <em>State v. Partlow, </em>117 N.H. 78, 81, 369 A.2d 221, 223 (1977). Any other construction would lead to an absurd result. <em>State v. Slayton, </em>116 N.H. 613, 615, 367 A.2d 575, 577 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b1044-7\">Lampron, J., did not participate in the decision of this case; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
