Michael A. Varney</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b209-10\">February 28, 1977</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-17\"><em>David H.

Damon, </em>assistant attorney general <em>(Mr. Damon </em>orally) for the state.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-18\"><em>Lee A.

Defendant moved to suppress the results of a blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>test sample of 0.17 percent alcohol by weight because of a twelve-day delay from the date the sample was taken to the date the sample was analyzed by the state police laboratory. This delay is asserted to violate RSA 262-A: 69-i (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The chemist who performed the analysis of the sample testified that any deterioration would have worked to the defendant\u2019s favor, not the state\u2019s. Because the timing of delivery of the blood sample to the state laboratory for analysis is \u201cnot part of the procedure for conducting the chemical test,\u201d the defendant may not take advantage of the provision for exclusion of evidence pursuant to RSA 262-A: 69-i (Supp. 1975). <em>State v. Paul, </em>116 N.H. 252, 356 A.2d 661 (1976); <em>State v. Groulx, </em>109 N.H. 281, 249 A.2d 690 (1969). To the extent the twelve-day delay has any effect on the evidence it would relate to its weight and not its admissibility. <em>State v. Gallant, </em>108 N.H. 72, 73-75, 227 A.2d 597, 598-99 (1967); <em>State v. LaFountain, </em>108 N.H. 219, 231 A.2d 635 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">This case raises no new or important question for this court. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>117 N.H. 67, 369 A.2d 197 (1977). The transferring of questions such as herein raised by district and municipal courts pursuant to RSA 502-A:17-a (Supp. 1975) on interlocutory matters should not be encouraged. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 491: App. R. 88 (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\"><em>Denial of defendants motion affirmed; </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
