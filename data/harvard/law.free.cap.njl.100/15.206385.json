No clerkship shall be deemed to have commenced until such certificate shall have been filed as aforesaid; and the period of clerkship shall be computed from the actual filing of such certificate and not otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">That rule, so amended, was promulgated June 5th, 1923, and by its express terms applies \"to candidates beginning clerkship on and after August 1st, 1923.\u201d Accompanying the \u201crevised rules\u201d so promulgated June 5th, 1923, was an \"introductory announcement,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">\"The attention of the members of the bar is especially called to the provisions requiring clerkship to be served in the office of a counselor-at-law, * * * and the rules relating to committees on character and fitness, which will require a rigid enforcement of the provisions \u2014 formerly relaxed in many cases \u2014 that certificates of commencement of clerkship must be filed as a condition precedent to credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>for service of clerkship, such service to run only from and after the filing of such certificate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">One reason for such announced intention to require a rigid enforcement of .the rule now in question is plainly indicated in such introductory announcement. It is to- secure the best results possible from the rules relating to committees on character and fitness requiring such several committees, so far as possible, \u201cto keep under observation all applicants <em>who have fled their certificates </em>of commencement of clerkship in the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Certainly, the fact that the present petitioner neglected to file a certificate for forty-six days after he commenced his clerkship, and that after his clerkship commenced the time for examinations for attorneys\u2019 licenses was changed from November to October, constitutes uo reason for granting his application for permission to file an amended certificate <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The question whether in other circumstances, perchance exhibiting greater hardship and not so clearly the sole fault of the candidate, the rule might be relaxed, is a question we do not now determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The application will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
