CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY, APPELLANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b434-11\">Argued May 21, 1924</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AoQP\">Decided January 27, 1924.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b434-12\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which the following <em>per curiam </em>was hied:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-13\">\u201cThe plaintiff delivered a carload of coal to the defendant at Nottingham, Pennsylvania, to be forwarded to the defendant at ElizaJbethport, New Jersey, and when it was delivered to the plaintiff it was found five and four-hundredths gross tons of coal were missing, and the plaintiff brought this suit to recover the value of the shortage. The District Court gave a judgment for the plaintiff for the market value of the coal at point of shipment, as well as the freight and war taxes. From this the plaintiff has appealed, and the question presented is whether the plaintiff was entitled to the value of the coal at destination rather than at the point of shipment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>which, was higher than at the point of shipment. It is not denied that the retail price of coal at Elizabothport was higher than at the point of shipment, and the real question at issue is whether the plaintiff was. entitled to recover the retail value at the destination rather than the wholesale value at the point of shipment. In <em>Blessing </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co. of N. J., </em>91 N. <em>J. L. </em>398, the Supreme Court laid down this rule: 'At the common law the measure of damages in the case of a total loss of shipment was \u2014 first, the value of the goods at the time and place of destination, and secondly, any incidental damages which were the natural and proximate result of the breach of the contract of carriage.\u2019 If this rule be applied, then the plaintiff in the present suit was entitled to. recover the value of the goods at the place of destination, and any incidental damages resulting from the breach of contract of carriage. In <em>Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Co. </em>v. <em>McCaull-Dinsmore Co., </em>171 <em>C. C. A. </em>(at <em>p. </em>561), which was a suit to recover the difference between the value at point of shipment and destination on a shipment of grain, in which the plaintiff recovered, the defendant claiming that by the contract of shipment the damages should be computed on the basis of the value of the property at the place and time of shipment, to which the court said 'we deem such contention unsound. There \u201cwas no uncertainty as to the time or place of estimating value under the rule of common lay \u2014 it ivas the destination. The evident purpose of the provision in the bill of lading ivas not to introduce certainty, but to avoid the rule existing at laiv for the obvious object of escaping the higher valuation which would often arise at destination. Such a provision is unquestionably a limitation, since it forbids application of the established rule,\u2019 and held that, notwithstanding the hill of lading, the plaintiff was entitled to. recover the value at destination. The case last mentioned ivas affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States under the same title (353 <em>U. S. </em>97), in which Mr. Justice Holmes said: 'The rule of common law is not an arbitrary <em>fiat </em>but an embodiment of the plain fact that the actual loss caused by the breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>is the loss of what the contractee would have had if the contract liad been performed.\u2019 We think the cases cited establishes the rule that the measure of damages in such cases is to be assessed as of the value of the cargo at destination. The defendant argues, however, that as the entire quantity was purchased at wholesale, and there being no wholesale market at Elizabethport, the value must be the wholesale price at the point of shipment, and cites some cases which seem to hold until the defendant. <em>But </em>that is not the rule either in this state nor that enforced by the Supreme Court of the United States. To' have supplied this lost coal at Elizabeth-port would have cost the plaintiff more than the wholesale price at the mines or point of shipment. The plaintiff was entitled to replace the coal at its value at destination, because the quantity that was lost could not be bought a-t wholesale rates anywhere. Our conclusion is that the trial court applied an erroneous measure of damages, and for that reason the judgment will be reversed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-4\">Por the appellant, <em>William A.
