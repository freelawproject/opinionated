(\u201cAmerican\u201d) and American Airlines Pension Benefits Administration Committee (\u201cPBAC\u201d) on her civil complaint, filed pursuant to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132. Her complaint sought a refund of insurance premiums from American\u2019s Group Life and Health Benefits Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) for medical coverage of her daughter on the ground that the coverage was erroneously reinstated upon Lesnick-Oakes\u2019s return to work from a leave of absence. On appeal, she argues that the district court erred in: (1) limiting its review to the administrative record; and (2) granting summary judgment because the PBAC\u2019s decision was wrong. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-22\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling affirming a plan administrator\u2019s ERISA benefits decision <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-23\">First, we find no merit to her claim that the district court erred in limiting its re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>view to the administrative record. As we\u2019ve held, \u201c[r]eview of [a] plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits is limited to consideration of the material available to the administrator at the time it made its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err in limiting its review to the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">We are also unpersuaded by Lesnick-Oakes\u2019s claim that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. Although ERISA does not provide any standards for reviewing a plan administrator\u2019s determination, we have developed the following six-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-5\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e. the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-8\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse, the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-9\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">Our inquiry in this case ends after application of the first prong of the test \u2014 based on the record available to the PBAC, its decision that Lesnick-Oakes was not entitled to a refund was not <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong.\u201d As the PBAC explained, the Plan guidelines required Lesnick-Oakes to file a life event requesting that her daughter\u2019s medical coverage be waived within 60 days of Lesnick-Oakes\u2019s return to work. Because she failed to make this request when she returned to work in 2010, the benefits she had in place prior to her 2006 leave-of-absence, which included medical coverage for herself and her daughter, were automatically reinstated. Moreover, the guidelines provide that benefit elections made during a leave-of-absence only apply for the duration of the leave-of-absence. Thus, although Lesnick-Oates waived medical coverage in February 2011, that waiver only applied to the duration of her January 2011 leave-of-absence; when she returned to work in March 2011, the benefits that she had in place prior to her January 2011 leave-of-absence were automatically reinstated. Finally, her argument that her daughter\u2019s coverage must have been a mistake because her son\u2019s coverage was a mistake is without merit. Unlike her son, her daughter was a covered dependent in 2006, and therefore, was properly re-enrolled in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">In short, the PBAC\u2019s decision was based on the explicit terms of the plan guidelines and was not <em>de novo </em>wrong. Accordingly, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment to American Airlines and PBAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
