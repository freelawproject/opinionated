Mr. Bullard argues that the district court erred in (1) finding that his prior conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell under Fla. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a) qualified as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); (2) increasing his offense level under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) for possessing a firearm in connection with a controlled substance offense; and (3) sentencing him above the ten-year statutory maximum for his offense based on prior convictions that were not alleged in the indictment. Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The district court sentenced Mr. Bullard as an armed career criminal under the ACCA based on three qualifying predicate convictions: (1) a 1989 Florida conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a); (2) a 1991 Florida conviction for aggravated battery and battery on a police officer, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 784.045 and 784.07; and (3) a 1999 federal conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. On appeal, Mr. Bullard contends that his Florida conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a), is not a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>583 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). Under the ACCA, any person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has at least three prior convictions from any court \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d receives a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">(ii) an offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of then years or more is prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014), we held that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA. Accordingly, we hold, for the reasons substantially stated in our opinion in <em>Smith, </em>that the district court did not err in concluding that Mr. Bullard\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) for possession of cocaine with intent to sell qualified as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Mr. Bullard also argues that the trial court erred in enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) because there was insufficient evidence to establish that he possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with ... a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">The pertinent facts of the offense are as follows. Riviera Beach police officers obtained a search warrant to search Mr. Bullard\u2019s residence after a confidential source made two purchases of drugs from Mr. Bullard at the residence. Mr. Bullard resided in the sole upper-floor apartment of a two-story building. A search of the apartment yielded five grams of cocaine in two plastic baggies in the master bedroom, as well as a digital scale in the kitchen. During execution of the search warrant, officers observed a firearm in plain view on the front passenger seat of a car parked in a parking stall in front of the apartment complex. Mr. Bullard acknowledged that the car belonged to his mother and admitted that the firearm belonged to him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Based on these facts, the district court found \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that [Mr. Bullard] did possess a firearm and ammunition in connection with a controlled substance offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">\u201cWe review a sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and review its application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u2019\u2019 United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 836 (11th Cir.1997). Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant who qualifies as an armed career criminal receives an offense level of \u201c34, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with ... a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). The Guidelines define a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as \u201can offense ... that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Even if Mr. Bullard could demonstrate that the district court erred in finding that he \u201cpossessed] a firearm and ammunition in connection with a controlled substance offense,\u201d any such error would be harmless. Mr. Bullard qualified as an armed career criminal under the ACCA, and as such, he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months. Even if Mr. Bullard had not possessed the firearm at issue in connection with a controlled substance offense, thereby reducing his advisory guideline range to 135-168 months, the district court nevertheless would have been required to impose a sentence of at least 180 months \u2014 the exact sentence that Mr. Bullard received. Accordingly, no reversible error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Finally, Mr. Bullard contends that his sentence is unconstitutional because the trial court relied on prior convictions not alleged in his indictment to increase his sentence above the ten-year statutory maximum. We review such constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. See United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 968 (11th Cir.2008). Because prior precedent forecloses Mr. Bullard\u2019s argument, we conclude that the district court\u2019s imposition of the ACCA enhancement did not violate Mr. Bullard\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See, e.g. Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1266 (\u201cThe Constitution does not require that the government allege in its indictment and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [a defendant] had prior convictions for a district court to use those- convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Mr. Bullard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
