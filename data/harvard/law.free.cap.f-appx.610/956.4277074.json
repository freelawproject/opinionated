Solomon challenges the sufficiency of his indictment and the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-21\">Solomon\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of his indictment fail. Solomon argues that his indictment is factually insufficient, but he waived that challenge to his indictment by failing to \u201craise [it] before trial,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3). <em>See United States v. Pacchioli, </em>718 F.3d 1294, 1307 (11th Cir.2013). Solomon also argues that his indictment is deficient because it charged him in the conjunctive with \u201cpossessing] in and affecting\u201d instead of in the disjunctive as provided in section 922(g), but an indictment does not have to recite verbatim the language of the statute, <em>United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1325 (11th Cir.1998). Solomon\u2019s indictment stated that his conduct violated \u201cSection 922(g)(1),\u201d which was sufficient to inform him of the charge against him. And the indictment described the firearm that Solomon possessed, \u201ca Glock, Model 19, 9 millimeter pistol,\u201d and the date and place where he committed the offense, which enabled him to prepare and present a defense and to avoid a second prosecution for the same offense. <em>See United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1046 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-22\">Solomon argues that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal, but his arguments are foreclosed by our precedents. Solomon argues that section 922(g) is an unconstitutional exercise by Congress of its power under the Commerce Clause to purely intrastate conduct, under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), but unlike the statute in <em>Lopez, </em>section 922(g) \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>tains an express jurisdictional requirement,\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011). Solomon also argues that his firearm did not \u201csubstantially affect\u201d interstate commerce because he possessed it briefly in a residential parking lot, but a convicted felon violates section 922(g)(1) if the firearm that he possesses traveled previously in interstate commerce, <em>see United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715-16 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996). The district court did not err by convicting Solomon when he stipulated that his firearm \u201cwas manufactured in Austria and ... traveled in and affected interstate and foreign commerce prior to\u201d reaching him in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We AFFIRM Solomon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
