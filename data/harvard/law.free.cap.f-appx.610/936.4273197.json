Kircus contends the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the Government failed to prove Kircus\u2019s modified airbag cylinder was a \u201cdestructive device.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-21\">A \u201cdestructive device\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cany explosive, incendiary, or poi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>son gas (A) bomb\u201d but not including \u201cany device which is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f). This section requires proof that the device was both (1) \u201can explosive\u201d and (2) \u201cdesigned as a weapon.\u201d <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>371 F.3d 776, 780 (11th Cir.2004). In determining whether a device was designed as a weapon, \u201cthe critical inquiry is whether the device, as designed, has any value other' than as a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">On appeal, Kircus does not argue the modified airbag cylinder was not an explosive. Rather, he contends the evidence does not support a finding that the device was designed or redesigned as a weapon. We disagree. The Government\u2019s experts testified the device as modified had no social, industrial, or commercial use and was, in their opinion, designed to be an improvised explosive bomb. The Government\u2019s experts also testified the device would fragment into pieces moving at a high enough rate of speed to seriously injure anyone in the vicinity of the blast. This testimony, along with other record evidence, provides a sufficient basis for concluding the device was designed as a weapon. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1247 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining the Government\u2019s expert testimony \u201cestablished that [defendant\u2019s] pipe bombs were designed, as weapons\u201d when the expert testified the pipe bombs \u201chad no social or entertainment use, they propelled fragments, and the fragments were capable of causing severe injury to people in the vicinity\u201d). Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Kir-cus\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
