Chen contends that the country conditions in his home province of Fujian have materially changed, and if he is forced to return there, he will be punished for violating the family planning laws because he has two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe moving party bears a heavy burden as motions to reopen' are disfavored, especially in removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">An alien seeking to reopen removal proceedings based on changed country conditions must present \u201cevidence [that] is material and [that] was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Chen did not meet his heavy burden of presenting the required evidence. In its order denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA recognized that the two Country Reports that Chen had submitted, the 2004 report in support of his application for asylum in his initial removal proceedings and the 2013 report in support of his motion to reopen, both discuss essentially the same types of enforcement of China\u2019s family planning policies, including coercion, forced sterilization and abortion, and social compensation fees. While in his initial removal proceedings he proffered specific evidence about family planning measures taken against the woman who was his wife at that time, in his present proceedings, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>proffered no new evidence showing that the country conditions have worsened in a way that is likely to cause him to be singled out for forced sterilization or other persecution upon returning to China with two foreign-born children. Although Chen did present evidence showing that his personal circumstances have changed, that is insufficient to support a motion to reopen. <em>See Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1258 (stating that \u201cchanged personal circumstances do not meet the standard for a petition to reopen\u201d); <em>see also Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319 (\u201cAn alien cannot circumvent the requirement of changed country conditions by demonstrating only a change in her personal circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">The BIA did not act in an arbitrary or capricious fashion or abuse its discretion by denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
