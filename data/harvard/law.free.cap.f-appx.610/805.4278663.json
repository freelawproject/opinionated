United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). On appeal, Mr. Cartagena-Merced disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that he had not satisfied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d and therefore could not challenge the validity of his sentence under \u00a7 2241. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Specifically, he asserts that, contrary to the district court\u2019s decision, <em>Alleyne </em>represented a new rule of constitutional law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Mr. Cartagena-Merced was convicted in 1998 of, among other charges, using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Neither the indictment nor the jury\u2019s verdict specified the type of firearm used, but at sentencing the government introduced evidence that the firearm in question was a semiautomatic weapon. For this reason, the district court increased the statutory mandatory minimum sentence on the \u00a7 924(c)(1) violation from 5 to 10 years. Mr. Cartagena-Merced\u2019s convictions and sentences were upheld on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Mojicar-Baez, </em>229 F.3d 292, 313 (1st Cir.2000). The following year, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in which he raised several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. That motion was denied in 2004, and Mr. Cartagena-Merced did not appeal. In 2009, Mr. Cart-agena-Merced filed his first \u00a7 2241 petition, raising new claims of ineffective assistance. The district court dismissed that petition, concluding it was, in substance, a successive \u00a7 2255 motion (which generally is not permitted) and was not otherwise properly filed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In 2013, the Supreme Court held that any aggravating fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory minimum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2162-63. In other words, under <em>Alleyne </em>the fact that an individual used a <em>semiautomatic </em>weapon in relation to a crime of violence must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B) (describing increased penalties for short-barreled rifles and shotguns, semiautomatic weapons, machine guns, and \u201cdestructive devices\u201d). The following year, Mr. Cartagena-Merced filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in which he asserted that <em>Alleyne </em>provided a basis for his new petition and for relief. The district court dismissed the petition as successive. Mr. Cartagena-Merced now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Typically, a prisoner must assert any collateral attacks on the validity of his federal conviction or sentence via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 generally is reserved for challenges to the execution, rather than validity, of a sentence. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Further, \u201cif a federal prisoner ... has already been denied [\u00a7 2255] relief,\u201d then a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks the validity of a sentence \u201cshall not be entertained\u201d unless it \u201cappears that the remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). This exception to \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s bar on a \u00a7 2241 petition, which we refer to as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d places the burden on the petitioner to establish that the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because this savings clause is jurisdictional, a prisoner petitioning the district court under \u00a7 2241 must make this showing before the district court may take jurisdiction of the case. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337-40 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013). And we recognize that the statutory bar on second and successive \u00a7 2255 petitions, standing alone, cannot render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause. <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) (era banc). Rather, a petitioner may employ the savings clause properly to file a \u00a7 2241 petition where he shows that (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding his claim squarely was foreclosed by binding circuit precedent; (2) his current claim is based on a Supreme Court decision that overturned that formerly binding precedent; (3) the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is retroactively applicable on collateral review; (4) as result of the new rule\u2019s application, his sentence exceeds the applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">We conclude the district court did not err in dismissing Mr. Cartagena-Merced\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. The claim he raises in his petition addresses the validity of his sentence, not its execution, and therefore falls within the scope of \u00a7 2255 rather than \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Because Mr. Cartagena-Merced previously had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied, he cannot merely circumvent the statutory restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308. To proceed under \u00a7 2241, then, Mr. Cartage-na-Merced must show by meeting the elements set forth in <em>Bryant </em>that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. He has not done so here. Although he relies upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Al-leyne </em>as a ground for relief, this Court previously has concluded <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014). Thus, because <em>Jeanty </em>forecloses Mr. Cartagena-Merced\u2019s ability to meet the third element of <em>Bryant, </em>we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">. Because we conclude <em>Jeanty </em>forecloses Mr. Cartagena-Merced\u2019s petition, we do not address any of the government\u2019s alternative arguments for affirming the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
