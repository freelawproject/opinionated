King argues the district court erred in denying his motion because his original, below-guidelines sentence was the result of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance departure. As the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we weave them into the discussion only as necessary. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>The district court did not err in denying King\u2019s motion because (1) his original sentence of 75 months was already below the 168-month minimum of his amended guideline range,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the Government never moved for a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure for substantial assistance. When a defendant\u2019s original sentence is already lower than the minimum of her amended guidelines range, she is not eligible for a reduction below the amended guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A); <em>see United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2013). That is the precisely the ease here. King\u2019s 75-month sentence was well below the 168-month minimum of his amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Nonetheless, a defendant is still eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if his original sentence was below the amended guidelines range \u201cbecause of a reduction based upon the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities [pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1].\u201d <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1259; \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). A substantial assistance departure is available upon a \u201cmotion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d \u00a7 5K1.1. The record belies King\u2019s assertion that he received a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance departure. The district court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing explicitly indicate King\u2019s below-guidelines sentence was attributable to a \u00a7 3553(a) downward variance, not a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-8\">. We review de novo a district\u2019s court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1194 n. 9 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b994-7\">. We assume, without deciding, that King is eligible pursuant to Amendment 782 of the Sentencing Guidelines for a 2-level reduction in his original base offense level of 38. Since his base offense level would be 36 under the amended guidelines, his amended guidelines range \u2014 keeping all of the original sentencing findings intact \u2014 would be 168 to 210 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
