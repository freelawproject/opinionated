As brief relevant background, in 1996 and 1997, Red-stone Federal Credit Union (\u201cRedstone\u201d) obtained state-court default judgments against Russell. In his complaint, Russell asserted that, in 2011, he had initiated a bankruptcy proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama after Redstone and its collections agents, C. Howard Grisham and Jeffery L. Cook, had forced him into bankruptcy based on the 1996 and 1997 state-court judgments. Russell\u2019s complaint then alleged claims of (1) fraud by concealment, in violation \u00f3f Ala.Code \u00a7 6-2-3; (2) fraud by deception; (3) excessive attorney fees at default; (4) \u201cTruth in Lending\u201d; (5) Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.6; (6) the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s \u201cFTC-5 A of the UNFAIR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES\u201d; (7) the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d); and (8) the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d) against Redstone, Grisham, and Cook, based on how they obtained the 1996 and 1997 state-court judgments. Russell also alleged claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against Philip A. Geddes, the bankruptcy trustee in the 2011 bankruptcy proceeding, and Scott Michael Ford, the counsel for the bankruptcy trustee. Russell further alleged claims of negligence against John and Melissa Larsen, his attorneys in the 2011 bankruptcy proceeding. The district court dismissed the complaint against all defendants as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>While the case was pending, Russell moved for \u201cpreliminary injunctive relief\u2019 to stop the foreclosure of his home, and the court denied the motion as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">On appeal, Russell first argues that the district court improperly dismissed his complaint on grounds of <em>res judicata </em>because: (1) in 2011, the bankruptcy court had not mentioned his allegations of fraud or his conflict with the Larsens; (2) he had not previously litigated in state court his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>fraud claim and other issues raised in the instant complaint; (3) the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>only bars claims that could have been litigated when the unlitigated claims were for \u201cinsignificant' matters\u201d; and (4)' <em>res judicata </em>does not bar unlitigated claims involving \u201cfraud, willful and malicious injury to a party, etc.,\u201d because doing so would make the courts a participant in the fraud. Second, he argues that the district court should not have denied his motion for an injunction. Third, Russell argues that he is entitled to the costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The district court dismissed Russell\u2019s complaint sua sponte on res judicata grounds after denying him in forma pauperis status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Jefferson Fourteenth Associates. v. Wometco de Puerto Rico, Inc. </em>695 F.2d 524 (11th Cir.1983), we specifically prohibited a sua sponte dismissal in the following circumstances: (1) the defendant had not filed an answer and, thus, the plaintiff still had a right under Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a) to amend the complaint; (2) the plaintiffs claim was brought in good faith and was not vexatious or patently frivolous; and (3) the district court had provided the plaintiff with neither notice of its intent to dismiss the complaint nor an opportunity to respond. <em>Id. </em>at 527. While Russell\u2019s case is arguably barred by res judicata, the district court lacked authority to dismiss without following the proper procedure. Therefore, we vacate and remand for the court to give Russell notice of its intention to dismiss and to allow him an opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">. Had the court granted IFP status, it could have reviewed the complaint for frivolity, failure to state a claim, etc., under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
