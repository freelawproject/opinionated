Outlaw pleaded guilty of five counts of distribution of cocaine base, and the district court varied upward from the 57-to-71-month guidelines range in imposing concurrent 78-month terms of imprisonment and concurrent three-year periods of supervised release as well as a $1,500 fine. Outlaw has appealed his sentence, contending that the above-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>that the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence imposed were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for procedural error and substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Because Outlaw did not object to the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons for its upward variance, this court\u2019s review of that question is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008)). To show plain error, Outlaw must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it- seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">When the district court imposes a non-guidelines sentence, it must articulate its reasons for the sentence imposed more thoroughly. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005)). Its reasons should be fact-specific and consistent with the statutory sentencing factors. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519). \u201cThe court, however, need not engage in \u2018robotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Lamoreaux, </em>422 F.3d 750, 756 (8th Cir.2005)). Where the record makes the sentencing judge\u2019s reasoning clear and allows for effective review, no further explanation is required'. <em>United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432, 439 (5th Cir.2013) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 359, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Contrary to Outlaw\u2019s assertions on appeal, it was not improper for the district court to consider Outlaw\u2019s criminal history in imposing a non-guidelines sentence. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 709 (citing <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519). The district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and Outlaw\u2019s history and characteristics in determining that a more lengthy sentence was necessary to provide an adequate punishment, to deter future criminal conduct, and to protect the public from Outlaw\u2019s criminality. <em>See id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court\u2019s reasons were adequate, and the seven-month upward variance was not substantively unreasonable. There was no error, plain or otherwise. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
