California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Bergren\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. However, the judgment of conviction contains a clerical error, identifying Bergren\u2019s conviction as a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, instead of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, as charged in Count One of the superseding indictment. Accordingly, the judgment is VACATED and REMANDED to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting this clerical error. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
