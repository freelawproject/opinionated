He contends that he received constitutionally inadequate treatment for an anal fistula. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo, employing the same standard used by the district court. <em>McFaul v. Valenzuela, </em>684 F.3d 564, 571 (5th Cir.2012). A district court \u201cshall grant summary judgment- if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). Where, as in the instant case, the appellees have raised the issue of qualified immunity, the typical summary judgment burden of proof is altered in that once the defense is pleaded by an official, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to rebut the defense by establishing a genuine fact issue as to whether the official\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established federal law. <em>Brown v. Callahan, </em>623 F.3d 249, 253 (5th Cir.2010). It is the plaintiffs burden to negate qualified immunity; however, all inferences are drawn in his favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">The defense of qualified immunity has two prongs: (1) whether an official\u2019s conduct violated a plaintiffs constitutional rights and (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>Id. </em>As an inmate, Lempar had a clearly established Eighth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>right not to be denied, by deliberate indifference, attention to his serious medical needs. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir.2006). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference only if \u201cthe official <em>knows of </em>and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (emphasis in original); <em>see Reeves v. Collins, </em>27 F.3d 174, 176-77 (5th Cir.1994). The plaintiff must establish that the defendants \u201crefused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Lempar\u2019s argument that the district court misapplied the summary judgment standard is without merit. Our exhaustive review of the medical evidence in this case establishes that the appellees were not deliberately indifferent to Lempar\u2019s serious medical needs. Lempar\u2019s complaint that his course of treatment fell below the \u2022applicable standard of care is not supported by the record evidence. His subjective belief that he is suffering from a complex anal fistula with multiple tracts that requires specialized treatment and re-parative surgery is not borne out by the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">There is no disputed fact question that, when resolved in Lempar\u2019s favor, rises to the level of deliberate indifference. Not only was Lempar consistently treated for his conditions, the appellees discussed his care with his family, in person and via letters, and referred him to a board-certified colorectal surgeon, who after two exploratory surgeries found no evidence that he was suffering from a complex anal fistula or that he required specialized treatment. Lempar\u2019s complaints about the quality of wound care, the types of dressings used, and the availability of sitz baths constitute a disagreement over the treatment he received, which does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. Insofar as Lem-par contends that evidence of his noncompliance with certain of the medical recommendations has been fabricated or falsified by the appellees, these are conclusional allegations and unsubstantiated assertions, which do not create a fact issue on summary judgment. <em>See Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 557 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">As there is no evidence of a constitutional violation, we uphold the district court\u2019s determination that those appellees sued in their individual capacities were entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Brown, </em>623 F.3d at 253. Those appellees sued in their official capacities similarly have no liability and were entitled to summary judgment. <em>See Mayfield v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>529 F.3d 599, 604 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
