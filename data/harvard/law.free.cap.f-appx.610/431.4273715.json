Although the district court erred in calculating Appellant\u2019s sentence, the court\u2019s error does not affect Appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">Appellant pleaded guilty to illegal reentry. The PSR calculated a guidelines range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment based on an offense level of 21 and Criminal History Category of IV. Included in the calculation of Appellant\u2019s Criminal History Category was three points for an eight-month sentence imposed in 2002 for a conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Appellant did not object to the calculation of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\">At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, Appellant sought a variance from the district court. In denying Appellant\u2019s request for a variance, the district court stated, \u201cThere will be no variance. The guideline range is reasonable.\u201d The district court sentenced Appellant to 57 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-25\">On appeal, both Appellant and the Government agree that the district court elear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ly erred by assessing criminal history points for a sentence that was imposed more than ten years before the instant 2014 offense. We agree that the district court clearly erred in considering the 2002 conviction in calculating Appellant\u2019s Criminal History Category.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue before this Court is whether the district court\u2019s error affected Appellant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Appellant did not object to the calculation of his criminal history in the district court; therefore, we review the district court\u2019s inclusion of the 2002 sentence for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To show plain error, Appellant must show that the error was clear or obvious and that it affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If he makes such a showing, this Court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">To show that the error affects his substantial rights, Appellant must show \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without the error, Appellant\u2019s criminal history score is six and his Criminal History Category is III.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Combined with his offense level of 21, his correct guidelines range of imprisonment is 46 to 57 months instead of 57 to 71 months. The district court imposed a prison sentence of 57 months, which is at the bottom of the Guidelines range applied by the court and at the top of the properly calculated range. When, as in this case, \u201cthe correct and incorrect ranges overlap and the defendant is sentenced within the overlap, [this court does] not assume, in the absence of additional evidence, that the sentence affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, because Appellant\u2019s sentence fell within both the correct and incorrect Guidelines range, Appellant acknowledges that our controlling caselaw \u201cobliges him to point to \u2018additional evidence\u2019 in the record, other than the difference in ranges, to show an effect on his substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cRecord evidence that the Guidelines range was a \u2018primary factor\u2019 in sentencing may be sufficient \u2018additional evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">We conclude that Appellant has not pointed to sufficient additional evidence in the record to establish that the district court would have likely sentenced Appellant to a lower term of imprisonment had it applied the correct Guidelines range. The district court made no explicit statement suggesting that the incorrect Guidelines range was a primary factor in sentencing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor did the court indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>it was sentencing Appellant to a particular section of the Guidelines range.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the court only stated that the incorrect range was \u201creasonable.\u201d This statement is insufficient for us to say that there is a reasonable probability that Appellant would have received a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, Appellant has not pointed to sufficient additional evidence that his sentence under the correct Guidelines range would be reduced. Because Appellant has not shown how his substantial rights were effected, he has not established plain error warranting reversal by this Court. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
