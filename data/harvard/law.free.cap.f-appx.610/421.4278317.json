Carrick sued after he was terminated from Southwestern Bell for poor job performance and his grievance was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The district court dismissed Carrick\u2019s suit after it determined that Carrick had brought a claim that the defendants violated only \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158, and that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had exclusive jurisdiction. The district court added that to the extent that Carrick sought to appeal the NLRB\u2019s decision dismissing his charge that the CWA failed in its duty of representation, such an appeal had to be made directly \u201cto the relevant court of appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo. <em>Asadi v. G.E. Energy (USA), L.L.C., </em>720 F.3d 620, 622 (5th Cir.2013). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate if a claim is subject to federal preemption. <em>Simmons v. Sabine River Auth. La., </em>732 F.3d 469, 473 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1876, 188 L.Ed.2d 912 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">Section 8(d) of the NLRA mandates that employers and unions bargain in good faith over \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). In <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 244-45, 79 S.Ct. 773, 3 L.Ed.2d 775 (1959), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[wjhen an activity is arguably subject to \u00a7 7 or \u00a7 8 of the [NLRA], the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the [NLRB] if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\u201d Carrick argues that the district court erred when it determined that it lacked jurisdiction over his complaint because his complaint alleged a duty of fair representation (DFR) claim, as well as a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) claim, and that both claims constituted a claim for \u201cUnfair Labor Practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-y\">Carrick may not urge a DFR or CBA claim in addition to his \u00a7 8(d) claim at this juncture. <em>See Hopkins v. Cornerstone Am., </em>545 F.3d 338, 347 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Hotard v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>286 F.3d 814, 818 (5th Cir.2002). Given that Carrick argued a violation of \u00a7 8(d) only, the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was proper. <em>See Garmon, </em>359 U.S. at 245, 79 S.Ct. 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">Even if this court were to consider Car-rick\u2019s DFR claim against CWA, and deem his suit a hybrid, <em>see United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 61-62, 66, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981), it is time barred because the most recent events of which he complains occurred in 2010. <em>See DelCostello v. Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 171, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Barrett v. Ebasco Constructors, Inc., </em>868 F.2d 170, 171 (5th Cir.1989). To the extent that Carrick \u201cdisagrees\u201d with the district court\u2019s statement that if he wished to appeal the NLRB\u2019s decision, he had to appeal \u201cto the relevant court of appeals,\u201d his argument is unavailing. <em>See NLRB v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 23, </em>484 U.S. 112, 118-19, 108 S.Ct. 413, 98 L.Ed.2d 429 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
