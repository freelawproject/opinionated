After review,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the two-year term of supervised release. The district court considered, among the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, that Hodo\u2019s repeated violations of her previous terms of unsupervised release indicated she needed more supervised release. <em>See United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cDefendants who violate the conditions of their supervised release are the defendants most in need of more supervised release.\u201d) Although the Government requested the district court not to impose a term of supervised release, the district court was not constrained by the Government\u2019s request. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>132 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cThat the sentencing court is not bound by the parties\u2019 agreements or recommendations is well settled.\u201d). Hodo has not met her burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>establishing that her sentence to a new term of supervised release was \u201cunreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). We accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-19\">. Hodo does not challenge her sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-25\">. We review the substantive unreasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
