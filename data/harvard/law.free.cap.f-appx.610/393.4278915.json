For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Stanley McWilliams (\u201cMcWilliams\u201d) is the President of Red Point Development, Inc. (\u201cRed Point\u201d), which in turn is the sole general partner of Race Street Properties, L.P. (\u201cRace Street\u201d). In 2009, National Farm Life Insurance Company (\u201cNFLIC\u201d), a Texas life insurance company, loaned Race Street $1,162,500 for a construction project, and McWilliams personally guaranteed the loan. In doing so, McWilliams signed a Note and Guaranty on the loan. In 2010, Race Street defaulted on the loan. NFLIC then accelerated the debt and foreclosed on the collateral securing the loan. Because the foreclosure proceeds did not satisfy the loan balance, NFLIC sued McWilliams, Race Street, and Red Point in state court for the deficiency. The parties settled in 2011, and the state court entered an Agreed Final Judgment in the amount of $874,768.19, broken out as follows: $781,086.95 for the loan deficiency, $18,681.24 for pre-judgment interest, and $75,000 for \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">McWilliams then filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, attempting to discharge the Agreed Final Judgment. Seeking to protect its judgment, NFLIC initiated an adversary proceeding. After a three-day bench trial, the bankruptcy court found that because McWilliams had obtained the loan from NFLIC by fraud, the judgment was nondischargeable. The bankruptcy court then entered a final judgment against McWilliams and awarded NFLIC costs and $99,177.87 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred during the adversary proceeding, which it calculated by taking 10 percent of the Agreed Final Judgment of $874,768.19 plus post-judgment interest of $117,010.51. This calculation was apparently based on a provision of the note on the loan providing that attorney\u2019s fees and costs would generally be calculated as \u201c10% of all amounts due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">McWilliams timely appealed the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the Northern District of Texas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158, and the district court affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">\u201cThis Court reviews the decision of a district court, sitting as an appellate court, by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.\u201d <em>In re SI Restructuring, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 131, 134-35 (5th Cir.2008). We thus review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 135. In Texas, the meaning of an ambiguous con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>tract is a question of fact. <em>Coker v. Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d 391, 394 (Tex.1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">A creditor that successfully contests the dischargeability of its claim in an adversary proceeding under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees if it has a contractual right to them under state law. <em>In re Luce, </em>960 F.2d 1277, 1286 (5th Cir.1992). Here, McWilliams does not dispute NFLIC\u2019s entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 the Note and Guaranty expressly provide for their recovery in these circumstances \u2014 but he does dispute the amount of fees that the bankruptcy court awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">As relevant here, the Note provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">If this note or any instrument securing or collateral to it is given to an attorney for collection or enforcement, or if suit is brought for collection or enforcement, or if it is collected or enforced through probate, bankruptcy, or other judicial proceeding, then Maker shall pay Payee all costs of collection and enforcement, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs, paid to an attorney who is not an employee of Payee, in addition to other amounts due. Reasonable attorney\u2019s fees shall be 10% of all amounts due unless either party pleads otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Similarly, the Guaranty provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOh\">The term <em>\u201cGuaranteed Indebtedness </em>\u201d as used herein, includes (a) all indebtedness of every kind and character, without limit as to amount, whether now existing or hereafter arising, of Borrower to Creditor, regardless of whether evidenced by notes, drafts, acceptances, discounts, overdrafts, or otherwise, and whether such indebtedness be fixed, contingent, joint, several, or joint and several, including to [sic] not limited to that one certain Real Estate Lien Note in the principal amount of $1,162,500.00, dated July 27, 2009, executed by Race Street Properties, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, made payable to National Farm Life Insurance Company; (b) interest on any of the indebtedness described in (a) preceding; (c) any and all costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses suffered by Creditor by reason of Borrower\u2019s default in payment of any of the foregoing indebtedness; and (d) any renewal or extension of the indebtedness, costs, or expenses described in (a) through (c) preceding, or any part thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">McWilliams contends that because the Agreed Final Judgment issued by the state court included $75,000 for \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d \u2014 an amount equal to 9.4 percent of the original loan deficiency plus interest \u2014 the bankruptcy court erred in awarding NFLIC attorney\u2019s fees equal to 10 percent of the entire Agreed Final Judgment. Whether McWilliams is correct turns on the proper definition of the term \u201call amounts due\u201d in the fee provision. We find this phrase to be ambiguous in this context, and thus its interpretation is a question of fact. <em>See Coker, </em>650 S.W.2d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">The Note states that if it \u201cis collected or enforced through ... bankruptcy,\u201d the debtor owes \u201c[rjeasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d which shall be \u201c10% of all amounts due.\u201d The bankruptcy court, adhering to the principle that \u201cseparate documents executed at the same time, for the same purpose, and in the course of the same transaction are to be construed together,\u201d <em>Jim Walter Homes, Inc. v. Schuenemann, </em>668 S.W.2d 324, 327 (Tex.1984), appears to have looked to the Guaranty\u2019s definition of Guaranteed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Indebtedness \u2014 the total amount that McWilliams agreed to pay NFLIC \u2014 to construe \u201call amounts due.\u201d Effectively, the bankruptcy court viewed the terms \u201cGuaranteed Indebtedness\u201d and \u201call amounts due\u201d as synonymous. And McWilliams agreed that his Guaranteed Indebtedness would include \u201cany and all costs, attorney\u2019s \u25a0 fees, and expenses suffered by Creditor by reason of Borrower\u2019s default.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> So even though the Agreed Final Judgment included an agreed-on sum purportedly attributable to attorney\u2019s fees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the time the bankruptcy court assessed attorney\u2019s fees under the Note\u2019s fee provision, the bankruptcy court found that the entire Agreed Final Judgment (plus post-judgment interest) constituted McWilliams\u2019s Guaranteed Indebtedness and thus \u201call amounts due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We find that the bankruptcy court\u2019s fac-' tual determination of the contract term\u2019s meaning was not clearly erroneous. Other provisions in the Note and Guaranty, moreover, support that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">For example, both the Guaranty and the Note contemplate that McWilliams will be liable for attorney\u2019s fees through whatever proceedings are required to collect or enforce the debt, including bankruptcy. Note (\u201cIf this note or any instrument securing or collateral to it ... is collected or enforced through ... bankruptcy ..., then Maker shall pay Payee all costs of collection and enforcement, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees[.]\u201d); Guaranty (providing that Guaranteed Indebtedness includes \u201cany and all costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses suffered by Creditor by reason of Borrower\u2019s default\u201d). Nothing indicates that in the Agreed Final Judgment, NFLIC somehow waived its entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees that it might incur in further proceedings needed to collect or enforce the debt. In other words, we see no reason to infer that the parties intended to permit McWilliams to discharge his responsibility for attorney\u2019s fees halfway through the collection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The Guaranty also contemplates that McWilliams\u2019s indebtedness would survive any number of changes in form. It provides that-his indebtedness would not be \u201creleased, diminished, impaired, reduced, or affected\u201d by, among other things, \u201cany release, surrender, exchange, subordination, ... any partial release of the liability of Guarantor, ... any renewal, extension, and/or rearrangement of the payment ..., or any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, or compromise that may be granted or given by Creditor to Borrower of [sic] Guarantor.\u201d As the bankruptcy court noted, this provision indicates that the Agreed Final Judgment (however characterized) did not diminish McWilliams\u2019s obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees of 10 percent of his entire obligation to NFLIC at the time of enforcement \u2014 even though he had agreed, in the Agreed Final Judgment, to an increase in his total indebtedness by some amount potentially attributable to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">In sum, when read together, the Note and Guaranty indicate that McWilliams agreed to pay attorney\u2019s fees of 10 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of his total indebtedness to NFLIC at the time NFLIC collected or enforced the debt. We thus decline to disturb the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings and attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">. The parties agree that Texas law applies to the underlying contract construction issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\">. Although the Guaranty provides that McWilliams would owe \u201cany and all costs, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses suffered by Creditor by reason of Borrower's default,\u201d the bankruptcy court construed the Note and Guaranty together and found that the parties intended to cap NFLIC\u2019s attorney's fees at 10 percent (unless NFLIC pleaded extra fees, and the bankruptcy court found that it did not).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">. As the district court pointed out, the bankruptcy court \u201cnoted that the $75,000 for which the parties designated as \u2018attorney's fees' 'may or ... may not have been' the amount of attorneys' fees that were actually incurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
