He asserts that he has no knowledge of any strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In 2001, the Northern District of Texas concluded that Fox had a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits and sanctioned Fox by prohibiting him from filing any future litigation in the Northern District of Texas without first obtaining permission. In dismissing the instant case, the district court relied on that earlier district court\u2019s order to determine that the instant complaint was barred under \u00a7 1915(g). However, this 2001 order is not a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), and there is no record of any other cases where Fox, \u201cwhile incarcerated or detained in any facility,\u201d brought \u201can action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it [was] frivolous, malicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Therefore, the district court erred in determining that Fox had three strikes at the time he filed the instant lawsuit and in concluding that Fox was barred under \u00a7 1915(g) from proceeding IFP. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
