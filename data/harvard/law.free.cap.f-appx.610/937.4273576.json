He now appeals <em>pro se </em>the denial of a motion for a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Guidelines. The district court denied the motion: Clayton\u2019s career-offender status precluded a sentence reduction. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission and \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). A reduction of a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) when the retroactive guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The district court committed no error in denying Clayton a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Amendment 782 reduced-by two-the base offense levels for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, amend. 782. But Clayton was sentenced using the offense level and guideline range for career offenders in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and <em>not </em>the offense level for drug quantity in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Amendment 782 resulted in no lowering of Clayton\u2019s guideline range; Clayton is ineligible for section 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Clayton\u2019s reliance on <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), is misplaced. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether defendants who entered into plea agreements recommending a particular sentence, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C), were eligible for a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2). Here, Clayton\u2019s plea agreement contained no agreed-upon sentence or guidelines range. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Because Clayton\u2019s guideline range remained unchanged as a result of Amendment 782, no ex post facto violation occurred. <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2013) (no ex post facto problem exists \u201c[s]o long as the effect of post-conduct amendments to the guidelines is not to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment beyond what it would have been without those amendments.\u201d). And the district court committed no error in treating U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as binding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
