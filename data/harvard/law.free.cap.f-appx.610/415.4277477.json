He claims that the district court erred by imposing the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on its determination that his 2006 conviction of aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>assault with a deadly weapon under N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 30-3-2(A) and 30-3-l(B) (West 1978) does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d (\u201cCOV\u201d) because it is neither an enumerated offense nor has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s characterization of an offense as a COV. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2005). Munoz\u2019s conviction qualifies as a COV because apprehension-causing aggravated assault creates a sufficient threat of physical force to constitute a COV. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 195-99 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Silva, </em>608 F.3d 663, 670-73 (10th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Licon-Nunez, </em>230 Fed.Appx. 448, 451-52 (5th Cir.2007). Therefore, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
