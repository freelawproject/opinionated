A judge of this Court granted King a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkZ\">Whether Mr. King\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) because <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151 [186 L.Ed.2d 314] (2013), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276 [186 L.Ed.2d 438] (2013), are retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARy\">After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a \u00a7 2255 motion is time-barred. <em>Drury v. United States, </em>507 F.3d 1295, 1296 (11th Cir.2007). The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion that begins to run from the latest of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,\u201d or \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), (3). Any court may determine that a Supreme Court decision applies retroactively for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(3). <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1278 (11th Cir.2004), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>545 U.S. 353, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">When a Supreme Court decision results in a new constitutional rule, this rule applies to all criminal cases pending on direct review but applies to convictions that are already final only in limited circumstances. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). In deciding retroactivity issues under \u00a7 2255(f)(3), a court must first find whether the Supreme Court decision in question announced a \u201cnew rule.\u201d <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 300-01, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989); <em>Howard v. United States, </em>374 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir.2004). If a court determines that a Supreme Court decision announces a new constitutional rule, it must then determine whether that new rule satisfies an exception to the general prohibition against the retroactive application of new rules to cases on collateral review. <em>See Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 305-10, 109 S.Ct. 1060. New substantive rules generally apply retroactively, while new rules of criminal procedure generally do not. <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">A rule is substantive, as opposed to procedural, if it \u201cnarrow[s] the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>or is a \u201cconstitutional determination! ] that placets] particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State\u2019s power to punish.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 351-54, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (explaining that a new rule modifying the elements of an offense is normally substantive because new elements \u201calter the range of conduct the statute punishes, rendering some formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa\u201d); <em>see also Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1278 (11th Cir.2013). New substantive rules apply retroactively because they \u201cnecessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">New rules of criminal procedure, by contrast, are those that \u201cregulate only the manner of determining the defendant\u2019s culpability,\u201d such as by allocating decision-making authority as to who must find the \u201cessential facts bearing on punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (emphasis omitted). New rules of procedure \u201cdo not produce a class of person convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal, but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519. Procedural rules thus produce a \u201cmore speculative connection to innocence\u201d than do substantive rules, and courts give retroactive effect to \u201conly a. small set of watershed rules of criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311-12, 109 S.Ct. 1060. The Supreme Court has explained that in order to qualify as a watershed rule, a decision must satisfy two requirements. First, it must \u201calter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\u201d <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 418, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) (quotation omitted); <em>see Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060. Second, it must announce a rule \u201cwithout which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (quotation omitted) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">In <em>AUeyne, </em>the Supreme Court revisited two of its prior cases: (1) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which requires that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than the fact of a prior conviction, be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), which held that judicial factfinding that increased the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence was permissible under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2157-58. In <em>AUeyne, </em>the Supreme Court expressly overturned <em>Harris </em>because it was inconsistent with its decision in <em>Apprendi, </em>and it determined that any facts that, by law, increase the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence for a crime constitutes an element of the crime that must be submitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 2155, 2163.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In <em>Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>we said that <em>\u201cAUeyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review.\u201d 757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014) (reviewing the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition and the application of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause). We explained that \u201cneither <em>Al-leyne </em>itself nor any later Supreme Court decision [held] that <em>AUeyne </em>is retroactive,\u201d and that in fact the <em>AUeyne </em>Court had explained that its holding was an application of the <em>Apprendi </em>rule. <em>Id. </em>We then noted that we had repeatedly held that the <em>Apprendi </em>rule did not apply retroactively on collateral review, and, thus, \u201cneither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>[does] a decision applying its rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1285-86; <em>see, e.g., McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"A7l\"><em>Descamps </em>addressed the process for determining whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a violent felony for purposes of enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-82. The <em>Descamps </em>Court recounted that a court may, in the case of a \u201cdivisible\u201d statute (that is, one that sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative), apply a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d to determine which of the statutory alternatives formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for purposes of determining whether a prior conviction is a predicate conviction for an enhanced sentence. <em>See id. </em>However, <em>Descamps </em>held that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach to prior convictions under \u201cindivisible\u201d statutes, meaning statutes that have a \u201csingle, indivisible set of elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, such indivisible statutes must be analyzed using the categorical approach, meaning that courts compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction with the elements of the generic crime. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Descamps </em>Court discussed <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), which had adopted a \u201cformal categorical approach,\u201d and explained that <em>Taylor </em>recognized a hypothetical \u201cnarrow range of cases\u201d \u2014 involving statutes with alternative elements, or divisible statutes \u2014 in which sentencing courts would use a modified categorical approach to look beyond the statutory elements of a conviction. <em>See </em>133 S.Ct. at 2283-84 (quotation omitted). The <em>Descamps </em>Court explained that the hypothetical type of cases discussed in <em>Taylor </em>became real in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), which \u201cauthorized sentencing courts to scrutinize a restricted set of materials\u201d to decide whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction under a divisible burglary statute qualified as an ACCA predicate conviction. 133 S.Ct. at 2284. The <em>Descamps </em>Court explained that its caselaw involving the categorical approach and modified categorical approach involving the ACCA \u201call but resolve[d]\u201d the instant case because, applying the modified categorical approach in \u201cthe only way [it has] ever allowed ... merely helps implement the categorical approach when a defendant was c1nvicted of violating a divisible statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2283-85, 2287-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In this case, as in <em>Jeanty, Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable, on collateral review. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1285-86. Although King argues that <em>Jeanty </em>is distinguishable because it only addressed the \u201cjury component\u201d of the <em>Alleyne </em>rule and not the \u201creasonable doubt component,\u201d this argument is meritless because <em>Alleyne </em>announced a single holding \u2014 that a fact that increases the statutory minimum sentence is an element of the crime. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2163. <em>Alleyne </em>did not announce separate rules about jury submission or the standard of proof, as both are merely consequences of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding that facts are elements of the crime if they increase the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 2155. Further, our opinion in <em>Jeanty </em>did not distinguish between portions of <em>Alleyne, </em>but rather addressed its retroactivity generally. <em>See Jeanty, </em>757 F.3d at 1284-86. Thus, <em>Alleyne </em>is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">As for <em>Descamps, </em>it is not a new rule. It merely applied prior precedent to reaffirm that courts may not use the modified categorical approach to determine whether convictions under indivisible statutes are predicate ACCA violent felonies. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-85. <em>Des-camps </em>is thus unlike other Supreme Court decisions construing the phrases \u201cviolent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>felony\u201d or \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and limiting the types of convictions that qualify as such, which did pronounce new substantive rules. <em>See Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (narrowing one portion of the definition of a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender guidelines); <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) (narrowly construing \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA to exclude failure to report for incarceration as qualifying as an escape from a penal institution); <em>Zack v. Tucker, </em>704 F.3d 917, 925-26 (11th Cir.) (stating that both <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>apply retroactively on collateral review), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 156, 187 L.Ed.2d 109 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">For these reasons, neither <em>Alleyne </em>nor <em>Descamps </em>apply retroactively on collateral' review as required by \u00a7 2255(h)(2), and, thus, King\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was not timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
