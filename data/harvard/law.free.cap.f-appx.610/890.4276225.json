In sentencing him for those offenses, the district court used the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines Manual to determine that he had ten criminal history points: seven points based on his prior convictions, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a)-(c) (2008); two points because he committed the offenses of conviction while on parole for another offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(d) (2008); and one \u201crecency\u201d point because he committed the offenses of conviction less than two years after he had been released from imprisonment, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(e) (2008). Ten criminal history points meant that Jones-Tidwell\u2019s criminal history category was V. The court sentenced Jones-Tidwell to 42 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. His term of supervised release began in February 2012, and jurisdiction over his case was transferred to the Northern District of Georgia in November 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">In 2014, a probation officer petitioned the district court to revoke Jones-Tidwell\u2019s supervised release. At the revocation hearing, the district court calculated an advisory guidelines range of 18 to 24 months imprisonment, which it based on a criminal history category of V \u2014 the criminal history category applicable at the time Jones-Tidwell was originally sentenced\u2014 and a violation grade of B. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). It then sentenced Jones-Tid-well to 18 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Jones-Tidwell contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the court erroneously calculated his advisory guidelines range based on a criminal history category of V. He relies on the fact that, in 2010, the Sentencing Commission prospectively eliminated the consideration of recency points under the former \u00a7 4Al.l(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 742 (2010); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(e) (2010) (showing that Amendment 742 does not apply retroactively). Without that recency point, Jones-Tidwell would have had only nine criminal history points and a criminal history category of IV when he was originally sentenced. He argues that, in light of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s elimination of recency points, the court should have recalculated his criminal history category at his revocation hearing and sentenced him based on an advisory guidelines range of 12 to 18 months instead of 18 to 24 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). We review the procedural reasonableness of Jones-Tidwell\u2019s sentence only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Jones-Tidwell\u2019s argument is meritless. The district court did not recalculate his criminal history category for purposes of imposing a revocation sentence because the sentencing guidelines specifically instruct that \u201c[t]he criminal history category is not to be recalculated\u201d for purposes of imposing a revocation sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4 cmt. n. 1. In calculating Jones-Tidwell\u2019s advisory guidelines range based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>on a criminal history category of V, the district court did exactly as the sentencing guidelines say to do: It used the criminal history category \u201capplicable at the time [Jones-Tidwell] was originally sentenced to a term of supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Facing an uphill battle, Jones-Tidwell acknowledges that \u201ca formalistic reading of the text of [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 7B1.4 might suggest that the district court need not entertain subsequent favorable changes in the guidelines affecting the criminal history score when a defendant is sentenced\u201d for violating the conditions of his supervised release. Nonetheless, he contends that the district court abused its discretion in doing exactly as \u00a7 7B1.4 says for two reasons. First, he argues that the district court\u2019s failure to recalculate his criminal history score violated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll\u2019s instruction that the court \u201cuse the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced,\u201d which in his case was the 2013 Guidelines Manual. But the court did use the 2013 Guidelines Manual in imposing Jones-Tidwell\u2019s revocation sentence, and that manual specifically instructs courts not to recalculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a) &amp; cmt. n. 1 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Second, Jones-Tidwell argues that the court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5)\u2019s instruction that the court consider relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and he quotes at length the commentary accompanying the amendment that eliminated recency points. That argument fails too. Although the district court was free to consider the elimination of recency points under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5) as a basis for a downward variance, Jones-Tidwell did not request a downward variance, and, even if he had, the court would not have been required to grant one. The court did not abuse its discretion in using a criminal history category of V to calculate Jones-Tidwell\u2019s advisory guidelines range at his revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
