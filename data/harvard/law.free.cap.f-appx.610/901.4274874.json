The district court treated Diggs\u2019s motion as a request for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and denied the motion as untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). Because the district court should have construed Diggs\u2019s motion as seeking to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we vacate and remand for the district court to determine whether Diggs is entitled to an out-of-time appeal on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to comply with Diggs\u2019s instruction to pursue a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Diggs entered an agreement to plead guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)-(iii), 846. The plea agreement stated that Diggs \u201cface[d], due to a prior drug felony conviction, a minimum of twenty years imprisonment,\u201d <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); \u201cthe sentence imposed [was] left solely to the discretion of the District Court;\u201d and Diggs and the government \u201creserve[d] the right to appeal any sentence imposed.\u201d Diggs\u2019s presentence investigation report provided that Diggs had an offense level of 34 and, with a criminal history score of VI, had an advisory guideline range of 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. The government moved for a downward departure based on Diggs\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (Nov.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">On January 14, 2014, the district court granted the motion of the government and departed downward to sentence Diggs to 10 years of imprisonment. The district court advised Diggs that he had a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>appeal; twice remarked to Diggs that he had to file his notice of appeal within 14 days; and urged Diggs to \u201ctalk with [his] lawyer ... to make sure that [he] ha[d] a clear understanding of whether [Diggs] [did] or [did] not wish to appeal....\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). The district court also advised trial counsel to either \u201cfile the notice and go forward\u201d or to \u201cwrite [Diggs] a letter to make sure that there is no misunderstanding and to bring home the importance of the decision.\u201d The district court explained that, if Diggs chose to appeal, his attorney could file a notice of appeal or \u201c[t]he clerk of court [could] file a notice at [Diggs\u2019s] request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">On January 22, 2014, Diggs submitted a letter to the district court that requested a reduction of his sentence. The district court interpreted the letter as seeking reconsideration of Diggs\u2019s sentence and denied relief on January 28, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">On May 28, 2014, Diggs filed <em>pro se </em>a motion for leave to file an out-of-time appeal. In the motion, Diggs alleged that he was \u201cdenied the opportunity to file a direct appeal because of his trial counsel\u2019s failure to fulfill his ... duty to consult with [Diggs] about [an] appeal[ ] ... even though [Diggs] was clear in communica-tin[g] to his counsel the desire to file a direct appeal in the case.\u201d Because Diggs, \u201cbeing untrained in the law, [did not] know ... the correct method ... to request an Out-of-Time appeal ..., [he] move[d] the Court to accept this Motion or to look behind the title of this Motion and to apply such vehicle as [would] permit [his] journey to a direct appeal.\u201d Diggs reiterated that, \u201c[i]f ... this Motion ... is not sufficient for the Court to act, ... [that it] look behind the title of the motion and rechar-acterize it as such pleading as will permit the Court to act thereon.\u201d Diggs also \u201cspecifically move[d] the Court to rechar-acterize this action as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 should that be the case; as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 appears to be the most correct method by which to raise this issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">The district court treated Diggs\u2019s motion as requesting an extension of time to file an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4), and denied that motion as untimely. The district court ruled that Diggs failed to move for an extension of time within 30 days of the time to file a notice of appeal, whether that deadline was calculated from the entry of his sentence or the denial of his motion for reconsideration. Even if \u201cDiggs\u2019s allegation that he clearly communicated to his attorney that he wished to appeal\u201d were true and \u201cwould constitute excusable neglect for good cause,\u201d the district court explained, Rule 4(b)(4) \u201cprohibited] an extension of the length Mr. Diggs ... requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the conclusions of law by&gt; the district court in a proceeding for postconviction relief. <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">The district court misconstrued Diggs\u2019s motion. The district court failed to construe a pleading filed by Diggs, a <em>pro se </em>litigant, liberally, <em>Winthrop-Redin v. United States, </em>767 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2014), and to \u201cdetermine whether [Diggs\u2019s] motion [was], in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework,\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Diggs sought an out-of-time appeal on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal, which federal courts adjudicate routinely in a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Otero v. United States, </em>499 F.3d 1267 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>433 F.3d 788; <em>Montemoino v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 416 (11th Cir.1995). And the district court ignored Diggs\u2019s explicit entreaties to \u201clook behind the title of [ ]his Motion\u201d and \u201crecharacterize [ ]his action as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u201d because that \u201cappeared] to be the most correct method by which to raise [ ]his issue.\u201d Diggs alleged that he was \u201cdenied the opportunity to file a direct appeal because of his trial counsel\u2019s failure\u201d to file a notice of appeal. \u201cWhen a defendant loses the opportunity to appeal due to constitutionally defective counsel, ... [he should be] put ... back in the position he would have been in had his lawyer filed a timely notice of appeal.\u201d <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1331 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If trial counsel ignored Diggs\u2019s \u201cclear ... [instruction] to file a direct appeal,\u201d he is entitled to the \u201centry of a new judgment for the purpose of permitting the perfection of an appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1330 (citing <em>Rodriquez v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 327, 332, 89 S.Ct. 1715, 1718, 23 L.Ed.2d 340 (1969)), regardless of whether \u201cthere would have been any viable grounds for an appeal,\u201d <em>Montemoino, </em>68 F.3d at 417. Because the district court erred when it failed to treat Diggs\u2019s motion as filed under section 2255, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">We VACATE the decision that treated Diggs\u2019s motion as requesting an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and denied that motion as untimely. We REMAND with instructions for the district court to construe Diggs\u2019s motion as seeking to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and to conduct further proceedings to determine whether Diggs\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal, which would entitle Diggs to an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
