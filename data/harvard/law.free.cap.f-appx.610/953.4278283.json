Pratts challenges the four-level increase in his offense level for possessing or transferring a firearm with knowledge that it would be shipped outside the United States. United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(A) (Nov. 2014). We affirm.'</p>\n<p id=\"b981-20\">The district court did not clearly err by enhancing Pratts\u2019s sentence. A defendant is subject to a four-level increase in his offense level if he \u201cpossessed or transferred [the] firearm ... with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be transported out of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A confidential informant arranged to purchase a firearm from Pratts and recorded their transaction. That recording reflects that, while the informant inspected the firearm, he twice stated that he purchased firearms to \u201csend them to Mexico,\u201d and that Pratts replied, \u201cOh ok,\u201d and then wrapped up the firearm, carried it to the informant\u2019s vehicle, and accepted payment. Pratts knew or had reason to believe that the firearm would be exported when he transferred it to the informant. <em>See United States v. Asante, </em>782 F.3d 639, 646 n. 5 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-21\">We AFFIRM Pratts\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
