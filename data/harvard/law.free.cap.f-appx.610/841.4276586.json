Nolley, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of AT &amp; T Services, Inc. (\u201cAT &amp; T Services\u201d) and Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc. (\u201cSedgwick\u201d), in her civil action alleging wrongful termination of long term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits, brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a). On appeal, Nolley argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment on her ERISA claims because: (1) Sedgwick\u2019s decision to terminate her LTD benefits was <em>\u201cde novo </em>\u201d wrong; (2) Sedgwick was not vested with discretionary authority to review claims; and (3) Sedgwick\u2019s decision was not supported by reasonable grounds. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling affirming a plan administrator\u2019s ERISA benefits decision <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1354 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">Under ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions, a plan participant may bring a civil action against the plan administrator to recover wrongfully denied benefits due to her under the terms of the plan. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1). Although ERISA itself does not provide any standards for judicial review of a plan administrator\u2019s benefits determination, the Supreme Court has articulated a framework for judicial review, which we have distilled into a six-part test. <em>Melech v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>739 F.3d 663, 672 (11th Cir.2014). Thus, a court reviewing a plan administrator\u2019s benefits decision should conduct the following multi-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-17\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-6\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-7\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-9\"><em>Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">In tackling the first prong of the six-part test, we review the administrator\u2019s decision for correctness, based upon the evidence before the administrator at the time of its benefits decision. <em>Melech, </em>739 F.3d at 672. If we would have reached the same decision as the administrator, the judicial inquiry ends, and judgment in favor of the administrator is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">In this case, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on Nolley\u2019s ERISA claims because Sedgwick\u2019s decision to terminate Nolley\u2019s LTD benefits was not <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong.\u201d As the record shows, Sedgwick based its adverse benefits decision on the fact that Nolley no longer met the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisabled,\u201d and the record reveals that it relied on the judgment of independent professionals in reaching this conclusion. Although Nolley\u2019s psychiatrist concluded that she was incapable of working due to her depression, his progress notes indicate that the majority of her cognitive processes were within normal limits. Furthermore, Sedgwick retained multiple independent physician advisors to review Nolley\u2019s medical records and assess whether she possessed any work capacity, and each of them concluded that there were no objective findings substantiating the conclusion that she was unable to work. As a result, the record supports Sedgwick\u2019s conclusion that Nolley no longer met the Plan\u2019s definition of \u201cdisabled,\u201d and we cannot say that Sedgwick\u2019s termination of her benefits was <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Nor can we find error in Sedgwick\u2019s benefits decision simply because it denied her claim for LTD benefits based on her failure to furnish objective medical evidence of her disability. The relevant Plan document specifically provided that LTD benefits would terminate if Nolley failed to furnish objective medical evidence demonstrating the continuing nature of her disability, and the claims administrator may rely on such a provision in making its determination to terminate benefits. Moreover, a representative of Sedgwick actually informed Nolley and her treating psychiatrist of the need to provide objective medical evidence of her disability; notified them that her treating psychiatrist\u2019s treatment records were deficient in this respect; clarified that the requisite objective medical evidence should support the conclusion that Nolley was not capable of performing any occupational duties; and then provided an example of the type of evidence that might suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">In short, based on the record available to Sedgwick at the time it terminated Nol-ley\u2019s LTD benefits, we cannot conclude that its decision was wrong. Because we have not concluded that Sedgwick\u2019s bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>fits-denial decision was \u201cwrong,\u201d our judicial inquiry has ended, and we must affirm. <em>See Melech, </em>739 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
