All but one of Scott\u2019s claims have previously been denied or dismissed. His one remaining claim challenges the validity of his conviction for sexual battery. In that claim, Scott argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges during voir dire to excuse potential jurors on the basis of race. The district court dismissed the claim on its merits. We granted Scott a certificate of appealability on his claim that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make an objection under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-23\">\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact and are governed by \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Clark v. Thaler, </em>673 F.3d 410, 416 (5th Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), a federal court must defer to a state habeas court\u2019s determination of the merits of a prisoner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>claims, unless the state court decision to deny relief \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1). On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s legal rulings de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Clark, </em>673 F.3d at 417. We then apply \u00a7 2254(d)(1) deference to determine whether the petitioner was entitled to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from using peremptory strikes against prospective jurors solely on account of their race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 84, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The Court held in <em>Vasquez v. Hillery, </em>474 U.S. 254, 261-64, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986), that discrimination on the basis of race in the selection of grand jurors is a form of structural error that voids a conviction. Since \u201c[t]he basic principles prohibiting exclusion of persons from participation in jury service on account of their race are essentially the same for grand juries and for petit juries,\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 84 n. 3, 106 S.Ct. 1712 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), it follows that a <em>Batson </em>violation would be a structural error. In this case, however, we must keep two things in mind. First, although it was determined that Scott had made out a prima facie <em>Batson </em>claim, no purposeful <em>Batson </em>violation has been proven here. Second, Scott presented his claim not as a <em>Batson </em>claim but as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a prisoner must show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Strickland </em>does not require us to address its deficient-performance and prejudice prongs in any certain order, <em>see id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 and we turn first to the prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Citing <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>535 U.S. 685, 694-98, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002), <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659 &amp; n. 25, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984), <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052 and <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 345-50, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), Scott argues that there is a narrow category of cases in which prejudice is presumed. However, the situations that justified a presumption of prejudice in the cases cited by Scott are not present in this case, and Scott makes no attempt to argue otherwise. Additionally, this court has declined to \u201chold that a structural error alone is sufficient to warrant a presumption of prejudice in the ineffective assistance of counsel context.\u201d <em>Virgil v. Dretke, </em>446 F.3d 598, 607 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, prejudice is not presumed, and Scott was required to show that his counsel\u2019s failure to raise <em>Batson </em>objections during voir dire prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Virgil, </em>446 F.3d at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Scott asserts that, because counsel failed to make a timely <em>Batson </em>objection, the State was allowed to use its peremptory challenges to eliminate black prospective jurors from the petit jury. \u201cIn assessing prejudice under <em>Strickland, </em>the question is not whether a court can be certain counsel\u2019s performance had no effect on the outcome\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 111, 131 S.Ct. 770, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Instead, the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice inquiry looks to \u201cwhether it is reasonably likely the result [of the proceeding] would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he likelihood of a different result must be substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tial, not just conceivable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. The Supreme Court has not held that prejudice is presumed in an ineffective assistance of counsel case based upon failing to make a meritorious <em>Batson </em>objection. Thus, arguably, the Louisiana courts have not \u201cunreasonably] [applied] clearly established Federal law, <em>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States </em>\u201d to this issue in Scott\u2019s case. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In any event, this case does not involve the failure to make a meritorious <em>Batson </em>objection. Here, the state court record reveals a race-neutral basis for each peremptory strike by the State of an' African American venireperson, although not, as Scott argues it should have been, in a <em>Batson </em>hearing following a defense lawyer objection. Nonetheless, the reasons are present in the actual voir dire record, as painstakingly examined and explained by the State in its brief. Thus, prejudice has not been shown because the <em>Batson </em>challenge would not have been successful. Scott has not met his burden of showing <em>Strickland </em>prejudice. Therefore we need not consider the deficient-performance prong, and his <em>Strickland </em>claim fails. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Scott thus has not shown that the state habeas court\u2019s denial of this claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Finally, the district court held an evi-dentiary hearing in this case. Citing <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>563 U.S. 170, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1398-99, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), Scott argues that the district court was precluded from considering any new evidence adduced at that hearing. Scott is correct that the district court\u2019s review of his \u00a7 2254 claim was limited to the record that was before the state court. <em>Id. </em>But no error occurred here as this limitation was noted in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and none of the evidence from the hearing was considered in analyzing Scott\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
