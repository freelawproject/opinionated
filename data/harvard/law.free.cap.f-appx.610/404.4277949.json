On appeal, Garcia-Monge challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence based on the district court\u2019s reliance on an allegedly incorrect fact. Because Garcia-Monge\u2019s request for a variance did not preserve the error he now complains of, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To succeed on plain error review, Garcia-Monge must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Because the question of whether the district court misstated the status of Garcia-Monge\u2019s state sentence presented a factual issue which could have been resolved by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing, it cannot constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Claiborne, </em>676 F.3d 434, 438 (5th Cir.2012). Even if it could, and even assuming Garcia-Monge has demonstrated a forfeited error that was clear or obvious, <em>see United States v. Kirklin, </em>701 F.3d 177, 178-80 (5th Cir.2012), he has not demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights or that we should exercise our discretion to correct the error, <em>see Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"A66k\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
