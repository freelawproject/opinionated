Quintero\u2019s motion argued that the district court should reopen his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus so that he could challenge the district court\u2019s denial of an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim as procedurally defaulted, based on <em>Martinez v. Ryan, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1309, 182 L.Ed.2d 272 (2012) (recognizing a limited, equitable exception to the general rule that issues not raised before the district court are procedurally barred), and <em>Trevino v. Thaler, </em>569 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1911, 185 L.Ed.2d 1044(2013) (extending <em>Martinez </em>to states that effectively prohibit defendants from raising ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Quintero\u2019s Rule 60(b)(5) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Arthur v. Thomas, </em>739 F.3d 611, 628 (11th Cir.2014). \u201cUnder the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will leave undisturbed a district court\u2019s ruling unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Rule 60(b)(5) permits a court to relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding if \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Quintero\u2019s Rule 60(b)(5) motion. Quintero\u2019s argument \u2014 that the third clause of Rule 60(b)(5) permits him to raise his <em>Martinez </em>argument \u2014 is foreclosed by binding precedent. <em>See Griffin v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>787 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2015) (holding that the third clause of \u201cRule 60(b)(5) applies in ordinary civil litigation where there is a judgment granting continuing prospective relief, such as an injunction, but not to the denial of federal habeas relief\u2019). We therefore do not address whether Quintero meets the requirements for relief under <em>Martinez </em>and <em>Trevino.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\">. The State argues on appeal that Quintero did not file his Rule 60(b)(5) motion in a reasonable time, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1), and that he had to request counsel in his state post-conviction proceedings to obtain relief under <em>Martinez\u25a0 </em>Because these arguments were never raised in the district court, they are waived. <em>See Mason v. Allen, </em>605 F.3d 1114, 1120 n. 3 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-20\">. Quintero also argues that he is entitled to relief under the second clause of Rule 60(b)(5). Though this Court's holding in <em>Griffin </em>forecloses only Quintero's argument about the third clause of Rule 60(b)(5), his argument about the second clause is waived because he raised it for the first time in his reply brief. <em>See Henry v. Warden, Ga. Diagnostic Prison, </em>750 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
