(McLendon), and an Evans County school bus. The district court, applying Georgia law, determined that Mitchell could recover under McLendon\u2019s policy with FCCI Insurance Co., which promised to pay sums he was \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d from an uninsured motorist. The district court found that Mitchell could make a claim under this provision even though Evans County\u2019s partial sovereign immunity prevented Mitchell from establishing in a lawsuit that he was legally entitled to recover the full amount of his damages from Evans County.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-19\">In the first panel decision in this case, we certified the following question to the Georgia Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-20\">Can an insured party recover under an uninsured-motorist insurance policy providing that the insurer will pay sums \u201cthe insured is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle\u201d despite the partial sovereign immunity of the tortfeastor?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-21\"><em>FCCI Ins. Co. v. McLendon Enters., Inc., </em>573 Fed.Appx. 919, 921 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">The Georgia Supreme Court answered the question in the affirmative. <em>FCCI Ins. Co. v. McLendon Enters., Inc., </em>297 Ga. 136, 772 S.E.2d 651 (2015). Given the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s resolution of the certified issue, the district court did not err in determining Mitchell could recover under McLendon\u2019s uninsured-motorist coverage despite Evans County\u2019s partial sovereign immunity and Mitchell\u2019s inability to establish its full liability to him. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
