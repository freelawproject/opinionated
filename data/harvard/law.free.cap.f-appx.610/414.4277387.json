He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly the need to protect the public and deter future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence outside the Guidelines \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors where it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">When imposing the upward variance, the district court considered Hemphill\u2019s extensive and violent criminal history, as well as the seriousness and particular circumstances of the instant offense. <em>See id. </em>at 709. Hemphill\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of these factors is not sufficient to show an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Given the deference that is due a district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>see id., </em>and the district court\u2019s legitimate reasons for its sentencing decision, Hemphill has not demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, <em>see Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
