Wilson against International Business Machines Corporation. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of IBM, ruling that the incentive plan at issue is not an enforceable contract, and that, even if it is, Mr. Wilson failed to show that IBM breached. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">We assume the parties are familiar with the litigation history of this case. Thus, we summarize the proceedings and facts only insofar as necessary to provide context for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">Mr. Wilson was a software salesman for IBM. His compensation included a fixed salary as well as a sales commission. The terms of the commission are governed by an Incentive Plan Letter (\u201cIPL\u201d) which Mr. Wilson accepted in February of 2011. 'The IPL sets Mr. Wilson\u2019s sales quota at $798,000 and provides for a six month sales period-January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2011. The IPL includes a \u201cRight to Modify or Cancel\u201d clause, which in relevant part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-16\">IBM reserves the right to adjust the Plan terms (including, but not limited to, changes to sales quotas or other performance objectives, ... or changes to target incentives or similar earnings opportunities) or to modify or cancel the Plan, ... at any time during the Plan period up until any related payments have been earned under the Plan terms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">D.E. 34-3 at 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">The IPL also gives IBM the \u201csole discretion\u201d to \u201cadjust incentive payments associated with [significant] transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. One example of a \u201csignificant transaction\u201d is as a transaction for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>\u201cthe incentive payment[ is] disproportionate when compared with [the employee\u2019s] performance contribution towards the transaction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">During the first half of 2011, IBM entered into a licensing agreement with Bank of America worth approximately $63 million. Mr. Wilson\u2019s contribution to the transaction was estimated at approximately $7.7 million. Based on that contribution, Mr. Wilson claims that he earned a commission of $816,947. IBM, however, classified the Bank of America deal as a \u201csignificant transaction,\u201d thereby triggering an \u201caccount level\u201d review (or recalculation) of Mr. Wilson\u2019s sales quota, and his corresponding commission. Based on IBM\u2019s recalculation, Mr. Wilson received a commission of $471,299 for his work on the Bank of America deal.</p>\n<p id=\"AeM\">Mr. Wilson brought a breach of contract action against IBM in Georgia state court, claiming that IBM owed him an additional $345,718. IBM removed the case to feder-' al court and later moved for summary judgment. The district court granted IBM\u2019s motion, ruling that the IPL is not an enforceable contract, and that, even if it is, IBM did not breach the IPL. Mr. Wilson now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is subject to plenary review.\u201d <em>Harris v. Liberty Cmty. Mgmt, Inc., </em>702 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cWe will affirm if, after construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, we find that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">The interpretation of a contract is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Southland Distributors Mktg. Co. v. S &amp; P Co., </em>296 F.3d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.2002). Under Georgia law, which applies here, a contract that is clear and unambiguous is enforced according to its clear terms. <em>See Begner v. United States, </em>428 F.3d 998, 1005 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Eudy v. Universal Wrestling Corp., </em>272 Ga.App. 142, 611 S.E.2d 770, 773 (2005)). \u201cA contract is ambiguous if it contains a \u2018duplicity, indistinctness, an uncertainty of meaning or expression\u2019 that makes it susceptible to several reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>Begner, </em>428 F.3d at 1005 (quoting <em>Holcim (US), Inc. v. AMDG, Inc., </em>265 Ga.App. 818, 596 S.E.2d 197, 200 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">We assume, without deciding, that the IPL is an enforceable contract. Nonetheless, IBM is entitled to summary judgment because it did not breach the IPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The express language of the IPL gives IBM the exclusive right to adjust, modify, or cancel the Plan. <em>See </em>D.E. 34-3 at 3-4. This includes the right to \u201cchange[ ] sales quotas [and] other performance objectives[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The IPL also gives IBM \u2014 at its \u201csole discretion\u201d \u2014 the unilateral authority to \u201cadjust incentive payments associated with [significant] transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Mr. Wilson does not dispute that he assented to the terms of the IPL. In fact, he argues here \u2014 as he did in the district court \u2014 that the IPL is an enforceable contract. Nor does Mr. Wilson deny that the Bank of America transaction was significant. Indeed, he admits it was a \u201cblockbuster deal.\u201d D.E. 32 at 60 (Wilson Dep.). In any event, whether Mr. Wilson concedes that the Bank of American transaction was significant is of no moment, because the IPL leaves that call to IBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>In short, the clear terms of the IPL provide that IBM holds the cards with respect to how sales commissions are calculated. The IPL may indeed include terms that are very favorable to IBM, but those are the terms Mr. Wilson admittedly accepted. Mr. Wilson cannot argue that the IPL is an enforceable contract on the one hand, while refusing to accept its disadvantageous terms on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We hold that the unambiguous language of the IPL gave IBM the unilateral and unconditional authority to modify Mr. Wilson\u2019s sales quota. And we conclude-like the district court \u2014 that IBM did not breach the IPL when it modified the Mr. Wilson\u2019s quota for the Bank of America deal based on its determination that the transaction was significant. <em>See, e.g., Knight Indus., Inc. v. Turner Mktg., Inc., </em>157 Ga.App. 177, 276 S.E.2d 860, 862 (1981) (where provisions of contract gave one of the parties \u201ccomplete and absolute discretion\u201d as to a matter, exercise of that discretion does not constitute a breach).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Mr. Wilson also argues that IBM breached the IPL by retroactively modifying his sales quota when it recalculated the quota after the applicable sales period had closed \u2014 i.e., after June 30, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Again,' Mr. Wilson ignores the plain language of the IPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">The \u201cRight to Modify or Cancel\u201d clause states that IBM may modify the IPL \u201cat any time during the Plan period <em>up until any related payments have been earned </em>[.]\u201d D.E. 34-3 at 4 (emphasis added). The \u201cFull-Plan Earnings\u201d clause provides that \u201cincentive payments are earned ... only after the measurement of complete business results <em>following the end of the full-Plan period </em>[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The terms of the IPL are clear: Commissions are not earned until business results are complete \u2014 i.e., until IBM assesses the impact of a significant transaction on an employee\u2019s sales quota. And results are deemed complete only after the Plan term ends. IBM\u2019s right to modify the IPL, therefore, did not end on June 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">Mr. Wilson next argues that because he received commission statements associated with the Bank of America transaction, and those statements were stamped \u201cearned,\u201d IBM breached the IPL when it subsequently modified the amount of his commission. Once again, Mr. Wilson\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the language of the IPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">The \u201cPlan-to-Date Advance Payments\u201d clause provides that \u201c[i]ncentive payments [an employee] may receive for Plan-to-Date achievements (before the full-Plan period is over and before its business results are complete) are a form of advance payment based on incomplete business results.\u201d D.E. 34-3 at 4. And as noted above, the \u201cFull-Plan Earnings\u201d clause states that incentive payments are not earned until IBM concludes its measurement of complete business results. The fact that IBM provided interim commission statements \u2014 stamped \u201cearned\u201d or otherwise \u2014 did not preclude IBM from later modifying Mr. Wilson\u2019s quota and concomitant commission within the time specified in the IPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In granting summary judgment in favor of IBM, the district court also ruled that Mr. Wilson was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under O.C.G.A \u00a7 13-6-11. We agree. \u201cA prerequisite to any award of attorney fees under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-6-11 is the award of damages or other relief on the underlying claim.\u201d <em>United Companies Lending Corp. v. Peacock, </em>267 Ga. 145, 475 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1996). Because summary judgment in favor of IBM was appropriate on the breach of contract claim, Mr. Wilson is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 13-6-11..</p>\n<p id=\"AUY\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of IBM.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-9\">. Mr. Wilson admitted that IBM did not modify the original sales quota for his other first-half 2011 transactions ($798,000). D.E. 37 at \u00b6 58. D.E. 34-2 at V 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-10\">. The \"Plan-to-Date Advance Payment\u201d clause similarly provides that \"[m]easurement of achievement requires complete, final, and accurate business results which become available only after the completion of the applicable full-Plan period.\u201d D.E. 34-3 at 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-17\">.
