Paul Abreu, a police officer for the City of Sweetwater, Florida, argues that he was entitled to qualified immunity from plaintiff Alberto Dominguez\u2019s excessive force claim because, according to Officer Abreu, video evidence showed incontrovertibly that Mr. Dominguez was behaving in a threatening manner toward him before he forcibly maneuvered Mr. Dominguez to the floor inside the Sweetwater police station. After reviewing this video evidence, however, we agree with the district court that a genuine dispute of material fact exists over whether Mr. Dominguez resisted or threatened Officer Abreu in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-19\">\u201cWe have repeatediy ruled that a police officer violates th\u00e9 Fourth Amendment, and is denied qualified immunity, if he or she uses gratuitous and excessive force against a suspect who is under control, not resisting, and obeying commands.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Duke, </em>766 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2014) (citing cases dating back to 2000). Because the facts as construed in Mr. Dominguez\u2019s favor establish that he was handcuffed and compliant,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is, consequently, a triable issue whether Officer Abreu\u2019s aggressive takedown action was \u201cgratuitous and constitutionally excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-20\">Officer Abreu\u2019s argument that he used only <em>de minimis </em>force has no merit. Although the use of <em>de minimis </em>force during a valid seizure cannot give rise to an excessive force claim, <em>Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2000), Officer Abreu cannot cite to any authority suggesting that the level of force he used was <em>de minimis </em>in the context of a compliant suspect who is securely in custody. At best, the line of authority to which he cites approves of only a minor push or shove in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>such circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>7 F.3d 1552, 1559-60 (11th Cir.1993), <em>modified, </em>14 F.3d 583 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also Mobley v. Palm Beach Cnty. Sheriff Dep\u2019t, </em>783 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2015) (per curiam) (\u201cOur decisions demonstrate that the point at which a suspect is handcuffed and poses no risk of danger to the officer often is the pivotal point for excessive-force claims.\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)). Our case law does not support extending qualified immunity where the level of force used against a secured, compliant suspect was analogous to the aggressive takedown that occurred here. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Officer Abreu\u2019s motion for summary judgment, <em>Dominguez v. City of Sweetwater, </em>No. 13-CV-21766, 2014 WL 5529646 (S.D.Fla. Oct. 31, 2014), for the reasons articulated in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-17\">. \"We review <em>de. novo </em>the district court\u2019s disposition of a summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity, resolving all issues of material fact in favor of [the plaintiff] and then answering the legal question of whether [the defendant is] entitled to qualified immunity under that version of the facts.\u201d <em>Case v.
