After his convictions were upheld on appeal, Akel sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. His \u00a7 2255 motion was assigned to the same judge who had presided over his criminal trial. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). Akel filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for recusal, contending that the judge lacked impartiality and harbored a personal bias against him. The judge denied the motion. Akel later filed a motion for reconsideration, which the judge denied after holding a two-day hearing on the matter. This is Akel\u2019s <em>pro se </em>appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for recusal and for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">As a preliminary matter, the government contends that Akel\u2019s appeal is untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(A), which governs appeals in criminal cases. We review <em>de novo </em>whether an appeal should be dismissed as untimely. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Akel\u2019s motions for recusal and for reconsideration relate to his \u00a7 2255 motion. Motions filed under \u00a7 2255 for most purposes are considered civil in nature. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>748 F.3d 1045, 1065 (11th Cir.2014). Thus, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B), which governs appeals in civil cases, applies. <em>See Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004). Under that rule, Akel had 60 days to file a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(l)(B)(i) (providing that \u201c[t]he notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from if one of the parties is ... the United States\u201d). The district court denied Akel\u2019s motion for reconsideration on February 21, 2014, and Akel filed a notice of appeal 49 days later, on April 11, 2014.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His appeal is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s rulings on Akel\u2019s motions for recusal and for reconsideration. <em>See Giles v. Garwood, </em>853 F.2d 876, 878 (11th Cir.1988) (motion for recusal); <em>Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir.2009) (motion for reconsideration). We will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Akel filed his motion for recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, arguing that two provisions of \u00a7 455 supported his position. The first was \u00a7 455(a), which requires a federal judge to \u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Akel argued that the judge could not rule impartially on his \u00a7 2255 motion because he had given \u201cimproper and repeated <em>Allen </em>charges\u201d to the jury at Akel\u2019s trial and had sentenced Akel as an Armed Career Criminal \u201cdespite knowing he couldn\u2019t per the jury verdict.\u201d <em>See generally Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 501-02, 17 S.Ct. 154, 157, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896) (holding that a trial court may instruct a deadlocked jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>to keep deliberating); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The second provision that Akel relied on was \u00a7 455(b)(1), which requires a federal judge to \u201cdisqualify himself ... [wjhere he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.\u201d According to Akel, the judge\u2019s personal bias against him was clear from several improper statements that the judge had allegedly made to the jury outside of Akel\u2019s presence, including \u201cberating] the jury for finding Akel not guilty on three (3) of the six (6) counts\u201d and calling Akel \u201ca son of a bitch.\u201d Akel attached an affidavit in which he declared that his trial attorney had told him that an anonymous juror had told him that the judge had made those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The district judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Akel\u2019s motion for recusal. Akel\u2019s argument that the judge should have recused because of a lack of impartiality stems from the judge\u2019s rulings at Akel\u2019s trial and sentence hearing. Just because those rulings were not in Akel\u2019s favor does not mean that they establish any bias or prejudice. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 551, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1155, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994); <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents, </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1988). \u201c[B]ias or prejudice must be personal and extrajudicial; it must derive from something other than that which the judge learned by participating in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). And Akel\u2019s allegations of personal bias or prejudice depend on double hearsay \u2014 that is, Akel\u2019s report about what his trial attorney said about what an anonymous juror said. \u201cA judge should not recuse himself based upon unsupported, irrational, or tenuous allegations,\u201d and Akel\u2019s allegations were exactly that. <em>Giles, </em>853 F.2d at 878. The district judge was not required to recuse himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">After the district judge denied his motion for recusal, Akel filed a motion for reconsideration. He made two arguments. First, he argued that the district judge should have considered his motion for re-cusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, another federal statute that governs recusal, as well as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, the statute he had cited in his original motion. Second, Akel argued that the district judge had denied his motion for recusal without considering an important piece of evidence that supported his claims about the judge\u2019s alleged misbehavior: a letter that Akel\u2019s trial attorney had written to Akel\u2019s father. Akel had included that letter in his reply to the government\u2019s response in opposition to his motion, but the district court had returned the reply as deficient because local rules do not allow parties to file a reply without first obtaining the court\u2019s permission. The district judge considered Akel\u2019s arguments, held a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motion for reconsideration, and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">The district judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Akel\u2019s motion for reconsideration. A litigant cannot use a motion for reconsideration to raise \u201cnew arguments that were previously available, but not pressed\u201d or to \u201cpresent evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Wilchombe, </em>555 F.3d at 957 (quotation marks omitted). Akel used his motion for reconsideration to do exactly those things. He raised an argument he could have raised in his original motion and presented evidence he could have presented before the court denied his motion. Although the district judge could have denied Akel\u2019s motion for reconsideration on those grounds alone, the judge instead held a two-day evidentiary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>before reaching his decision. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">.
