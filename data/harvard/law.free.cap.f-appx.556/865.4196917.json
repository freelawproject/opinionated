Mazard argues that his sentence at the low end of the advisory guideline range is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">Mazard invited any error involving the reasonableness of his sentence. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Love, 449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997)). At his sentencing hearing, Ma-zard \u201cask[ed] for, at a maximum, ... [a sentence of] 30 months\u201d and later argued that \u201c30 months ... [was] very significant, a long period of time ... but appropriate in this case.\u201d Mazard is barred from challenging the reasonableness of a sentence at the low end of the guideline range that he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">We AFFIRM Mazard\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
