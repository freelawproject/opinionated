Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he brought this civil rights action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging that defendants denied him his constitutional rights to a jury trial and to confront his accusers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wright did not pay the filing fee, but sought leave to leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge. The judge recommended that the District Court deny Wright leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>for the following reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">A prisoner may not bring a civil action in federal court <em>in forma pauperis </em>if [he] has, on 8 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it [was] frivolous, malicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Plaintiff has filed more than three prior cases while incarcerated that were dismissed either as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. <em>See Wright v.PolkCnty., </em>No. 4:12-CV-0256-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 29, 2012); <em>Wright v. Cedartown Standard, </em>No. 4:11-CV-0293-RLV (N.D.Ga. Jan. 6, 2012); <em>Wright v. Polk Cnty., </em>No. 4:10\u2014CV-0136-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 15, 2010); <em>Wright v. Crane, </em>No. 4:10-CV-0135-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 15, 2010); <em>Wright v. Dodd, </em>4:10-CV-0134-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 10, 2010); <em>Wright v. Polk Cnty., </em>4:10-CV-0133-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 8, 2010); <em>Wright v. McClendon, </em>No. 4:10-CV-0132-RLV (N.D.Ga. Nov. 2, 2010). Plaintiff does not allege a current imminent threat of serious injury in this case. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), plaintiff cannot proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-8\"><em>See </em>Final Report and Recommendation at 2. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissed Wright\u2019s complaint without prejudice for failure to pay the filing fee. He now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the PLRA \u201cthree strikes provision\u201d regarding the payment of a filing fee. <em>Dupree v. Palmer, </em>284 F.3d 1234, 1235 (11th Cir.2002). The PLRA prohibits a prisoner from proceeding <em>in forma pau-peris </em>if the prisoner has \u201con 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The purpose of this provision is to curtail abusive prisoner litigation, and after three meritless suits, the prisoner is no longer permitted to file a suit at the reduced rate provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. <em>Dupree, </em>284 F.3d at 1236. We have held that the prisoner must pay the full filing fee \u201cat the time he <em>initiates </em>the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). If the prisoner fails to do so, then the proper procedure is to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Wright does not contest the District Court\u2019s finding that he has had three pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>vious actions dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim, and thus that issue is abandoned. Thus, the only remaining issue is whether he paid the filing fee at the time he initiated the action. The District Court docketed the complaint on May 15, 2013, and the first payment for the filing fee, which was only partial, was received and processed on May 22, 2013. Thus, Wright failed to pay the filing fee \u201cat the time he initiate[d] the suit.\u201d <em>See Dupree, </em>284 F.3d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. The Magistrate Judge, and the District Court in adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation as indicating in the text, declined to treat Wright\u2019s complaint as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition to set aside the Superi- or Court\u2019s order of confinement because Wright had not exhausted his state court remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). <em>See </em>Final Report and Recommendation at 1, n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
