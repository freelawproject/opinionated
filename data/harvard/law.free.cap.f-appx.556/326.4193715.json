He first contends that the district court erred in applying the enhancements in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and (b)(6)(A) because the district court failed to make specific findings of fact and resolve the disputed application of these enhancements; the evidence relied on by the district court, an undercover agent\u2019s (UA) statement to Mendoza that the firearms the UA was purchasing were going to Mexico, was unreliable; and the evidence was not sufficient to support these enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-21\">Mendoza did not make the specific arguments he now raises nor were the objections he made \u201csufficiently specific to alert the district court to the nature of the alleged error[s]\u201d he now raises and \u201cto provide an opportunity for correction.\u201d <em>United States v. Neal, </em>578 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, his claims of error are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Hernandez, </em>671 F.3d 494, 497-99 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Mendoza\u2019s assertion that the district court failed to make specific findings of fact and resolve the disputed application of these enhancements is belied by the record. Also unavailing is Mendoza\u2019s contention that the UA\u2019s statement was not reliable evidence. The PSR identified the source of the recorded statement, and the PSR was corroborated by the parties after they listened to the recording. Therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that the statement existed was based on sufficiently reliable information and was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Njoku, </em>737 F.3d 55, 77 (5th Cir.2013); <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>726 F.3d 586, 627 (5th Cir.2013); <em>cf. United States v. Shacklett, </em>921 F.2d 580, 584-85 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Based on the plain language of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(A), the UA\u2019s statement that he told Mendoza the firearms were going to Mexico provided sufficient support for the enhancement for \u201ctransferr[ing] any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be transported out of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The enhancement in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) applies if the defendant trafficked firearms by \u201ctransferring] ... two or more firearms to another individual\u201d knowing' or having reason to believe \u201cthat such conduct would result in the ... transfer ... of a firearm to an individual ... [w]ho intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.\u201d \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) &amp; cmt. n. 13(A)(i), (ii)(II). Mendoza was introduced to the UA by a confidential informant, a machine gun was included in the five firearms Mendoza was involved in transferring to the UA, and Mendoza knew the firearms were going to Mexico. Additionally, the district court suggested that it was local common knowledge that this area of Texas supplied Mexico with weapons used to commit violence. These facts, considered in light of the record as a whole and with reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mendoza transferred firearms with knowledge or reason to believe that they would be used to commit violence in Mexico. <em>See Njoku, </em>737 F.3d at 77; <em>United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246, 251-53. Alternatively, since Mendoza does not address at all whether the alleged error affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, he has failed to satisfy the fourth prong of plain error review. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>620 F.3d 483, 496 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Next, Mendoza contends that the district court engaged in impermissible double-counting by applying both enhancements. Assuming arguendo that Mendoza\u2019s vague and general objection to double-counting preserved review, his argument is without merit. Mendoza\u2019s crime of conviction, which penalizes receipt or possession of an unregistered firearm, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d), is distinct from the enhancement in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which penalizes trafficking firearms, and from the enhancement in \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(A), which penalizes exporting firearms. Further, even assuming for the sake of argument that applying both \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and (b)(6)(A) double-counts weapons possession and trafficking, nothing in \u00a7 2K2.1 expressly prohibits the application of both enhancements. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
