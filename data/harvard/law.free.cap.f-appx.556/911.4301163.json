Toledo-Cardona\u2019s property was subject to two mortgage hens at the time he filed for bankruptcy. The debt owed on the first mortgage exceeded the fair market value of the property. Bank of America held the second mortgage, which had a value of over $100,000. Because the debt secured by the first hen exceeded the value of the property, Bank of America\u2019s junior hen was considered to be wholly \u201cunderwater.\u201d This being the case, Toledo-Cardona moved the bankruptcy court to \u201cstrip off\u2019 or \u201cvoid\u201d \u2014 that is, extinguish in its entirety \u2014 Bank of America\u2019s hen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Bank of America\u2019s response to Toledo-Cardona\u2019s motion acknowledged that under binding Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that a wholly underwater junior hen is voidable, Toledo-Cardona\u2019s motion should be granted. <em>See Folendore v. U.S. Small Bus. Admin., </em>862 F.2d 1537, 1538-39 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also McNeal v. GMAC Mortg., LLC, </em>735 F.3d 1263, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam). For that reason, the bankruptcy court granted Toledo-Cardona\u2019s motion. Bank of America appealed to the district court, but moved for summary affirmance in light of this Court\u2019s binding precedent. The district court granted the motion, and Bank of America now seeks the appellate review that its motion for summary affirmance was intended to expedite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Bank of America maintains that <em>Folen-dore </em>and <em>McNeal </em>should be overturned in light of <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), which held that a chapter 7 debtor could not \u201cstrip down\u201d a creditor\u2019s hen on real property where the value of the property is less than what is due to be paid to the creditor. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 112 S.Ct. at 778. But in <em>McNeal, </em>we reaffirmed <em>Folendore </em>despite the holding in <em>Dewsnwp. McNeal, </em>735 F.3d at 1265-66. As Bank of America concedes, we are bound as a panel to follow our Court\u2019s decision in <em>McNeal. </em>We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
