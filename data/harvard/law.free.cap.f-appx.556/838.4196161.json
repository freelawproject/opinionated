Because Gupta cannot meet his burden to establish that the dismissal was obtained through a fraud on the court under Rule 60(d)(3) or that he is entitled to have his filing recast as a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">This appeal arises out of Gupta\u2019s efforts to avoid deportation. In May 2010, Gupta sought declaratory relief from the government\u2019s denial of his application to adjust his immigration status to lawful permanent resident. On January 18, 2011, the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Gupta\u2019s suit and so granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, which this Court affirmed. <em>Gupta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. et al., </em>439 Fed.Appx. 858, 860-61 (11th Cir.2011). On November 19, 2012, Gupta filed a motion to set aside the dismissal under Rule 60(d)(3). His motion alleged that the government committed a fraud on the court by presenting false evidence and withholding other evidence that was pertinent. The district court denied this motion, noting that Gupta \u201cfailed to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud on the court\u201d and that the \u201callegations and evidence presented by [Gupta] do not show that [the government\u2019s] conduct improperly influenced this Court\u2019s decision to dismiss [his] complaint.\u201d Gupta now asks us to reverse that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">We first address whether the district court erred in its denial of Gupta\u2019s Rule 60(d)(3) motion, a decision we review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Maradiaga v. United States, </em>679 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2012). Rule 60(d)(3) permits a litigant to obtain relief from a final judgment or order if the movant can show \u201cfraud on the court.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3). It has long been the law of this Circuit that fraud on the court must be established by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Booker v. Dugger, </em>825 F.2d 281, 283 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cGenerally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated, will constitute a fraud on the court.\u201d <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1338 (5th Cir.1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Int\u2019l Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., </em>349 F.Supp. 22, 29 (D.Conn.1972), <em>aff'd without opinion sub nom. Nader v. United States, </em>410 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 1363, 35 L.Ed.2d 582 (1973)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The mere nondisclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>sure of allegedly pertinent facts does not ordinarily rise to the level of fraud on the court. <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201cit is necessary to show an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decision\u201d to set aside a judgment under Rule 60(d)(3). <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gupta had not presented clear and convincing evidence of fraud sufficient to warrant setting the judgment aside under Rule 60(d)(3). Gupta\u2019s allegation that the government presented a perjured affidavit is at best tenuously supported by the documents Gupta presented to the district court, and the remainder of the allegedly fraudulent conduct amounts to mere nondisclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Even if there had been sufficient evidence to demonstrate a fraud on the court, the district court did not err in requiring proof that the challenged outcome was actually obtained through \u2014 or at least impacted by \u2014 the alleged fraud. <em>See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 246-47, 64 S.Ct. 997, 1001, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944) (permitting a judgment to be set aside for fraud on the court where the fraud, whether or not the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for the ruling, at the very least \u201cdid impress the Court\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 17, 97 S.Ct. 31, 50 L.Ed.2d 21 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the fraud allegations are unrelated to the underlying determination that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Rule 60(d)(3) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Gupta also argues that the district court erred when it failed to liberally construe his Rule 60(d)(3) motion as a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that courts must liberally construe pleadings made by <em>pro se </em>litigants). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">A district court\u2019s discretion to construe Rule 60(b) motions is somewhat limited, because Rule 60(b)(6) is an appropriate basis for relief only for those cases that do not fall into one of the other provisions of Rule 60(b). <em>United States v. Real Prop. &amp; Residence Located at Route 1, Box 111, Firetower Rd., Semmes, Mobile Cnty., Ala., </em>920 F.2d 788, 791 (11th Cir.1991). Indeed, it is an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion to rely on Rule 60(b)(6) to grant relief for conduct more appropriately challenged under another subsection of Rule 60(b). <em>Id.; Gulf Coast Bldg. &amp; Supply Co. v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 480, AFL-CIO, </em>460 F.2d 105, 108 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201cWhere either Clauses (b)(1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) provide coverage for the movant\u2019s claim, relief may not be obtained pursuant to Clause (b)(6).\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Cooper, </em>485 Fed.Appx. 411, 415 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cAlthough a Rule 60(b)(6) motion can be filed \u2018within a reasonable time,\u2019 Cooper\u2019s claim of new evidence of fraud cannot be brought under (b)(6)\u2019s catch-all provision because it falls under either (b)(2) or (b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">At least one reason for this limitation is that motions brought under subsections (1), (2), and (3) of Rule 60(b) are subject to a strict one-year statute of limitations. In contrast, claims brought under the remaining subsections, including Rule 60(b)(6), are not subject to such a strict deadline. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1) (\u201cA motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>a reasonable time \u2014 and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d); <em>see also Real Prop. &amp; Residence, </em>920 F.2d at 791 (\u201cFurther, the maximum time limitation of one year that applies to clause (1), (2) and (3) would be meaningless, if after the year period had run the movant could be granted relief under clause (6) for reasons covered by clauses (1), (2) and (3).\u201d (quoting 7 J. Moore, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 60.27, at 60-266 (2d ed.1987))). Gupta\u2019s status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant does not exempt him from this procedural rule. <em>See Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[AJlthough we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The district court would have abused its discretion here if it had construed Gupta\u2019s Rule 60(d)(3) motion as one brought under Rule 60(b)(6). Liberally construed, Gupta\u2019s motion alleges conduct within the ambit of Rules 60(b)(2) and (3). <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2) (permitting relief if there is \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)\u201d); <em>id. </em>60(b)(3) (permitting relief if there is \u201cfraud ... misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party\u201d). Indeed, Gupta\u2019s case illustrates precisely the concern this Court highlighted in <em>Real Property &amp; Residence </em>when we explicitly limited a district court\u2019s discretion to grant relief under Rule 60(b)(6). See 920 F.2d at 791. To grant him relief under Rule 60(b)(6) would entirely circumvent the timing restrictions on Rule 60(b)(2) and (3) motions, for he brought his motion more than one year after the order he challenged. Because the district court would have abused its discretion had it obliged the request Gupta now makes, <em>see id., </em>it did not err in the first instance by failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Gupta\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">. In diis regard, Gupta\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of this standard rather than a preponderance of the evidence standard is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b867-8\">. For the same reasons, Gupta's remaining challenge to the Rule 60(d)(3) ruling \u2014 that he was legally entitled to an evidentiary hearing \u2014 is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
