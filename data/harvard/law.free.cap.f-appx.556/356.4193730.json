The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Scottsdale. For the reasons below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Scottsdale issued Logansport an insurance policy for commercial general liability and property insurance (\u201cthe Policy\u201d), insuring a property in Logansport, Louisiana. The property included a truck stop, a convenience store, video poker machines, and a restaurant. The Policy contains a Protective Safeguards Endorsement, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-18\">PROTECTIVE SAFEGUARDS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-19\">A. The following is added to the Commercial Property Conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-20\">PROTECTIVE SAFEGUARDS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjDa\">1. As a condition of this insurance, you are required to maintain the protective devices or services listed in the Schedule above [Fire Extinguishers and Ansul System].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>2. The protective safeguards to which this endorsement applies are identified by the following symbols:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cP-9\u201d The protective system described in the Schedule [Fire Extinguishers and Ansul System].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">B. The following is added to the EXCLUSIONS section of the Causes of Loss-Special Form:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from fire if, prior to the fire, you:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">1. Knew of any suspension or impairment in any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above and failed to notify us of that fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">2. Failed to maintain any protective safeguard listed in the Schedule above, and over which you had control, in complete working order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Logansport purchased and installed a fire suppression system in the vent hood above the stove in the restaurant kitchen. Logansport hired Ark-La-Tex Fire Systems to service the fire suppression system and inspect it semi-annually. Ark-La-Tex Fire Systems last inspected the Logansport fire suppression system in August 2010. On January 31, 2011, a fire occurred in Logansport\u2019s restaurant kitchen, causing damage to the property. Lo-gansport filed a claim on the Policy the same day. Scottsdale investigated the claim, particularly whether the fire suppression system had been maintained \u201cin such a condition that it should have operated.\" Its investigation concluded that the system did not activate on the day of the fire and that, even if it had activated, missing parts would have rendered the system ineffective in suppressing the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">On September 15, 2011, Scottsdale brought this suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that the Policy did not provide coverage for the damage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Scottsdale moved for summary judgment, claiming that the policy barred coverage because it required Logansport to maintain its fire suppression system \u201cin complete working order.\u201d Logansport<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contended that it complied with the Policy by acting with due diligence and in a reasonably prudent manner in maintaining the fire suppression system.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The district court granted summary judgment for Scottsdale. The district court found that the Policy\u2019s requirement that Logansport not only \u201cmaintain\u201d the system, but \u201cmaintain it in complete working order\u201d meant that the system had to be working at the time of the fire for Logansport to receive coverage. Thus, because Logansport conceded that the system did not work on the date of the fire and because Logansport did not provide any alternative interpretation of the Policy\u2019s language, summary judgment for Scottsdale was appropriate. Logansport filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Logansport seeks review of a final judgment of the district court. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court in the first instance. <em>Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 343 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Summary judgment should be granted only when there is \u201cno genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). An interpretation of an insurance policy provision is likewise an issue of law reviewed de novo. <em>Travelers Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Pac. Emp\u2019rs Ins. Co., </em>602 F.3d 677, 681 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Having diversity jurisdiction over this action, we apply the substantive law of the forum state. <em>See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In the underlying action, Louisiana is the forum state, and thus, Louisiana law governs this dispute. Louisiana courts construe insurance policies using ordinary contract principles. <em>Smith v. Matthews, </em>611 So.2d 1377, 1379 (La.1993). An insurance contract\u2019s clear and unambiguous language will be enforced as written, but any ambiguous provisions must be construed in favor of coverage to the insured and against the insurer who issued the policy. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cent. La. Elec. Co. v. Westinghouse, </em>579 So.2d 981 (La.1991); <em>Breland v. Schilling, </em>550 So.2d 609 (La.1989)); <em>see also </em>La. Civ.Code Ann. art.2046. Still, \u201c[wjhen a literal interpretation will produce absurd consequences, the court may consider all pertinent facts and circumstances, including the parties\u2019 own conclusion of the instrument\u2019s meaning, rather than adhere to a forced meaning of the terms used.\u201d <em>Halphen v. Borja, </em>2006-1465, p. 4 (La.App. 1 Cir. 5/4/07), 961 So.2d 1201, 1205, <em>writ denied, </em>2007-1198 (La.9/21/07), 964 So.2d 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On appeal, Logansport challenges the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Policy. Specifically, Logansport argues that (1) the Policy\u2019s language \u2014 to \u201cmaintain ... in complete working order\u201d \u2014 is ambiguous; (2) the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Policy leads to absurd results; and (3) due diligence is the proper standard for determining compliance with the Policy\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Scottsdale argues that Logansport\u2019s ambiguity and absurdity arguments about the interpretation of the Policy were not raised before the district court and should therefore be deemed waived. We agree that Logansport failed to raise its ambiguity and absurdity arguments before the district court. As the district court emphasized, Logansport did not frame its arguments as offering an interpretation of the language of the Policy itself. Accordingly, we deem Logansport\u2019s ambiguity and absurdity arguments waived on appeal. <em>See LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Logansport\u2019s lone remaining argument is that we should consider evidence of its due diligence in determining whether the Policy\u2019s exclusion for \u201cfailing] to maintain any protective safeguard ... in complete working order\u201d applies. We disagree. Nothing in the plain language of the Policy suggests that to maintain the protective safeguards in complete working order means only to exercise due diligence in maintaining the safeguards listed. As the district court emphasized, the phrase \u201cin complete working order\u201d is crucial. There might be a genuine issue of material fact as to what actions are necessary to \u201cmaintain\u201d protective safeguards. <em>See Charles Stores, Inc. v. Aetna Ins. Co. </em>428 F.2d 989 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that determination of whether insured maintained sprinkler and alarm systems was a \u201cclassic issue for jury\u201d). Yet the Policy\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cin complete working order\u201d to modify \u201cmaintain\u201d \u2022 leaves no doubt that diligence alone is not enough to satisfy the plain terms of the Policy. In conceding that the fire suppression system did not work on the day of the fire, Logansport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>necessarily admits that its system was not \u201cin complete working order,\u201d and thus did not comply with the plain language of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Scottsdale also filed a motion to dismiss the appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 27 for failure to \u201caddress the actual Judgment of the District Court.\u201d Logansport has adequately addressed the district court\u2019s judgment and we accordingly deny its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Therefore, we DENY Scottsdale\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Scottsdale.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-10\">. Logansport made a counterclaim, which the district court dismissed. Logansport does not appeal this ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-17\">. Sabine River Restaurant did not oppose Scottsdale's Motion for Summary Judgment below. Accordingly, it has waived its right to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
