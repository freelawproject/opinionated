Plaintiff Freeman now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">In her complaint, plaintiff Freeman alleged that the City discriminated against its black residents through its electricity billing practices. Freeman alleged that the City inflated its black residents\u2019 electricity bills by fraudulently overstating the number of kilowatt-hours that the City\u2019s black residents consumed. To be clear, Freeman did not allege that the City charged its black residents a higher <em>rate </em>for each kilowatt-hour consumed. Instead, Freeman alleged that the City stated that its black residents <em>consumed </em>more kilowatt-hours of electricity than they actually did. Freeman alleged that the City inflated black residents\u2019 electrical bills \u2014 and, thus, made the City\u2019s black residents pay excessive electrical bills \u2014 because of their race.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Based on these allegations, Freeman filed a housing discrimination complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d). In her HUD complaint, Freeman alleged that the City, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201covercharged and unfairly charged them fees\u201d related to their electric bills. HUD investigated those allegations and \u201cdetermined that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice ha[d] occurred.\u201d Based on this conclusion, HUD issued a \u201cDetermination of No Reasonable Cause\u201d and informed Freeman of her right to file a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Freeman exercised her right to file a civil action and sued the City in federal court. She brought these federal claims:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1) a race-based discrimination claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of her Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights and (2) a race-based discrimination claim pursuant to Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d). Freeman also brought these state law claims: (3) fraud; (4) misrepresentation; (5) breach of contract; (6) negligence; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">In support of her claims, Freeman produced nearly 2,000 pages of documents for the district court. The vast majority of those documents were (1) utility bills that the City sent to various residents for various billing periods and (2) correspondence between plaintiff Freeman, the Douglas Energy Relief Association, City residents, and/or HUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">After the close of discovery, the City moved for summary judgment on all claims raised in the complaint. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion. The court stated that it \u201creview[ed] \u2014 page by page \u2014 the specific documents cited by Plaintiff\u2019 and concluded that Freeman \u201cutterly and completely failed to support [her] allegations with evidence.\u201d The district court concluded that Freeman failed to produce evidence that \u2014 at least with respect to electricity consumption \u2014 the City\u2019s black residents were similarly situated to the City\u2019s non-black residents. Without some evidence that the City\u2019s black and non-black residents were similarly situated, the district court concluded that there was insufficient evidence supporting Freeman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and FHA claims. Thus, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>on Freeman\u2019s federal race-based discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Because Freeman\u2019s state law claims were predicated on the City\u2019s alleged race-based discrimination, which was unsupported by the evidence, the district court also granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Freeman\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Plaintiff Freeman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Morales v. Zenith Ins. Co., </em>714 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir.2013). When reviewing the evidence, we view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cRule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">To state a \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim, plaintiff Freeman must show that she is similarly situated to non-black persons who received more favorable treatment. <em>See Sweet v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>467 F.3d 1311, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cTo establish an equal protection claim, a [plaintiff] must demonstrate that (1) he is similarly situated to [others] who received more favorable treatment; and (2) the state engaged in invidious discrimination against him based on race, religion, national origin, or some other constitutionally protected basis.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Ray, </em>279 F.3d 944, 946-47 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that, to establish an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that \u201che is similarly situated\u201d to others who received more favorable treatment). Specifically, plaintiff Freeman must show that the City overstated the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity that she consumed but the City did not overstate the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity that similarly-situated, non-black residents consumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Freeman\u2019s FHA race-based discrimination claim requires the same showing. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1216 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[A] disparate treatment claim [pursuant to the FHA] requires a plaintiff to show that he has actually been treated differently than similarly situated [non-black] people.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">On appeal, Freeman directs this Court to these portions of the record: (1) a comparison chart reflecting the electric bills of the City\u2019s residents; (2) an analysis of the City\u2019s electric bills, which shows that black City residents use more electricity than the national and state averages; (3) the City\u2019s responses to Freeman\u2019s interrogatories; (4) plaintiff Freeman\u2019s responses to the City\u2019s interrogatories; (5) Roy Wad-ley\u2019s expert witness report; (6) Willis Pa-pillion\u2019s expert witness report; and (7) an affidavit from a civil rights analyst, Edward Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">We address each item below and explain why that evidence, viewed in plaintiff Freeman\u2019s favor, fails to establish that Freeman was similarly situated to any non-black persons who received more favorable treatment with respect to their electric bills. Specifically, Freeman\u2019s evidence does not show that the City charged Freeman with using more kilowatt-hours of electricity than she actually used but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>not over-charge similarly-situated, non-black persons for their electricity consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A.Electricity Consumption Chart</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The chart of the City residents\u2019 electrical usage does not provide sufficient information to determine which residents, if any, were similarly situated to plaintiff Freeman. Many factors affect one\u2019s electric bill: the home\u2019s size; the home\u2019s energy sources (e.g., gas, electric, solar, wood); the way that a home is built (e.g., the number of doors, windows, the type of insulation, whether the home faces east or south); the home\u2019s location (e.g., further north, at a higher elevation); how a home is occupied (e.g., seasonally, only on the weekends, only at night, all day); the number of residents; the appliances used in the home (e.g., heat pump versus furnace, electric versus gas water heater); the characteristics of those appliances (e.g., the appliances\u2019 ages, conditions, and efficiency ratings); efforts to conserve energy (e.g., programmable thermostats, turning off unused lights and appliances, maintaining lower thermostat settings in the winter or higher settings in the summer, using LED bulbs). Freeman provided no evidence that the residents in the comparison chart had homes with similar energy consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Moreover, even if the energy efficiency and consumption characteristics were similar across all residences in the City, the comparison chart does not compare electrical consumption for a specific time period or periods. Thus, the energy consumption comparison does not account for such things as the specific weather conditions on a given day, week, or month. Nor does the energy consumption comparison account for the season (e.g., winter versus spring).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Without some evidence that the comparison chart reflects a difference in electrical consumption for people who are similarly situated in all respects but their race, the comparison chart fails to establish a critical part of Freeman\u2019s federal claims\u2014 namely, that Freeman is similarly situated to non-black persons who were not overcharged for their kilowatt-hours of electricity consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">B. National and State Data</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">For similar reasons, Freeman\u2019s evidence that the City\u2019s black residents consumed more electricity than the state and national averages does not satisfy the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d element of her federal claims. Residents across Georgia are not similarly situated to the City\u2019s residents. Some Georgia residents live in the mountains; some live at the beach. Some live in sprawling estates; some live in studio apartments. Some use their homes seasonally; some reside in the same home all year. Other than their state of residence, Freeman provided no evidence that the \u201caverage\u201d Georgia resident is similarly situated to the City\u2019s black residents in terms of electricity consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">For obvious reasons, the differences between the City\u2019s black residents\u2019 energy consumption and that of the \u201caverage\u201d national resident are even greater, as the geography, weather, and energy sources vary greatly across the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">C. The City\u2019s Interrogatory Responses</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">The City\u2019s responses to Freeman\u2019s interrogatory requests also fail to establish the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d elements of Freeman\u2019s federal claims. Freeman directed the Court to Interrogatory No. 4 and Interrogatory No. 12. In Interrogatory No. 4, Freeman asked for the addresses of all residents in two of the City\u2019s four wards where the residents used 4,000 to 5,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>kilowatt-hours of electricity in any month between 2005 to. 2010. The City stated that it- could not produce the requested information without substantial expense because the City would have to contract with the software company that created the billing software to generate a program to retrieve the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In Interrogatory No. 12, Freeman asked the City to explain the process for recording residents\u2019 electricity consumption into the City\u2019s computer database. In response, the City stated that meter readers rotated through the City\u2019s four wards on a predetermined schedule (e.g., Ward 1 on the 1st of each month, Ward 2 on the 7th of each month, etc.). The City stated that, after completing their routes, the meter readers upload their readings to City Hall for billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">These interrogatory responses establish very little. They certainly do not establish the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d elements of Freeman\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">D. Plaintiff Freeman\u2019s Interrogatory Responses</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Plaintiff Freeman\u2019s responses to the City\u2019s interrogatory requests also fail to establish the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d elements of Freeman\u2019s federal claims. Plaintiff Freeman\u2019s responses establish that (1) the City\u2019s electricity wards are divided predominantly along racial lines, (2) the \u201cwards were established many years ago when [the City] established the utility service,\u201d (3) the City charges the same rate and fees to all residential customers, and (4) the City\u2019s computerized billing program cannot differentiate between white and black residents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of the facts from Freeman\u2019s interrogatory responses establish the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d elements of Freeman\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">E. Wadley\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Roy Wadley\u2019s expert report relies on national and state energy consumption data and a comparison of fourteen electric bills from black and white residents in the City. However, as with the consumption comparison chart and the state and national data, nothing in Wadley\u2019s report shows that the white comparators analyzed in his report were similarly situated to Freeman. In fact, the comparison of City resident data is based on electric bills of black City residents from 2004, 2008, and 2010. Yet, the data for the white resident comparators are based on energy consumed in 2005. There is no evidence that weather conditions for these various dates \u2014 spanning many years \u2014 produced \u201csimilar\u201d electricity consumption. Nor is there any indication that the homes, living conditions, or energy use in those homes were similar in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Notwithstanding these deficiencies in the national, state, and City comparisons, Wadley\u2019s report concludes that the disparities in the electric bills of the City\u2019s white and black residents are \u201cevidence of discrimination.\u201d While the Court must view the evidence in plaintiff Freeman\u2019s favor at this summary judgment stage, the Court need not accept Wadley\u2019s legal conclusion because it is unsupported by the facts. <em>See Evers v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>770 F.2d 984, 986 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cThis court has consistently held that conclusory allegations without specific supporting facts have no probative value.\u201d); <em>see also Hilburn v. Murata Electronics N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1228 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he absence of any specific facts which would substantiate [the expert\u2019s] conclusion deprives [her conclusions] of any probative value.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>F. Papillion\u2019s Report</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">As noted above, after investigating plaintiff Freeman\u2019s allegations of discrimination, HUD \u201cdetermined that no reasonable cause exist[ed] to believe that a discriminatory housing practice ha[d] occurred.\u201d Plaintiff Freeman\u2019s expert, Willis Papillion, issued a report stating that the HUD investigation was flawed for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">First, the HUD investigator allowed the City to choose the sample of electric bills analyzed by HUD, rather than using a randomly selected sample of electric bills. Second, the HUD investigator misunderstood Freeman\u2019s claim. Specifically, plaintiff Freeman alleged that the City overstated black residents\u2019 electricity <em>consumption (e.g., </em>number of kilowatt-hours consumed). But, the HUD investigator investigated disparities in the <em>rate </em>charged to black residents (e.g., cost per kilowatt-hour consumed). Freeman agreed with the HUD investigator that black and non-black residents were charged the same rate for each kilowatt-hour consumed. However, she alleged that the City inflated the amount of electricity that its black residents consumed, and, thus, the City forced black residents to pay higher electric bills than their non-black counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Even if Papillion\u2019s report could be used to demonstrate flaws in the HUD investigation, nothing in Papillion\u2019s report provides evidence that the City inflated the black residents\u2019 electricity consumption because of their race. Nor does Papillion\u2019s report indicate that plaintiff Freeman was similarly situated to any non-black residents with respect to actual electricity consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">G. Edward Freeman\u2019s Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">Edward Freeman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a retired HUD specialist and a civil rights analyst. His affidavit also challenged the HUD investigator\u2019s methodology and conclusion. But, demonstrating flaws in the HUD investigator\u2019s methods does not establish plaintiff Freeman\u2019s causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In addition to challenging HUD\u2019s investigation, Edward Freeman\u2019s affidavit draws the legal conclusion that the City \u201cgives preferential treatment to Caucasians and discriminates against African Americans who are similarly situated\u201d through inflated electric bills. But, as noted above, the Court does not accept legal conclusions unsupported by the facts. <em>See Evers, </em>770 F.2d at 986; <em>see also Hilburn, </em>181 F.3d at 1228 (\u201c[T]he absence of any specific facts which would substantiate [the expert\u2019s] conclusion deprives [his conclusions] of any probative value.\u201d). Notably, Edward Freeman\u2019s conclusion is based on the same evidence discussed above: the consumption comparison chart, national and state averages of electricity consumption, and the City\u2019s interrogatory responses. However, neither Edward Freeman nor plaintiff Freeman explained how this evidence satisfies the \u201csimilarly situated\u201d requirements in plaintiff Freeman\u2019s federal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Without some evidence showing that the proffered comparators reflect similarly-situated persons who only differ by race, Freeman\u2019s \u00a7 1983 and FHA federal claims fail as a matter of law. <em>See Sweet, </em>467 F.3d at 1318-19; <em>Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1216. As Freeman concedes, her other causes of action are all predicated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>City\u2019s alleged race-based discrimination. Without evidence of race-based discrimination, Freeman\u2019s state law claims also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s grant of the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-15\">.
