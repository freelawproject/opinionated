Francis, a citizen of Jamaica and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme. He conceded removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) and applied for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) determined that Francis was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had failed to refute evidence in the record indicating that he had aggravated felony convictions for access device fraud and conspiracy to commit access device fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(5) and (b)(2), which had resulted in restitution of $285,439. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), (U). Francis now petitions for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-21\">Francis challenges the BIA\u2019s ruling that, to qualify for cancellation of removal, he was required to provide documentation showing that he was not in fact convicted of access device fraud or conspiracy or that the offenses did not constitute aggravated felonies. He contends that the government had the initial burden to produce evidence indicating that the aggravated felony bar might apply. Francis also asserts that any records submitted by the government were inconclusive; although the government had argued that Francis was removable on the basis of these aggravated felony convictions, the IJ had found the evidence insufficient to establish re-movability because the submitted judgment and presentence report were not certified. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B). He argues that, in light of the inconclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>record, he has satisfied his burden of proving that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">To qualify for cancellation of removal, an alien must establish that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Because the record contained evidence indicating that the aggravated felony bar may apply, Francis was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence \u201cthat he is not an aggravated felon and is therefore statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d <em>Vasquez-Martinez v. Holder, </em>564 F.3d 712, 715 (5th Cir.2009); \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). The government had no burden to show that the offense was an aggravated felony. <em>See Vasquez-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 716. Although the final judgment submitted by the government was insufficient to establish that Francis was removable, it did constitute record evidence indicating the existence of an aggravated felony. <em>See Vasquez-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 714-15 (finding that judgment containing an error was insufficient to establish a controlled substance violation for removability purposes but that it constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d of ineligibility for cancellation of removal). The BIA did not err in dismissing Francis\u2019s appeal, so we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
