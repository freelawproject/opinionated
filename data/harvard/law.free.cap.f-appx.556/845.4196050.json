In 2005, he was transferred to Limestone Correctional Facility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where he remains, and placed on the list of \u201cchronic care\u201d patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-23\">Gillentine claims that his hepatitis C is not being treated at all; rather, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>resulting symptoms are being treated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, Gillentine claims that, without treatment of his hepatitis C, his condition will continue to deteriorate and will likely result in his death. Gillentine filed this lawsuit, claiming that Defendants violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to treat his hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Prior to the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on Gillentine\u2019s claims, Gil-lentine filed a motion for appointment of an expert witness to show that Defendants\u2019 care and treatment related to his hepatitis C constituted an actionable claim of deliberate indifference. A magistrate judge denied the motion because \u201c[ujnlike a criminal case, the court has no authority in this civil case to appoint an expert witness or to pay the expenses for the plaintiff to hire one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">On appeal, Gillentine argues that the magistrate judge erred in denying Gillen-tine\u2019s motion for the appointment of an expert medical witness because he believed that he lacked the authority to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that, under Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, courts have discretionary authority to appoint an expert and that discretion was not exercised here. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Rule 706 \u201cprovides the [district] court with discretionary power to appoint an expert witness either on the court\u2019s own motion or the motion of a party,\u201d and this authority is not limited to criminal cases. <em>See Steele v. Shah, </em>87 F.3d 1266, 1270-71 (11th Cir.1996) (determining that the district court, by failing to give an explanation for its denial of indigent plaintiffs motion to appoint an expert witness, had failed to exercise informed discretion, and requiring, on remand, the district court to reconsider the motion and exercise its discretion in accordance with Rule 706). Indeed, Defendants \u201cdo not dispute that under Federal Rule of Evidence 706, a district court does have the discretionary power to appoint an expert witness in a civil case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">This Court has not yet addressed the question of \u201cwhether, or under what circumstances\u201d a district court may apportion all of the costs of a court-appointed expert to the non-indigent parties in a lawsuit. <em>See Young v. City of Augusta, Ga., </em>59 F.3d 1160, 1170 (11th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>decide this question now and instead allow the district court to decide whether it is even necessary to reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">\u201cWe emphasize that we do not here offer any opinion on the propriety of appointing an expert witness; we only direct that discretion on the matter be exercised and reflected in a reasoned ruling.\u201d <em>Steele, </em>87 F.3d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and remand for the district court to consider Gillentine\u2019s motion for an expert witness, exercising its discretion in accordance with Rule 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-15\">. Gillentine proceeded <em>pro se </em>in the district court, but we appointed him counsel on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-25\">. Correctional Medical Services, Inc., which is now known as Corizon, Inc., began providing medical services to inmates, like Gillen-tine, incarcerated at Limestone Correctional Facility on November 1, 2007. Defendants are all employees of Corizon, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">. Specifically, Gillentine's fluid retention, ammonia levels, and blood pressure are being controlled with medication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">. We reject Defendants\u2019 argument that we lack jurisdiction to review the magistrate judge\u2019s order because Gillentine did not mention that order in his notice of appeal. In his notice of appeal, Gillentine indicated that he was appealing from the district court\u2019s \"Final Order of Dismissal.\u201d That was all that was necessary. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (providing that, were a plaintiff seeks review of the entire final judgment a \"notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\u201d); <em>Barfield v. Brierton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 930-31 (11th Cir.1989) (providing that \"the appeal from a final judgment draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment\u201d and determining that this Court had jurisdiction to review the district court's earlier interlocutory rulings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b872-12\">.Other circuit courts have addressed this question. See <em>McKinney v. Anderson, </em>924 F.2d 1500, 1511 (9th Cir.) (concluding that Rule 706 permits a district court to apportion all of the cost to one side in an appropriate case), <em>vacated on other grounds, Helling v. McKinney, </em>502 U.S. 903, 112 S.Ct. 291, 116 L.Ed.2d 236 (1991), <em>judgment reinstated, McKinney v. Anderson, </em>959 F.2d 853 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Webster v. Sowders, </em>846 F.2d 1032, 1038-39 (6th Cir.1988) (concluding that the district court \"has authority to apportion costs under this rule, including excusing impecunious parties from their share\"); <em>U.S. Marshals Serv. v. Means, </em>741 F.2d 1053, 1057 (8th Cir. 1984) (en banc) (determining that the district court has \"discretionary power\u201d to call indigent litigants\u2019 \"lay and expert wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>nesses as the \u25a0 court\u2019s own witnesses and to order the government as a party to this case to advance their fees and expenses, such advance payment to be later taxed as costs\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
