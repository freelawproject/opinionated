We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On November 25, 2011, Aventura Police Department, Crime Suppression Unit Detective Kenneth Sealy was on patrol at the Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida. Mall security alerted Detective Sealy to the presence of Torres-Bonilla at an ATM on the first level. Detective Sealy and his partner, Detective Sean Bergert, observed Torres-Bonilla remove a plastic card from his right pocket, swipe his left hand over the back of it, insert the card into the ATM, remove the card and currency, place it in his left pocket, and then take a different card from his right pocket to repeat the process. When an individual stood in line behind him, Torres-Bonilla stopped using the ATM and walked toward a second ATM in the mall. Torres-Bonilla repeated this same transaction pattern at a second and third ATM. At a fourth ATM, Torres-Bonilla stood in line behind another person; when someone got in line behind him, he walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">Torres-Bonilla exited the mall and Detectives Sealy and Bergert decided to make contact with him. Detective Sealy displayed his badge and called out, \u201cSir, excuse me. Police.\u201d R at 441. Torres-Bonilla looked back but did not stop. Detective Sealy then shouted, \u201cSir, police. Can I speak with you?\u201d R at 441. Torres-Bonilla turned around; he again failed to stop. He then ran away at a light jogging pace and entered the driver\u2019s seat of a minivan. He started to drive away, but another officer, who was driving an unmarked car, responded and pulled in front of Torres-Bonilla\u2019s vehicle to block his exit.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Detectives Sealy and Bergert approached the minivan. Detective Sealy approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and smelled a strong odor of burned marijuana inside. Torres-Bonilla was in the front seat, his girlfriend was in the passenger seat, and an infant child was in a car seat in the back seat. Detective Sealy did not have his weapon drawn, and Detective Bergert could not recall whether he had drawn his weapon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Detective Sealy identified himself as a police officer, explained he was investigating suspicious behavior he had observed inside the mall, and requested Torres-Bonilla\u2019s identification. Torres-Bonilla refused. Detective Sealy again stated his request. When Torres-Bonilla again refused, Detective Sealy warned that failure to provide identification could result in his arrest under Florida law. Detective Sealy asked Torres-Bonilla about the ATM transactions and the smell of marijuana, to which Torres-Bonilla responded the cards were his and Detective Seales \u201cnose must [have been] broken.\u201d R at 469. Torres-Bonilla refused to identify himself for a third time. Detective Sealy arrested him for resisting an officer without violence and for loitering and prowling, in violation of Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 848.02, 856.021.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Detective Sealy then searched Torres-Bonilla. He found nine Wal-Mart prepaid debit cards, several ATM withdrawal receipts, and over $1,700 in cash. All of the cards had an activation label on the back that appeared to have been pulled back; underneath the label, there was a person\u2019s written name and a numerical code that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>appeared to be a personal identification number. The ATM receipts showed withdrawals in the mall shortly before Torres-Bonilla was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Torres-Bonilla\u2019s vehicle was checked for visible weapons and then towed to the Aventura Police Station. Pursuant to department policy, the officers conducted an inventory search of the vehicle. The search uncovered additional Wal-Mart debit cards in Torres-Bonilla\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s purse and in the baby bag, additional ATM receipts, and about two grams of marijuana within two plastic bags. In total, the search of Torres-Bonilla and his vehicle yielded 28 Wal-Mart debit cards and ATM receipts reflecting approximately $4,000 in withdrawals, dated November 23, 2011, through November 25, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Further investigation revealed the transaction history for the cards. The transaction history showed the U.S. Treasury had deposited several individuals\u2019 tax refunds into the accounts associated with the cards. Twenty-eight debit cards were loaded with approximately $117,000 in 2010 tax refunds in the names of 28 different victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">A federal grand jury indicted Torres-Bonilla for using an unauthorized access device, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2); possessing 15 or more unauthorized access devices with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3); and transferring, possessing, or using, without lawful authority, the means of identification of another, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l). Prior to trial, Torres-Bonilla moved to suppress all physical and testimonial evidence found as a result of his arrest. The district judge heard the evidence and denied the motions. The judge determined Torres-Bon-illa\u2019s arrest and the searches of his person and his car were based on probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">After a jury trial, Torres-Bonilla was found guilty on all six counts. He moved for a judgment of acquittal or new trial and argued in part the district judge had violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause by limiting a portion of his cross-examination of Detective Sealy. The motion was denied; the district judge subsequently sentenced Torres-Bonilla to 192 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Torres-Bonilla raises five arguments on appeal. First, he argues the district judge erred when he denied his motion to suppress. Second, he asserts the district judge violated Torres-Bonilla\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him at trial by placing a time limit on his cross-examination of a police officer and by not allowing him to recall the officer during the defense case-in-chief. In his final three arguments, Torres-Bonilla contends the district judge clearly erred when he assessed Sentencing Guideline enhancements for (1) a loss amount of more than $120,000, (2) the production or trafficking of an unauthorized or counterfeit access device, and (3) 10 or more victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Torres-Bonilla argues the district judge erred when he denied his motion to suppress. We review the denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 753-54 (11th Cir.2000). Rulings of law are reviewed de novo, while the district judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>When considering a ruling on a suppression motion, all facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id. </em>at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Officers may stop and briefly detain a person to investigate a reasonable suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>cion of criminal activity, even though probable cause may be lacking. <em>See Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 754 (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). When determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, a judge must review the totality of the circumstances to ascertain whether officers had a particularized and objective basis to suspect unlawful conduct. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002). Flight from law enforcement is a relevant factor in determining whether reasonable suspicion exists. <em>See Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Whereas an investigatory detention requires only reasonable suspicion, a seizure or arrest must be supported by probable cause. <em>United States v. Virden, </em>488 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007). Probable cause to arrest exists when the totality of the circumstances warrants a reasonable belief that the suspect has committed or is committing a crime. <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.2007). Whether a <em>Terry </em>stop has matured into an arrest depends on several factors, including: (1) the law-enforcement purposes served by the detention; (2) the diligence with which officers pursued the investigation; (3) the scope and intrusiveness of the detention; and (4) the duration of the detention. <em>Virden, </em>488 F.3d at 1321. Some restriction of freedom of movement alone is not sufficient to transform a <em>Terry </em>stop into a de facto arrest. <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>363 F.3d 1141, 1147 (11th Cir.2004). Similarly, an investigatory stop does not necessarily ripen into an arrest because an officer draws his weapon. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Two detectives with debit-card-fraud training and experience watched Torres-Bonilla conduct suspicious transactions at multiple ATMs in the same mall. The detectives observed Torres-Bonilla peel stickers from each ATM card, look around to check to see if he was being watched, take a long route from one ATM to another after seeing uniformed officers walking toward him, and leave ATM lines when others got in line behind him. Torres-Bonilla also ignored the detectives\u2019 requests to stop and speak with them as he walked with a quickening pace toward his van. Construing these facts in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 753-54, there was reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. <em>See Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750; <em>Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Contrary to Torres-Bonilla\u2019s argument, his brief, initial detention\u2014during which one officer may have drawn his weapon\u2014did not constitute an arrest requiring probable cause. When the officers first stopped Torres-Bonilla, they did not place him in handcuffs, take him into custody, or move him or his van to another location. <em>Cf. Virden, </em>488 F.3d at 1321 (concluding a seizure which involved transporting the defendant\u2019s vehicle to a new location two miles away and, without formally arresting him, handcuffing the defendant and driving him to another location was \u201cunreasonable absent probable cause because of its scope and intrusiveness\u201d). Rather, Detective Sealy immediately told Torres-Bonilla why the officers wanted to speak with him and asked for his driver\u2019s license. <em>See Acosta, </em>363 F.3d at 1146; <em>Gordon, </em>231 F.3d at 754. Regardless of whether an officer had his weapon drawn, the officers acted quickly in a manner designed to confirm or dispel their suspicions. <em>See Acosta, </em>363 F.3d at 1146.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Moreover, there was probable cause to arrest Torres-Bonilla under section 856.021, Florida Statutes, almost immediately after his initial detention began, once he refused the officers\u2019 request for identification. Under Florida law: \u201cIt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>unlawful for any person to loiter or prowl in a place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 856.021(1). \u201cAlarm\u201d is presumed under the second element of \u00a7 856.021 if, when law enforcement appears, the defendant flees or refuses to' identify himself. <em>See State v. Ecker, </em>311 So.2d 104, 106 (Fla.1975); <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 856.021(2) (\u201cAmong the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm or immediate concern is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon appearance of a law enforcement officer [or] refuses to identify himself or herself.\u201d). A person\u2019s refusal to respond to a request for identification is \u201cmerely a circumstance to consider in deciding whether the public safety is threatened,\u201d which \u201ccomes into play only after the two elements of section 856.021 have been established.\u201d <em>Watts v. State, </em>463 So.2d 205, 207 (Fla.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">The officers\u2019 observations of Torres-Bonilla inside the mall satisfied the first element of section 856.021, because the officers saw him loitering at several ATMs \u201cin a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 856.021(1); <em>Ecker, </em>311 So.2d at 106. Regarding the second element, the officers were entitled to be reasonably and justifiably concerned that the property of others was at risk, based on the combined sum of all of Torres-Bonilla\u2019s suspicious activities in the mall, his attempts to evade the officers, and his refusal to provide identification. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 856.021(1), <em>Watts, </em>463 So.2d at 207; <em>Ecker, </em>311 So.2d at 106. Accordingly, the district judge properly denied Torres-Bonilla\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">B. <em>Limiting Cross-Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Torres-Bonilla argues the district judge violated his right to confront the witnesses against him at trial by placing a time limit on his cross-examination of Detective Sealy and by not allowing him to recall the detective during the defense case-in-chief. We generally review a district judge\u2019s decision to limit cross-examination for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1295 (11th Cir.2009). A district judge\u2019s discretion in limiting the scope of cross-examination, however, also is subject to the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">To show a Confrontation Clause violation, a defendant must establish he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a witness\u2019s bias, and thereby to expose facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences relating to the witness\u2019s reliability. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1178 (11th Cir.2007). The fact that a defendant sought to explore bias on the part of a prosecution witness does not automatically void the judge\u2019s ability to limit cross-examination. <em>Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d at 1296. The defendant is entitled only to an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to the extent, the defendant might wish. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, a defendant is entitled to cross-examine a witness only if the information sought to be elicited is relevant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Torres-Bonilla has not established the district judge prohibited him from recalling Detective Sealy during the defense case-in-chief. Although the judge initially stated Torres-Bonilla could not recall Detective Sealy, the judge thereafter instructed counsel for Torres-Bonilla to discuss his proposed line of questioning of Detective Sealy off the record before calling him again. Counsel agreed but did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>seek to recall Detective Sealy thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Additionally, Torres-Bonilla has not shown the district judge\u2019s limitation of his previous cross-examination of Detective Sealy during the prosecution\u2019s case violated his confrontation rights. Although Torres-Bonilla has identified several questions he would have asked Detective Sealy, had he been given more time, he has not explained how the answers to any of his proposed questions would have exposed bias. His proposed question about what would have happened had he produced his driver\u2019s license would have been irrelevant. <em>See Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d at 1296. His proposed questions about why names and numbers appeared on stickers on the debit cards found in his possession similarly would have been inappropriate, because there was no suggestion that Detective Sealy had anything to do with the information on the cards. While TorresBonilla asserts he wanted to inquire why certain investigative methods were not used, he has not explained how the answers to any of those questions would have exposed bias or otherwise been relevant to any contested issues. <em>See id.; Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d at 1178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Moreover, during Torres-Bonilla\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Sealy, Torres-Bonilla was able to expose (1) inaccuracies in Detective Sealy\u2019s initial incident report, (2) Detective Sealy\u2019s failure to acquire video recordings of the incident, (3) Detective Sealy\u2019s failure to record his conversation with Torres-Bonilla, and (4) Detective Sealy\u2019s failure to verify Torres-Bonilla personally had engaged in every transaction associated with all of the debit cards and to obtain the personal identification numbers associated with each of the cards. Torres-Bonilla further elicited from Detective Sealy that, although Detective Sealy testified he smelled burned marijuana when he first approached Torres-Bonilla\u2019s van, no marijuana was found during the initial search of the van. Torres-Bonilla asked Detective Sealy several questions about officers\u2019 activities the day of Torres-Bonilla\u2019s arrest. He had an adequate opportunity to present the jury with sufficient evidence with which to evaluate Detective Sealy\u2019s credibility, and Torres-Bonilla has not shown how additional questioning would have given a reasonable jury a different impression of Detective Sealy\u2019s credibility. <em>See Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d at 1296; <em>Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d at 1178-79. Therefore, Torres-Bonilla has not shown the district judge abused his discretion when he limited further questioning of Detective Sealy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">C. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Torres-Bonilla argues the district judge clearly erred, when he assessed Sentencing Guidelines enhancements for (1) a loss amount of more than $120,000, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>production or trafficking of an unauthorized or counterfeit access device, and (3) 10 or more victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">1. Loss Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We review a district judge\u2019s loss determination for clear error, and his interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011). The loss determination need not be made with precision; the figure need only be a reasonable estimate given the available information. <em>Id. </em>The amount of loss must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence; the burden must be satisfied with \u201crehable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>485 F.3d 1291, 1304 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by 8 levels where the loss exceeds $70,000, but is less than $120,000, and by 10 levels where the loss exceeds $120,000, but is less than $200,000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(E), (F). In determining a defendant\u2019s offense level based on the amount of loss, the district judge must take into account the conduct charged and all relevant actions. <em>United States v. Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d 1335, 1344 (11th Cir.2009). In a case involving counterfeit or unauthorized access devices, the minimum loss amount is $500 per access device. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(F)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">During Torres-Bonilla\u2019s trial, the government presented testimony that: (1) most of the account-holders associated with each card were born in 1941 or 1942; (2) most of the account-holders were clients of Compass Health System, where the mother of Torres-Bonilla\u2019s child worked; and (3) 28 tax returns filed for the year 2010 all resulted in refunds of similar amounts deposited in accounts associated with prepaid cards, all of which had the same routing number. Torres-Bonilla has not shown the district judge clearly erred when he determined the initial tax-refund deposits associated with the 23 cards for which information was available \u2014 $117,949.69\u2014constituted relevant conduct and was a reasonable estimate of the losses associated with those 23 cards. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(2), 2B1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 3(A); <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1197; <em>Hoffman-Vaile, </em>568 F.3d at 1344. Because actual-loss information was not provided for the remaining 5 cards, the district judge properly imposed the minimum loss amount of $500 per card. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(F)(i). Based on a total of $120,449.69, the district judge did not clearly err when he determined the loss amount exceeded $120,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">2. Production of an Unauthorized Device</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">We review a district judge\u2019s application of a sentencing enhancement for production of an unauthorized access device for clear error. <em>See Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1203. A two-level enhancement applies where the offense involved the \u201cproduction or trafficking\u201d of any \u201cunauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(B)(i). The term \u201caccess device\u201d includes account or personal identification numbers that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e); <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1201. An access device is \u201ccounterfeit\u201d if it is forged and \u201cunauthorized\u201d if it has been obtained with intent to defraud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 9(A) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(2), (3)); <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1201. The term \u201cproduction\u201d includes duplication. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 9(A); <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Torres-Bonilla has not shown the district judge clearly erred when he determined the initial tax-refund deposits associated with 23 of the cards at issue constituted relevant conduct. In order to obtain the improper tax refunds, it was necessary to duplicate the Social Security numbers of others with intent to defraud the United States Treasury. The judge correctly found Torres-Bonilla\u2019s relevant conduct included the duplication or \u201cproduction\u201d of Social Security numbers that were obtained with intent to defraud to be \u201cunauthorized access devices.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(11)(B)(i) &amp; cmt. n. 9(A); <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">3. Number of Victims</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">We review a district judge\u2019s calculation of the number of victims for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013). A two-level sentencing enhancement applies, where the offense involved 10 or more victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A). In cases involving means of identification, the term \u201cvictim\u201d includes \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 4(E)(ii); <em>United States v. Philidor, </em>717 F.3d 883, 885-86 (11th Cir.2013) (per cu-riam). When the Internal Revenue Service issues refunds for tax returns listing certain Social Security numbers, the district judge may infer the Social Security numbers correspond to actual persons. <em>Philidor, </em>717 F.3d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Torres-Bonilla has not shown the district judge clearly erred in determining the tax refunds associated with 23 cards constituted relevant conduct. In order to obtain those refunds, it was necessary to duplicate the Social Security numbers of 23 people. <em>See id. </em>Based on the testimony of 3 victims, who testified at Torres-Bonilla\u2019s trial, and the similarities between all of the relevant tax returns, the judge was entitled to find the Social Security numbers of the 23 persons whose tax refunds were deposited on the cards were used without the authority of those persons. Consequently, the judge correctly concluded Torres-Bonilla\u2019s relevant conduct included the unauthorized use of the Social Security numbers of 23 persons, and the offense involved 10 or more victims. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(2)(A) &amp; cmt. n. 4(E)(ii); <em>Philidor, </em>717 F.3d at 885-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-7\">. Torres-Bonilla testified Detective Bergert had drawn his weapon and had pointed it at him, when the detectives approached Torres-Bonilla's van.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">. We agree that placing time limits on the examination of witnesses is no substitute for limiting the examination in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence. If the examination is proper, artificial time limits simply have no place in the proceedings. <em>See United States v. McLain, </em>823 F.2d 1457, 1462 (11th Cir.1987) (recognizing that a district judge should use care when choosing to expedite cases, and \"[a] case involving a defendant facing a prison sentence is much more important than an overcrowded court docket\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Watson, </em>866 F.2d 381, 385 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b907-12\">. While Torres-Bonilla makes a passing assertion that the judge's limitation violated his right to compulsory process, he has failed to advance additional arguments in support of his assertion; consequently, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 23 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that an appellant abandons an issue if he fails to develop any argument in support of it in his opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">. Because Torres-Bonilla has advanced no additional arguments in support of his passing assertion that the amount of restitution imposed by the judge also was improper, that argument also fails. <em>See Woods, </em>684 F.3d at 1064 n. 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
