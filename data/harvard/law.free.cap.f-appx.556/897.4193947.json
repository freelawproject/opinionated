We granted Duhart a certificate of appealability (COA) on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-7\">(1) Whether the district court erred in concluding that Claim One (claiming ineffective assistance of counsel) was waived by virtue of Duhart\u2019s voluntary and knowing guilty plea; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-8\">(2) If the district court erred in concluding that Claim One was waived, whether it properly denied his sub-claim that counsel was ineffective in the pre-plea stage for advising him that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C) applied to his conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">(See Dkt. 27). While we agree with Du-hart that the district court erred by finding that he waived the ability to challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea, we affirm his conviction and sentence because Duhart fails to show that his counsel provided ineffective assistance that impacted the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error on a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence, and we review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Whether counsel provided ineffective assistance is a mixed question of law and fact that we also review de novo. <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Ordinarily, a defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings. <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984). But, a defendant can still maintain an attack on the voluntary and knowing nature of the guilty plea itself. Such an attack can be based upon ineffective assistance of counsel claims that go to the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea. <em>See Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1992). Because Duhart\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel challenged the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea itself, the district court erred by concluding (based upon the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation) that Duhart had waived the ability to raise this claim. <em>See Wilson, </em>962 F.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">The district court should have applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), test and evaluated the merits of Duhart\u2019s claim. <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test \u201capplies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish a constitutional claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must establish two things: (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the outcome of the case. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To succeed, a petitioner must satisfy both prongs. If a petitioner cannot satisfy one prong, we need not review the other prong. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">To prove deficient performance under the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>the prisoner must show that counsel made errors so serious that petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to function as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>2064. The prisoner must show \u201cthat counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d measured against \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. Scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance is highly deferential, and a strong presumption exists that counsel\u2019s performance fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. While counsel\u2019s \u201ctactical or strategic decision is unreasonable if it is based on a failure to understand the law,\u201d <em>Hardwick v. Crosby, </em>320 F.3d 1127, 1163 (11th Cir.2003), \u201ccounsel will not have rendered deficient performance for an error in judgment\u201d where the \u201clegal principle at issue is unsettled.\u201d <em>Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1144 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by six \u201c[i]f any victim sustained bodily injury\u201d and if the degree of bodily injury was permanent or life threatening. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C). Although several of our sister courts of appeals have held that bystanders and responding police officers qualify as victims under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C), the parties have called to our attention no binding caselaw of either the Supreme Court or this Court that has decided the question of whether a co-defendant injured during a robbery qualifies as a victim under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Duhart claims that his counsel performed ineffectively by advising him to accept a plea agreement applying the \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C) bodily-injury enhancement and failing to challenge the enhancement\u2019s applicability where his codefendant was the \u201cvictim.\u201d Despite these contentions, the district court did not err in denying Duhart\u2019s ineffective assistance claim because his counsel\u2019s advice to enter into this plea agreement fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Although none of the cases the Government brought to our attention directly address the issue of whether the term \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(3)(C) includes a co-defendant, these cases do illustrate a body of persuasive law from which the Government could have reasonably argued that the enhancement applied in this case \u2014 and on which the district court in fact relied in determining that the enhancement did apply. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Ortiz, </em>528 F.3d 74 (1st Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hidalgo, </em>197 F.3d 1108, 1109 (11th Cir.1999). A reasonable attorney could have challenged the applicability of the enhancement based on the absence of controlling law. But it was not objectively unreasonable for counsel to have advised Duhart that the enhancement applied given the absence of controlling law on the issue. <em>See Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1144 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Pitts v. Cook, </em>923 F.2d 1568, 1573 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Given the penalties Duhart faced, it was not objectively unreasonable for counsel to advise him to enter into a plea agreement which included the enhancement in exchange for the Government agreeing to dismiss three other counts against him\u2014 one of which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064-65. Because we conclude that Duhart failed to establish deficient performance under the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we need not address the second prong of the test involving prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. After careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Duhart\u2019s 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Anp\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Afs\">.
