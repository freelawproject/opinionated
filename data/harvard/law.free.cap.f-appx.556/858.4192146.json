She has at least a high school education and engaged in the following past relevant work: cashier, sales clerk, receiving clerk, hostess, waitress, and prep cook. The ALJ found that Davis had several severe impairments \u2014 among them a bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014during that November 30, 1994, to March 19, 2003, period, but nevertheless denied relief. The Appeals Council denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>review, and Davis brought this action in the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In the District Court, Davis argued that the ALJ erred in a number of ways, by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">(1) failing to follow the Court\u2019s Remand Order<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (2) posing an improper hypothetical [to the Vocational Expert (VE) ], especially when the proper hypothetical posed, a finding of disability is mandated; (3) failing to find Plaintiff disabled under Social Security Ruling (SSR) 83-14; (4) improperly analyzing Plaintiffs obesity; (5) failing to recognize all of Plaintiffs impairments; (6) failing to afford proper weight to Plaintiffs treating physicians; (7) failing to properly consider Plaintiffs fibromyalgia; and (8) failing to properly apply Eleventh Circuit\u2019s pain standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) at 7-8 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">The Magistrate Judge considered these points and, in his R &amp; R to the District Court, concluded that the ALJ had applied the correct legal standards and that the ALJ\u2019s decision denying Davis\u2019s applications was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Davis objected to the Magistrate\u2019s Judge\u2019s R &amp; R on three grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-12\">(1) \u201c[T]he ALJ failed to identify the functional limitations resulting from Plaintiffs bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and consequently the ALJ failed to incorporate any findings as to Plaintiffs bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome into a hypothetical posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). [Referring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>Remand Order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to explain why he did not afford the worker\u2019s compensation disability determination great weight. (2) [T]here should be an immediate finding that Plaintiff lacked bilateral manual dexterity, and such a finding in combination with Plaintiffs other impairments would warrant the conclusion that Plaintiff is disabled as a matter of law.\u201d (3) [T]he Magistrate Judge did not properly address the ALJ\u2019s failure to properly apply the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s pain standard .... [T]he Magistrate Judge improperly reasoned that there must be an objective basis for headaches, ... that headaches are a non-exertional impairment and objective evidence is not required to establish them as a basis for disabling pain. In addition, ... the Magistrate Judge erred by using daily activities as a method of refuting Plaintiffs pain testimony. Her testimony regarding her pain has not been properly refuted and, as such, must be accepted as true. Thus, ... she has satisfied the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s pain standard such that her level of pain in combination with all impairments proven and not refuted should result in a finding that she is disabled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">District Court Order at 4. The District Court rejected Davis\u2019s first ground, concluding that the Magistrate Judge did not err in concluding that the ALJ complied with the Remand Order; the ALJ did as ordered and identified the functional limitations resulting from Davis\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. He found that the syndrome \u201csignificantly limited [Davis\u2019s] ability to perform basic work activities such as lifting, pushing, reaching, carrying, or handling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. \u201cThe ALJ limited Davis to a reduced range of sedentary work, with lifting up to ten pounds only and no repetitive overhead reaching.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. Addressing the worker\u2019s compensation issue, the Magistrate Judge properly found satisfactory the ALJ\u2019s explanation for affording the worker\u2019s compensation determination practically no weight. The evidence of the worker\u2019s compensation determination consisted of a \u201csingle page conclusory document that was void of any substantive analysis or explanation of the basis for that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. As for the hypothetical posed to the VE, the District Court concluded that the Magistrate Judge had not erred in determining that Davis \u201cdid not demonstrate functional limitations related to her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome beyond those identified in the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d); and thus, the ALJ did not need to include any further limitations with respect to manipulation or handling in his hypothetical to the VE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The District Court rejected Davis\u2019s second ground, concluding that the Magistrate Judge did not err in finding the ALJ\u2019s treatment of the issue well-founded. The record supported the ALJ\u2019s declination to find that Davis \u201clacked the good use of both her hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Her \u201cmedical history indicated that [she] consistently demonstrated good range of motion and good grip strength of her wrists and normal fine and gross manipulation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">As for Davis\u2019s third ground, the District Court found no error in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ properly applied this circuit\u2019s pain standard in considering Davis\u2019s subjective pain testimony regarding her headaches and her other impairments. \u201c[Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that [Davis\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>impairments did not correlate with [her] subjective complaints.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">In prosecuting this appeal, Davis argues that \u201cthe hypothetical [question] used as a basis for [the ALJ\u2019s] decision was incomplete since no limitation from an impairment which was deemed to be severe, that of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, was given in [the] hypothetical [question] to the VE.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. According to Davis, the ALJ should have included a functional limitation of her hands in the hypothetical question \u2014 because he had already been determined that the syndrome was a severe impairment \u2014 and that had he done so, he would have granted her DIB and SSA applications. Davis also says that the ALJ would have granted the applications had she supported her argument that the hypothetical question was incomplete with a statement that the ALJ should have given \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the state worker\u2019s compensation determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and determine whether his final decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not reweigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner. <em>See id. </em>at 1211, 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Eligibility for disability insurance benefits requires that the claimant is under a disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(a)(1)(E). In order to determine whether a claimant is disabled, the Social Security Administration applies a five-step sequential evaluation. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). This process includes an analysis of whether the claimant: (1) is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity; (2) has a severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment; (3) has such an impairment that meets or equals a listed impairment and meets the duration requirements; (4) is unable to perform her past relevant work, in light of her residual functional capacity; and (5) cannot make an adjustment to other work, in light of her residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). A \u201csevere\u201d impairment does not necessarily indicate that a person has a disability qualifying her for benefits because it is possible that, even with the severe impairment, that person could still perform the work pertaining to her job after taking into consideration other vocational factors. <em>See McCruter v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1986) (finding that \u201cthe \u2018severity of a medically ascertained disability must be measured in terms of its effect upon ability to work, and not simply in terms of deviation from purely medical standards of bodily perfection or normality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Generally, \u201c[t]he findings of disability by another agency, although not binding on the [Commissioner], are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1241 (11th Cir.1983). Even when an agency\u2019s definition of disability differs from that of social security law, if the agency\u2019s disability definition is construed in a similar manner as the definition of disability under social security law, it is error for the ALJ to not give that agency\u2019s finding of disability great weight. <em>Falcon v. Heckler, </em>732 F.2d 827, 831 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">When a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, she must show evidence of an underlying medical condition, and either (1) \u201cobjective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain\u201d stemming from that condition, or (2) \u201cthat the objectively de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>termined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). The ALJ must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for choosing to discredit subjective testimony. <em>Id. </em>If the ALJ fails to articulate the reasons for discrediting subjective testimony, then, as a matter of law, the testimony must be accepted as true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The ALJ may consider the claimant\u2019s daily activities when evaluating her subjective symptoms, but a claimant\u2019s admission that she participates in daily activities for short durations does not necessarily disqualify her from a disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(S)(i); <em>see Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1441 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that the claimant\u2019s successful completion of a six-minute treadmill exercise was not necessarily indicative of his ability to work, and that the fact that he did housework and went fishing was not inconsistent with the limitations recommended by his treating physicians).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Under step five of the sequential evaluation process, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant is able to perform other work that exists in the national economy. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227. If the ALJ finds that the claimant is able to perform other work, he \u201cmust articulate specific jobs that the claimant is able to perform, and this finding must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere intuition or conjecture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One way in which the ALJ may determine that the claimant is able to perform other jobs is by posing a hypothetical question to a VE that comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>Id. </em>The hypothetical does not need to include any symptom alleged by the claimant that is not supported by medical evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe hypothetical need only include \u2018the claimant\u2019s impairments,\u2019 not each and every symptom of the claimant.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">After considering the parties\u2019 briefs and the record before the ALJ, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019 denial of Davis\u2019s DIB and SSA applications. First, the ALJ complied with the Remand Order. The ALJ had ample evidence on which to conclude that Davis did not have functional limitations of her hands notwithstanding that her bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is a severe impairment. He therefore was not required to include a hand limitation in the hypothetical posed to the VE. Moreover, as the Remand Order required, he thoroughly explained his reasons for not including a functional limitation of the hands in his question to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Second, the ALJ was plainly justified in giving little weight to the State of Florida\u2019s disability determination because all that Davis introduced was a one-page, concluso-ry document acknowledging that she was receiving worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">In sum, the ALJ did not err in relying on the VE\u2019s answer regarding the existence of jobs in the economy that Davis could perform in reaching his decision to deny Davis\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. The other impairments the ALJ found were: \"degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, status-post fusion (1993) and hardware removal (1998), history of shoulder bursitis, ... probable degenerative joint disease of the left knee, fibromyalgia, type II diabetes melli-tus, sensory neuropathy, asthma, hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflus (GERD), history of peptic ulcer disease, headaches, obesity, and depression.\u201d Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation dated February 22, 2013 (R&amp;R), at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. This case has a lengthy and complex procedural history that includes three applications, five administrative hearings, and three cases in the District Court. Davis first filed her application for a period of disability and DIB in March 1995, alleging a disability that began on November 30, 1994. An ALJ issued a partially favorable decision, finding that Davis was disabled as of her fiftieth birthday, March 20, 2003, but that she was not disabled prior to that date, and that she needed to demonstrate that she was under a disability on or before December 31, 1998, to satisfy the Social Security Act's insured-status requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">After an appeal and an administrative remand, a second ALJ found that Davis was not disabled for the period from November 30, 1994, to March 19, 2003. An appeal to the District Court resulted in the reversal of that finding and a remand for further consideration because: (1) the ALJ's decision did not mention or evaluate Davis's award of state worker's compensation benefits for a permanent and total disability; and (2) the ALJ had not found any residual functional capacity limitation arising from Davis\u2019s hand problem despite finding that Davis had a severe impairment of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">On remand, a third ALJ found as follows: (1) the limited evidence regarding the state\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation award was concluso-ry, did not explain the reasons for the award, and, if adequate, was inconsistent with the evidence in the record; (2) among other things, Davis had a severe impairment of bilateral caipal tunnel syndrome, and that the combination of Davis's issues with her upper and lower extremities and that syndrome suggested that all were severe and had a combined effect of limiting her ability to less than a reduced range of sedentary work, with lifting up to 10 pounds, no repetitive overhead reaching, and standing or walking only two hours in an eight-hour day. The ALJ also found that the evidence did not support any additional functional limitations based on Davis\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. Then, based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that there were jobs in significant numbers in the national economy that Davis could have performed during the period in question, even with her residual functional capacity, and accordingly denied her applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-14\">. The District Court remanded the case so the ALJ could (1) identify the functional limitations caused by Davis\u2019s bilateral caipal tunnel syndrome and (2) consider Davis\u2019s worker's compensation as probative evidence of disability or provide an adequate explanation for disregarding it as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. <em>See Susan J.
