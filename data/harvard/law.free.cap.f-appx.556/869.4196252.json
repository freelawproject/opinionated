Ruling in favor of Rock\u2019s former employer, BAE,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court dismissed the ISPPA claim because that st\u00e1tute did not provide for a private right of action, and dismissed the RICO claims because Rock\u2019s alleged business or property injuries were not the result of the claimed RICO predicate acts, and thus he lacked standing to sue under RICO. On appeal, Rock challenges both of these conclusions. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a statute provides a private right of action. <em>Touche Ross &amp; Co. v. Redington, </em>442 U.S. 560, 568, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979); <em>Dionne v. Floormasters Enters., </em>667 F.3d 1199, 1203 (11th Cir.2012). We also review de novo whether a party has standing to assert a RICO claim. <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 654 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. <em>Ironworkers Local Union 68 v. AstraZeneca Pharm., </em>634 F.3d 1352, 1359 (11th Cir.2011). We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>While courts are to liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, we are not required to \u201crewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-15\">First, we are unpersuaded by Rock\u2019s claim that the ISPPA provides a private cause of action. In answering this question, our \u201ctask is limited solely to determining whether Congress intended to create the private right of action asserted.\u201d <em>Touche Ross, </em>442 U.S. at 568, 99 S.Ct. 2479; <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>484 U.S. 174, 179, 108 S.Ct. 513, 98 L.Ed.2d 512 (1988). In this context, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Court has discussed four factors: (1) whether the plaintiff is a member of the class \u201cfor whose especial benefit\u201d the statute was enacted; (2) whether there is any indication of \u201clegislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one\u201d; (3) whether an implied private remedy is \u201cconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme\u201d; and (4) whether the cause of action is one \u201ctraditionally relegated to state law.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>484 U.S. at 179, 108 S.Ct. 513. However, while these four factors are \u201crelevant,\u201d the \u201ccentral inquiry remains whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action.\u201d <em>Touche Ross, </em>442 U.S. at 575-76; <em>see also Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 316, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979) (noting that criminal statutes \u201crarely\u201d are read to imply a private right of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The ISPPA, which is part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, provides that a person who travels in interstate commerce with the intent to harass or intimidate another person and who, in the course of such travel, places the victim in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury, shall be punished as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261(b), which addresses interstate domestic violence, and provides for both imprisonment and fines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2261A, 2261(b); see Pub.L. No. 103-322, Title IV, 108 Stat. 1796, 1902, 1926-31 (1994). Under the statute, a court may order, \u201cin addition to any other civil or criminal penalty authorized by law,\u201d that a defendant convicted under \u00a7 2261A pay restitution to the victim for the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2264(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Nevertheless, having carefully reviewed \u00a7 2261A, we cannot find anything in its plain language to indicate that it is more than a \u201cbare criminal statute.\u201d <em>See Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 80, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). Section 2261 also does not explicitly contain a private right of action, and \u00a7 2264\u2019s provisions for restitution plainly state that the penalty is \u201cin addition to any other\u201d penalty authorized by law \u2014 thus, neither of these provisions provide for a private right of action either. Further, there is no evidence from which we can infer that Congress intended to create a private right of action under \u00a7 2261A. The legislative history does not suggest that Congress contemplated a private right of action, and in fact indicates the opposite \u2014 that Congress only intended to aid law enforcement in their criminal investigations and prosecutions. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 104-557, at 2-3. Nor does it appear that Rock, who alleges harassment by his employer, is a member of the protected class for whom \u00a7 2261A was especially enacted, namely victims of domestic violence. <em>See </em>Combating Violence Against Women: Hearing on S. 1729 Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 3-4, 11-14 (1996); <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 79, 95 S.Ct. 2080. For the same reason, a private right of action would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the statute. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 104-557, at 2-3; <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 79, 95 S.Ct. 2080. In short, there is no basis from which we can or should infer a private right of action, and the district court properly dismissed Rock\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">We also find no merit to Rock\u2019s claim that he had standing to sue under RICO. RICO provides for civil and criminal liability against persons engaged in \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c); <em>Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., </em>547 U.S. 451, 453, 126 S.Ct. 1991, 164 L.Ed.2d 720 (2006). To recover on a civil RICO claim, \u201cthe plaintiffs must prove, first, that \u00a7 1962 was violated; second, that they were injured in their busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ness or property; and third, that the \u00a7 1962 violation caused the injury.\u201d <em>Cox v. Adm\u2019r, U.S. Steel </em>&amp; <em>Carnegie, </em>17 F.3d 1386, 1396 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006). In order to show a \u00a7 1962 violation, a plaintiff \u201cmust satisfy four elements of proof: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1282 (quotations omitted). To show \u201cconduct of an enterprise,\u201d a plaintiff must show that an enterprise, which \u201cincludes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,\u201d had a common goal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4); <em>Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1283. A RICO \u201cpattern\u201d is two predicate acts of racketeering within a ten-year period, and \u201cracketeering activity is any act which is indictable under the list of criminal offenses in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961(5); <em>Langford v. Rite Aid of Ala., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 1308, 1312 (11th Cir.2000). This list of criminal offenses includes: obstruction of criminal investigations relating to a violation of federal law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510; intimidating a person in order to prevent his testimony in an official proceeding or prevent the person from informing the police about the commission of a federal offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b); and retaliating against a witness regarding a federal offense by interfei\u2019ing with his lawful employment or livelihood, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(e). Notably, the federal obstruction and witness intimidation claims are only applicable to <em>federal </em>proceedings. <em>See Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\">In order to have standing under RICO, a civil plaintiff must show that he suffered business or property injuries as a result of a RICO violation. <em>See Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1287 (stating that this requirement \u201cimplicates two concepts: (1) a sufficiently direct injury so that a plaintiff has standing to sue; and (2) proximate cause,\u201d and noting that the two concepts have \u201csignificant overlap\u201d). Although RICO is to be \u201cread broadly, the injury to business or property limitation on RICO standing has a restrictive significance.\u201d <em>Ironworkers, </em>634 F.3d at 1361 (quotation and citation omitted). Recovery based on personal injury, including claims of emotional and mental distress, is not cognizable under RICO. <em>Pilkington v. United Airlines, </em>112 F.3d 1532, 1536 (11th Cir.1997). In evaluating whether a \u00a7 1962 violation caused a civil plaintiffs injuries, the \u201ccentral question ... is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>465 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted). \u201c[0]ne or more of the predicate acts must not only be the \u2018but for\u2019 cause of the injury, but the proximate cause as well.\u201d <em>Green Leaf, </em>341 F.3d at 1307; <em>see Anza, </em>547 U.S. at 456, 126 S.Ct. 1991 (2006) (noting that proximate cause requires \u201csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged\u201d (quotation omitted)). A wrongful act is a proximate cause of injury \u201cif it is a substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation.\u201d <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>253 F.3d 641, 675 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Here, Rock does not have standing to sue under RICO. Rock\u2019s complaint alleged that his former employer, BAE, conspired to surveil, harass, and intimidate him; defamed him and denied him unemployment benefits; damaged his property; and, in addition to other state law offenses, assaulted him in violation of Florida law. He alleged that the two predicate acts of racketeering that allowed him to file a civil RICO suit were BAE\u2019s attempts to dissuade him from reporting the assaults. He further alleged that his business and property injuries consisted of a destroyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>shed, denied unemployment benefits, and lost employment opportunities due to BAE\u2019s defamation. However, based on the contents of the complaint, Rock has failed to allege any predicate acts under RICO, because, among other things, he failed to claim that the obstruction and witness intimidation allegations were related to <em>federal </em>proceedings. <em>See Green Leaf, </em>341 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Nor has Rock shown or attempted to explain how the injuries were directly and proximately caused by the alleged predicate acts. Instead, he argues that his damages were a \u201cnatural and foreseeable consequence\u201d of BAE\u2019s actions, which does not meet the requirement that the RICO predicate acts be \u201ca substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation.\u201d <em>See Maiz, </em>253 F.3d at 675 (citation and quotation omitted). Although Rock relies on <em>Keystone Insurance Co. v. Houghton, </em>a case in which the Third Circuit ruled that civil RICO plaintiffs can rely on predicate acts that form a pattern of racketeering \u201ceven though the specific act relied on has not caused direct injury,\u201d this \u201clast predicate act\u201d rule was overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>863 F.2d 1125, 1131-32 (3d Cir.1988), <em>overruled by Klehr v. </em>A.O. <em>Smith Corp., </em>521 U.S. 179, 186-91, 117 S.Ct. 1984, 138 L.Ed.2d 373 (1997). Accordingly, Rock cannot establish standing based on any claimed injuries proximately caused by BAE\u2019s attempts to dissuade him from reporting assaults. <em>See Ironworkers Local Union, </em>634 F.3d at 1361.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-12\">.

We decline to review Rock's arguments that BAE\u2019s defamation and wrongful denial of his unemployment benefits constitute RICO predicate acts because he has waived them by raising them for the first time on appeal and then only in his reply brief. <em>See Walker v.
