See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Raftopoulos argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">Raftopoulos, a career offender, walked into a bank in Palm Beach, Florida, with a black pouch strapped to his body and passed a note to a teller that stated as follows: \u201cI AM WILLING TO DIE FOR THIS MONEY. ARE YOU. ALL THE MONEY \u2014 STACK! NO DYE PACK-TRANSMITTER.\u201d With money in hand, Raftopoulos glanced at the teller and patted his black pouch. Raftopoulos had a criminal history of VI that included prior convictions for bank robbery and possession by a felon of a firearm equipped with a silencer. Raftopoulos blamed his crimes on various addictions, but the district court found that he had a \u201cpattern of criminal conduct [beginning at age 14 that] [was] interrupted primarily by time in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-18\">The district court reasonably determined that a sentence at the low end of Raftopoulos\u2019s advisory guideline range of 120 to 150 months of imprisonment was necessary to address his crime; his lack of respect for the law; his history of offenses involving \u201cforce and violence\u201d; and to prevent him from committing future similar crimes that endangered the public. See <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, Raftopoulos faced a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years, but was incorrectly assigned an offense level of 29 instead of an offense level of 32, <em>see </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (Nov. 2012), which would have resulted in a guidelines range between 151 and 188 months of imprisonment, id. ch. 5, pt. A. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of 120 months, which is well below the statutory maximum penalty for Rafto-poulos\u2019s offense. See <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-19\">We AFFIRM Raftopoulos\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
