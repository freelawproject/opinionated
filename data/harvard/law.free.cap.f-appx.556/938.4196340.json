(collectively \u201cRitz-Carlton\u201d). De La Flor suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while he was exercising in the fitness facility at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel located on South Beach in Miami, Florida. De La Flor complained that Ritz-Carlton negligently failed to have an automated external defibrillator in its fitness facility in South Beach and that Ritz-Carlton breached its contract by failing to fulfill promises made in its marketing materials to provide a \u201cstate of the art\u201d fitness facility. The district court dismissed De La Flor\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">The district court did not err by dismissing De La Flor\u2019s claim that Ritz-Carlton was negligent in failing to place a defibrillator in the fitness facility. Under Florida law, which the parties agree applies, if a person voluntarily undertakes to perform a duty that results in an injury to another, the person is liable if \u201chis failure to exercise [reasonable care] increasefd] the risk of such harm\u201d or \u201cthe harm [was] suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.\u201d <em>L.A. Fitness Int\u2019l, LLC v. Mayer, </em>980 So.2d 550, 560 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2008). De La Flor argues that Ritz-Carlton \u201cundertook the duty to provide\u201d a defibrillator by having one on the premises, but Ritz-Carlton was not required to have a second defibrillator, <em>see id. </em>at 559. De La Flor also argues that Ritz-Carlton assumed a duty to provide a defibrillator by recommending in its internal operating procedures that hotels adopt the industry standard of placing the machine in fitness rooms, but the adoption of industry standards by Ritz-Carlton did not create \u201can independent legal duty\u201d with which it had to comply, <em>see id. </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">De La Flor failed to state a claim that Ritz-Carlton breached its contract by failing to provide a defibrillator, oxygen, and aspirin in the fitness room. De La Flor alleged that he relied on representations made by Ritz-Carlton in its marketing materials that the fitness facility in South Beach was \u201cstate of the art,\u201d but those representations did not constitute an offer for De La Flor to accept. <em>See Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1256, 1272 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that an offer and acceptance are two of the four elements required to prove the existence of a contract). Moreover, those advertisements did not contain any representations about medical equipment, the presence of a defibrillator, or medication in the fitness facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>We AFFIRM the dismissal of De La Flor\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
