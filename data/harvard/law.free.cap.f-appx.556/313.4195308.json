He contends that the district court impermissibly considered the need for just punishment, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), when imposing his revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-22\">Because Preciado failed to object in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To succeed on plain-error review, Preciado must show (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>On such a showing, we may exercise our \u201cdiscretion to remedy the error\u201d if we conclude that it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, bracketing, emphasis, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-23\">There has been no showing that \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) informed the choice of the sentence. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court intended to select a \u201cjust punishment\u201d for Preciado\u2019s marihuana offense of conviction. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The court did not mention \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>or use the phrase \u201cjust punishment.\u201d The court stated that a sentence of twenty-four months was necessary, for punitive reasons, after first remarking that Preciado had two prior revocations with an imprisonment term of nine months on each. Considering the context of the proceeding and Preciado\u2019s significant history of ignoring the court\u2019s directives with regard to SR, the court\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cpunitive reasons\u201d when announcing the sentence was consonant with our teaching \u201cthat the goal of revocation is to punish a defendant for violating the terms of the supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Thus, we cannot conclude that the district court selected the sentence because of an impermissible focus on the marihuana offense of conviction rather than on Preciado\u2019s abuse of the court\u2019s trust by violating conditions of SR. <em>See id. </em>at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
