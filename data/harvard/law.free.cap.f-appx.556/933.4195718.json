Wald, Jr., brought this bad faith claim against State Farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d), which insured the driver responsible for an accident injuring Wald. The estate of the late driver, Sam Gus Felos, escaped liability beyond State Farm\u2019s policy limits despite a tort judgment against it because Wald failed to comply with the Florida probate code\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 738.702(1) (barring claims against estates \u201cunless filed in the probate proceeding on or before the later of\u2019 three months after notice by publication or thirty days after service of notice, where service is required), 783.702(4)(b) (excluding from the statute of limitations claims up to the policy limits of a casualty insurance policy). The district court granted summary judgment because, under Florida law, a third party bad faith claim is derivative of the insured\u2019s claim, and an insured suffers no injury supporting his or another\u2019s bad faith claim when he is not exposed to liability beyond his policy limits. <em>Perera v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>35 So.3d 893, 902 (Fla.2010); <em>Fid. &amp; Cas. Co. of N.Y. v. Cope, </em>462 So.2d 459, 461 (Fla.1985); <em>see also May v. Ill. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>190 F.3d 1200, 1202 (11th Cir.1999) (applying Florida law and concluding that \u201c[i]f a deceased insured\u2019s estate is not obligated to pay the excess judgment, then no cause of action for bad faith exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of State Farm based upon the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order filed on July 25, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AWi\">.
