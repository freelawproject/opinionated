Siler, Jr., United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b951-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Ramon Garcia was convicted on one count of manufacturing 100 or more marijuana plants, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(vii). He appealed his conviction, contending that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence seized from his house and a barn on his property. That appeal is now before us for the second time. All of the relevant facts and procedural history are set out in our earlier decision in this case, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>No. 12-11994, slip op. at 2-5 (11th Cir. June 6, 2013) <em>(Garcia </em>I), and we will assume the reader\u2019s familiarity with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">In our earlier decision, we resolved several issues concerning Garcia\u2019s motion to suppress, and we are bound by those determinations here. See <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe law of the case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d); <em>Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cLaw of the case binds not only the trial court but this court as well.\u201d); <em>Burger King Corp. v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>15 F.3d 166, 169 (11th Cir.1994). First, we held that exigent circumstances did not support the warrantless search of Garcia\u2019s home. <em>Garcia I, </em>slip op. at 5-10. Second, we held that the district court did not clearly err when it concluded that the barn on Garcia\u2019s property was located beyond the curtilage of Garcia\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 11 n. 2. That meant that the investigating officers were permitted to include their observations of the barn\u2019s surroundings when applying for a warrant to search Garcia\u2019s property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">We also surmised that the evidence collected from Garcia\u2019s property may have still been admissible, despite the fact that the initial search of his home was unlawful, because of the independent source exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 10-12. That exception has two requirements: (1) the warrant affidavit must establish probable cause independent of any information obtained during the initial illegal search, and (2) if the remaining information was sufficient to establish probable cause, the officers\u2019 decision to seek the warrant must not have been \u201cprompted by\u201d what they saw during the illegal search. <em>See United States v. Noriega, </em>676 F.3d 1252, 1260-61 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation marks omitted). We held in <em>Garcia I </em>that the first prong of the independent source exception was met. <em>Garcia I, </em>slip op. at 11-12. More specifically, we held that probable cause existed to search the premises, even without the observations Deputies Roe and Moody made inside Garcia\u2019s home, because of the observations officers made in the open fields surrounding the barn near the home. <em>Id. </em>We could not resolve the second prong of the independent source test, however, because there was an unresolved factual question as to whether the officers\u2019 decision to seek a warrant was \u201cprompted by\u201d their initial illegal search of Garcia\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 12. We therefore remanded this case to the district court for resolution of that factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">On remand, the district court held two hearings in which it heard testimony from Officer Roe and Sergeant Joshua Lee. Officer Roe, who had participated in the ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>tial illegal search of Garcia\u2019s home and had also observed outside the home evidence that Garcia\u2019s barn was being used to cultivate marijuana, testified at the first hearing that he would have searched the area surrounding Garcia\u2019s barn even if he had not smelled marijuana in Garcia\u2019s home when he illegally searched the residence. He further testified that, based solely on his observations near the barn, he would have contacted narcotics officers so they could obtain a search warrant for the premises. The district court credited Sergeant Roe\u2019s testimony and found that (1) he would have searched the area surrounding Garcia\u2019s barn even if he had not entered Garcia\u2019s home beforehand, and (2) he would have contacted narcotics officers based on his observations of the barn\u2019s exterior, even if he had not entered Garcia\u2019s home beforehand. Those findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Sergeant Lee, the officer who applied for the warrant to search Garcia\u2019s property, testified at the second hearing that he would have sought a search warrant to search the property, even if Officer Roe \u201chadn\u2019t gone into the house ... and made the observations that he did inside the residence.\u201d Sergeant Lee testified that he would have applied for the search warrant based on all the other evidence observed in the open area surrounding the barn on Garcia\u2019s property. The district court credited Sergeant Lee\u2019s testimony and found that his decision to seek a search warrant was \u201cbased primarily on his and other officers\u2019 observations of the area around [Garcia\u2019s] barn\u201d and that he would have sought a warrant to search the premises based solely on the observations of the outbuilding, even if the illegal search of Garcia\u2019s residence had not occurred. We see no clear error in those findings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The district court\u2019s factfindings lead us to conclude that the second prong of the independent source exception is met in this case. As a result, the evidence seized from Garcia\u2019s property was admissible under the independent source exception, and the district court did not err when it denied Garcia\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See Noriega, </em>676 F.3d at 1260-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AXP\">.
