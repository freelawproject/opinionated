On appeal, he challenges the District Court\u2019s application of an eight-level increase to his offense level based on the court\u2019s finding that his prior North Carolina conviction of possession with intent to sell or deliver more than 28 but less than 200 grams of cocaine (the \u201cNorth Carolina offense\u201d), for which he was sentenced to 8 to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment, qualified as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He argues that the district court erred in treating the North Carolina offense as an aggravated felony because, under North Carolina\u2019s then-mandatory sentencing scheme, he could not have received a sentence in excess of 12 months\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>ment. In addition to arguing that the North Carolina offense qualified as an aggravated felony, the government argues that Beiza-Hernandez\u2019s appeal is moot because he has already served his sentence of imprisonment and been removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">We review whether a case is moot <em>de novo. United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). Before assuming jurisdiction over any case, we must resolve any question of mootness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">\u201cArticle III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to the consideration of \u2018Cases\u2019 and \u2018Controversies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]n action that is moot cannot be characterized as an active case or controversy. A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>273 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations, alterations, and citation omitted). \u201cThe fundamental question with respect to mootness is whether events have occurred subsequent to the filing of an appeal that deprive the court of the ability to give the appellant meaningful relief.\u201d <em>Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d at 1189 (quotations, alterations, and ellipses omitted). We recognize three general exceptions to the mootness doctrine: \u201c(1) the issues are capable of repetition, yet evading review; (2) an appellant has taken all steps necessary to perfect the appeal and to preserve the status quo; and (3) the trial court\u2019s order will have possible collateral legal consequences.\u201d <em>Wakefield v. Church of Scientology of Cal., </em>938 F.2d 1226, 1229 (11th Cir.1991). In <em>United States v. Farmer, </em>923 F.2d 1557, 1568 (11th Cir.1991), an appeal raising sentencing issues, we held the appeal moot because the appellant had completed his sentence and advanced no argument that there may be other benefits in having his sentence reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), an alien may avoid removal from the United States and adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien: (1) \u201chas been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application\u201d; (2) \u201chas been a person of good moral character during such period\u201d; (3) \u201chas not been convicted of an offense under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3)]\u201d; and (4) \u201cestablishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). An alien convicted of a violation of \u201cany law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance\u201d is inadmissible and ineligible for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (2) (A) (i) (II); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C). An alien is also ineligible for cancellation of removal if he is convicted of an aggravated felony after admission. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">In <em>United States v. Orrega, </em>we held that that the government\u2019s appeal of an alien\u2019s sentence was not rendered moot by his removal from the country. 363 F.3d 1093, 1095-96 (11th Cir.2004). There continued to be an active controversy in the case because Orrega might, at some point, reenter the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1095. We noted that \u201c[although not dispositive, this possibility of re-entry is made more likely by the fact that Orrega lived in the United States for most of his life, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>entire family is in this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1095 n. 2. Even though the possibility of reentry was speculative, it prevented the government\u2019s appeal from being moot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">In <em>Mingkid v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>we reviewed a Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision that concluded, in relevant part, that the Mingkids\u2019 applications for asylum were frivolous. 468 F.3d 763, 767 (11th Cir.2006). On appeal, the government argued that we lacked the power to grant the Mingkids meaningful relief as to this issue because reversing the frivolity determination would not have any effect given that the Mingkids had already been ordered removed on other grounds and were thus inadmissible to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 768. The government claimed that the issue was moot because there was only a speculative possibility that the frivolity finding would have consequence if the Mingkids applied for some future benefit under the INA. <em>Id. </em>We held that the issue was not moot because \u201cvacating such a determination incontrovertibly leaves [the Mingkids] in better position than they would be in without our relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Beiza-Hernandez\u2019s removal after the completion of his sentence did not moot the sentencing issue raised in this appeal. There continues to be an active controversy in this case because BeizaHernandez may, at some point in the future, reenter the United States. This possibility, while speculative, is made more likely by the fact that he has lived in the United States since he was eight years old and has a number of family members currently living in the United States. <em>See Orrega, </em>363 F.3d at 1095 n. 2. Moreover, we have the power to grant Beiza-Hernandez meaningful relief. The record currently contains a finding that his North Carolina offense constituted an aggravated felony. If he applies for any relief under the INA, this finding will have consequences, such as making him ineligible for cancellation of removal; and vacating this decision would undoubtedly leave him in a better position than he would be without relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(b)(l)(C). Avoiding the mootness doctrine does not require that he show that he would necessarily succeed in obtaining cancellation but only that the judgment in this case has possible collateral legal consequences, such as impacting future proceedings under the INA. <em>See Wakefield, </em>938 F.2d at 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Aldrich, </em>566 F.3d 976, 977 n. 2 (11th Cir.2009). The interpretation of criminal statutes is a question of law that we also review <em>de novo. United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines mandate an eight-level increase to a defendant\u2019s offense level for the crime of unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States if he was deported or unlawfully remained here after a conviction for an aggravated felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The application notes to \u00a7 2L1.2 include a definition of \u201cfelony,\u201d which requires that the federal, state, or local offense be punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, but this definition specifically does not apply to subsection (b)(1)(C). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 2). For the purposes of applying this sentencing guideline, \u201caggravated felony\u201d has the meaning assigned in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)). Section 1101(a)(43) defines an aggravated felony as, among other things, \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802]), including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>a drug trafficking crime (as defined in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) ]).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Cocaine is a schedule II controlled substance. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(6), 812(c). Section 924(c) defines a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). In general, a felony is any crime for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is greater than one year. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), the Supreme Court addressed the question of \u201cwhether conduct made a felony under state law but a misdemeanor under the [CSA] is a \u2018felony punishable under the [CSA].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 127 S.Ct. at 627 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2)). Lopez received a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for the state offense of aiding and abetting another person\u2019s possession of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 127 S.Ct. at 628. The government began removal proceedings against Lopez and alleged, in relevant part, that his state conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court noted that mere possession of cocaine was not a felony under the CSA. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 127 S.Ct. at 629. The Supreme Court stated that to determine which state offenses qualified as felonies punishable under the CSA, the proper place to look was to the CSA\u2019s definitions of crimes punishable as felonies. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 127 S.Ct. at 630. The Court\u2019s analysis confirmed \u201cthat a state offense whose elements include the elements of a felony punishable under the CSA is an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 127 S.Ct. at 631. \u201c[T]he crimes the CSA defines as \u2018felonies\u2019 are those crimes to which it assigns a punishment exceeding one year\u2019s imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56 n. 7, 127 S.Ct. at 631 n. 7. As applied to Lopez, the government\u2019s reliance on the greater-than-one-year sentence under state law to define the crime as an aggravated felony was misplaced. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 127 S.Ct. at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Under North Carolina law, it is a crime to \u201cpossess with intent to manufacture, sell or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-95(a)(l). \u201cDeliver\u201d means \u201cthe actual constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 90-87(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">The CSA prohibits knowingly or intentionally possessing \u201cwith intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Under the CSA, \u201cdistribute\u201d means \u201cto deliver ... a controlled substance,\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d means \u201cthe actual, constructive, or attempted transfer of a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802(8), (11). The maximum statutory penalty for possession with intent to distribute any amount of cocaine less than 500 grams is 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The District Court did not err in finding that Beiza-Hernandez\u2019s North Carolina offense qualified as an aggravated felony. The parties do not dispute that Beiza-Hernandez was deported in 2008, four years after his conviction for that offense. Regardless of the sentence he could have received under North Carolina law, the relevant inquiry remains whether the state offense of which he was convicted qualifies as an aggravated felony because it contains elements punishable under the CSA by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. <em>See Lopez, </em>549 U.S. at 56 n. 7, 57, 127 S.Ct. at 631 &amp; n. 7. The elements of the North Carolina offense mirror the elements of possession with intent to distribute under the CSA. Both offenses require proof that a defendant possessed with the intent to deliver or distribute a controlled substance, and they use virtually identical definitions for the terms deliver and distribute, the only relevant terms that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>not repeated verbatim in both statutes. <em>Compare </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 90-95(a)(l) (using term \u201cdeliver\u201d), 90-87(7), <em>vnth </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(8), (11), 841(a)(1) (using term \u201cdistribute\u201d). Thus, Beiza-Hernan-dez\u2019s North Carolina offense qualifies as a felony punishable under the CSA, a drug-trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Accordingly, the district court properly applied an eight-level increase to Beiza-Hernandez\u2019s offense level based on the fact that he had been deported following the commission of an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Beiza-Hernandez\u2019s conviction is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
