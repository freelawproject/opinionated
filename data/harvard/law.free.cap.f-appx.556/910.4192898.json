Bran-scomb complained that the Navy discriminated against him based on a disability, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l)-(2), the Americans With Disabilities Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12203(a), and the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 791(g), and that the Navy interfered with worker\u2019s compensation benefits and rescinded a job offer to retaliate after Branscomb appealed his termination, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, <em>id., </em>and the Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). We affirmed the summary judgment against Branscomb\u2019s complaints of discrimination, but because that \u201cdetermination was not dispositive of Branscomb\u2019s [complaints of] retaliation,\u201d we \u201cvacate[d] the ... summary judgment as to the retaliation claim and remand[ed] ... to the district court to address the claim in the first instance.\u201d <em>Branscomb v. Sec\u2019y of the Navy, </em>461 Fed.Appx. 901 (11th Cir.2012). On remand, the district court entered summary judgment against Branscomb\u2019s complaints of retaliation. Branscomb argues that he established a prima facie case of discrimination, but his argument is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine, <em>see Schiavo ex. rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, </em>403 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). Branscomb also challenges the summary judgment against his complaints of retaliation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-19\">The district court did not err by entering summary judgment against Bran-scomb\u2019s complaint that the Navy retaliated by interfering with his worker\u2019s compensation benefits. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, Branscomb had to establish that he engaged in a protected activity; he suffered an adverse employment action; and the protected activity was causally connected to the adverse employment action. <em>See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1260 (11th Cir.2001). Branscomb argues that, after he appealed his termination to the Merit System Protection Board, he suffered two adverse employment actions when the director of the injury compensation program, Joseph Blanton, wrote letters to the Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs that contested Branscomb\u2019s application for benefits, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 10.111, 10.117, and that reported the decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the Board affirming Branscomb\u2019s termination and requested cessation of Bran-scomb\u2019s benefits, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 10.112, 10.117. Despite Blanton\u2019s letters, Personnel Management paid Branscomb disability benefits. Neither of Blanton\u2019s letters constituted an adverse employment action because they did not \u201cresult[] in some tangible, negative effect on\u201d Branscomb\u2019s receipt of worker\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>See Lucas, </em>257 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The district court also did not err by entering summary judgment against Bran-scomb\u2019s complaint that the Navy retaliated by rescinding a job offer. In January 2006, more than a year after his termination, Branscomb accepted an offer to work as an Emergency Services Dispatcher, but in March 2006, Blanton had to rescind the offer because the position was no longer available. Branscomb failed to establish that the retraction was causally related to a protected activity. <em>See id. </em>at 1260. In 2002, Branscomb filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and in March 2005, he appealed his termination, but those activities were too remote to establish causation based on close temporal proximity. <em>See Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cA three to four month disparity between the statutorily protected expression and the adverse employment action is not enough.\u201d). Bran-scomb accuses the Navy of having \u201cunclean hands\u201d and allowing \u201c[s]poilation of [e]vidence\u201d that would support his complaint of retaliation, but we will not consider these arguments because they are raised for the first time in Branscomb\u2019s reply brief, <em>see Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Branscomb argues that he should not have to pay the costs incurred by the Navy as the prevailing party, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1), but that issue is not ripe for review. The Navy did not move to recover its costs before Branscomb filed his notice of appeal. Because the written judgment does not assess any specific costs against Branscomb and simply invites the Navy to seek costs, we dismiss this part of Bran-scomb\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the Navy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
