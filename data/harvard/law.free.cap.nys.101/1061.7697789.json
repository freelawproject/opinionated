This motion was denied, and from the order entered upon that denial the plaintiff appealed. The plaintiff failed to serve the printed copies of the papers upon the appeal, as required by rule 41 of the general rules of practice, whereupon he made a motion at the Special Term to be relieved from the default. This default was in failing to file with the clerk of this court and serve upon the opposite party the papers upon which the appeal is to be heard in this court. Where there is a default in the service of a case on appeal, or in the filing of the case, as settled by the trial judge or referee, an application to open that default should be made at the Special Term; and where the default consists of a failure to file the printed copies of the papers on which the appeal is to be heard in this court, or to serve copies thereof upon the opposite party, the default is in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-16\">The preparation, settlement, and filing of the case or bill of exceptions is a part of the record of the court below, and is to be prepared, settled, and filed there, and an application to be relieved from a default must be made at Special Term. After the case is settled and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>filed, as prescribed by the Code and general rules of practice, the filing and service of the printed papers upon which the appeal is to be heard, as required by the general rules of practice, are a part of the appeal, and any default is a default in a proceeding which is a part of the appeal, and is regulated by the rules of this court. The question whether such a default should be enforced must be settled upon a motion, made in this court, either to be relieved from the default or to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
