The defendant denies violating the agreement, and alleges that the plaintiff refused to sell him beer, and for that reason he was compelled to procure beer elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>This action in effect is to specifically enforce a contract by a mandatory injunction. In such a case a temporary injunction should not be granted unless it appears that doing the act during the pendency of the action will \u201cproduce injury to the plaintiff.\u201d The effect of this injunction is to compel the defendant to purchase the beer that he-'requires from the plaintiff. The only injury that his not purchasing the beer of the plaintiff will produce will be loss of profits, and if the plaintiff succeeds he can obtain a judgment for such profits. The amount can be ascertained from the amount of beer that defendant used in the meantime. If the injunction in its present form is allowed to stand, if the plaintiff refuses to sell the defendant beer, the defendant will have to go out of business. The defendant can purchase no beer except that of the plaintiff, and there is no obligation on the part of the plaintiff to sell the defendant any beer at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">I think the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to continue the injunction denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
