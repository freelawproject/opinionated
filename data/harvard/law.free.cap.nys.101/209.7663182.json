He left his office, on the day he met the refusal, intending to go to his home, and, being invited by a friend, took a car, and, visiting with his friend, rode beyond the point where he would have transferred by the usual route to reach his home, and kept on riding away from his ultimate destination. Having finished his visit, he sought to reach his home by transferring from line to line, but was finally refused a transfer, and now accounts himself aggrieved by what he alleges was defendant\u2019s violation of the provisions of section 104 of the railroad law.
