The defendants counterclaimed $500 damages for breach of contract. The justice found for the defendants in the sum of $32.72 damages and costs.

The defendants claimed that plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>tiff\u2019s work was improperly done. The court apparently allowed both plaintiff\u2019s claim and the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, giving judgment for the difference in favor of defendants. The latter claim that they are tearing up the work done by plaintiff and doing it over again. They told plaintiff, if he would finish his work, they would pay him, but that he did not do so. An expert tile setter 'says the work was improperly done by plaintiff, and he estimated the cost of doing the work over at $300. For what the'additional $200 were allowed by the justice on defendants\u2019 counterclaim does not appear. While we do not wish to pass upon the weight of conflicting evidence, it seems to us that the ends of justice would be best served by allowing a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
