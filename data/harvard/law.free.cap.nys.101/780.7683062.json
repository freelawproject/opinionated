Defendant\u2019s north-bound car ran into the rear of the automobile as it was also proceeding northward. The plaintiff\u2019s damages as allowed by the court included an item of $150 for loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>of use of automobile. This finding was based upon expert testimony as to the value of the use of an automobile like the plaintiff\u2019s. There was no evidence to show that plaintiff used his automobile for any business purpose whatever. The inference from the evidence is that he used it for his pleasure and recreation. It does not appear that he hired any other vehicle to take its place. Under the circumstances, we think it was error to allow plaintiff to prove this item of $150. It was highly speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event, unless the plaintiff stipulates to reduce the judgment to $322.35, together with interest and costs below, in which case the judgment, as modified, will be affirmed, without costs of appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
