The answer denies all the allegations of the complaint, except the deposit of $50 for the sale of the house and lot, and the demand for a return of the money and refusal. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and judgment rendered in favor of the defendant. The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-17\">The evidence consists of a receipt, dated March 17, 1906, for the $50, signed by all the parties, and the testimony of one of the plaintiffs and the defendant. The receipt states that the $50 is received \u201cas a deposit on house, No. 20 Ames street, Brooklyn,\u201d and then specifies price, mortgages, payments, and says that \u201ccontract should be drawn on the 24th of March.\u201d There is no formal language setting forth an agreement to purchase and sell. Michael Kroshinsky, one of the plaintiffs, testified that he saw Mr. Klein on March 17th, and gave him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>money, and saw him sign the receipt, but that he (Kroshinsky) never made the contract as required by the receipt. The defendant testified that \u201csome brokers and one of those fellows\u201d came around Saturday,, and they said, \u201cOur lawyer is not here,\u201d and that they would come Monday. I said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201cAll right. We will leave it go until Monday. * * * I never saw them after this until the lawyer sent me a notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The record is barren of evidence tending to show why the contract was not made. So far as appears, it was no fault of the defendant. The complaint alleges that the sale was never consummated for the reason that the parties f\u00e1iled to agree upon the terms. The plaintiffs offered no proof in support of this allegation. The plaintiffs failed to make out a cause of action, and were properly nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Judgment must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
