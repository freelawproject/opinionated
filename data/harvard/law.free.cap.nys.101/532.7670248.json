The regular entrance to the portion of the building in which the business of Meyer Meyer &amp; Son is carried on is from the street; they are butchers, and there are means of access to their slaughterhouse from defendant\u2019s icehouse. In this passageway is an overhead rail used by defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s t\u00f3 shove along sides of beef. Plaintiff in June, 1904, was a customer of Meyer Meyer &amp; Son, and entered this passageway for the purpose of reaching the slaughterhouse. While there he was struck on the cheek by a side of beef which was being pushed along in the customary way, causing his injuries\u2014dislocation of lower jaw and loss of two teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">Under the authorities, the plaintiff upon the testimony was at best but a licensee, and the defendant owed him no duty of active care. McCann v. Thilemann, 36 Misc. Rep. 145, 72 N. Y. Supp. 1076; Downes v. Elmira Bridge Co., 41 App. Div. 339, 58 N. Y. Supp. 628; Baker v. Otis El. Co., 78 App. Div. 513, 79 N. Y. Supp. 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-19\">The \u201ctrolley\u201d appears to have been in good order, nothing out of the ordinary was being done, the plaintiff was familiar with the uses to which this passageway was put, and in entering upon it, even with the acquiescence of the defendant, he assumed at least the ordinary risks of the place and was bound to be particularly careful on that account. With such care he might have avoided the accident. \u201cAcquiescence is not invitation.\u201d Forbrick v. General Electric Co., 45 Misc. Rep. 452, 92 N. Y. Supp. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-20\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
