MILLIKEN BROS., Inc.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1137-7\">(Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Second Department</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ax73\">January 11, 1907.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1137-8\">1. Costs\u2014Action by Nonresident Administratrix\u2014Security for Costs\u2014 Discretion of Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1137-10\">Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3268, subd. 1, requires nonresident plaintiffs to give security for costs; but subdivision 4, providing for such security from persons suing in representative capacities, contains no provision relating to executors or administrators. Section 3271 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to require representative plaintiffs, including executors and administrators, to give such security. Plaintiff, a nonresident, was appointed administratrix in New York of a nonresident decedent\u2019s estate, and sued to recover damages for decedent\u2019s death. <em>Held, </em>a motion to require plaintiff to give security for costs was not a matter of right, but was addressed to the court\u2019s discretion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1137-11\">[Ed.

Clarendon, deceased, against Milliken Bros., incorporated, to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s intestate by reason of defendant\u2019s negligence.

Rodgers, 44 App. Div. 139; 61 N. Y. Supp. 1015, that this plaintiff was not required absolutely to give security for costs under section 3368 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Under section 3371 of that Code it was a matter of discretion with the court, and I think that its order should not be disturbed, inasmuch as it is within the rule which we laid down in McNeil v. Merriam, 57 App. Div. 164, 68 N. Y. Supp. 165, and Davidson v. Bos\u00e9, 57 App. Div. 212, 68 N. Y. Supp. 316, per Woodward, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-8\">\u201cThe court is not justified in extending its discretion to a case of this character, unless it is manifest that there is bad faith involved or some other serious objections to the parly proceeding without the guaranty provided for by the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">See, too, 2 Nichols\u2019 New York Practice, p. 1891, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">McNeil\u2019s Case, supra, is cited with approval in Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 80 App. Div. 542, 80 N. Y. Supp. 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">The order is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
