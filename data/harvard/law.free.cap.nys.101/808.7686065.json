The machine consists of two rollers, about 18 inches in length and between 4 and 5 inches in diameter, which were slightly corrugated, and which were operated in either direction by means of pulleys, belts, and an electric motor. The machine is about waist high, and is operated by the operator standing facing the side of the machine, with his right side towards it. The plaintiff described it as something like a clothes wringer, with a kitchen table at each side of it. Plaintiff said that, while operating it, he took hold of the candy with his left hand farthest from the rollers and his right hand on top of the candy, \u201cand this candy had either hardened or stuck to the table, and when I shoved my right hand slipped off the candy and caught in the rollers,\u201d and that the injuries for which he sued were thus received.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b841-4\">Appeal from Trial Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b841-5\">Action by George E.

Wales, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b841-9\">Charles R. Stewart, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b841-10\">CHESTER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au9\">It is claimed by the plaintiff that the action is brought under the employers\u2019, liability act (chapter 600, p. 1748, Laws 1902) and section 81 of the labor law (chapter 415, p. 480, Laws 1897), and the case was submitted to the jury by the court as having been brought under those acts. It is claimed by the appellant that the complaint was not sufficient for that purpose, as the only reference in the complaint to any facts which might be construed to have reference to the labor law or the employers\u2019 liability act is the allegation \u201cthat on or about the 25th day of June, 1904, plaintiff gave and served this defendant with a notice in writing, signed by him, of the time, place, and cause of the injuries for which this action is brought,\u201d and makes no reference in the complaint whatever to the statutes themselves. The only condition precedent for the bringing of the action under the employers\u2019 liability act is the'service upon the defendant of a notice in writing, within 120 days, of the time; place, and cause of the injury, and signed by the person injured, or some one in his behalf. It has been held in the Fourth Department (Monigan v. Erie R. R. Co., 99 App. Div. 603, 91 N. Y. Supp. 657) that the allegations in support of a cause of action under the common law and under the employers\u2019 liability act are the same, except that under the act there must be an allegation with respect to the service of the notice provided for therein-</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">But this complaint goes farther than that. In the fifth paragraph it is alleged \u201cthat it was the duty of the defendant under the laws and statutes of the state of New York * * * to furnish * * * proper and adequate tools and machinery, * * * properly guarded to avoid accidents.\u201d In the sixth paragraph it is alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>defendant omitted to furnish \u201cmachinery properly guarded.\u201d In the eleventh paragraph it is alleged \u201cthat solely by reason of defendant\u2019s negligence in not complying with its duties as aforesaid, and in not' complying with the statutes as aforesaid,\u201d the plaintiff was injured. Section 81 of the labor law requires that all machinery \u201cshall be properly guarded.\u201d We.think, therefore, it was a fair construction of the complaint on the part of the trial court to hold that the action was brought under these acts, and that he was right in submitting the case to the jury upon that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Notwithstanding this, we think there were errors on the trial that cannot be overlooked. The court declined to charge the jury, at the request of defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201cthat there is no evidence in the case authorizing the jury to impute negligence to the defendant on the character of this machine, excepting the question of this guard; that the guard is the only defect in the machine which they can in any way on any possible hypothesis attribute to or connect with the defendant\u201d \u2014and the court stated he would leave that whole question to the jury. This was excepted to. There was no such evidence, except as to the absence of the guard, and the jury should have been so instructed when the request was made, so that they might not speculate as to any other ground of liability with respect to the condition of the machine, which the proof showed was of standard make and similar in all respects to those used in all manufacturing establishments of the kind and was in good order.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The court also charged, over the defendant\u2019s exception, that it was the duty of the defendant under the law to promulgate rules and regulations for the operation of its factory and machinery; but he did not inform the jury, nor did the evidence show, what, if any, rule or regulation would have been effective to protect the plaintiff. The charge, therefore, left it for the jury to speculate as to what particular rule or regulation the defendant should have promulgated, and in doing so they were confined only by the realm of their imaginations, with no evidence in the case to serve as a guide in forming their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except PARKER, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
