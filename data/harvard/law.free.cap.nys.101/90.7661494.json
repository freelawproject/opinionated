The communication to the commissioner of public works by the assistant engineers, requesting the adoption of a sliding scale of salaries' based upon the length of service, giving to assistant engineers after 20 years\u2019 service an annual salary of $2,400, approved by the commissioner of public works and taken under consideration by the common council, did not receive the concurrence as to that part of the communication which provided for a salary of $2,400 after 20 years\u2019 service. The attention of the common council in passing upon such estimates of the bureau of engineering was not called to the fact that the commissioner of public works requested that warrants be drawn in favor of the two assistant engineers, petitioner and Buttolph, at the rate of $2,400 a year. Therefore it cannot be said that the common council, by its action in providing such estimates, intended to give its assent or concur with the commissioner of public works in fixing the salary of the petitioner at the sum named. Our conclusion is that, while the statute does not require any particular or special method or manner of fixing the salaries of the employ\u00e9s of the department of public works, the action of the commissioner in fixing such salaries must be called to the attention of the common council for its action and concurrence. The statute requires the affirmative and express sanction of the common council. The order denying the application for a peremptory writ of mandamus should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
