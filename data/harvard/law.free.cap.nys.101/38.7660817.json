Code, \u00a7 640d, relating to unauthorized offers for the sale of and unauthorized applications for loans on real property, but providing that the act shall not affect any judicial action pending in any court, the proviso saves the expense of costs to those who, acting on the existence of the repealed statute, were defending actions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b70-11\">2.

The legislative reason for making the exception referred to in section 3 must have been to save the expense of costs or disbursements to those who, acting upon the existence of the repealed statutes, were defending actions or proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Furthermore, Haynes et al. v. Abramson (Sup.) 97 N. Y. Supp. 371, seems an authority in support of the proposition, that where a contract, not unlawful in itself, has been executed, and the parties have enjoyed the benefits of the contract, the mere fact that one of the parties has violated a penal statute in the approach to the contract will not prevent a court from enforcing payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The judgment will be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
