This evidence warrants an inference of a request upon the part of the patient to have the operation performed, with an understanding that a reasonable compensation would be paid for the performance of it. The stipulation, it seems, was that the value of the services was $225. It is true that plaintiff\u2019s counsel said that it was stipulated \u201cthat the amount of recovery be $225,\u201d but this he followed by saying that \u201cthe value of the services * * * is $225.\u201d It seems quite clear that he corrected his first statement. This seems to have been the view of the learned trial justice, and we are unable to say that he was wrong. The point that the word \u201cas\u201d does not appear after Milburn and before \u201cexecutor\u201d is not important. At the beginning of the trial plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cThis is an action for services against the executor.\u201d The defendant apparently acquiesced. In' no way did he present at the trial the point he now makes, and therefore he should not now be permitted to raise it effectively. The summons seems to contain the word. The statute was matter of defense, and there was no evidence that it had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">GILDERSLEEVE and DUGRO, JJ., concur. DOWLING, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
