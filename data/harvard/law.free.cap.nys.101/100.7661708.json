When the plaintiff rested, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove the case under sections 39, 101, and 104 of the Railroad Law (Laws 1890, pp. 1096, 1113, 1114, c. 565). \u201cThe Court: In what respects do you claim that he has' failed to make o\u00fct a case? Defendant\u2019s Attorney: Upon the ground that he was not a bona fide passenger within the meaning of that act.\u201d The defendant offered no testimony. Briefs were submitted, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">There is some evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was a passenger desiring to make one continuous trip between two points on defendant\u2019s line. The admission by plaintiff upon the trial did not go farther than concede \u201cthat one of the purposes of the plaintiff in taking the trip was to ride to enforce the law, in case he was refused a transfer.\u201d The grounds of the decision are not stated in the record. It may very well be that the trial court found, as a matter of fact, that the plaintiff was a bona fide passenger desiring to make one continuous trip between two points of defendant\u2019s line. This case, therefore, does not necessarily turn upon the motive of plaintiff in boarding defendant\u2019s car. We agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that a construction of the language used in section 104 of the railroad law, as amended by chapter 676, p. 1406, Laws of 1892, as follows: \u201cAny passenger desiring to make one continuous trip between two such points\u201d\u2014by the appellate courts in this department, is very desirable. It should be done, however, in a case where it is conceded, or clearly appears, that the plaintiff was riding for the sole purpose of laying the foundation for a cause of action to recover the penalty under the statute. It was hoped that the Appellate Division would dispose of this question in McLean v. Int. St. Ry. Co. (Sup.) 87 N. Y. Supp. 135; but the judgment therein was modified, and the question of good faith was not passed upon. The somewhat confused state of the law on the question under consideration, as now gathered from the Fisher Case, 46 N. Y. 644, the Topham Case (Sup.) 86 N. Y. Supp. 295, the McLean Case (Sup.) 87 N. Y. Supp. <em>135; </em>the Fitzmartin Case (Sup.) 99 N. Y. Supp. 765, and the Myers Case, 10 App. Div. 335, 41 N. Y. Supp. 798, can then be cleared up.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The judgment herein must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">GILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs. DOWLING, J., concurs in result. DUGRO, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
