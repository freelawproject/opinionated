A transfer was not given him, and he rode to Twenty-Third street and again asked for a transfer, and the conductor refused to give him one. He subsequently boarded a crosstown car at Twenty-Third street, and explained to the conductor of that car the refusal of the conductor on the uptown Sixth Avenue car to give him a transfer. This conductor demanded another fare, which plaintiff paid. C. L- Rowe corroborates plaintiff\u2019s statement as to the refusal of the conductor to give the transfer and as to the payment to conductor on the Twenty-Third Street Crosstown Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">As regards plaintiff\u2019s statement that he was refused a transfer, it stands corroborated and absolutely uncontradicted. The only improbability suggested is claimed to be inferable from the fact that the complaint in the record is a mimeograph copy and tends to refute his statement that he saw a stenographer drawing up that complaint. A mimeograph complaint may be described as a form of complaint applicable in a general way to a particular class of cases, and is therefore nothing more than a blank, which, before it can be of service in a special instance, must be properly filled out. It is reasonably infer-able and entirely reconcilable with plaintiff\u2019s evidence on this subject that he may have seen the stenographer filling out such blank. Moreover, his examination in chief showed a situation, as was said in Lewis v. N. Y. City Ry. Co. (Sup.) 99 N. Y. Supp. 462, \u201cso common and so often before the court that its mere narrative carries with it an atmosphere of conviction of its truth.\u201d Applying, therefore, the rule in Lewis v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., supra, judgment must be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
