An appeal from the original order allowing the amendment was submitted upon the same day as the appeal now under consideration. Upon that appeal the first point made by the respondent was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-14\">\u201cThe order, not reciting any opposition to the motion and no appearance on. behalf of the defendant, is not appealable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">The order here appealed from was from an order denying a motion to resettle said preliminary order by adding thereto, in its recital, the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-16\">\u201cAnd after hearing J. C. Edwards, of counsel for defendant, in opposition thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">That motion was based upon an affidavit in which the attorney stated that he did appear in open court upon the call of said motion, and opposed the same in open court, and submitted a memorandum opposing the same to the justice then presiding. The memorandum handed down, upon the motion for leave to amend, by the learned judge, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-18\">\u201cI think the explanation by plaintiff excuses the loches complained of by defendant\u2019s counsel in his brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">This would seem to establish the correctness of the appellant\u2019s claim. The motion for a resettlement should have been granted. A litigant cannot be deprived of his right to appeal by the arbitrary refusal of the court to resettle its order so as to show the fact that the order was not made upon his default or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The appeal from the order allowing the amendment will be held, and the order denying the motion for a resettlement should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion remitted to the learned justice granting the original order, with instructions to grant the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
