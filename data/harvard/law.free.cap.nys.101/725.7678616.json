The case is therefore taken out of the rule as to actions generally prescribed by section 1241 of the Code. This section 1773 was first inserted in our law in 1880, when the second part of the Code of Civil Procedure took effect. When the case of Park v. Park, reported in 80 N. Y. 156, arose, therefore, there was no such specific provision of law applicable to these actions. The case of Mercer v. Mercer, 73 Hun, 192, 25 N. Y. Supp. 867, relied upon by defendant, arose upon an order directing payment of counsel fee, 'and not of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">A certified copy of the decree was properly served upon the defendant, and a personal demand for the alimony. The delay in making the demand is shown to have been caused by the absence of defendant from the state. That the rights of plaintiff have been impaired and defeated by defendant\u2019s failure to pay the same is undoubted, and we discover no reason for interfering with the order of the Special Term!</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Order affirmed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
