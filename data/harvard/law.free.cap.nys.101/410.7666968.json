Subsequently he instituted this \u25a0proceeding by notice of motion to obtain a writ of mandamus requiring the defendant, as police commissioner, to reinstate him in his former position. After the motion had been argued, but before the same had been determined, he sought to discontinue the proceeding; but, the corporation counsel refusing to give his consent, a motion was made for that purpose. The motion was granted, and there was inserted in the order a provision that the proceeding was discontinued, \u201cwithout prejudice to a new proceeding.\u201d From this order the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">It is difficult to see what objection the defendant could have to the \u25a0discontinuance of the proceeding. Certainly the relator had a right to \u25a0discontinue, if he saw fit. Defendant was not injured. It was, in effect, a confession on the part of the relator that upon the papers presented he was not entitled to the relief asked. He, however, was not \u25a0entitled to have inserted in the order the words \u201cwithout prejudice to a new proceeding.\u201d Whether in a new proceeding he would be entitled to the writ must be determined from the papers there presented, unaffected by the order permitting this proceeding to be discontinued. This we in effect held in People ex rel. Allen v. York, 84 App. Div. 440, 82 N. Y. Supp. 862, and People ex rel. Arfken v. York, 106 App. Div. 590, 94 N. Y. Supp. 812. These words were improperly inserted in the order. Therefore the order should be modified by striking, them out; and, inasmuch as the defendant has appealed from the whole order, the modification should be without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">The order appealed from, therefore, is modified, by striking out of it the words \u201cwithout prejudice to a new proceeding\u201d; and, as modified, the same is affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
