Judgment, however, was not entered in either case until April 31, 1906, being more than the 14 days provided for by section 330 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1557, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">It is strenuously urged by counsel for the respondent that as section 330 provides that the court may have 14 days in which to render judgment from the time \u201cthe same is submitted to him for that purpose,\u201d and there being nothing in the return to show that the cases were submitted to the court on April 3, 1906, the judgments should not be reversed on that ground. The return states that the cases were tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>April 3, 1906. At the close of the testimony in No. 89 a stipulation was entered on the minutes to the effect that the testimony in that case shall be considered as in the action No. 90 \u201ctried this day,\u201d after which appears the words, \u201cDecision reserved.\u201d The Municipal Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, and its jurisdiction will not be presumed; but all the facts essential thereto must appear in the record. Tannenbaum v. Natchtigall, 29 Misc. Rep. 759, 60 N. Y. Supp. 474. It must in every instance show authority for its acts. People ex rel. Jaffe v. Fitzpatrick, 35 Misc. Rep. 456,457, 71 N. Y. Supp. 191. Had it affirmatively appeared in the record that time was given in which to submit briefs, then the time in which to render judgment would date from the time given for filing briefs. Hill v. Hill (Sup.) 99 N. Y. Supp. 410. But from the record it conclusively appears that the case was submitted for decision on April 3, 1906, and decision reserved, and in such a case judgment must be rendered within 14 days. Maggio v.
