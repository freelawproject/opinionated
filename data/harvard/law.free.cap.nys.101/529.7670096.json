Shaw and George Plummer were engaged in a co-partnership for the purpose of selling goods as auction. Plaintiff\u2019s silverware was sold at their sales, at one of which she was present, and about the sum of $200 was realized from the sale of her property. This money has not been paid over, and action is brought against the surety to recover upon the bond for the alleged breach of the principals\u2019 contract. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, upon motion, judgment for defendant was granted, which ruling was duly excepted to, and the correctness of that ruling is challenged upon this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">No reasons were given for the court\u2019s decision, but we think we are justified in assuming that it was based upon an assumption by the learned trial justice that as matter of law demand upon the principal should have been pleaded and proven as a condition precedent to the enforcement of liability of surety, and as matter of fact that no such demand was made. It was incumbent upon the auctioneers to pay over to their consignor the proceeds of the sale, and upon their default in this respect the condition of the bond was violated, and the liability of the obligor immediately attached. Gregory v. United States Fidelity Co., 45 Misc. Rep. 113, 91 N. Y. Supp. 595; Eppstein v. Same, 29 Misc. Rep. 298, 60 N. Y. Supp. 527; Wilson v. Field, 27 Hun, 47. These cases appear to be authority for the proposition that demand was not necessary, and appellant has not called our attention to any decisions holding to the contrary, but, assuming that it was necessary, the uncontradicted testimony is that the money was asked for. It may well be that the alleged dual agency of plaintiff\u2019s husband places him in a peculiar position, and were he to assert a claim against either of the alleged principals public policy upon the establishment of such fact would bar recovery. These statutory principles may not, however, be invoked to defeat plaintiff\u2019s claim; for as to her no question of agency arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
