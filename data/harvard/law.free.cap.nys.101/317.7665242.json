The record discloses, during the direct examination of a witness called by the plaintiff in rebuttal, and apparently before its conclusion, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-26\">\u201cThe Court: We have been all over this before. I have made up my mind what I am going to do with this case. I am going to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant, as the evidence stands now, if I am asked to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-27\">\u201cMr. Samuels: May I ask on what ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Yes; on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was the broker for Mr. Oppenheimer and did not disclose it to Mr. McKenna.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">\u201cMr. Samuels: With that intimation, then, I will rest now. We rest, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cThe Court: That is one of the grounds. Of course, there is this other ground as to the legality of the statute, and as to whether it affects this situation; and then there is the other ground as to whether or not the agent brought to McKenna a person who was willing and able to perform. On those three grounds, if you rest and the other side rest\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cMr. Samuels: Well, on the ground of ability to perform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cThe Court: You have asked me my reasons, and I have given them to you as soon as I have made up my mind about them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cMr. Samuels: I don\u2019t want to argue. I thought I might offer more testimony on the question of ability to perform, which is something new, and your honor makes that a ground of dismissal. If that is not made a ground of the dismissal, I don\u2019t care to offer any evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201cThe Court: You may ask as to his ability to perform.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Counsel then proved by the witness that when he purchased the property he had the title searched; that there were no liens upon it, except the mortgage of $61,000; and that while he was the owner there no liens were created upon it by way of judgment, mortgage, or anything of that kind, and rested the case. Counsel for the defendant then moved for the dismissal of the complaint, or the direction of a verdict, upon the three grounds stated by the court, and the two additional grounds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a cause of action and that there is no proper or legal proof of any measure of reasonable-value for the services. The court directed the jury to find a verdict in favor of the defendant of no cause of action, to which direction the plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">As there was no indication by the court in its final disposition of the case as to which of the grounds stated it based its action upon, we have deemed it advisable to consider them seriatim. The court was in error in assuming that Marcus did not disclose to the defendant the fact that he was acting as a broker for Mr. Oppenheimer. The evidence was to the contrary, the defendant himself testifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">\u201cI knew that Mr. Marcus was going to charge Mr. Oppenheimer a commission for the sale of bis property, which is proper. He said he was his client, and he was his agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">When a broker is employed by both the vendor and the purchaser, neither can refuse compensation if he had knowledge that the broker-held the same relation to the other party. Jarvis v. Schaefer, 105 N. Y. 289, 11 N. E. 634. The evidence does not disclose that Marcus was-authorized to fix the value of the properties to be exchanged, or to-make any agreement with reference thereto that would bind the parties. No discretion was left to him, and no trust was reposed in him. All' the details of the exchange were determined and agreed upon by the-parties themselves. Under such circumstances, and in the absence of an express agreement to the contrary (which, if it existed, as testified to by the defendant and denied by Marcus, presented a question to- be determined by the jury), Marcus was entitled to receive, and his assignee could compel, payment for his services by both parties. Norton v. Genesee National Savings &amp; Loan Association, 57 App. Div. 520, 68 N. Y. Supp. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>2. </em>That Marcus did not have written authority from Oppenheimer or the defendant to represent them in an exchange of properties, if required as a condition to the validity of the agreement to which the plaintiff testified; by the provisions of section 640d of the Penal Code (Laws 1901, p. 312, c. 128), furnished no ground for the direction of the verdict. This court held that section unconstitutional (Grossman v. Caminez, 79 App. Div. 15, 79 N. Y. Supp. 900), and, while our attention is directed to the fact that the Appellate Division of the First Department has differed with us, we still adhere to our views expressed in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">3. The direction of the verdict was not warranted by the evidence of noncompletion of the contract entered into between Oppenheimer and the defendant. If it be true that the former was not able or willing to perform, such fact does not prevent the plaintiff\u2019s' recovery, in the absence of an express agreement to that effect. The right of Marcus to compensation became absolute when, through his efforts, the written contract of exchange was entered into between Oppenheimer and the defendant, if the agreement testified to by him was made by the defendant. Kalley v. Baker, 132 N. Y. 1, 29 N. E. 1091, 28 Am. St. Rep. 542; Norton v. Genesee National Savings &amp; Loan Association, supra; Charles v. Cook, 88 App. Div. 81, 84 N. Y. Supp. 867. If this were not so, the evidence that there were no liens upon the property of Oppenheimer, preventing his transfer of the title which he had undertaken to transfer to the defendant by his contract, made the question one of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">4. There was sufficient evidence of the value of the services of Marcus to take the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">5. Whether or not the plaintiff had established a cause of action depended entirely upon the determination of the question whether the defendant had employed Marcus to render the services for which the plaintiff sought to recover. The testimony of Marcus, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to establish such agreement, and that there was no understanding, nor was he at any time prior to the rendition of his services informed, that the defendant was to pay no commissions. On the other hand, the defendant testified that there was no such agreement, and that it was understood and specifically agreed that, if he entered into the contract with Oppenheimer, he was to pay no commissions to Marcus. These were questions of fact to be determined by the jury, and should have been submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The action of the trial justice in taking the case from the jury and directing a verdict for the defendant was erroneous, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
