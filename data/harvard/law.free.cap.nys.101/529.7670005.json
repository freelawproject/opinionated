The wife engaged the nurse at $10 a week. During all this time an action for separation was pending between the defendant and his wife; the wife being the plaintiff. It also appears that defendant was paying his wife $5 a week. The defendant contended that he was not liable for the services of a nurse because he and his wife were living apart. The Trial Court found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">The services rendered were clearly necessaries for which the husband may be held liable, notwithstanding their living apart. Hatch v. Leonard, 165 N. Y. 435, 438, 59 N. E. 270. '</p>\n<p id=\"b561-18\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
