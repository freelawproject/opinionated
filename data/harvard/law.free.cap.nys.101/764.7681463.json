In pursuance of such application the defendant was required to appear at the office of the plaintiff for the purpose of executing such bond and mortgage. When the parties met, the mortgage which the defendant was asked, to execute was one payable upon demand. Accompanying said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>mortgage were two extension agreements, which were to the effect that, in consideration of the sum of $1 paid by the defendant, the time of payment of said mortgage was extended for three years, but that in the event, among other things, of the passage of a law changing the rate of taxation upon mortgages the mortgagee had the right to enforce payment of the mortgage by giving sixty days\u2019 notice. This mortgage and extensions the defendant declined to execute, whereupon the plaintiff sued for and recovered a judgment for $50 the amount of his commission. The presentation for execution by the defendant of the mortgage and extensions as above stated was not an acceptance of her offer, and the terms imposed by the lender were not a compliance with her application for the loan. The plaintiff did not, therefore, earn his commission, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
