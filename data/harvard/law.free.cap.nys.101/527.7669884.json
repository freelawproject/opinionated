On the return day both parties appeared by counsel. The pleadings were oral. The case was by consent adjourned to July 24, 1906. On July 24th, by stipulation, the case was again adjourned to July 31, 1906. It was further by stipulation adjourned to August 7, 1906. In consideration of the last adjournment, defendant\u2019s attorney stipulated in writing to ask for no further adjournments. On August 7th both parties appeared in court. Defendant\u2019s attorney, in violation of his stipulation, applied to the court for an adjournment, stating that under the rules of the court cases of this kind were not to be tried before September. The court denied this application. An inquest was taken. Plaintiff was called and examined, and the court gave judgment in his favor for $37.89, being the amount claimed with interest and costs. Defendant appeals from the judgment and from the order denying'his motion for an adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The order is not appealable (White v. Lawyers\u2019 Surety Co. [Sup.] 84 N. Y. Supp. 247), and the appeal from the judgment must be dismissed, for the reason that it was taken upon a default, and a motion to open such default must first be .made. Kerr v. Walter, 104 App. Div. 45, 93 N. Y. Supp. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Appeals dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
