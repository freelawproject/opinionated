Inter-borough Rapid Transit Co. [Sup.] 97 N. Y. Supp. 330); were excepted to at the close of the charge; were not modified or withdrawn, but were practically repeated and emphasized. Of course, we are unable to determine whether defendant was prejudiced or not thereby, but it may well have been. It was its legal right to have the rule correctly stated, and judgment founded upon improper instructions, duly excepted to, cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-20\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
