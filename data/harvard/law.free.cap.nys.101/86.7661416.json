Simon &amp; Co., and plaintiff failed to show that he was doing business as A. Simon <em>&amp; Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">The first reason was a sufficient one, for section 320 of the negotiable instrument law reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-17\">\u201cWhere a note is drawn to the maker\u2019s own order, it is not complete until indorsed by him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-18\">Although allegations in a complaint are to be liberally construed, statements of legal conclusions cannot be considered statements of fact. It is not necessary to inquire into the- second reason..</p>\n<p id=\"b118-19\">There was no error in denying the motion to amend the judgment. 'The court, in rendering judgment, had already passed upon the question, and there was no reason why it should pass upon it a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-20\">The order will therefore be affirmed, with costs. The judgment will be modified, so as to eliminate the words \u201con the merits,\u201d and affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
