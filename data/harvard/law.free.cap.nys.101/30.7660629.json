It is defendant\u2019s contention that a new cause of action, based upon new facts and a new contract, appears in the amended complaint, and that it -yvas error for the court below to allow such amendments. Upon comparing the original with the amended complaint, it seems to us that this case comes within the authority of Deyo v. Morss, 144 N. Y. 216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>39 N. E. 8, where it was held that under the provisions of section 723 of the Code, authorizing amendments of pleadings by the court, the latter has power to direct an amendment of a complaint, although it changes the cause of action and substitutes another belonging to a .different class, where the result sought to be reached is the same and the amendment does not affect the substantial purpose of the action. The appellant urges, however, that under the circumstances the court below should have imposed the payment of costs as a condition for granting the motion, to which proposition respondent orally consented upon the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The order is modified, by inserting as a condition for the granting of the amendment the payment of the costs of the action up to the time of the making of the motion for the amended complaint, and, as thus modified, affirmed, with disbursements to the appellant, but no costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
