Acting on the reply, plaintiff sold such person goods on credit. The purchaser never asked to be allowed to give the note provided for. <em>Held, </em>that defendant\u2019s reply and plaintiff\u2019s acts in pursuance thereof showed prima facie a complete meeting of the minds as to the contract of guaranty, without any further or formal notice to defendant of plaintiff\u2019s acceptance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b828-10\">[Ed.

The facts are as follows, viz.: On April 25, 1905, one of the plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">wrote to defendant the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-18\">\u201cI am informed that you agree to guaranty the payment of any goods purchased by Mr. N. Samson. Will you please write me a letter to that effect, and oblige.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-19\">\u201cTours truly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-20\">On April 29, 1905, this letter was received by defendant, who wrote the following reply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-21\">\u201cIn reply to yours of to-day, I have much pleasure in guarantying the payment of Mr. Norman Samson\u2019s account, or the Norman Samson Company\u2019s ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>count, up to $1,500, providing your firm will grant him or them a credit of thirty days. Mr. Samson shall be allowed, as an alternative, to pay you every second payment by a ninety-days note, the note to be indorsed by me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Said Samson never asked to be allowed to give such note, nor did the Samson Company. Acting on this guaranty, plaintiffs sold and delivered to the Samson Company, between August 21, 1905, and October 4, 1905, merchandise to the amount of $272.75, no part of which money has been paid, although payment has been duly demanded. It seems to us that the letter of defendant and the acts of plaintiffs show prima facie a complete meeting of the minds as to the contract of guaranty, without any further or formal notice to defendant of the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the guaranty, assuming none was given, especially as defendant\u2019s relations with the company should have kept him informed as to transactions between plaintiffs and said company.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">It was error for the court to dismiss the complaint on plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, and the order and judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
