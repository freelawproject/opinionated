The complaint also alleges the assignment to plaintiff, also an attorney and counselor at law, of the said cause of action by the personal representatives of said Lucius H.

L. Washburn and the plaintiff were copartners; and, as such co-partners rendered services as agents of said Margaret Kilbourn, deceased, in leasing her real estate and collecting and paying over rents and that \u201csaid plaintiff and his said copartner between the years 1900 and September 7, 1904, in violation of their contract with intestate, and for their private advantage and gain, unknown to intestate, equipped, or partially equipped, portions of said realty and premises with household furniture and leased the same in connection with said premises, and as a part thereof, to divers persons upon an understanding with such persons that a portion of the rent paid was to be applied for the use of said furniture, and the balance for the use of said premises; that in furtherance of said plan the sums so agreed upon as for use of said furniture were collected by plaintiff and his said copartner, or one of them, and applied to his or their personal profit without the consent of intestate to the damage and injury of the defendants\u2019 intestate in the sum of $500,\u201d and also \u201cthat in furtherance of said plan for a personal and private gain in the leasing of said furniture, the plaintiff and his said copartner, or one of them, disposed of certain household furniture belonging to said intestate, and located in said premises and under their charge, without the consent of the intestate of the value of $450 for the nominal sum of $18.40, or thereabouts, to her damage $431.60.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1076-5\">The plaintiff in his moving affidavit, denies in detail all knowledge respecting any of the matters alleged in'said counterclaim, and it appears from such affidavit that he is ignorant of all facts pertaining to the same. No opposing affidavits were submitted. Plaintiff asked for a bill of particulars specifying \u201cthe particular articles of household furniture alleged to have been leased by plaintiff and his said copartner, the names of the persons it is claimed paid moneys pursuant to the alleged understanding that a portion of the rent was to be received for the use of said furniture, and the proportion or amount of the rent so applied, and of the amount of rent so alleged to have been collected, and the particular days and times of the collection or receipt of said alleged amount, and also the particular articles of household furniture alleged to have been sold as aforesaid, with the respective values of such articles, together with the day or days of such sale and the name or names of the person or persons to whom the same was sold.\u201d</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1076-6\">Argued before SMITH, CHESTER, KELLOGG, and COCHRANE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1076-7\">Erost, Daring &amp; Warner (J. S. Erost, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1076-8\">N. B. Spalding, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1076-9\">COCHRANE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXnG\">The counterclaim alleges deception, imposition, and wrong dealing by plaintiff and his copartner for a period of nearly four years while acting in a fiduciary capacity for the defendants\u2019 intestate. These allegations are in the most general terms, and convey very little, if any, information as to the precise facts constituting such malfeasance save the general statement thereof. Plaintiff in his reply and in the moving affidavit denies all knowledge concerning the same. His copartner for whose misdeeds equally with his own he is sought to be held liable is dead, and whatever information may have been possessed by the copartner is not available to plaintiff. Defendants do not plead their inability to furnish the desired particulars. In the absence of opposing affidavits it must be assumed that they can readily furnish the same. It may very well be that the instances of wrongdoing, if any, alleged in the counterclaim were committed by the deceased copartner of plaintiff without the knowledge of the latter and the latter should be apprised in detail of the facts concerning the same which are within the defendants\u2019 knowledge. It would be mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>festly unjust to require the plaintiff to go to trial on such sweeping and comprehensive charges of business obliquity and long-continued petrified integrity on the part of himself or his deceased copartner, without apprising him more fully of the nature of such charges. Justice and propriety require the defendants to comply with the plaintiff\u2019s demand for a bill of particulars. The particulars asked for amount to little more than a detailed description of the wrongful contracts which the defendants claim were made to the prejudice of their intestate. If those contracts were in writing, and in defendants\u2019 possession, plaintiff would clearly be entitled to copies thereof. Being oral, it is equally proper that defendants should furnish detailed particulars concerning the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
