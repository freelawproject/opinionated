Code, \u00a7 6\u00e10d, a written authorization to procure a purchaser of real estate is necessary, must, to be available, be specially pleaded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b818-10\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Special Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b818-11\">Action by Maurice I.

The answer is a general denial. The work, labor, and services shown upon the trial consisted of the procuring of a purchaser ready, able, and willing to buy the defendants\u2019 real estate on terms desired by and satisfactory to them. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the learned court below dismissed the complaint, upon the ground that the written authorization required to be procured by section 640d of the Penal Code by persons offering real property for sale in cities of the first or second class had not been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">This ruling cannot be upheld. It would undoubtedly have availed, if it had been pleaded, or if proof that it had been procured was essential to the establishment of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. Cox v. Hawke, 96 N. Y. Supp. 433, decided by this court, is directly in point. The action at bar is upon a paroi contract. No illegality appears upon the face of the complaint, nor does any necessarily appear from the evidence which plaintiff is obliged to introduce in order to sustain his complaint. It may not, therefore, be taken advantage of under a general denial. The illegality of the contract, if pleaded, would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>raised an issuable fact; but upon the record the dismissal of the complaint was against the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
