Due notice of the motion was given to every one interested, but no opposition to the motion or objection that it was not made in the proper place was made. After thus acquiescing in the motion being heard in Albany county, the respondents had no standing to make a motion in Kings county to vacate the order made in Albany county on the ground of irregularity. There was jurisdiction; the Supreme Court had jurisdiction <em>; </em>the question of the county in which the motion should be made was one of regularity only.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-17\">The order should be reversed, and the motion denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-18\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with costs.
