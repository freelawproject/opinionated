Muller v. City of Philadelphia, 113 App. Div. 92, 99 N. Y. Supp. 93. The exercise of this power, however, is controlled by the consideration that a party should not, by loches or otherwise, place his opponent at an unfair disadvantage, and for this reason an amendment, which otherwise would be freely allowed, is often refused because of the loches of the party moving. Mere loches, however, are not always an unanswerable objection to an amendment, especially if no prejudice will arise therefrom to the party opposing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">In the present case the action is for money alleged to have been obtained from plaintiff by fraud. The defendants have already served an original and one amended answer, and, having changed their attorney, now seek to serve a second amended answer, amplifying their defense that the plaintiff by certain acts has waived the tort of which he complains. It is true that no very cogent reason is given why this defense was not properly pleaded before, and the defendants have unquestionably laid themselves open to the imputation of loches. We are unable to see, however, that any disadvantage will come to plaintiff if the motion be granted upon proper terms. The action was commenced in April, 1906, and the amended answer served on June 4th. The present motion was made on August 27th. The action has been noticed for trial for the October term, but has not yet appeared upon the day calendar. The defendants\u2019 loches are not, therefore, very gross.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">The order should be reversed, without costs, and the motion granted, on condition that, within five days after the entry and service of the order to be entered hereon, the defendants serve their proposed second amended answer, and pay to plaintiff\u2019s attorney all costs of the action to date and $10 costs of motion; the cause to retain its number, date of issue, and place upon the trial calendar,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
