Section 20 of the labor law (Laws 1897, p. 468, c. 415), so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>far as it is necessary to refer to it, provides that, where d.ouble floors are to be laid, all contractors for carpenter work \u201cshall lay the under-flooring * * * on each story * * * to not less than two stories below the one to which such building has been erected,\u201d and, where double floors are not to be used, \u201cshall keep plank over the floors two stories below the story where the work is being performed.\u201d The defendant was not the contractor for carpenter work, and so not within the purview of the statute. Whether defendant appellant was \u2022 negligent in having things as they were, and whether, if she was negligent, her negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, were questions for the jury. Probably, if she had no carpenter contractor whose duty it was to comply with the provisions of section 20 of the labor law, that circumstance would be evidence admissible upon the question of her own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The exception is valid, and the judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
