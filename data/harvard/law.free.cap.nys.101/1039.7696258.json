Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b1072-4\">The following is the opinion of Justice Henry T. Kellogg at Special Term:</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1072-5\">This is an. application for a writ of mandamus to compel the Citizens\u2019 National Bank of Saratoga to exhibit its books and papers to William C. Taylor, a stockholder. A stockholder may for a proper purpose obtain by a mandamus an examination of the corporate books. Matter of Steinway, 159 N. Y. 250, 53 N. E. 1103, 45 L. R. A. 461. The writ will not be granted for the purpose of enabling a stockholder, by showing financial embarrassment, to force the corporation into the hands of a receiver through action by the Attorney General (Matter of Pierson, 44 App. Div. 215, 60 N. Y. Supp. 671); nor to show an improper loan by its officers, in order to compel the parties to make good in case of a deficit (People v. Produce Exchange Trust Company, 53 App. Div. 93, 65 N. Y. Supp. 926). Before a stockholder may have the writ, he must establish that \u201cit is necessary for him to have the information in order to protect his interest in the corporation.\u201d Matter \u25a0of Latimer, 75 App. Div. 522, 78 N. Y. Supp. 314.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1072-6\">Thus it will be seen that the writ is granted only on behalf of a stockholder, considered as such, and in proper aid of his stock interest only. Wherever information concerning the management, conduct, and control of the corporation is necessary for the protection of such stock interest, its \u25a0revelation will be compelled; but where the information is sought, not for the benefit of an owner\u2019s stock interest, but to assist him in matters personal to himself and wholly apart from such interest, the writ should not be granted. This application seeks information to aid him in a suit in deceit against three directors of a banking corporation, brought to recover \u25a0damages sustained by reason of a false report published by them, whereby he was induced to become a stockholder and incurred loss. Confessedly this is the purpose of the application. It is, therefore, not as a stockholder, but as a plaintiff in a suit against individuals not affecting the management', conduct, or control of the corporation, that he demands this writ. It should be denied to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1072-7\">Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1072-8\">Argued before SMITH, CHESTER, KELLOGG, and COCH-RANE, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1072-9\">Edgar T.
