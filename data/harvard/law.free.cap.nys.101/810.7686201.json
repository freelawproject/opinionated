The defend\u00e1nts raised the question by demurrer that the commissioners of highways were improperly joined with the towns -as plaintiffs. This demurrer was overruled by the Special Term. On appeal to this court the interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrer was reversed, and the demurrer sustained, with leave to plead anew and to serve an amended \u2022summons and complaint. 90 App. Div. 548, 86 N. Y. Supp. 412. In order to get a review in the Court of Appeals, the plaintiffs did not comply with the conditions imposed as a prerequisite to amending, and final judgment was entered dismissing the complaint, with costs. The plaintiffs then appealed to this court, where such judgment was affirmed, and in turn to the Court of Appeals from such final judgment, with the intention of bringing up for review \u2022all the prior orders and interlocutory judgments against them. In the Court \u2022of Appeals the judgment of this court was affirmed, with costs, \u201cwith leave to appellants to apply to the Supreme Court for such relief as they may be advised.\u201d 184 N. Y. 582, 77 N. E. 1197. The plaintiffs then moved at Special \u201cTerm for leave to make appropriate amendments of the summons and complaint to correspond with the judgment of this court and of the Court of Appeals, and for such other relief \u00e1s may be just. The Special Term granted an order making such appropriate amendments to the summons and complaint, and also amending the judgment, so that the complaint should not stand' \u2022dismissed, but in force as amended, and' granted to the defendants $10 costs \u2022of the motion. No costs were imposed as a condition of making the amendment. From this order the defendants have appealed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b843-4\">Appeal from Special Term, Montgomery County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b843-5\">Action by the town of Palatine and others against the Canajoharie Water Supply Company and another.

The court of Appeals, in affirming the judgment of this court, had settled, as the law of this case, that the commissioners of highways were improperly joined with their respective towns as-plaintiffs in the action. If the Supreme Court, \u2022acting through a Special Term or an Appellate Division in an appropriate case, is powerless to make the judgment of the Court of Appeals effective because of highly technical objections largely relating to procedure, there is something inherently defective in our judicial system, and the right of review in many cases would be rendered fruitless and worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">While we entertain no doubt of the inherent power of the Special Term to make the amendments of the judgment and of the summons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>and complaint which it did, we think, as the defendants had earned a considerable amount of costs in their efforts to be rid of improper plaintiffs in the action, and had recovered judgments for these costs against such improper plaintiffs, as well as against the towns, that the amendments should not have been made, except upon condition that the towns, which remain as plaintiffs, should pay the defendants their taxable costs, as well as the costs of the motion. The criticism by the appellants of this feature of the order as made relates to a matter of substance, as one effect of it is practically to dismiss from the action two parties against whom judgments for costs have been obtained without making any provision for payment of any of the costs incurred. The condition we suggest will furnish ample protection to the defendants, as the towns are responsible and no injustice follows by imposing the costs upon them, as the commissioners were only agents for the town, the proper plaintiffs, and can with propriety be relieved from paying the costs personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">There is no reason shown why, in addition to the costs, the counsel fees incurred by the defendants with respect to the temporary injunction should have been imposed as a condition of granting the amendments. The question of the liability of the towns for damages to the defendants because of the temporary injunction can well await the determination of the action on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The order should be modified, by adding, after the words \u201cthat the defendants recover of the plaintiffs $10 costs of this motion,\u201d the following: \u201cAnd that said amendments are made upon condition that the plaintiffs, the town of Palatine and the town of Canajoharie, pay to the defendants all their taxable costs in the action, including said $10 costs of motion\u201d\u2014and, as so modified, affirmed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
