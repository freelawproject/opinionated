As to the former item, amounting to $100, it is claimed to be due under a certain agreement in writing between the parties, which agreement, among other things, provided that, before any payment became due to plaintiffs from defendant, a certificate should be obtained from and signed by a certain architect</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>therein named. The balance sued for is claimed to be due as part of the last payment provided for by the agreement, and concededly no such certificate for said last payment was obtained from or signed by said architect. This action is brought upon the theory that the contract was fully performed by plaintiffs. In such a case, where a certificate is required to be obtained from an architect before a payment becomes due, the plaintiff must either procure the architect\u2019s certificate, or show that it has been unreasonably refused, or that defendant has waived its production. Weeks v. O\u2019Brien, 141 N. Y. 202, 36 N. E. 185; Excelsior Terra Cotta Co. v. Harde, 90 App. Div. 8, 85 N. Y. Supp. 732. There is no such proof in this case, and the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance as to waiver is upon a case (Haden v. Coleman, 73 N. Y. 567) where, as a matter of fact, the architect had never superintended the work in question, which is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
