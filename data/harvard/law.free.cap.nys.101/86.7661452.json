Upon the trial it was sought to establish defendant\u2019s liability byproving a contract madebetween plaintiff\u2019s salesman, one Leo Schwab, and defendant\u2019s manager, one Aaron Rider. But the evidence showed that, so far from said manager having made a contract for the purchase of these labels and bands, when Schwab called upon him to urge the purchase thereof, he was referred to one Harry Rothschild by Rider, who, in so referring him, said that the purchase of such goods was not in his department. It is true that he also said, \u201cAnything Rothschild says about this is all right.\u201d Rothschild is claimed to have said to Schwab, after inspecting samples of the labels and bands, that they were an excellent band and he would take them. But Harry Rothschild, by the admission of plaintiffs\u2019 own witness, was not employed about defendant\u2019s premises, and it affirmatively appears that he was not at any time an officer of defendant corporation. He had no power whatever to bind defendant in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">The plaintiffs have failed to prove any sale to defendant, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">GILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.
