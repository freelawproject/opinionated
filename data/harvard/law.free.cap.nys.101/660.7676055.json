The order amending the order overruling the demurrer was entered upon the defendant\u2019s motion, and the appeal therefrom must be dismissed. The demurrer to the complaint was well taken and should have been sustained. .Briefly, the complaint averred that in June, 1906, the August Roesler Company gave to plaintiffs a promissory note for value, in the sum of $1,000, due on or before July 35, 1906. At the time this note was given to plaintiffs the defendant owed the Roesler Company upwards of $5,000 for work done for it by the Roesler Company. To secure the payment of this note the Roesler Company assigned to plaintiffs all the moneys due it from the defendant. Defendant was notified of this assignment on July 13, 1906. On July 35, 1906, payment of the note was demanded of the Roesler Company, but the same not being paid, suit without demand for payment upon or notice to the defendant was begun. No demand for payment is alleged in the complaint. It is not claimed that the assignment to the plaintiffs by the Roesler Company of .the sum due from defendant was an absolute assignment creating immediately an absolute liability on the part of defendant, but the same was given as security merely, for payment of the note. Notice of such assignment created at most but a contingent liability on the part of the defendant, and such liability depended on whether or not the note was paid. The note was uncertain as to its due date, and therefore the knowledge as to when the plaintiffs exacted payment or when demand therefor and default was made was peculiarly within the knowledge of the plaintiffs, and, before payment could be exacted of the defendant, demand for payment upon it should first have been made. This is in accordance with the rule that, when the fact upon which the defendant\u2019s liability depends is within the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge, notice should be given to the defendant before bringing the action. Cole v. Jessup, 2 Barb. 309; Bunn v. Lett, 47 N. Y. St. Rep. 77, 19 N. Y. Supp. 728; Wanger v. Swift, 90 N. Y. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Appeal from order dismissed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and demurrer sustained, with costs, and plaintiff allowed to amend the complaint within six days upon payment of costs less the $10 costs imposed upon dismissal of appeal from order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
