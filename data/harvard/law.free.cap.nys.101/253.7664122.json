The source of affiant\u2019s information as to the possession of the property was alleged to be a statement, made to affiant by one of the plaintiffs at the \u201ccommencement of the action,\u201d that the debtor was the owner of the property mentioned, and that since that time he had assigned the same to his son; also a statement made to affiant by plaintiff\u2019s salesman to substantially the same effect, and, as to the money, that affiant\u2019s information was based on an offer of the debtor\u2019s counsel to settle the judgment by a payment of 50 cents on the dollar. <em>Held, </em>that such facts were insufficient to show that the debtor had either money or property at the time the order was applied for.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-12\">\"3.

A motion was made to vacate such order upon the ground of the insufficiency of the affidavit upon which the order was granted, which motion was-denied, and from the order denying such motion the debtor appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The affidavit upon which the order was gra\u00f1ted is clearly defective. It is made by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and is based, as to the allegation that the defendant has property, etc., wholly upon information and belief.. Neither the grounds of the belief nor the sources of the information are given. Even if we assume that an averment in the language of the statute is sufficient (First Nat. Bank v. Wilson, 13 Hun, 232), it does-not comply with that, as there is no positive allegation that the debtor bad property. Upon the hearing of the motion the judgment creditor was permitted to file an additional affidavit intended to cure the defects-in the first. The second affidavit, however, fails to supply the essential elements required to authorize the granting of the order for the debtor\u2019s examination. The source of information as to the possession of property by the debtor is an alleged statement, made to the affiant by one of the plaintiffs, that at the \u201ccommencement of the action upon which the proceeding was predicated\u201d the debtor was the owner of the property mentioned, and that since that time the debtor had made an assignment or pretended assignment of such property to the debtor\u2019s son,, and also an alleged statement made to affiant by a salesman of the plaintiffs to substantially the same effect. As to the money stated to be in the debtor\u2019s possession, the affiant\u2019s information is based upon an offer of the debtor\u2019s counsel to settle the judgment by a payment of 50 cents on a dollar. Instead of these facts showing that the debtor had property, they tend to show that he had transferred the same by assignment to his son, and not that he had property which he could apply in payment of the judgment. \u201cWhere the evidence does not show that the defendant has any property free from the claims of third persons, the order should not be granted.\u201d Owen v. Dupignac, 17 How. Prac. 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">As to whether or not the debtor had any money which he refused to apply on the judgment, the offer of settlement made by his attorney affords no evidence whatever. If, on the other hand, the defendant had tangible property, the creditor must exhaust his remedy under the execution. It is only where the creditor can prove to the satisfaction of the judge that the debtor has property not subject to levy, or which is so kept by the debtor that it cannot be clearly identified and with ordinary diligence reached by execution, that the order may be granted. Sackett v. Newton, 10 How. Prac. 560. As to the allegation of a demand upon and refusal by the debtor, that is equally defective. \u201cWhere the affidavit does not state any facts or circumstances from which it may be determined whether such refusal was unjust, or whether the credit- or\u2019s remedy by execution is not adequate, it is insufficient.\u201d Matter of First Nat. Bank, 52 App. Div. 601, 65 N. Y. Supp. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Order denying motion to vacate order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to vacate order for examination of judgment debtor granted, with $10 costs.
