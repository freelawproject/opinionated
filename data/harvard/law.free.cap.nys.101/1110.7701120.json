The trust was created under a will probated in 1894. The amendment by chapter 175, p. 370, of the Laws of 1905 of section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by chapter 461, p. 1071, of the Laws of 1903, does not affect the full application of the judgments of the First Department of this court in King v. Irving, 103 App. Div. 420, 92 N. Y. Supp. 1094, and Sloane v. Tiffany, 103 App. Div. 540, 93 N. Y. Supp. 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-16\">I am of opinion that we should follow them, and I therefore advise the affirmance of the order, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">WOODWARD, HOOKER, and RICH, JJ., concur. GAYNOR, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
