It seems that this action was in equity, was tried at the Special Term, and judgment entered on the 17th day of January, 1905. The case was made and settled, and a stipulation signed waiving certification by the clerk. It was alleged by the plaintiff that there was omitted from the printed case two exhibits which were overlooked by his attorney; one being an abstract from the East Brooklyn Savings Bank, and another the recital of a mortgage which he asked to have inserted in the case, and that the title of the case conform to the title in the pleadings. This was a question to be determined by the trial judge, and I do not think that we should interfere with him in his determination of what was before him. The form of the title of the case is of no possible consequence. I think, however, that the plaintiff should have been required to pay the costs of reprinting the record made necessary by the amendment allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-19\">It follows that the order appealed from should be modified accordingly, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
