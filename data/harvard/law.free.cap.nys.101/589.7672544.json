On boarding the latter car he paid another fare absentmindedly, but before the conductor had rung it up he recovered his memory and requested the return of his five cents, whereupon the conductor abused him and undertook to forcibly remove him from the car. His statement of the occurrence is corroborated, and not contradicted. Plaintiff remained upon the car until it reached the ferry. Five hundred dollars damages were awarded. No serious injury was suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">In Thomas v. Met. Ry. Co., 44 App. Div. 364, 60 N. Y. Supp. 1150, and in Conlon v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 34 Misc. Rep. 394, 69 N. Y. Supp. 653, verdicts of $250 were reduced to $100, and justice requires a similar modification in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Judgment modified, by reducing amount of recovery to $100, and as modified affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
