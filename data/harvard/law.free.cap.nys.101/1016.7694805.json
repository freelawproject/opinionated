The principal witness for the prosecution was one Charles Augustus Seton, a confessed accomplice, and the chief point relied upon by the appellant is his claim that the testimony of the accomplice was not corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. Seton\u2019s testimony was to the effect that he, with certain confederates, had forged a number of certificates of stock of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company; that defendant had called on him and asked what he was handling; that Seton replied that he was handling some railroad bonds, mentioning the Norfolk &amp; Western securities; that defendant asked where Seton got them, to which the latter replied that they had been given him by the private secretary of the owner, who lived in Buffalo, and that they had been taken without the owner\u2019s consent and wrongly from the vault; that defendant said, \u201cWell,, it doesn\u2019t look like good stock to me; it is new looking; it looks like Gardner\u2019s work;\u201d that he further said, \u201cIt looks wrong; it looks phoney; it looks like scratch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>work; it looks like Gardner\u2019s workthat defendant finally said that he thought the stock would go, and that he could introduce Seton to a man who could handle it; and that he did introduce a man named Davis. This was some time in July or August. The transaction upon which defendant was convicted took place some time later. Defendant called upon a broker named Meloy and sought to arrange for a loan upon 200 shares of Norfolk &amp; Western stock. Seton testified that on this occasion the defendant took with him and had in his possession two forged certificates, but it does not appear that he showed them to Meloy. It is upon this attempt to procure a loan that the defendant was convicted of \u201can attempt to utter\u201d the forged certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">It is obvious that to justify the conviction it must be made to appear by competent evidence that the defendant sought to obtain the loan upon certificates which were forged and which he knew to be forged instruments. These were the essential elements of the crime, and the serious objection to the judgment of conviction is that as to neither of these points was the evidence of Seton, the accomplice, in any way corroborated. Except by his evidence there is nothing to show that the certificates which the defendant took to Meloy\u2019s office were forged, or that, if they were, the defendant knew it. Meloy\u2019s evidence goes no further than to prove that defendant sought to procure a loan on Norfolk &amp; Western stock certificates, and for all that appears from his evidence the certificates upon which the loan was sought may have been genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Eor this lack of corroboration of Seton\u2019s evidence as to the essential elements of the crime for which defendant was convicted, the judgment and order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">McEAUGHLIN and EAUGHLIN, JJ., concur. PATTERSON, P. J., and HOUGHTON, J., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
