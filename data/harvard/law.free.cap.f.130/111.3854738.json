Collision \u2014 Ship Making Berth \u2014 Refusal of Small Boat to Give Way.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b143-9\">A barge lying at the end of a pier in New York, although rightfully there, which refused the offer of a steamship to remove her temporarily while the ship was making her berth in an adjacent slip and to return her afterward, took the risk of injury from the docking of the ship if the latter was properly handled, and cannot recover therefor without proving fault.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-10\">Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-11\">The following is the opinion of the court below (Holt, District Judge):</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-12\">I think that this case cannot be distinguished from the case of The Etruria (D.

C.) 88 Fed. 555. The Austria was not in fault for shifting from the side to the end of Pier 37; she was there for a legitimate purpose, viz., to discharge the stone needed for an extension of that pier. But we are satisfied that the weight of evidence shows that, at a time early enough to avoid all risk, those who had the berthing of the Minneapolis in charge urged the captain of the scow to shift her position, and proffered the use of one of their tugs to remove her temporarily, with the promise to return her to her old position when the berthing might be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-19\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
