The opinion of the board, so far as pertinent to the question raised in this case, reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-19\">FISCHER, General Appraiser. The merchandise in question consists of (1) paper bags. * * * Duty was assessed as follows: On the paper bags at the rate of 35 per cent, ad valorem, under paragraph 407 of the act of 1S97, o. 11, \u00a7 1, Schedule M, 30 Stat. 1S9 [U. S. Comp.

S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1673]. We find from the evidence and samples before us, as follows: First. That the paper bags are manufactures of paper properly dutiable at the rate of 35 per cent, ad valorem, under paragraph 407. The fact that such bags have had printed matter thereon will not make them dutiable under paragraph 403. The articles are paper bags, and have become, by a process of manufacture, a distinct article for use as such, and the printing thereon is merely incidental thereto and not a controlling feature. * * * The protests are accordingly overruled as to the articles enumerated in our first finding. * \u2022 *</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-4\">Howard T.
