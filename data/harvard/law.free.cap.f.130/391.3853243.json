A. 4,941, T. D. 23,112, which affirmed the_assessment of duty by the collector of customs at the port of New York on merchandise imported by Baer Bros. Note Meier v. United States (C. C.) 128 Fed. 472. The opinion of the Board of General Appraisers reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-15\">FISCHER, General Appraiser. The merchandise in question consists of so-called flitters. Duty was assessed thereon at the rate of 45 per cent ad valorem, under the provisions of paragraph 193 of the act of July 24, 1897, c. II, \u00a7 1, Schedule C, 30 Stat. 167 [U. S. Comp. St 1901, p. 1645]. It is claimed to be dutiable at the rate of 12 cents per pound under the provisions of paragraph 175, c. 11, \u00a7 1, Schedule C, 30 Stat 165 [U. S. Comp. St 1901, p. 1644], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>as bronze powder, or at the rate,of 30 per cent, ad valorem, under provisions of paragraph 58, c. 11, \u00a7 1, Schedule A, 30 Stat. 154 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1630], as a pigment or color.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">The process of manufacture of the article is described by one of the importers\u2019 witnesses as follows: \u201cAfter the metal has been smelted and is in sheet form, it is cut up into clippings; and after the metal, in the shape of clippings, is under the hammer for about an hour or so, we get flitters; and, if the clippings are kept under the hammer five or six hours longer, then we get bronze powder.\u201d Its manner of use is thus described by th\u00e9 same witness: \u201cThe principal uses of flitters are by wall paper manufacturers \u2014 window shade manufacturers. They would put on a size first, and afterward brush on the flitters. * * * The size is applied first, and afterward the flitter is brushed upon it in the following manner: The wall paper will pass under a certain box, and the box will contain the flitters, with a big brush, and the wall paper strikes the brush, and the flitters are dusted or brushed on.\u201d When asked if these flitters are ever mixed with oil or water before they are used, the witness answered that it was not feasible. He stated, also, that flitters were used in the dried condition only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">From this testimony it is clear that, while subsequent manufacture might convert the flitters into bronze powder, they are not bronze powder in the condition imported. It is also clear, from the testimony quoted, that the articles cannot be used as a pigment or color, but must be used in a manner similar to that of applying metal leaf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">We accordingly find (1) that flitters are not bronze powder; (2) that they are not a color, nor susceptible for use as a color.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">The protests are overruled, and the decisions of the collector affirmed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-8\">Howard T.
