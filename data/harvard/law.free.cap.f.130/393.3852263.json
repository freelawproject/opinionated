S. Comp.

F. Downing &amp; Co. The nature of the questions at issue appears from the opinion of the board, which reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-15\">FISCHER, General Appraiser. The merchandise in question consists of portfolios made up of loose sheets of printed matter, photogravures, and lithographic prints. In the portfolio entitled \u201cPalast-Architektur von Ober-Italien und Toscana,\u201d there are four loose pages of print in foreign languages, twelve loose sheets of photogravure pictures of Italian palaces, and seven loose sheets of lithographic prints representing the architectural detail thereof. In the portfolios entitled \u201cDie Mustergiltigen Kirehenbauten des Mittelalters in Deutschland,\u201d there are twelve loose pages of print in the German language, eight loose sheets of photogravure pictures of church edifices, and sixteen loose sheets of lithographic prints representing the architectural detail of the same. Both portfolios are covered by a loose outside covering of paper, bearing the titles above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-16\">The importers claim that the assessment of duty on the articles under paragraph 403 of the act of July 24, 1897, \u00a7 1, Schedule M, 30 Stat. 189, c. 11 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1673], at the rate of 25 per cent, ad valorem, as printed matter, or under paragraph 400, 30 Stat. 188 [U. S. Comp. St 1901, p. 1672], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>as lithographic prints, was erroneous, and that the merchandise Is entitled to free entry under paragraph 502, \u00a7 2, Free List, 30 Stat. 196 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 1681], as books printed exclusively in a foreign language. The portion of paragraph 502 upon which the importers rely provides as follows: Books and pamphlets printed exclusively in languages other than English.\u201d It is unnecessary to discuss the question whether these articles are publications printed exclusively in a language other than English, for, even if they be such, they are clearly not books. They are loose sheets, apparently not intended to be bound or fastened together in book form. They are portfolios or collections of pictures, and do not fall within the provisions of paragraph 502 at all. The protests are accordingly overruled, and the decisions of the collector affirmed.
