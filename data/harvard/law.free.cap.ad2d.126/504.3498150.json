The proof submitted by the plaintiff in connection with the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion failed to establish a prima facie case of serious injury. Therefore, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment <em>(see, Lorenzo v Witt, </em>118 AD2d 628). Mangano, J. P., Brown, Rubin and Fiber, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
