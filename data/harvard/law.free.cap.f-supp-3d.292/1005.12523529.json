DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the instant motion, Defendants seek to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions of the Enrollment Agreement. Defendants argue that the question of arbitrability has been delegated to the arbitrator and thus the scope of this Court's review is narrow. Plaintiff argues that the agreement's delegation clause is unenforceable and that, even if it is enforceable, certain claims are outside the scope of the arbitration provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties Clearly and Unmistakably Delegated Arbitrability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A threshold issue the Court must decide is whether the Enrollment Agreement delegated the arbitrability determination to the arbitrator. The determination of whether an arbitration clause is valid, applicable, and enforceable is reserved to the district court unless \"the parties clearly and unmistakably provide[d] otherwise,\" such as by delegating the issue of arbitrability to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Technologies, Inc. v.

Even if a delegation of arbitrability is clear and unmistakable it may be found unenforceable if the delegation itself is unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Ctr.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 71-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants argue that the delegation provision requires that any dispute pertaining to arbitrability must be submitted to the arbitrator. (ECF No. 8-1 at 13.) Defendants argue the parties have shown a clear and unmistakable intent to delegate the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator\n   because (1) the arbitration provision requires the arbitration of \"any dispute or claim,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Antun. Decl. Ex.1 at 2)), and (2) the agreement incorporates the JAMS procedural rules, which in turn provide JAMS with the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability. Plaintiff disputes delegation on the grounds that (1) the arbitration agreement does not expressly state that the arbitrator has the power to determine arbitrability and (2) the arbitration agreement merely references the requirement to initiate proceedings with JAMS, not JAMS's procedural rule regarding its jurisdiction over arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The delegation clause of the arbitration agreement here states that upon initiation of arbitration JAMS \"will serve as the arbitration administrator\n   <em>\n    pursuant to its rules of procedure.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added).) There appears to be a dispute between the parties as to which JAMS rules of procedures apply. Whereas Defendants point to Rule 8(b) of the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures, Plaintiff points to Rule 11 of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court need not decide which set of rules is appropriate under the arbitration agreement's delegation clause because both sets of Rules contain an identical clause authorizing JAMS to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Jurisdictional and arbitrability disputes, including disputes over the formation, existence, validity, interpretation or scope of the agreement under which Arbitration is sought, and who are proper Parties to the Arbitration, shall be submitted to and ruled on by the Arbitration. The Arbitrator has the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability issues as a preliminary matter.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Rule 11(b), JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Rule 8(b) JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the context of another arbitrator, the Ninth Circuit has held that \"incorporation of the AAA rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the contracting parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.\"\n   <em>\n    Brennan v.

Plaintiff has failed to provide particularized evidence showing actual bias. The fact that the Defendants appear before JAMS with some degree of frequency is insufficient to find bias that warrants invalidation of the arbitration provisions. To the extent Plaintiff was legitimately concerned about arbitrator bias, the arbitration agreement \"does not preclude the parties from mutually agreeing to an alternative arbitration forum or administrator ...\" (Antun Decl. Ex. 1.) In anticipation of the Court's inevitable reference to this provision, Plaintiff argues that this provision is \"illusory\" in light of its \"mutual agreement\" requirement because Defendants and JAMS have no desire to initiate such proceedings. Plaintiff's argument is belied by other evidence. Plaintiff was required to propose an alternate forum or administrator within twenty days of receipt of Defendants' intent to arbitrate. (Antun Decl. Ex. 1 at 2.) Upon electing arbitration in writing, Defendants expressly informed Plaintiff of his right under the arbitration agreement to propose an alternative arbitrator and expressly identified their amenability to use of AAA as an arbitrator, instead of JAMS. (ECF No. 8-4 Ex. B.) There is no indication Plaintiff in fact proposed a different arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Fee and Cost Provisions Are Not Unconscionable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that arbitration provisions are substantively unconscionable because Plaintiff faces the risk of having to pay arbitration-related fees and costs not required in court. This argument is insufficient to invalidate the delegation clause of this arbitration agreement because that provision is not sufficiently connected to the delegation clause. This alone would doom finding that the delegation provision is substantively unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rent-a-Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court's analysis is limited to challenges specific to delegation clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even assuming there is a sufficient connection, Plaintiff advances nothing more than mere speculation about the fees and costs of arbitration. \"The 'risk' that [a plaintiff] will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Green Tree Fin.

As to the arbitration filing fee, the JAMS fee is in fact less than the fee Plaintiff paid to file his case in this Court.

All other costs identified in the arbitration agreement-attorney, expert and witness fees-are costs incurred in judicial proceedings. Moreover, the arbitration agreement here follows the general rule applicable in judicial proceedings that a party generally bears its own litigation costs and even permits fee-shifting under applicable law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alyeska Pipeline Serv.

Defendants' Demand for Arbitration is not \"Wholly Groundless\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The arbitration provision of the Enrollment Agreement provides that it applies to \"any dispute or claim between the student and The Art Institute ... arising out of or relating to the student's enrollment or attendance at\" AICSD, including claims against \"any company affiliated\" with AICSD. (Antun Decl. Ex. 1.) Notwithstanding this broad language, Plaintiff argues that Defendants' demand for arbitration does not reach his claim that Defendants intentionally and publicly disclosed his private personal facts. (ECF No. 10 at 11.) Plaintiff's argument does not have merit. As confirmed by the allegations in the Complaint, this entire dispute, including Plaintiff's claim concerning alleged disclosure of his private personal facts during classes at AICSD, arises from or relates to Plaintiff's enrollment and attendance at AICSD. Thus, the entire dispute directly \"touches\" the subject matter of the Enrollment Agreement and is subject to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simula Inc. v.
