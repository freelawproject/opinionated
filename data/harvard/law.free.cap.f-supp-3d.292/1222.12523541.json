PHP insists that pertinent legislative history confirms Congress' sweeping preemptive intent. For instance, it notes that the congressional conference report observed that the provision, which was part of the 2003 Medicare Act amendments, \"clarif[ies] that the [Medicare Advantage] program is a federal program operated under Federal rules. State laws[ ] do not, and should not apply, with the exception of state licensing laws or state laws related to plan solvency.\"\n   <em>\n    Doc. 40\n   </em>\n   at 8 (quoting H.R. Rep.

Furthermore, in the same explanation that it offered in 2005, CMS also indicated that it\n   \"believe[s] that an enrollee will still have State remedies available in cases\n   <em>\n    in which the legal issue before the court is independent of an issue related to the organization's status as a [\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medicare Advantage] plan\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204193\">\n    70 Fed.

Yet, it is not immediately clear to the Court that the legal issues before it are in fact independent of PHP's status as a Medicare Advantage organization. After all, Plaintiffs' claims center around the denial of a Medicare benefit. Finally, while it may be true that Congress has left room for state law claims based on standards for the practice of medicine and the manner in which medical services are delivered, this says nothing of state law claims based upon a Medicare Advantage organization's denial of a benefits as medically unnecessary.

In\n   <em>\n    Kaohi\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court merely indicated that it was \"unpersuaded\" by the defendant's \"reference to 'Congress' strengthening of Medicare's broad preemptive scope,\" and explained that a broader preemptive scope did not somehow transform a medical malpractice claim into one for benefits under the Medicare Act.\n   <em>\n    Kaohi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206472231\">\n    2015 WL 6472231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

PHP's issuance of the Notice of Denial of Medical Coverage, which asserted that the degree of Ms. Hall's liver disease was not severe enough to initiate a liver transplant evaluation, shows that it made that determination.

Even a claim that a Medicare Advantage organization wrongfully applied or wholly disregarded the medical necessity standard is still a claim alleging conduct that was governed by federal Medicare standards. Put another way, Plaintiffs' claims against PHP depend upon a showing that PHP violated standards, perhaps of its own making, which federal Medicare regulations required it to promulgate and apply in determining medical necessity.

Indeed, at times they have merged the analyses, employing the same standard-whether the claims \"arise under\" the Medicare Act-to determine both the issues of preemption and exhaustion.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ardary v.

Penn. Jan. 25, 2011). In these cases, it appears that courts decided whether there was \"preemption\" under 42 U.S. \u00a7 405(g) and (h), the statutory provisions outlining the mandatory administrative process for claims \"arising under\" the Medicare Act. Here, the Court attempts to separate the issues of preemption under the Medicare Act's preemption provision, \u00a7 1395w-26(b)(3), from exhaustion pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g) and (h).
