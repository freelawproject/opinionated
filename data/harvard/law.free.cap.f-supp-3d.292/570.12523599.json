For the reasons set forth herein, the Court DENIES the Estate leave to file its Third Amended Complaint, as supplementation would be futile. The Court also DENIES as moot the Estate's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts and posture of this matter have been extensively laid out in this Court's prior decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gadbois I,\n   </em>\n   slip op. at 2-13, in the First Circuit's opinion in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and in the briefing by the parties on these motions. The Court assumes the reader's familiarity with those details and recites only what is relevant to the issues currently before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July of 2009, Jennifer Denk, a pharmacist previously employed by PharMerica in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, filed a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action against PharMerica in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (the \"Wisconsin action\"). She subsequently filed a first amended complaint in January of 2010. Ms. Denk alleged that PharMerica violated the False Claims Act by submitting fraudulent claims for monetary payment through Medicare and Medicaid, including for Schedule II through V controlled substances. Pursuant to the governing statute, the Wisconsin action was filed under seal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During this time, the original relator in this action, Robert Gadbois, worked as a pharmacist employed by PharMerica in its Warwick, Rhode Island, pharmacy. In November of 2010, he filed this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit alleging that PharMerica was engaged in schemes related to overbilling Medicaid and Medicare Part D for controlled and non-controlled medications. Mr. Gadbois alleged that these false claims brought undue profit to PharMerica, and that these schemes were prevalent beyond just PharMerica's Warwick pharmacy. Mr. Gadbois' allegations reached Schedule II through V drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May of 2013, the United States intervened in the Wisconsin action, and the next month, the complaint was unsealed. A few months later in November, the United States declined to intervene in Mr. Gadbois' action. The complaint in this action was unsealed and ordered served on PharMerica. Shortly thereafter, the State\n   of Rhode Island, on behalf of itself and other named states, similarly declined to intervene in this action. Mr. Gadbois filed his second amended complaint in February of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 3, 2014, this Court dismissed Mr. Gadbois' second amended complaint under the first-to-file bar of the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Gadbois I,\n   </em>\n   slip op. at 22-23. This Court held that Mr. Gadbois' complaint alleged the same scheme as contained in Ms. Denk's complaint, and that Mr. Gadbois' allegations related to non-controlled medications were insufficient to distinguish the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, this Court found that, \"[b]y the time Gadbois filed his initial complaint in this Court, the United States Government had already been alerted to PharMerica's alleged fraudulent scheme on three occasions: Denk's meeting with government officials and Denk's filing of her original and first amended complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Whether the medications in question were controlled or non-controlled, the prescription information required prior to their dispensing was the same, and dispensing either category of medication without a proper prescription disqualified it from reimbursement by Medicare and/or Medicaid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Gadbois appealed the Court's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. While that appeal was pending, two crucial developments unfolded. First, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Carter,\n   </em>\n   which interpreted the first-to-file bar as a temporal bar that dissolves when the precluding suit is no longer \"pending.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589901\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1970/#p1979\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1979,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589901\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1970/#p1979\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Second, the Wisconsin action was settled and dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of these events, the First Circuit held that the jurisdictional bar underpinning this Court's order of dismissal had \"dissolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Faced with a complaint originally dismissed for want of jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals had a choice: allow the original dismissal to stand and require Mr. Gadbois to file a new action, or allow Mr. Gadbois to pursue supplementation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d) to cure the jurisdictional defect. The First Circuit chose the latter course, reasoning that to require dismissal and refiling would be a \"pointless formality.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court of Appeals thus vacated the dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Some six months later, on June 1, 2016, Mr. Gadbois died. His Estate was substituted as relator, through Mr. Gadbois' successor and the Estate's representative, Kristine Cole-Gadbois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Acting on the First Circuit's decision, the Estate sought leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint in December of 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 64. Briefing related to this motion ensued over nearly the next year, including a motion by the Estate to strike PharMerica's response in opposition to the Estate's motion for leave to supplement.

In addition to amending a complaint, a plaintiff\n   may supplement her complaint \"setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.\" Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   PharMerica raises three primary arguments as to why supplementation would be of no avail. Its opening argument is that the proposed supplemental complaint does not relate back to the date of the original complaint. If this is so, PharMerica can take advantage of two defenses which have arisen since the original complaint was filed. First, that this action is barred because it is based upon allegations already subject to a suit in which the Government is a party. Second, that the suit is barred because substantially similar allegations have been publicly disclosed, and because the Estate cannot prove Mr. Gadbois was an original source of the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relation Back\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The supplemental allegation central to the Estate's proposed complaint is that the Wisconsin action has been settled. This development, in conjunction with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kellogg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589901\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1970/#p1979\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , has \"dissolved the jurisdictional bar\" that caused this Court to previously dismiss this action.\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the jurisdictional bar no longer exists going forward, a critical question is whether the supplemental complaint relates back under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the supplemental complaint does not take the date of the original complaint, then PharMerica may have several defenses that would render supplementation futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 8 n.4 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607891\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/436/#p443\">\n    137 S.Ct. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607891\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/436/#p443\">\n    196 L.Ed.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, this was not an explicit holding of the case,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12607891\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/436/#p443\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and the decision did not explicitly overrule the First Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Gadhois II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court must reject PharMerica's request to dismiss the Estate's complaint outright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While the Supreme Court's dictum is procedurally at odds with the First Circuit's holding, the two can be reconciled to reach functional equivalence. The First Circuit realized that simply allowing Mr. Gadbois to supplement, rather than refile his action, would circumvent \"pointless formality.\"\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the formality of dismissal and refiling to indeed be pointless to the simpler alternative of supplementation, both courses of action must have the same legal consequences-that is, any supplemental complaint filed by the Estate to cure a jurisdictional defect must have the same legal effect as filing a new complaint. Thus, the Estate's proposed complaint cannot relate back, and must be given effect no earlier than the day the Estate sought leave to file it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To hold otherwise would wreak the kind of havoc that courts have sought to avoid by requiring dismissal and refiling. If\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relators could file supplemental complaints and relate them back, those plaintiffs could file barebones complaints, \"secure a place in the 'jurisdictional queue ... and thereby trump any meritorious, related actions that were filed in the meantime' \" by relating their supplemental complaints back.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Not relating back these supplemental allegations could also cure the hypothetical scenario that troubled the D.C.

Relator A reaches the courthouse first and his action therefore goes forward. Relator B reaches the courthouse second, but the district court determines his suit is blocked by the first-to-file bar and thus dismisses it per the ordinary course. Relator C files last, and shortly thereafter, the first-filed action is dismissed. But suppose relator C filed her suit so late in the game that the district court fails to dismiss her action before dismissing the first-filed suit. Under Shea's proposed rule, relator C would receive a windfall: she, unlike relator B, could simply amend her existing complaint and thereby secure herself pole position in the first-to-file queue. Relator C would jump past relator B for the opportunity to proceed with her suit (and to share in the government's reward).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

This conflates amendment under Rule 15(a) with supplementation under Rule 15(d), and as counsel for the Estate conceded at argument, the vehicle it seeks to use is supplementation and not amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 10:10-20, ECF No. 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As the First Circuit noted in this case, when ruling on a request to supplement, \"[e]verything depends on context.\"\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Denk specifically alleged that PharMerica dispensed (and sought reimbursement for) medications based on phone orders without a signed prescription, on faxed discharge orders, and on physician orders in the absence of any actual or claimed emergency. Denk also alleged that some of the prescriptions lacked the prescribing physician's signature; that they were non-specific as to quantity; and that some of the prescriptions were re-filled repeatedly, even when a signed prescription had not been received. Not only did Denk's complaint put the government on notice, it is uncontroverted that Denk met with [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration] investigators and [U.S. Department of Justice] attorneys before she ever filed suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   By the time Gadbois filed his initial complaint in this Court, the United States Government had already been alerted to PharMerica's alleged fraudulent scheme on three occasions: Denk's meeting with government officials and Denk's filing of her original and first amended complaints. Although Gadbois seeks to distinguish his case from the Wisconsin action by including in his claims the dispensing of, and billing for, non-controlled medications, he has not established that such a distinction is material to the alleged fraudulent scheme. Whether the medications in question were controlled or non-controlled, the prescription information required prior to their dispensing was the same, and dispensing either category of medication without a proper prescription disqualified\n   it from reimbursement by Medicare and/or Medicaid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (citations omitted).

This means that the Government became a party to Ms. Denk's whole action-every allegation, every cause of action-even if it elected only to proceed with (and ultimately settle) the claims related to controlled Schedule II drugs. The Government was aware of the wide-ranging scheme as alleged by Ms. Denk, including all of the allegations brought by the Estate; it investigated all of those claims; it intervened in Ms. Denk's action; and ultimately reached a settlement of that case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201587215\">\n    2016 WL 1587215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (rejecting argument to consider suit as two proceedings-one in which government intervened and one in which it did not-and reasoned that understanding the case as one action \"fits the purpose of \u00a7 3730(e)(3), to dispense with\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   claims of wrongdoing the government has already discovered thanks to previous suits or proceedings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    When Must the Government Have Been a Party?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The question becomes whether the Government is a \"party\" in the Wisconsin action within the meaning of the statute. The Estate urges that, if the Government were party to all of Ms. Denk's original allegations, it ceased to be when the Wisconsin action settled. The Estate points to the present-tense framing of the government action bar: that no person may bring an action based upon allegations \"which\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   the subject of a civil suit ... in which the Government\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   already a party.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3) (emphasis added).

The Estate, however, argues that the Court must adhere to the overall purpose of the FCA-to recover wrongfully claimed federal funds, and to encourage relators to assist-which will be hampered by this understanding of the government action bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Estate's interpretation ignores the ebb and flow of Congress's amendments to the FCA's jurisdiction, recounted at length by the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Prawer. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 324-26. While the FCA once had broad reach, Congress contracted it with its 1943 amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 325. Finding those limits too stringent, Congress once again revised the FCA in 1986, this time loosening its strictures and adding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the government action bar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 326.

Ultimately, the court determined the purpose of \u00a7 3730(e)(3) was to prevent parasitic lawsuits which enriched the relator without exposing fraud the Government was not already aware of.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817555,10527319\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/645/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 326-27 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

To be sure, the recovery of funds for the Government fisc is an important goal of the FCA's\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   provisions, but the purpose of the government action bar in that larger scheme must be given effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   If the reading of the statute were as the Estate suggests, such that the government action bar dissolves whenever a suit in which the Government is a party is dismissed, the central policies behind the government action bar would be undermined. For example, after the Government is made aware of, investigates, intervenes in, and settles a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   suit, subsequent original source relators (like Mr. Gadbois) could allege the same fraud, bring identical lawsuits, and bring no additional benefit to the Government except the recovery of additional funds. This would be plainly contrary to the purpose of the government action bar: to promote the exposure of additional fraud while weeding out duplicative suits the Government is capable of pursuing on its own. Where the Government already has been party to a suit based on the same allegations, the Government is clearly capable of pursuing the suit itself, and the government action bar should prohibit these duplicative successor suits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Estate ultimately cautions the Court not to interpret the scope of the government action bar too broadly: where a court finds the Government is litigating or has litigated the same claim, then the bar will prevent all future suits based on the same scheme, with no safety valve (such as the \"original source\" exception in the prior public disclosure bar). The Estate specifically invokes the Supreme Court's logic concerning the pending case bar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Under petitioners' interpretation, a first-filed suit would bar all subsequent related suits even if that earlier suit was dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with the merits. Here, for example, the\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   suit, which provided the ground for the initial invocation of the first-to-file rule, was dismissed for failure to prosecute. Why would Congress want the abandonment of an earlier suit to bar a later potentially successful suit that might result in a large recovery for the Government?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Kellogg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12589901\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1970/#p1979\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This reasoning is inapposite as applied to the government action bar. For this concern to arise where the government action bar is at play, it will be in a case where the Government received notice of the suit, investigated the claims, elected to intervene, and then, for whatever reason, chose to abandon the suit. Moreover, there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a safety valve: the text of the government action bar does not appear to preclude the Government itself from reinitiating litigation. The bar applies to \"[a]ctions by private persons.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The Government, however, can bring its own suit for violations of the False Claims Act under a separate provision not subject to the bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For these reasons, the answer to the question of whether the Government is a \"party\" to the Wisconsin action within the meaning of the government action bar must be \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the Court has determined that this case is \"based upon allegations or transactions\" that are the subject of the Wisconsin action, an action to which the Government is a party. Because the Estate's proposed supplemental complaint can be effective no earlier than December 27, 2016, and because the Government was already a party to the Wisconsin litigation on that date, the government action bar precludes the claims set forth in the proposed supplemental complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As the Court concludes that the proposed supplemental complaint cannot take the date of Mr. Gadbois' original complaint, and that the government action bar applies to the Estate's claims, the Court need not reach the applicability of the prior public disclosure bar. Granting the Estate of Robert Gadbois leave to file its supplemental complaint would be futile, as the proposed complaint would leave the Court without subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Estate's motion for leave to file its Third Amended Complaint (ECF No. 64) is DENIED, as supplementation would be futile. The Estate's motion to strike (ECF No. 72) is DENIED as moot. The Court further declines to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the Estate's state law claims. Accordingly, the Court directs the Clerk to enter a judgment of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gadbois II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n    809 F.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    This ruling was made by a now-retired district judge of this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Because the critical issue in this case is supplementation under Rule 15(d), the Court simply refers to this proffered pleading as the proposed supplemental complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In this case, the Court of Appeals did not reach the question of whether the first-to-file bar remains jurisdictional in light of its holding that a supplemental pleading can be used to cure a jurisdictional defect.\n    <em>\n     Gadbois II,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058394\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1/\">\n     809 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    6 n.2.
