Plaintiff's opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment does not identify a genuine dispute of material fact that would preclude the entry of judgment since she has not disputed defendant's assertions of fact, and defendant's statement points to record support for each fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Marino,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902611,3771883\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/1076/\">\n     685 F.3d at 1080\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (observing that one way to put forward a \"meritorious defense\" is by disputing facts on a motion for summary judgment and showing \"with only a hint of a suggestions that key facts in the record aren't yet entirely clear\").
