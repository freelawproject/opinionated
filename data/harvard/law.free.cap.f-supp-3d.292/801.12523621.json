(ISS), its president Derrick Olson, and its vice president Brett Stubblefield (dkt. 1), alleging breach of employment contract (count one), failure to pay final compensation under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act (IWPCA) (count two), retaliatory discharge under the IWPCA (count three), and tortious interference with employment contract (count four).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have moved for summary judgment on all claims. (Dkt. 71.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a contract and labor dispute stemming from the termination of Parise's employment. When the undisputed facts are considered, the following narrative emerges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ISS is a Wisconsin corporation that provides logistics solutions to facilitate the shipping and moving of a variety of products. Olson and Stubblefield co-own ISS and serve as its president and vice president, respectively. In July 2013, defendants learned of a business plan Parise had developed, a managed services model referred to as \"Strategic Transportation Management\" (STM). STM provides an integrated approach to shipping logistics across the financial, technological, and operational departments within a company, making use of the same carrier for inbound and outbound shipments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After several meetings, defendants offered Parise a job, formalized in an employment agreement executed on August 20, 2013. Under the agreement, ISS would employ Parise as its Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) for five years at a salary of $235,000 for the first year, with an increase to $250,000 the second year. In order to meet Parise's $235,000 salary requirement, Olson and Stubblefield each took a 50% pay cut, leaving their combined salaries approximately equal to Parise's individual salary and making Parise the highest paid employee of ISS. The agreement also included a \"Termination for Cause\" provision containing a \"satisfaction clause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The satisfaction clause allowed ISS \"at any time [to] terminate [Parise] for 'cause,' which shall include...failure to perform the duties of [Parise's] position in a satisfactory manner....\" (Dkt. 78, at 18 (first\n   alteration added).) After executing the employment agreement, ISS leased an office in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, where Parise and several other ISS employees worked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the course of the next year, Parise and defendants worked to find clients to implement the STM model. For example, Parise entered into negotiations with McCain Foods on the subject, though the negotiations were ultimately fruitless. Parise also worked on a partial, manual implementation of STM with an existing ISS customer, Northern Safety &amp; Industrial, starting in November 2013. Emails sent by Parise between December 2013 and April 2014 illustrate his continued belief in the project, stating that he was personally working to generate revenue, which was forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Throughout this period, Olson and Stubblefield encouraged employees, including Parise, to work on generating revenue. In an August 2013 email, Olson set a $1 million booked-fees goal for Parise and three other employees, assigning each the goal of $250,000 in revenue by the end of 2013. In January 2014, Olson instituted a sales competition and held individual meetings with employees, including Parise, to discuss ways to increase revenue. In May 2014, ISS hired a logistics executive to evaluate multiple ISS employees, including Parise, and work with them on ways to generate revenue. And in June 2014, Olson and Stubblefield discussed, between themselves, the possibility of restructuring Parise's employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite his enthusiasm (and increasing pressure by Olson and Stubblefield), Parise had not generated any revenue by the end of his first year. On August 28, 2014, Parise sent Stubblefield an email noting that the agreed-to raise had not gone into effect as scheduled on August 16 and asking that the missing increase be included in his September paycheck. Stubblefield forwarded Parise's email to Olson, and subsequent emails between the two indicate that they were disappointed that Parise had brought up the agreed-to raise. Stubblefield acknowledged that Parise was contractually entitled to the raise; nevertheless, both Olson and Stubblefield believed Parise's request was in \"poor taste.\" (Dkt. 82 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Later that evening, Olson sent an email to his business mentor Hillary Harris, expressing his disappointment and anger over Parise's request. In that email he asked Harris, \"Do you think I am wrong for wanting to terminate my relationship with [Parise] when all he really did is ask for what the employment agreement stated he was 'owed'? It feels like [m]uch more than that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By September 3, 2014, Stubblefield and Olson had decided to fire Parise. That same day Olson sent an email to Harris discussing his plan to fire Parise the following day. On September 4, 2014, Parise went to the ISS Wisconsin office to meet with Olson and Stubblefield on other business. Instead, Olson gave him an official termination letter drafted by ISS's attorney. At the same time, Stubblefield gave Parise a document titled \"STM Spin-Off Company Framework\" in which ISS proposed to continue its relationship with Parise, but on an independent contractor basis. Parise rejected the proposal and this lawsuit ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment obviates the need for a trial where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Further, Illinois courts have developed rules for interpreting such clauses.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [S]atisfaction clauses in Illinois come in two categories: those that make the exercise of discretion purely subjective and those that require the exercise of discretion according to objective factors. The first category includes satisfaction clauses invoking the feelings, taste or judgment of the party exercising discretion. When a satisfaction clause conveys this sort of subjective discretion, it does not, however, remove all limitations on the exercise of discretion. The party that has the right to act according to its personal judgment or within its sole discretion must still act in good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   On the other hand, a satisfaction clause may fall into the second category when it involves matters susceptible to objective evaluation; mechanical utility is a stereotype of such matters. When objective considerations control the exercise of discretion, the party to be satisfied must exercise its authority in a just and reasonable way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Kohler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7642392\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/1181/#p1186\">\n    80 F.3d at 1186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Employment contracts, like other personal service contracts, often fall into the first category using the subjective standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beasley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=558%20N.E.2d%20677\">\n    558 N.E.2d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20Ill.%20Dec.%20714\">\n    146 Ill.Dec. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the satisfaction clause here does not contain any objective criteria. (Dkt. 78, at 18.) Thus, ISS's exercise of its discretion as to what is \"satisfactory\" is bounded only by the requirement that it act in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants argue that Parise was terminated because he \"failed to generate a single dollar in over a year working at ISS\" (dkt. 72 at 14) and refused to follow\n   defendants' suggestions for generating revenue. Parise disputes this and asserts that defendants never raised any complaints about his performance during his tenure at ISS. He argues that defendants terminated him because they were offended by his request for the salary increase, which he supports in part by pointing to the emails discussing Olson's and Stubblefield's disappointment with the salary increase request. Parise argues that termination for this reason did not constitute good faith. (Dkt. 77 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Viewing the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to Parise, a reasonable jury could find that defendants did not act in accordance with their duty of good faith in terminating Parise's employment. Genuine factual disputes exist as to Olsen and Stubblefield's belief that Parise was not performing to their satisfaction, their expectation of when the STM business plan would start to bring in revenue, and whether Parise was fired because he made a lawful request to enforce the employment agreement between him and ISS. All of these facts would bear on whether ISS acted in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment on count I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Dkt. 72, at 14-15.) In response, Parise points to evidence in the record that he argues establishes substantial in-state activity by defendants. (Dkt. 77, at 12-13, citing dkt. 79 \u00b6 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) In particular, he notes that the Rolling Meadows office was maintained for the benefit of multiple employees, including Olson and Stubblefield, who would use the office when they were in town; that defendants sought a \"Chicago presence\" and actively marketed to potential clients in Chicago, including making presentations to Illinois-based companies and entertaining potential clients in Illinois; and, finally, that defendants did business with the Illinois-based employee of a third-party resource for the sales side of their business. Viewing the undisputed facts in the light most favorable Parise, there is a triable issue of fact about whether defendants engaged in substantial in-state activity sufficient to render them subject to liability under the IWPCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, summary judgment is inappropriate on the issue of whether defendants are subject to liability under the IWPCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Failure to Pay Final Compensation under the IWPCA (Count II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 115/14(a) of the IWPCA states that \"[a]ny employee not timely paid...final compensation\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...as required by this Act shall be entitled to recover...in a civil action...the amount of any such underpayments and damages of 2% of the amount of any such underpayments....\" Parise alleges that defendants failed to pay him final compensation due under the parties' agreement, including severance and other amounts omitted from his final paycheck, in violation of the IWPCA. (Dkt. 1 at 4-5.) Defendants argue that Parise's claim is moot because he is not entitled to severance and they have already paid him for discrepancies in his final paycheck. (Dkt. 77 at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants do not dispute that they have not made a severance payment to Parise. Instead, in footnote 7 of their opening summary judgment brief, they claim Parise was not entitled to severance. (Dkt. 72, at 15.) Despite stating that they will do so, defendants make no argument \"elsewhere in their brief\" about why Parise was not entitled to severance. (Dkt. 72, at 15.) The court infers that defendants' argument is that no severance is due to Parise because he was terminated for cause. Because the issue of whether Parise's termination was for cause under the agreement is still in dispute, however, the question of whether Parise is entitled to severance is, likewise, still in dispute and must be decided by the trier of fact. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on count II as to the severance claim is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Regarding the issue of discrepancies in Parise's final paycheck, Parise does not dispute that he received two checks in May 2015 to remedy those discrepancies. The court therefore finds count II moot to the extent it requests relief for discrepancies in Parise's final paycheck that are unrelated to severance, and summary judgment is granted on this specific issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Retaliatory Discharge under the IWPCA (Count III)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Count III is a statutory claim of retaliatory discharge. Section 115/14(c) of the IWPCA mandates that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Any employer, or any agent of an employer, who discharges or in any other manner discriminates against any employee because that employee has made a complaint to his employer...that he or she has not been paid in accordance with the provisions of this Act ...is guilty, upon conviction, of a Class C misdemeanor. An employee who has been unlawfully retaliated against shall be entitled to recover through a claim filed with the Department of Labor or in a civil action, but not both, all legal and equitable relief as may be appropriate.

(Dkt. 72, at 17.) Quoting liberally from\n   <em>\n    Precision Alliance\n   </em>\n   , they argue that, because they have provided a \"valid nonpretextual basis for discharging\" Parise, Parise has failed to establish the elements of retaliatory discharge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.)\n   <em>\n    Precision Alliance\n   </em>\n   , however, makes clear that an employer's \"valid nonpretextual reason\" will defeat liability only if \"\n   <em>\n    the trier of fact believes it\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Precision Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20Ill.%20Dec.%2012\">\n    387 Ill.Dec. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20N.E.3d%201183\">\n    21 N.E.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Parise has pointed to evidence in the record, including the email Olsen sent to his mentor acknowledging Parise was entitled to the salary increase pursuant to their written agreement and that he felt hurt by Parise's request, (dkt. 77, at 11), from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Parise's request was the reason for his termination.

Moreover, Parise has pointed to evidence in the record that Olson and Stubblefield stood to personally\n   gain financially from his termination, as they had previously taken 50 percent pay cuts in order to pay his salary, a reason that could be inconsistent with a proper business purpose of ISS. Thus, taken in the light most favorable to Parise, a reasonable jury could conclude from the evidence in the record that Olson or Stubblefield, or both, were not motivated by a proper business purpose and did not act in good faith. Olson and Stubblefield respond that, because they have testified that Parise was terminated for failure to generate revenue, no reasonable jury could conclude that they terminated Parise's employment\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   for personal gain or from a desire to harm him. This argument is unavailing, because a reasonable jury could conclude that Olson and Stubblefield are not credible and reject their testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not the place of the court to weigh the evidence at the summary judgment stage.
