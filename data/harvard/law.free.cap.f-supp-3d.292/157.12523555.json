BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Should a federal court stand idly by when a foreign arbitral commission issues an order restricting the speech of a private party? Actually, yes. Here, two Asian television manufacturers, Sharp and Hisense, entered into a 2015 licensing agreement under which Hisense would make and market televisions bearing Sharp's name. In 2017, alleging that Hisense had violated various regulatory standards and failed to maintain the quality of its television sets, Sharp terminated the agreement. A week later, under a provision of the licensing agreement providing that all disputes would be arbitrated by the Singapore International Arbitration Center, Hisense filed an arbitration action there. Among other relief, Hisense sought an emergency order requiring that Sharp abide by the agreement while the full arbitration was pending and enjoining it from making disruptive or disparaging statements about Hisense or the licensing dispute. In May 2017, an emergency arbitrator in Singapore issued an interim award granting that injunctive request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sharp thereafter filed suit here and now seeks a preliminary injunction declaring that the interim award is not enforceable in the United States because it contradicts U.S. public policy. Specifically, Sharp argues that the emergency award-which it deems a \"gag order\"-would prevent it from communicating with both consumers and the Federal Communications Commission, and is thus against the policies enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Hisense opposes the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction and has moved to dismiss the case, asserting that this Court lacks both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, and that the award does not violate our public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although subject-matter jurisdiction exists here, personal jurisdiction does not; in any event, the interim award does not contradict any fundamental public policy that would allow Sharp to prevail. The Court will therefore dismiss the Complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given the Court's ruling here, it must consider the facts as set forth in the Complaint. The relationship between Sharp and Hisense started on amicable terms. In July 2015, Sharp, a Japanese electronics company, entered into a limited trademark-licensing agreement (TLA) with Hisense, a Chinese manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1 (Complaint), \u00b6 24. The TLA allows Hisense to \"manufacture, assemble, promote, market, distribute, [and] sell\" Sharp-branded televisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28-2 (Licensing Agreement), \u00b6 2.1. It also provides that \"[a]ny disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved in Singapore by Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of [the Centre,] ... which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference.\" TLA, \u00b6 28.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Sharp, \"immediately\" after entering into the TLA, Hisense began to fall short of its contractual obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 2. It allegedly \"fail[ed] to comply with regulations and maintain the required standards and quality of its television sets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on these violations, Sharp terminated the TLA on April 17, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. On April 24, Hisense filed for arbitration in Singapore with the SIAC, seeking emergency relief to reinstate the TLA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 9, an arbitrator appointed to consider the emergency motion issued a 33-page \"emergency\" interim award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-3 (Emergency Award). The interim award prohibited Sharp from terminating the TLA, required it to continue to perform under the agreement while the arbitration was pending, and imposed an order stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Sharp] shall refrain from, directly or indirectly through its affiliates, disparaging [Hisense] and/or disrupting its business, including by making public statements or press releases about this arbitration and/or the dispute between [Hisense] and [Sharp], or approaching [Hisense's] business associates and/or other third parties (including, but not limited to, [Hisense's] customers, suppliers, content and service providers, and/or regulatory authorities, except as required by law), in respect of any matters that are to be addressed in arbitration under the [License Agreement].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Emergency Award, \u00b6 135 (iii). It is this portion of the award, which Sharp characterizes as a \"one-sided Gag Order,\" Mot. for PI at 3, that Plaintiffs now contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 15, 2017, Plaintiffs Sharp Corporation and Sharp Electronics Corporation filed a Complaint in this Court, alleging that the emergency order \"is contrary to the public policy of the United States embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution, including (1) the public policy that prohibits a prior restraint on speech absent extraordinary circumstances, and (2) the public policy that favors the right to petition the Government.\" Compl., \u00b6 5.

Granting the motion for a declaratory judgment would not \"set aside\" or \"vacate\" the underlying award. Instead, it would determine only whether the emergency order is enforceable in the United States,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 2, not whether it is valid worldwide. Such a determination clearly falls within the purview of secondary-jurisdiction courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs are not seeking to vacate the arbitration award also resolves Defendants' alternative contention that Sharp's suit is untimely. Although the New York Convention does not contain a statute of limitations for petitions to vacate arbitration awards, the FAA, which supplements the Convention, requires that such actions be filed within three months after the award is filed or delivered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hisense asserts that Sharp is, in fact, suing to vacate the emergency award, and that Plaintiffs' action is untimely because it was filed one week after the three-month period expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hisense Reply at 12-13. As the Court concludes that Sharp is seeking only to have the emergency order declared unenforceable in the United States-and the FAA contains a three-year statute of limitations for such enforcement actions-its suit is therefore timely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Declaratory Judgment Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Determining that Plaintiffs are not seeking to vacate the arbitration award, however, does not fully resolve the jurisdictional inquiry. This is because Sharp's suit comes before the Court in a\n   somewhat unusual posture-a motion for a declaratory judgment that the emergency order is unenforceable. As Defendants note, the New York Convention discusses the power of a court in a secondary jurisdiction over actions to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   arbitration awards and the ability of defendants to raise certain affirmative defenses in such enforcement proceedings. The Convention does not, however, expressly address suits in which a party preemptively seeks to have an award declared\n   <em>\n    unenforceable\n   </em>\n   , as is the case here. Hisense argues that this distinction matters, and that the Court therefore lacks jurisdiction over Sharp's \"proactive\" action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 12.

Here, Plaintiffs are asking for a declaration that the interim relief issued by the emergency arbitrator-the so-called \"gag order\"-is unenforceable in the United States. Presumably, the suit Sharp wishes to disable is an action by Defendants to\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   the emergency order in U.S. courts. The question is thus whether this Court would have subject-matter jurisdiction over that \"hypothetical threatened action.\"\n   <em>\n    Medtronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701985,12585925\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/843/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It requires no gift of premonition to see that the answer is yes. The implementing\n   provisions of the FAA state that, when a court has primary or secondary jurisdiction under the New York Convention, \"[a]n action or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20203\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, this Court would clearly have secondary jurisdiction over an enforcement action by Hisense in U.S. courts. The Court, accordingly, has federal-question jurisdiction over this corollary action for a declaratory judgment. Indeed, in a remarkably similar case,\n   <em>\n    Hospira, Inc. v. Therabel Pharma N.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203811488\">\n    2013 WL 3811488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Hospira\n   </em>\n   addressed the interaction between the Declaratory Judgment Act and the New York Convention, noting that the plaintiff's complaint \"anticipates a suit by [Defendant] ... to compel [Plaintiff] into arbitration before the ICC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. Finding that it would have jurisdiction over such \"anticipated claims,\" the court concluded that it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the action for a declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The facts of this case nearly mirror those in\n   <em>\n    Hospira\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs are asking for a declaratory judgement in anticipation of an enforcement claim by Defendants under the New York Convention. As this Court would have jurisdiction over such a case pursuant to the FAA and the Convention, it thus has federal-question jurisdiction over the instant suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Court at oral argument independently raised the issue of whether a particular SIAC rule precludes Sharp's challenge to the emergency interim award. SIAC Schedule 1, Rule 12 states that an emergency award \"shall be binding on the parties from the date it is made\" and that the parties \"irrevocably waive their rights to any form of appeal, review or recourse to any State court or other judicial authority with respect to such Award insofar as such waiver may be validly made.\" SIAC Rules, http://www.siac.org.sg/our-rules/rules/siac-rules-2016. Although the text of this rule would appear to preclude Plaintiffs' suit contesting the scope of the emergency award, Defendants did not raise this issue in their papers. The Court will therefore consider this argument forfeited and need not determine the effect of the SIAC rules on Sharp's ability to file the instant suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Personal Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court turns next to Defendants' position that Sharp has not demonstrated personal jurisdiction in the District over Hisense International and Hisense USA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Legal Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Personal jurisdiction may take the form of general or specific jurisdiction.

The California court order in fact\n   <em>\n    supports\n   </em>\n   Defendants' argument that, regardless of the status of Hisense Co., Ltd., the two subsidiaries in this case are not agents of a foreign state. In the California case, Sharp initially filed an action in state court, and Hisense Co., Ltd. removed the entire action to federal district court under the FSIA. In order to show federal jurisdiction under the FSIA, Hisense Co., Ltd. asserted that it was an \"agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\" as it is directly and wholly owned by a political subdivision of the Chinese government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.D.

Yet, although Hisense USA and Hisense Intl. were named defendants in the California state action, they did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   join the notice of removal, and Hisense Co., Ltd. did not assert that its subsidiaries were also agencies or instrumentalities of the Chinese state.

More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that the emergency order violates the First Amendment's \"well defined and dominant\" public policy against \"one-sided gag orders\" and restrictions on a party's ability to petition the government. In relying on the First Amendment, however, Sharp runs into a significant obstacle-the principle that without governmental action, there can be no First Amendment violation. According to Hisense, as this suit presents no such state action, Sharp is out of luck. In response, Sharp first argues that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   in fact governmental action in this case-in the form of the Court's enforcement or nonenforcement of the arbitration award.

Foreign Judgments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, the Court turns briefly to Plaintiffs' reliance upon a limited number of cases in which U.S. courts have refused to enforce foreign\n   <em>\n    judgments\n   </em>\n   because they were contrary to the public policy of the First Amendment. This line of decisions appears to be confined largely to a narrow area of law-libel judgments issued by foreign courts. As Sharp correctly notes, federal courts have found certain foreign judgments unenforceable in the United States, concluding that such judgments are \"repugnant\" to the public policy of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matusevitch v.

While having some superficial allure, these cases offer no succor here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As an initial matter, all of Sharp's cited cases involve\n   <em>\n    judgments\n   </em>\n   rendered by foreign\n   <em>\n    courts\n   </em>\n   -not arbitration awards issued by private arbitrators. This distinction matters. First, as Defendants point out, the enforcement of foreign judgments is governed not by the New York Convention, but instead by general notions of comity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yahoo!, Inc. v.

Here, the \"cause of action\" that led to the judgment against Sharp is an action pursuant to an arbitration award entered under a private agreement between private parties. The fact that the emergency order was, in this case, issued by a foreign arbitrator makes no difference. The First Amendment would be no more offended by the parties' arbitration agreement and the resulting award if such proceedings occurred across the street. The foreign-judgment cases cited by Plaintiffs are thus distinguishable from the facts of this case, as they are concerned with whether a foreign court has entertained a cause of action that would not be cognizable if brought in this country.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yahoo! Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473083\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/169/1181/#p1192\">\n    169 F.Supp.2d at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that foreign judgment \"clearly would be inconsistent with the First Amendment if mandated by a court in the United States\"). The SIAC arbitrator, by contrast, issued an order that the precedent shows would be permissible and enforceable, even if made by a U.S. arbitral body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, it is reasonable that U.S. courts may be more concerned with the First Amendment implications of foreign judgments than foreign arbitral awards. The former come far closer to the state-action concerns of the First Amendment than do the latter, as they involve the coercive power of a state over potentially non-consenting parties. Arbitration, by contrast, simply involves the bargained-for results of the parties' mutual agreement to forgo the judicial system. Although it is not explicit in the reasoning of the foreign libel decisions, the Court finds persuasive this distinction between the level of state action involved in foreign judgments versus foreign arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Montr\u00e9 D. Carodine,\n   <em>\n    Political Judging: When Due Process Goes International\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Wm.%20%26%20Mary%20L.%20Rev.%201159\">\n    48 Wm. &amp; Mary L.

[P]arties freely and voluntarily enter into private contracts. A foreign judgment is usually obtained after litigation ... [and] under most circumstances, the [defendant] can hardly be said to have voluntarily agreed to the terms of the foreign judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Indeed, unlike foreign judgments, arbitration proceedings and awards are \"simply a matter of contract between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p943\">\n    514 U.S. 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p943\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339246\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/938/#p943\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). The determinations of an arbitral body are a reflection of that bargained-for arrangement and involve no independent governmental acts. Here, no law compelled Sharp and Hisense to submit to arbitration. The two parties entered into the arbitration provision of the TLA willingly, and no state action was involved in the proceedings or entry of the interim award. The Court therefore finds the foreign-judgment decisions inapposite, in part because they reflect a degree of governmental involvement not present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Put simply, there is no free-floating, penumbral public policy protecting free speech. The principle underlying the First Amendment-that citizens shall be free from government acts infringing upon their rights of expression and petition-is inherently tied to the state-action requirement. Because Sharp can make no showing of such government involvement, and because all of its counts rely upon the alleged violations of First Amendment policies, the\n   Court will grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Discretion Under Declaratory Judgment Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition to the lack of personal jurisdiction and Plaintiffs' failure to state a claim, there is yet another reason why Sharp comes up empty. Given the ongoing arbitration proceedings in this case, the Court is unconvinced that a declaratory judgment is the appropriate relief at this time. As has long been held, the Declaratory Judgment Act gives courts discretion to determine \"whether and when to entertain an action.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilton v.

Cir. 2004) (affirming district court decision to adjourn case pursuant to New York Convention, where foreign set-aside proceeding was underway);\n   <em>\n    In Re Arb. of Certain Controversies Between Getma Int'l &amp; Republic of Guinea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228807\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/110/#p116\">\n    142 F.Supp.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116-17 (D.D.C. 2015) (granting stay of arbitration-award action pending resolution of foreign proceeding seeking annulment of award and noting possibility that award will be set aside favors granting stay). As was articulated in this Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hanes\n   </em>\n   , the \"propriety of granting a declaratory judgment\" is informed, in part, by the question of whether \"other remedies are available or other proceedings pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074554,3696902\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/531/585/\">\n    531 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   591 n.4. Here, such proceedings are already well underway. Foreign proceedings to vacate the emergency award were initiated prior to the instant suit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exh. E, and the SIAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   is only months away from taking action on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court therefore finds that practical considerations counsel it to refrain from exercising its authority to issue a declaratory judgment. Even in a world in which the merits of this case were not so readily resolved in Defendants' favor, Plaintiffs would nonetheless not prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Although Plaintiffs certainly feel aggrieved by the emergency order imposed upon them by the SIAC, they have no legal recourse in this Court. There is no personal jurisdiction over Defendants in the District, and, even if there were, the emergency order does not violate a fundamental public policy. And, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Court reached neither of those conclusions, it would nonetheless decline to exercise its authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act in light of the pending motion to vacate before the SIAC. For all of these reasons, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue on this date.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
