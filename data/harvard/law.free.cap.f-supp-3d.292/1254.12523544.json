Plaintiff has filed a response [Doc. No. 28], and Defendants have replied [Doc. No. 29]. Thus, the Motion is fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Johnny Reininger, Jr. is deaf. He resides in Oklahoma and tracks the status of state legislative bills, particularly ones that affect disabled individuals. Defendants State of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State Senate, Oklahoma House of Representatives, and their respective leaders-President Pro Tempore Mike Shulz and Speaker Charles A. McCall-maintain internet websites that show live feeds of legislative hearings and proceedings. Plaintiff claims he does not have meaningful access to this information because the audio content of the online broadcasts is not captioned and he cannot understand what is being said. Plaintiff has contacted both legislative bodies about the lack of captioning and has asked them to bring the websites into compliance with federal\n   disability discrimination laws. Plaintiff alleges that despite an admission of noncompliance, captioning has not been provided due to budgetary constraints. Defendants state in their Motions that captioning would be cost prohibitive and technologically difficult and, as an alternative, they have offered to provide interpretive services if Plaintiff gives advance notice that he wants to attend a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff brings suit claiming that Defendants have violated and are violating Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , by failing to provide captioning for internet broadcasts of the Oklahoma Legislature's proceedings. Title II of the ADA prohibits the exclusion of a qualified individual with a disability from participation in the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, and implementing regulations require that a public entity \"furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities, including ... members of the public, an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a service, program, or activity of a public entity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.160\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The Rehabilitation Act extends similar requirements to programs that receive federal financial assistance. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of Defendants' failure to caption, he has been unable to access legislative information that is available to hearing persons, and he has suffered mental anguish and other nonpecuniary losses. Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, and injunctive relief, to include a mandatory injunction compelling Defendants \"to make accessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing all audio and video content on their websites, including by displaying simultaneous captioning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1] at 7 (Relief, \u00b6 e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendants' Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants seek dismissal on grounds of sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution and States' immunity from federal control under the Tenth Amendment. Although Defendants do not designate their Motion as one for partial dismissal, it is clear upon closer inspection that Defendants do not challenge Plaintiff's action in its entirety. Defendants state that while they do not concede the Rehabilitation Act abrogates sovereign immunity, they \"believe this argument is best left for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Dismiss [Doc. No. 26] at 2, n.2. The Motion addresses the issues of sovereign immunity and States' rights only as they pertain to Plaintiff's ADA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.160\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2035.160\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Defendants assert that they are immune from suit under the ADA and further that application of the ADA in the manner asserted by Plaintiff would be ... impermissible under the Tenth Amendment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Further, Defendants assert that the individuals sued in their official capacities, President Pro Tempore Shulz and Speaker McCall, enjoy sovereign immunity only from an ADA suit for money damages. They admit the Tenth Circuit has authorized an action for prospective injunctive relief against a state official for a violation of the ADA under the\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

As framed by Defendants, \"[t]he issue presented for decision is whether Title II of the ADA commandeers the Oklahoma Legislature if the Court finds that [the legislature] must close caption its floor sessions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

As agreed by all parties, there are two types of challenges to subject matter jurisdiction: (1) facial attacks on the sufficiency of the allegations contained in the complaint; and (2) challenges to the actual facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction is based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holt v.

Dismiss [Doc. No. 26] at 10-12. Instead, Defendants ask the Court to rule that a particular remedy sought by Plaintiff under the ADA is unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (arguing that Title II of the ADA would invade state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment if the Oklahoma Legislature is required to either pass laws or make appropriations to implement captioning).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds, however, that the issue of what relief may be available to Plaintiff if he prevails on his ADA claim is not ripe for decision or appropriate for resolution under Rule 12(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Typically, a Rule 12(b) motion tests the sufficiency of a claim and not a prayer for relief.

This Court has previously held that whether a particular remedy, such as punitive damages, is \"recoverable in a case is not a proper subject for adjudication in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, as the prayer for relief is not a part of the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Douglas v.

The Court further finds that a decision whether Plaintiff may obtain a mandatory injunction to enforce the ADA in a particular manner would be premature at this stage of the proceedings, prior to any factual development or determination of liability.
