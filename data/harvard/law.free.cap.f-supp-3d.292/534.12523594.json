The\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint contends that the Town of Framingham, two police detectives, the Massachusetts Division of Children and Families, two social workers, an extended family member, five private attorneys, a state judge, the Middlesex County District Attorney, and an Assistant District Attorney unlawfully attempted to deprive plaintiffs Thomas and Joann Tierney of custody of their grandson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nearly all defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for a multitude of reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among them are lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and failure to provide a short and plain statement of plaintiffs' theory of relief. In addition, three defendants have requested that the Court award them reasonable costs and attorney's fees. For the reasons stated below, the motions to dismiss will be granted, and the requests for costs and attorney's fees will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts are set forth as described in the complaint, supplemented by certain official\n   public records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thomas and Joann Tierney (collectively, the \"Tierneys\") are grandparents and legal guardians of minor child T.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tierneys were then charged by the Middlesex District Attorney's office with assault and battery and child endangerment.\n   <em>\n    See Commonwealth v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It appears that the prosecuting Assistant District Attorney was Kate Cimini. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   T. was then removed from the custody of the Tierneys by DCF for 96 days while he was hospitalized.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). The complaint alleges that Justice Tan \"enforced a state scheduling law ['the 72-hour rule']\" during this hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Attorneys Belle Soloway, Judith Hyatt, and Cynthia Pucillo were appointed to represent Thomas, Joann, and T., respectively, at the hearing.
