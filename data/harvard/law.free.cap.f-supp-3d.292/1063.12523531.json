The court declines to make that conversion here and therefore does not reach Hawaii Masons' new Training Fund argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Another argument regarding an alleged \"Training Fund delinquency,\" ECF 17, PageID # 112, fails for the same reason. In the Memorandum in Opposition but not in the Complaint, Hawaii Masons avers that \"Defendants\" \"are in possession\" of assets \"which were actually paid to the Training Fund,\" and which \"should be considered plan assets, giving rise to a fiduciary duty.\" ECF 17, PageID # s 99, 112, 113 (citing affidavit of Karen Tamashiro);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 1 (containing no such allegations). The court will not consider these recent claims and allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court Dismisses the Alter Ego Claims as Conclusory.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendants Fuchs and Nelson insist that the alter ego allegations, much like the fiduciary duty allegations, are \"conclusory and contain no factual substance.\" ECF 15, PageID # 80. The court agrees and dismisses the alter ego claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Complaint asserts that \"at all relevant times, Global Stone was the alter ego and/or the mere instrumentality of [Fuchs and Nelson],\" and thus Fuchs and Nelson are liable for any unpaid contributions \"as a matter of equity and fairness.\" ECF 1, PageID # s 12, 13. The Complaint provides no specific factual allegations in support of this assertion. Instead, it lists \"factors,\" alleging that \"all or some\" of them are \"relevant\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   a) Undercapitalization\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   b) Failure to observe corporate formalities\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   c) Absence of corporate records\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   d) Insolvency of corporation at time of transaction\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   e) Siphoning off of funds by the dominant shareholder(s)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   f) Shareholders guarantying [sic] corporate liabilities in their individual capacities\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   g) Nonfunctioning officers or directors\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   h) Lack of officers or directors\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   i) Failure to issue stock\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   j) Absence of consideration for stock\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   k) Corporation is a facade of the operation of the dominant shareholder(s)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   l) Corporation's inability to meet payroll and other obligations\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   m) Commingling of funds or assets\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   n) Stripping the corporation of assets in anticipation of litigation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   o) Use of the corporate shell to advance purely personal ends\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   p) Treatment of corporate assets as personal assets\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   q) Cash advances to shareholders/officers/directors\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   r) Advances to corporation by shareholders\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   s) Undocumented loans\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   t) Use of individual rather than corporate checks and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   u) Fraud and misrepresentation with respect to Trust Fund plan assets of which [Fuchs and/or Nelson] was a fiduciary for the employees covered by the Bargaining Agreement and trust agreements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   ECF 1, PageID # s 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Later, the Complaint lists other factors, \"all or some\" of which are allegedly \"relevant\" to the alter ego claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   a) Nonpayment of trust fund obligations by Global Stone;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   b) Violation of statute or public policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   c) Misrepresentations by Global Stone and/or members/officers/directors; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   d) The acting principals of Global Stone[ ] were responsible for and ratified administrative decisions exercised on behalf of Global Stone, were vested with the authority to exercise discretionary control over the management of the financial responsibilities and business affairs of GLOBAL STONE, and exercised discretionary control over the management of the financial responsibilities and business affairs of GLOBAL STONE including, but not limited to, authorizing and tendering the payment of contributions and withholdings due to the funds pursuant to the Bargaining Agreement and trust fund agreements; and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   e) The acting principals of Global Stone intentionally misrepresented to Trust Funds the amount of hours worked by its employees by failing to report and/or transmit contributions in a timely fashion to Trust Funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   ECF 1, PageID # 14 (emphases omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Given the \"all or some\" language, the court and Defendants cannot tell what is\n   really at issue. Does Hawaii Masons submit that Global Stone's veil should be pierced based only on \"undercapitalization,\" or do\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the enumerated factors apply? The conclusory list is not supported by any factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1, PageID # s 12-14. In light of the conclusory and nonspecific allegations, Hawaii Masons' alter ego claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Court Dismisses the Constructive Trust Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Complaint supports its constructive trust claim with a single allegation: \"[a]s a result of\" Fuchs and Nelson's \"breach of their fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the participants and beneficiaries of Trust Funds as alleged herein, plan assets have been improperly diverted from Trust Funds to Global Stone and/or\" Fuchs and Nelson. ECF 1, PageID # 11. Therefore, says Hawaii Masons, a \"constructive trust should be imposed upon the assets of\" Fuchs and Nelson.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"452830\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/932/#p934\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The court has already dismissed the fiduciary claims against Fuchs and Nelson as a matter of law and because the supporting allegations are conclusory. The court agrees with Fuchs and Nelson that, on the present state of the pleadings, \"there can be no legal basis for the Court to order a constructive trust on the[ir] personal property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 15-2, PageID # 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The other rulings in this district are not binding here, and Hawaii Masons was free to raise its arguments in the present case. Moreover, this court has given Hawaii Masons leave to amend it Complaint, so that which party will ultimately prevail has not yet been determined. Finally, Defendants have not complied with Local Rule 54.3, which requires, among other things, a description of the work performed by counsel and a tabulation of the time required to perform the work.

This court nevertheless discusses those provisions here because what their language is does not appear to be in dispute. Moreover, converting the present motion to dismiss to a summary judgment motion disadvantages Hawaii Masons, the very party that quotes the language in its Memorandum in Opposition.
