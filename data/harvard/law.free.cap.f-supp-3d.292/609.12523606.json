In addition, defendants hired Plaintiff knowing he was Hispanic and Chief Palmer and other others actually thought Plaintiff would be an asset because he was bilingual.

Because a reasonable factfinder could find that defendants have advanced a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for plaintiff's discharge, it therefore falls to Plaintiff to present evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable factfinder to find by a preponderance of the evidence that defendants' reasons were mere pretext, and that discrimination of some sort was the true reason for Plaintiff's termination.\n    <em>\n     Fasold v.

However, Plaintiff himself has admitted that he deserved the written and verbal warnings he received for his actions at the firing range, that he had difficulty writing police reports, that he failed to prepare proper crash reports to the District Attorney's office, that he failed to call for backup or even call in the report of a man in a Mercedes with a gun and that he drove too fast to the call at\n    McDonald's. Although Plaintiff disputed that he was driving too fast in the residential neighborhood on Halloween, Chief Palmer and the Court witnessed Plaintiff speeding in the videos and Officer Steckel and his brother witnessed plaintiff speeding through the residential neighborhood. There is no evidence in the record that either Chief Palmer or Officer Steckel bore any racial animus to Plaintiff. There is nothing implausible or inconsistent about defendants' course of action in failing to retain Plaintiff because of his numerous transgressions during his probationary period and because his driving presented a danger to the community. Plaintiff had been cited by Officer Santo as far back as Plaintiff's Field Training for driving too fast. The Halloween incident occurred just two months after Plaintiff had been counseled by Lieutenant Smith for driving too fast. A reasonable factfinder could not conclude that Plaintiff has satisfied his burden of persuasion under the first\n    <em>\n     Fuentes\n    </em>\n    prong to show that defendants' reasons for his termination should not be believed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Moreover, even if it were true that the warnings and misconducts that Plaintiff received were the result of some form of setup, Plaintiff has completely failed to identify any evidence that any alleged setup was based on his race and/or national origin.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    Plaintiff also cannot meet the second prong of the\n    <em>\n     Fuentes\n    </em>\n    standard. As discussed above in the context of Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case, the only pieces of evidence Plaintiff offers are that Sergeant Smith mocked his accent on two or three occasions and his own opinion that Sergeant Smith resented him because of his race and national origin. Furthermore, Sergeant Smith was not the decision maker in this case. It was Chief Palmer and Township Manager Christman. This evidence is not sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating cause of his termination. The record contains no evidence that anything other than Plaintiff's driving and myriad of other performance problems during his probationary period motivated his termination recommendation by Chief Palmer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Plaintiff nevertheless argues that Chief Palmer was influenced by the alleged racial animus of Sergeant Smith towards Plaintiff in making his decision not to retain Plaintiff and therefore Palmer Township should be liable under a \"cat's paw\" theory of liability. \"Cat's paw liability applies when a member of a protected class is subjected to an adverse employment action by a decisionmaker who is himself free of discriminatory animus, but whose actions are influenced by other employees who are motivated by discriminatory animus.\"\n    <em>\n     Burlington v. News Corporation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880338\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/55/723/#p731\">\n     55 F.Supp.3d 723\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 731 (E.D.

There is no evidence in the record to support this theory. Chief Palmer's decision to terminate Plaintiff was based in large part on Plaintiff's driving record and the other reports he had received. Sergeant Smith did not communicate with Chief Palmer about Plaintiff's driving record and poor report writing. Rather, it was Chief Palmer himself who viewed two videos of Plaintiff speeding and running stop signs and a red light. Sergeant Smith also did not accuse plaintiff of driving too fast on Halloween. Rather, it was Officer Steckel and his brother who filed a complaint against Plaintiff at the suggestion of Lieutenant Smith. There is no evidence in the record that nay of these individuals bore any racial animus to Plaintiff. With regard to the incidents at the firing range, which resulted in the written and verbal warnings, Plaintiff admitted to almost all of the\n    charges and even testified the filing of the administrative charges against him by Sergeant Smith were not the result of discrimination. Therefore, those incidents clearly happened and were not \"drummed up\" by Sergeant Smith. The incident about the improper crash reports had nothing to do with Sergeant Smith, but was reported by Sergeant Sipel and the incident involving the packages for the District Attorney's Office was reported by Sergeant Ruoff. Accordingly, Plaintiff's discriminatory discharge claims can not survive summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Plaintiff's retaliation claim is analyzed under the same\n    <em>\n     McDonnell Douglas\n    </em>\n    burden-shifting scheme as his discrimination claims.\n    <em>\n     Woodson v.

He also claims that he was often yelled at and humiliated by Sergeant Smith. Plaintiff does not point to any racially discriminatory comments made by any of the other defendants. In fact, he admitted there were none. Nor is there any evidence that any Palmer Township official took actions against Plaintiff that were physically threatening, frequent or that interfered with Plaintiff's ability to perform his job. In addition, Plaintiff admitted that he did not report any claims of harassment or discrimination to any ranking officer. A reasonable factfinder simply\n    could not find that the mocking of his accent on two or three occasions by Sergeant Smith constituted intentional discrimination and was severe and pervasive. While Plaintiff may have had a poor relationship with Sergeant Smith, a poor working relationship with a supervisor is not enough state a claim for racial harassment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Walton v.

Plaintiff claims that Palmer Township was negligent in,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , failing to implement an effective policy against racial and national origin discrimination and harassment and in failing to properly investigate Plaintiff's complaints of racial and national origin discrimination. The record reveals that Palmer Township had multiple anti-discrimination and harassment policies in place. Plaintiff also acknowledged that he \"carefully read\" the Manual which contained these policies. Yet, Plaintiff admitted that he never complained to any ranking official in Palmer Township about being the victim of discrimination and harassment based on race and national origin. It is not possible for Palmer Township to investigate something about which no official has been informed about in the first place. While Plaintiff testified that he complained to Chief Palmer about harassment from Sergeant Smith, Plaintiff admitted that he did not complain about harassment based on\n    <em>\n     race and national origin\n    </em>\n    . In any event, Chief Palmer responded to the allegations of harassment by trying to shift Plaintiff to another platoon, albeit without success.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Plaintiff has also brought a claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , claiming the defendants terminated him without due process of law and that Palmer Township maintained a policy, practice or procedure that was designed to allow his termination without due process of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    \"Probationary police officers have neither a property interest in their employment, nor an absolute right to a pre- or post-termination hearing.\"\n    <em>\n     Bartal v.

As stated by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, \"The very notion of probationary employment sets those employees apart from the others, signaling that they are new, newly transferred or newly promoted and that they must prove themselves in the new position before being considered permanently employed therein....Implicit in the term probationary is that the employee is being tested or evaluated on the job.\"\n    <em>\n     Olson v.

As a result, the Court concludes that Plaintiff did not have a property interest in his employment and, therefore had no right to any type of pre or post deprivation hearing. It follows, that since Plaintiff did not have a property interest in his continued employment, Palmer Township could not have had a policy in place that was designed to allow Plaintiff's termination without due process of law. Therefore, defendants are entitled\n    to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Finally, defendants Chief Palmer, Sergeant Smith and Sergeant Vangelo are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's aiding and abetting claims under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Section 955(e) of the PHRA states that it is an unlawful discriminatory practice \"[f]or any person, employer, employment agency, labor organization or employee, to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20955\">\n     43 Pa.
