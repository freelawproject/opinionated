BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Some on the street say snitches get stitches, but in this case they become the subject of Freedom of Information Act requests. As America gears up for another tax season, Plaintiffs Thomas and Beth Montgomery are still concerned about a dispute with Defendant Internal Revenue Service stemming from the early aughts. The controversy began when the IRS adjusted certain pass-through losses Plaintiffs had claimed on their joint tax returns, deeming them the result of sham partnership deductions. The Montgomerys have since embarked on a quest to deduce who, if anyone, tipped off the Service as to the nature of the partnerships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This FOIA case is the latest chapter in that pursuit. The Montgomerys seek twelve categories of records, which the IRS asserts either do not exist or are being withheld pursuant to a valid exemption. Before asking the Court to reach those issues, however, Defendant brings this preliminary Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that the Montgomerys' claims are either barred by a settlement agreement between the parties or by the twin doctrines of collateral estoppel and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . For the reasons explained below, the Court disagrees and will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Because of the way partnership losses are treated in the Internal Revenue Code, however, each year when the LLCs filed their returns and listed losses, Montgomery (and his wife, as a joint filer) were also able to take a loss against their individual income for the year. Like most things that seem too good to be true, the partnership-loss deductions eventually caught up with the Montgomerys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Beginning in 2006, the IRS began issuing a series of \"final partnership administrative adjustments\" (FPAAs) to the\n   Montgomerys' various partnerships covering tax years 2001 to 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bemont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877691\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/339/\">\n    679 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   343 ;\n   <em>\n    Southgate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751290\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/651/596/#p598\">\n    651 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   638-39 ;\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-2926 (N.D.

Another contract term again refers to the \"above-captioned cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on the multiple references to the thirteen cases (and no other \"disputes\"), the Court finds that \"ongoing disputes\" in the Settlement Agreement is limited to the consolidated cases in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   . As Plaintiffs' FOIA suit had not yet been filed, it is not barred by the plain language of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant nonetheless attempts to lump this case in with the resolved consolidated cases. The IRS argues that, even though the FOIA litigation had not commenced at the time, it involves issues that overlap with the consolidated cases and should thus be subsumed within the \"ongoing disputes\" language. Defendant points specifically to a motion for disclosure that Plaintiffs filed in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , 13-2926, ECF No. 25. There, they asked the court to require the Government to \"disclose\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   whether it has paid or will pay an award or other consideration to a third party in connection\" with the partnership litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The Montgomerys believed (and likely still believe) that their partnership tax deductions unraveled because of a government informant. After the parties reached the Agreement, the court denied the motion in a summary order with no analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , 13-2926, ECF No. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Neither side can plausibly deny that the FOIA requests here \"primarily seek disclosure whether a confidential information tipped off the Service leading to the collapse\" of the partnerships.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 17. Defendant thus argues that \"this FOIA suit[,] which again seeks disclosure regarding whether any confidential information tipped off the Service[,] ... is precluded by the mutual release that 'fully and finally' resolved all disputes\" among the Montgomerys, the IRS, and the partnerships.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Where the IRS goes off track, however, is in conflating the underlying\n   <em>\n    information\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs seek with the\n   <em>\n    device\n   </em>\n   through which they are pursuing documents. Before explaining why these issues are separate, the Court notes that the motion for disclosure is a red herring because it was filed months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Settlement Agreement was signed. Even if the motion were relevant to the parties' Agreement, then, it would still have no bearing on this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Montgomerys' FOIA suit challenges the adequacy of the Government's search and withholding of certain records. Whether or not those records may reveal the existence of an informant has no bearing on the validity of the suit. \"The FOIA disclosure regime... is distinct from civil discovery,\"\n   <em>\n    Stonehill v.
