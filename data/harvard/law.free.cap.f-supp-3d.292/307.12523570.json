MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 31, 2017, Fusion GPS (\"Fusion\") filed a motion in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to quash a third-party subpoena issued in connection with a defamation action currently pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On January 3, 2018, Fusion sent a letter to me asking that I consider disqualifying myself, and on January 8, 2018, I invited Fusion to submit formal briefing on the matter. Now before the Court is Fusion's motion for recusal, which argues that my impartiality in deciding its motion to quash might reasonably be questioned because a shareholder of one of my former clients and President Trump have purported interests in the matter. Because a reasonable person who was informed of all the surrounding facts and circumstances would not believe that such an interest exists nor that such an interest, if it existed, would create an appearance of bias, the motion for recusal will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the underlying litigation, Aleksej Gubarev, XBT Holdings S.A., and Webzilla, Inc., (collectively, \"the Plaintiffs\") are suing Buzzfeed, Inc., and its editor in chief for defamation. As quoted in their complaint, their defamation claim arises out of Buzzfeed's publication of the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Redacted] reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership. Entities linked to one Aleksei GUBAROV [sic] were involved and he and another hacking expert, both recruited under duress by the FSB, Seva KAPSUGOVICH, were significant players in this operation. In Prague, COHEN agreed [to] contingency plans for various scenarios to protect the operations, but in particular what was to be done in the event that Hillary CLINTON won the presidency. It was important in this event that all cash payments owed were made quickly and discreetly and that\n   cyber and that cyber [sic] and other operators were stood down / able to go effectively to ground to cover their traces.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mot. Quash Ex. 6 \u00b6 26. This statement appeared in the last of a series of memoranda written by Christopher Steele after he was retained by Fusion to investigate Donald Trump's ties to Russia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fusion is not a party to the underlying litigation, but it is the recipient of a third-party subpoena from the Plaintiffs with which it does not wish to comply. In light of Fusion's concerns about disclosing the information requested by the subpoena, the Plaintiffs in the underlying case have agreed that any information Fusion produces will be designated \"Attorneys' Eyes Only,\" meaning that \"it will not be shared with anyone other than the lawyers working on the underlying case in Florida\" and that it will not be shared with any of the parties or with lawyers working on related matters. Opp. to Mot. Quash Ex. 5. Notwithstanding that agreement, Fusion has moved to quash the subpoena. Fusion now asks that I disqualify myself from consideration of its motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Section 455(b) lays out specific situations in which a judge must recuse himself from a matter, such as when he previously served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, when he or a close family member has a financial interest in the matter in controversy, or when he or a sufficiently close relation is a party to the proceeding. Section 455(a) is a general catchall provision, requiring that a federal judge disqualify himself \"in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" Section 455(a) calls for an objective inquiry into whether there is an appearance of impartiality, \"from the perspective of a reasonable observer who is informed of all the surrounding facts and circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Cheney v.

Instead, it argues that there are two\n   grounds on which my impartiality might reasonably be questioned under \u00a7 455(a). First, \"Mikhail Fridman-the Court's recent former client-has a significant interest in the outcome of Fusion's motion to quash.\" Reply ISO Mot. Recuse at 1.

Both Mikhail Fridman's Connection to the Court and His Alleged Interest in This Matter Are Too Attenuated to Raise Reasonable Doubt Regarding My Impartiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As an initial matter, Fusion is simply incorrect in characterizing Mikhail Fridman as my former client. The fact of the matter is that I do not know, have not met, and have never worked for Mr. Fridman. Nor has Fusion even alleged facts to support its description of Mr. Fridman as my former client. Rather, Fusion notes that I was previously part of the legal team providing compliance advice to VimpelCom Ltd.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") matter when I was a partner at Baker &amp; McKenzie.

Although Mr. Fridman may consider my resolution of this discovery dispute interesting, he is not an interested third party in the same sense as the third parties in the cases on which Fusion relies. Those third parties had an immediate financial interest in the outcome of the cases.

Mot. Recuse at 10-11; Reply ISO Mot. Recuse at 4. According to Fusion, denying the motion to quash would further President Trump's \"political interests.\" Mot. Recuse at 11. However, a reasonable observer would not question my ability to remain impartial based on the possibility that discovery in this case might help the Plaintiffs show that they were defamed and that this, in turn, might further the President's political interests by indirectly justifying his criticisms of a detractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even a personal friendship with a politician is generally not grounds for disqualification unless \"the personal fortune or the personal freedom of the friend\" is at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5908772,5881546,5877749,5884758,5889692\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/913/\">\n    541 U.S. at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20S.%20Ct.%201391\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that a Justice's impartiality in a case where the Vice President was named as the defendant in his official capacity could not reasonably be questioned based on the fact that he was friends with the Vice President and that he was part of a group that went on a multi-day duck-hunting trip with the Vice President while the case was pending, when the Vice President did not host the trip or have private conversations with the Justice). Whatever the President's political interests may be, Fusion has not shown that his personal fortune and personal freedom are jeopardized by the discovery dispute in the underlying case. Every President has a wide range of political interests, and President Trump has commented on a plethora of people, companies, and cases. It cannot be that the President has a cognizable interest in every matter that has the potential to indirectly vindicate his public comments. Fusion's argument that I should look beyond the traditional grounds of disqualification to consider President Trump's alleged political interests proves too much. Such an argument would lead to the disqualification of numerous judges appointed by the sitting President on a wide range of cases.\n   <em>\n    C.f.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Exec.

Yet Fusion asks me to focus on political considerations and to avoid considering the merits of its motion to quash.
