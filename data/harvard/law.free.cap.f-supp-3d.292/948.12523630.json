As set forth above, major carriers such as Verizon and Sprint have deployed CDMA networks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. OEMs that wish to manufacture handsets to operate on CDMA networks such as Verizon and Sprint must use modem chips that comply with CDMA standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Qualcomm is the dominant supplier of CDMA modem chips. From 2001 through 2015, Qualcomm's worldwide share of CDMA modem chips exceeded 80%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. At the time of the CCAC, it was also estimated that \"Qualcomm's worldwide share of the CDMA [modem] chip market for 2016 [was] likely to exceed or at least meet its historically greater than 80% share of the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Qualcomm faces \"limited competition for the supply of CDMA\" modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. In the past ten years, \"the only supplier of CDMA [modem chips] other than Qualcomm was Via Technologies,\" a Taiwanese company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Via Technologies has focused its sales on the lower-tier handset market, rather than the premium market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This is partly because Via Technologies has not offered multi-mode modem chips \"that combine CDMA functionality with UMTS or LTE functionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2015, Intel Corporation (\"Intel\") acquired Via Technology's CDMA modem chip business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Intel \"has not yet commercialized a [modem] chip that integrates Via [Technology]'s CDMA technology\" with \"Intel's [own] multi-mode [modem chip] technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Another Taiwanese company, MediaTek Inc. (\"MediaTek\"), licensed technology from Via Technologies in late 2013 and began to offer CDMA modem chips in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, MediaTek has not offered multi-mode CDMA modem chips that are \"suitable for use in flagship handsets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Overall, MediaTek's sale of CDMA modem processors has been small.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Premium-LTE Modem Chips\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As discussed above, most cellular network operators have deployed LTE networks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.

From 2012 through 2014, Qualcomm's annual worldwide share of premium LTE modem chip sales exceeded 80%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Qualcomm's worldwide share dipped to 69% in 2015, its worldwide share for 2016 \"remained at the dominant levels it [had] since 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Qualcomm faces limited competition in the premium LTE modem chip market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.

Qualcomm's Cellular Communications SEPs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to supplying modem chips to OEMs, Qualcomm also has several patents that have been declared essential to cellular communications standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Qualcomm has participated in the cellular standard setting process through SSOs such as ETSI, TIA, and Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (\"ATIS\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. \"Qualcomm was a leading developer and proponent of 2G-CDMA standards. Qualcomm has a correspondingly high share of all patents declared essential to 2G-CDMA standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Qualcomm also participated in 3G standard setting, though to a less significant degree.\"\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Qualcomm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202774406\">\n    2017 WL 2774406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Qualcomm \"had a smaller share of SEPs related to the UMTS and 3G-CDMA standard than its share of the 2G-CDMA SEPs.\" CCAC \u00b6 36. Qualcomm's share of SEPs in LTE standards \"is much lower\" than Qualcomm's share of CDMA SEPs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Qualcomm's share of LTE SEPs \"is roughly equivalent to that of other industry competitors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"One study of declared LTE SEPs found that Qualcomm had a 13% share of 'highly novel' essential LTE patents, compared to 19% for Nokia and 12% for both Ericcson and Samsung.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Qualcomm has committed \"to ETSI, TIA, [ATIS], and other SSOs that it w[ill] license its cellular SEPs\" on FRAND terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. \"Qualcomm is thus required to license its cellular SEPs on FRAND terms to [handset] OEMs, as well as competing [modem] chip suppliers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. In practice, however, Qualcomm licenses its SEPs to OEMs, but Qualcomm \"refuses\" to license its SEPs to competing modem chip manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In licensing its SEPs to OEMs, Qualcomm collects a royalty rate of approximately 5% of the value of the net selling price of the handset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. For example, if an OEM sells a handset that is priced at $600, Qualcomm will collect a $30 royalty for each sale. Among SEP holders, Qualcomm garners an outsized share of licensing revenues paid by OEMs, and OEMs pay Qualcomm far more in royalties than OEMs pay other SEP licensors, even those with comparable portfolios of cellular SEPs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, an analysis conducted by Qualcomm in 2015 showed that revenues from Qualcomm's licensing program were \" 'equivalent in size to the sum of ~12 companies with a form of technology licensing,' including leading cellular SEP licensors such as Ericsson, Nokia, and Interdigital.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Qualcomm's Alleged Anticompetitive Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm uses its dominance in the supply of CDMA and premium-LTE modem chips to skew SEP licensing negotiations toward outcomes that benefit Qualcomm and harm Qualcomm's modem chip competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm does this through a course of conduct that includes three primary practices: (i) a \"no license-no chips\" policy; (ii) Qualcomm's refusal to license its SEPs to competing modem chip manufacturers; and (iii) Qualcomm's exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    i. \"No License-No Chips\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As discussed above, Qualcomm's FRAND commitments \"require[ ] [Qualcomm] to license its cellular SEPs on FRAND terms to [handset] OEMs, as well as competing chip suppliers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Nonetheless, Qualcomm refuses to license its SEPs to competing modem chip manufacturers. Thus, competing modem chip manufacturers cannot sell to OEMs modem chips \"that convey the right to Qualcomm's cellular SEPs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Instead, Qualcomm licenses its SEPs to only OEMs who make and sell handsets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8a. In licensing its SEPs to OEMs, Plaintiffs allege that \"Qualcomm conditions OEMs' access to [Qualcomm's modem] chips on [OEMs'] accepting a separate license to Qualcomm's cellular SEPs on Qualcomm's preferred terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Essentially, unless OEMs agree to take out a separate SEP licensing agreement with Qualcomm on Qualcomm's preferred terms that covers all of the handsets that the OEM sells, Qualcomm will not supply the OEM with any Qualcomm modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\n   call this practice Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm's conduct is unique among modem chip suppliers and suppliers of other cellular-equipment components.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. \"Other component suppliers rely on component sales to convey their intellectual property rights to OEM customers, rather than selling the components and also entering into a separate intellectual property license.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When a supplier sells a component, such as a modem chip, to an OEM, that sale, under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, ordinarily terminates any right of the supplier under patent law to control any further use or sale of the component.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Thus, a supplier's sale of a component to an OEM would already exhaust their patent rights, obviating the need-and making it unlawful-to require a separate patent license.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy stifles the normal process of negotiating the royalty rates of Qualcomm's FRAND-encumbered SEPs. OEMs have a number of grounds to \"attack Qualcomm's royalty demands in court as being non-FRAND.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. For example, OEMs could argue that Qualcomm's royalties: (1) \"do not reflect the value contributed by its patented inventions,\" (2) are much higher than those \"charged by other SEP licensors with similar technical contributions,\" (3) constitute \"a percentage of the [entire handset's] price,\" and (4) \"do[ ] not account for the value of any cross-licensed patents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiffs allege that OEMs do not challenge Qualcomm's royalty terms because of Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. Losing access to Qualcomm's modem chips would be a substantial loss to OEMs given Qualcomm's \"dominance in CDMA and premium LTE [modem] chips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, \"[t]o maintain access to Qualcomm's [modem] chips, OEMs have been coerced into accepting royalty and other license terms that they would not otherwise accept.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. Specifically, OEMs pay Qualcomm royalties that \"do not reflect OEMs' assessments of patent royalties that a court or neutral arbiter would deem reasonable, including in light of Qualcomm's FRAND commitments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Instead, the royalties reflect Qualcomm's dominant position in the [modem] chip markets, and include the added increment that OEMs pay to Qualcomm to avoid disruption of [modem chip] supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs call this \"added increment\"-the incremental above-FRAND royalty that OEMs pay Qualcomm-a \"surcharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. This \"surcharge\" raises an OEM's cost of purchasing any\n   <em>\n    modem chip\n   </em>\n   because OEMs consider the \"all-in\" cost of a modem chip as consisting of two components: (i) the nominal price of the modem chip itself, and (ii) \"any patent royalties the OEM must pay to use that [modem] chip in a [handset].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. Qualcomm's \"surcharge\" raises the latter component-the patent royalties to use the modem chip in the handset-for every modem chip that an OEM buys, including the modem chips made by Qualcomm's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. \"By raising OEMs' all-in cost of using competitors' chips, Qualcomm's conduct has diminished OEMs' demand for such processors, reduced competitors' sales and margins, and diminished competitors' ability and incentive to invest and innovate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140. Moreover, \"Qualcomm has also limited competitors' ability to discipline the all-in prices that Qualcomm charges for [modem chips].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. \"Th[e] inflated all-in modem cost is ultimately passed onto consumers of [handsets] like Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs allege that \"Qualcomm can discriminate in its royalties\" by\n   \"offer[ing] OEMs incentive payments to discount Qualcomm's above-FRAND royalties if an OEM uses Qualcomm's chips as opposed to those of a competitor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Qualcomm can do so based on its accumulation of funds from charging the surcharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. In other words, \"the surcharge is a means to extract a higher price for Qualcomm's own chips without being undercut by competing chip manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this way, the revenue that Qualcomm earns from its surcharge \"comes back to Qualcomm as a form of profit and maintains Qualcomm's chip monopoly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Qualcomm's Refusal to License its SEPs to Chip Competitors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As discussed briefly above, Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm refuses to license its FRAND-encumbered SEPs to competing modem chip manufacturers. Rather, Qualcomm licenses its SEPs only to OEMs who manufacture handsets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8a. This, according to Plaintiffs, is in violation of Qualcomm's FRAND commitments, which \"require[ ] [Qualcomm] to license its cellular SEPs on FRAND terms to [handset] OEMs, as well as competing chip suppliers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Although several of Qualcomm's competitors, including Intel and Samsung, have requested SEP licenses from Qualcomm, \"Qualcomm has simply refused to offer\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   licenses to potential competitor [modem] chip manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, if Qualcomm licensed its modem chip competitors-as opposed to only OEMs-Qualcomm would not be able to use the threat of a disruption in supply of its modem chips to induce OEMs to agree to Qualcomm's preferred royalty terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. This is because, unlike OEMs who depend on Qualcomm for modem chip supply, competing modem chip manufacturers do not need modem chips from Qualcomm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, because Qualcomm does not license its competitors, competitors cannot offer competitive pricing and are therefore unable to \"discipline the all-in prices that Qualcomm charges for\" modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Again, \"[t]he revenue from Qualcomm's surcharge comes back to Qualcomm as a form of profit and maintains Qualcomm's chip monopoly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Qualcomm's Exclusive Deals with Apple\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition to Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy and Qualcomm's refusal to license its SEPs to its competitors, Plaintiffs further allege that Qualcomm has entered exclusive deals with Apple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"Apple is a particularly important OEM from the perspective of a nascent [modem chip] supplier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. Specifically, \"Apple sells large volumes of premium handsets that require premium LTE\" modem chips which \"command higher prices\" than lower-tier modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107a. Moreover, Apple provides additional benefits to chip suppliers because modem chip suppliers for Apple learn from Apple's engineer teams, achieve \"technical validation\" by meeting Apple's complicated technical requirements, and \"can field-test [their modem chips] through global launches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107b-d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Apple has entered into\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusive agreements with Qualcomm to use only Qualcomm's modem chips in Apple's flagship products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. Specifically, Apple \"repeatedly engaged in negotiations with Qualcomm concerning the excessive royalties Qualcomm charged such contract manufacturers to license its SEPs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Apple entered into agreements with Qualcomm in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In 2007, \"Qualcomm agreed to give Apple a rebate of all royalties Qualcomm received\" from Apple that were \"over a specified per-[handset] cap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. In return, Apple had to agree not to incorporate\n   a prospective fourth-generation standard that was opposed by Qualcomm but championed by Intel, its competitor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In 2009, Qualcomm and Apple entered into an agreement \"address[ing] the process by which Qualcomm supplied chips and associated software to Apple.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100. Under the agreement, \"Apple's ability to sue Qualcomm for patent infringement concerning Qualcomm [modem] chips\" was restricted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Qualcomm \"capp[ed] its liability for the failure to supply\" and \"reserv[ed] for itself the ability to terminate its obligation to supply [modem] chips to Apple's contract manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In 2011, Qualcomm entered into an agreement with Apple through which \"Qualcomm agreed to make substantial incentive payments to Apple if Apple agreed to exclusively use Qualcomm chips in all new iPhone and iPad models.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101. If Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm modem chip, \"Apple would forfeit all of these incentive payments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agreement also provided that \"Apple could not initiate any action or litigation against Qualcomm for intellectual property infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In 2013, Qualcomm entered into an agreement with Apple that modified and extended the term of the exclusivity arrangement set forth in the companies' 2011 agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102. Under the 2013 agreement, Qualcomm agreed to rebate to Apple royalties that Qualcomm collected in excess of a modified per-handset cap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103. Qualcomm's agreement to do this was subject to a new condition: \"Apple could neither initiate nor induce others to initiate litigation based on Qualcomm's failure to offer licenses on FRAND terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102. Further, \"Qualcomm also agreed to make separate substantial incentive payments to Apple so long as Apple exclusively sourced chips from Qualcomm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If, during the period of the agreement, Apple launched a new handset with a non-Qualcomm modem chip, Apple would forfeit past and future incentive payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, \"Qualcomm's 2011 and 2013 agreements with Apple were, and were intended by Qualcomm to be,\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   exclusive deals that were as effective as express purchase requirements that essentially foreclosed Qualcomm's competitors from gaining [modem chip] business at Apple.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. Although Apple had \"an interest in developing and working with additional suppliers of [modem chips],\" the \"large penalties that Apple would face\" from Qualcomm if it chose to source chips from another supplier \"prevented Apple from using alternative suppliers\" during the effective exclusivity period under the agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105a-b;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108 (alleging penalties are sufficiently large that they effectively prevent other modem chip manufacturers from competing with Qualcomm to gain business from Apple).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As a result of Qualcomm's exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple, Apple sourced modem chips exclusively from Qualcomm for all iPad and iPhone products that Apple launched from October 2011 until September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106. Qualcomm's exclusive agreements with Apple \"excluded competition from other chip suppliers and harmed competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. These exclusive agreements \"also prevented Qualcomm's competitors from attaining the[ ] benefits\" of working with Apple \"and foreclosed a substantial share of the market for premium LTE chips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Plaintiffs' Alleged Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Qualcomm's conduct caused them injury. According to Plaintiffs, \"Qualcomm used its\" practices to \"coerce acceptance of [above]-FRAND licensing rates and terms for its SEPs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. As noted above, this raises the \"all-in\" price of every modem chip because OEMs must pay a surcharge to Qualcomm \"to ensure continued access to Qualcomm's modem chips supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"The artificially inflated all-in cost for modem chips in turn resulted in increases for the price of [handsets] that use those [modem] chips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that the surcharge was \"passed down the distribution chain from the modem chips purchasers to Plaintiffs\" who purchase \"the [handsets] containing such [modem] chips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. In other words, Qualcomm's surcharge was \"passed on\" to Plaintiffs through OEMs, distributors, and retailers and \"can be directly traced through a straightforward distribution chain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   OEMs, distributors, and retailers cannot \"readily absorb the [surcharge] Qualcomm charges for its modem chips\" because they are \"generally subject to vigorous price competition\" and \"generally operate on thin margins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. \"The inflated all-in cost of a modem chip raises the prices consumers pay for [handsets] incorporating modem chips.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Qualcomm's royalty rates are generally based on \"a percentage of the wholesale price of\" the entire handset, rather than the modem chip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. Plaintiffs allege that, in this way, Qualcomm \"directly distorted and increased the price of the [handsets] paid by Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. By \"us[ing] a royalty base that is the price of the [handset] as a whole,\" Qualcomm targeted the effect of its conduct \"at the [handsets] as a whole rather than merely their components.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. Therefore, according to Plaintiffs, \"[t]he [handset] product market is inextricably intertwined with the CDMA and premium-LTE [modem] chip markets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The CCAC asserts two federal statutory claims and two California statutory claims. Specifically, the CCAC asserts (1) a claim under the California Cartwright Act, (2) a claim under \u00a7 1 of the federal Sherman Act, (3) a claim under \u00a7 2 of the federal Sherman Act, and (4) a claim under the California Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Qualcomm moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' CCAC in its entirety. First, Qualcomm\n   argues that none of Plaintiffs' claims may proceed because Plaintiffs have not established that Qualcomm's conduct caused them any antitrust injury. Next, Qualcomm contends that Plaintiffs have not established that they have Article III standing to assert their claims related to Qualcomm's agreements with Apple. Finally, Qualcomm raises particular objections to each of Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court first considers Qualcomm's arguments regarding antitrust injury, then considers Qualcomm's contentions regarding Article III standing as to Qualcomm's agreements with Apple, and last considers Qualcomm's challenges to each of Plaintiffs' causes of action in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In other words, the question whether a plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury looks to the closeness of the connection between the alleged anticompetitive behavior and the claimed injury to ensure that the injury is of the type the antitrust laws were designed to prevent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Shield of Va. v.

As Plaintiffs explain in their CCAC, the combined effect of three specific circumstances demonstrate that the market for handset products-in which Plaintiffs participate-is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the market for CDMA and premium-LTE modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. First, Qualcomm is able to use its dominance in the modem chip market to \"extract anticompetitive licensing terms for its SEPs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, Qualcomm's royalty rate is calculated \"as a percentage of the wholesale price of the [entire handset] rather than the [modem] chip.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, Qualcomm's royalties \"directly inflate[ ] the modem chip prices\" and thereby \"inflate[ ]...the price of the [handset] purchased by consumers like Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   First, Plaintiffs detail Qualcomm's practices that permit Qualcomm to use its monopoly power to distort SEP licensing negotiations and induce OEMs to pay above-FRAND royalties. Like FTC, Plaintiffs identify three primary practices that coerce OEMs to accept above-FRAND licensing rates and terms: (i) Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy; (ii) Qualcomm's refusal to license its SEPs to competing modem chip manufacturers; and (iii) Qualcomm's exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 145. The Court offers a brief overview of the practices and their effect on the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under Qualcomm's \"no license-no chips\" policy, Qualcomm will not sell modem chips to OEMs unless OEMs agree to take out a separate SEP licensing agreement with Qualcomm on Qualcomm's preferred terms that covers all of the handsets that the OEM sells.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. An important component of Qualcomm's conduct, Plaintiffs contend, is that Qualcomm refuses to license its competitors in the modem chips market,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8a, even though Qualcomm's FRAND commitments require Qualcomm to license its competitors,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Thus, competing modem chip manufacturers cannot\n   sell to OEMs modem chips \"that convey the right to Qualcomm's cellular SEPs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. This difference in licensing is important because, unlike OEMs who depend on Qualcomm for modem chip supply, competing modem chip manufacturers do not need modem chips from Qualcomm. OEMs must necessarily buy some modem chips from Qualcomm because Qualcomm owns approximately 80% of the market for CDMA modem chips and approximately 80% of the market for premium-LTE modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 60. Thus, \"[t]o maintain access to Qualcomm's [modem] chips, OEMs have been coerced into accepting royalty and other license terms that they would not otherwise accept.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. Specifically, OEMs pay royalties that \"reflect Qualcomm's dominant position in the [modem] chip markets\" and include a surcharge \"to avoid disruption of [modem chip] supply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Qualcomm's refusal to license to competitors and exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple also allow Qualcomm to continue to leverage a surcharge from OEMs. As to the refusal to license, Plaintiffs allege that because Qualcomm does not license its competitors, competitors cannot offer competitive pricing and are therefore unable to \"discipline the all-in prices that Qualcomm charges for\" modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Thus, \"[t]he revenue from Qualcomm's surcharge comes back to Qualcomm as a form of profit and maintains Qualcomm's chip monopoly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. With regard to Qualcomm's dealings with Apple, Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm \"used its market power as leverage to make Apple accept unreasonable and anticompetitive licensing terms\" and rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. The penalties for breaking the agreements with Qualcomm were so large that Apple could not work with non-Qualcomm modem chip manufacturers during the effective exclusivity period, but instead sourced modem chips exclusively from Qualcomm for all iPad and iPhone products that Apple launched from October 2011 until September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-06, 108. Plaintiffs therefore allege that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the modem chip markets to extract a surcharge to license its SEPs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm's royalty rate is directly tied to the handset market in which Plaintiffs participate. Specifically, Qualcomm calculates its royalty \"as a percentage of the wholesale price of the [entire handset] rather than the [modem] chip.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. By basing the royalty rate on the wholesale price of the handset, \"[t]he effect of Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct...is targeted at the [handsets] as a whole rather than merely [the handset's] components.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. Qualcomm's recognition that the price of handsets sold to consumers should drive its licensing royalty rates bolsters the plausibility of the closeness of the connection between Qualcomm's alleged misconduct and the Plaintiffs' injuries. Moreover, that practice suggests that \"Qualcomm's anticompetitive acts...directly distorted and increased the price of the [handsets] paid by Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he surcharge resulting from Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct results in an increased cost for the [handset] as a whole, which is directly passed on to the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Third, and finally, Plaintiffs explain that Qualcomm's practices increase the price that OEMs pay for modem chips and that those costs are passed down to consumers like Plaintiffs. The above-FRAND royalty that Qualcomm collects on every handset affects the market for modem chips because OEMs consider the \"all-in\" cost of a modem chip as consisting of two components: (i) the nominal price of the modem chip itself and (ii) patent royalties to Qualcomm\n   to use the modem chip in a handset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. As Plaintiffs allege, Qualcomm's practices increase the second component of the \"all-in\" price for every modem chip that an OEM buys, including the modem chips made by Qualcomm's competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Thus, for every modem chip that an OEM buys, the OEM must pay a surcharge on that modem chip that does not reflect the value of Qualcomm's FRAND-encumbered SEPs, but rather reflects Qualcomm's modem chips monopoly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. OEMs are forced to pay the surcharge to \"ensure continued access to Qualcomm's modem chips supply,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 127, 145; maintaining such access is important because Qualcomm's share of the CDMA and premium-LTE modem chips market is significant,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Qualcomm's surcharge affects the ultimate price paid by consumers like Plaintiffs because the cost of modem chips substantially influences the retail price that OEMs, retailers, and distributors charge for a handset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150. Modem chips have no \"independent free-standing use,\" but must be incorporated into a handset to \"serve any purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. As such, modem chips and handsets containing those modem chips are \"stages of a single market supply chain\" whereby \"[i]ncreases in the price of modem chips lead directly to price increases at the OEM and retail levels for [handsets].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consumers like Plaintiffs therefore drive demand in the modem chips market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the \"all-in\" cost of modem chips \"make[s] up a substantial portion of the cost of manufacturing\" handsets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150. Therefore, \"[t]he retail price of a [handset] is determined in substantial part by\" the all-in costs of modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   According to the CCAC, Plaintiffs at the end of the supply chain are injured when they purchase handsets containing modem chips because the handsets have been priced to account for the surcharge on the modem chips.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139 (\"Qualcomm's anticompetitive practices have...increased consumer prices.\"). The passing on of costs either occurs \"directly\" when Plaintiffs purchase from OEMS or occurs \"through distributors and retailers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146, 151. Plaintiffs who purchased from OEMs, such as Apple, are \"impacted...directly\" by Qualcomm's agreements because Plaintiffs purchased from OEMs \"subject to\" those agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs assert that all categories of Plaintiffs have been injured by supra-competitive pricing because Qualcomm's \"surcharge\" has been \"passed down the distribution chain from the modem chip purchasers to Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the nature of the industry explains why these costs must be passed on to consumers. In particular, Plaintiffs describe that OEMs, distributors, and retailers are \"generally subject to vigorous price competition\" and \"generally operate on thin margins.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. This means that OEMs, distributors, and retailers cannot \"readily absorb the anticompetitive rates Qualcomm charges for its modem chips\" and, therefore, the \"corresponding price increases at all levels of the distribution chain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the surcharge passed on to Plaintiffs \"can be directly traced through a straightforward distribution chain\" back to Qualcomm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 146. Qualcomm cites no authority to support its argument that at this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiffs cannot provide allegations about the usual operation of the industry but must instead identify by name specific intermediaries that pass on royalties.

Specifically, the plaintiff asserted Clayton and Cartwright Act claims alleging that Qualcomm violated its FRAND obligations, charged supra-competitive royalties by requiring both OEMs and handset manufacturers to obtain licenses, and offered discounts to OEMs that purchased modem chips exclusively from Qualcomm.\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476158\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/1291/\">\n    603 F.Supp.2d at 1295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, Qualcomm's license covered \"only a component of the technology\" in the modem chip, which is ultimately built into the handset that the consumer plaintiff purchases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476158\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without more details to connect the injury to the plaintiff, the court found the allegations lacking because the plaintiff's injury is \"passed on through the supply chain such that [the] [p]laintiff's injury also must be disaggregated from a multitude of other manufacturing and component factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476158\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained that \"[t]he Complaint does not allege facts to support a finding that [the] [p]laintiff and Qualcomm had a direct relationship, that Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct proximately caused [the] [p]laintiff's injury, that [the] [p]laintiff is a direct victim of Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct, or that [the] [p]laintiff is the 'necessary means' by which Qualcomm carried out its anticompetitive licensing scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476158\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court concluded that the plaintiff \"fail[ed] to allege sufficient facts to support a finding that [the] [p]laintiff's alleged injury [was] inextricably intertwined with Qualcomm's unlawful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3476158\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/603/1291/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations in the instant case are more detailed in ways that cure the deficiencies identified in\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   . While Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm's surcharge is passed down through a distribution chain, Plaintiffs also provide allegations about why the surcharge cannot be absorbed at any level but must be passed on to consumers. In particular, Plaintiffs describe that all levels of the supply chain-OEMs, distributors, and retailers-face price competition and operate on thin margins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. In that environment, OEMs, distributors, and retailers have no means to \"readily absorb the anticompetitive rates Qualcomm charges for its modem chips\"; instead, actors \"at all levels of the distribution chain\" must increase their prices to account for Qualcomm's surcharge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that they fall at different points along the supply chain: some are three levels removed, but others are only one level away, purchasing directly from OEMs, like Apple.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146, 151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs also explain how Qualcomm's surcharge is passed down to them even though Qualcomm's licenses cover only a portion of the technology in the modem chips. As Plaintiffs recite, OEMs consider the \"all-in\" cost of a modem chip, which includes the nominal price of the modem chip itself plus any royalties to use the modem chip in a handset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. Qualcomm's surcharge raises OEMs' patent royalties for every modem chip that an OEM buys, whether the modem chip is\n   made by Qualcomm or one of Qualcomm's modem chip competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Further, Plaintiffs allege that the final retail price of a handset is \"determined in substantial part\" by the all-in cost of the modem chips because that cost forms a \"substantial portion\" of the cost to manufacture headsets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150. Indeed, the sole purpose of modem chips is to operate in handsets, so modem chips and handsets lie along one \"market supply chain\" so that increasing modem chip price \"lead[s] directly to price increases at the OEM and retail levels for [handsets].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs include an additional, significant facet of Qualcomm's conduct beyond the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   that bolsters the plausibility of \"inextricably intertwined\" injuries. Notably, Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm's royalty base is the wholesale price of the entire handset, not the modem chip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Tying the royalty rate to the wholesale price of the handset suggests that Qualcomm's conduct \"target[s]\" the handsets as a whole \"rather than merely [the handset's] components.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. As described more fully above, the likely effect is that Qualcomm's surcharge \"directly distorted and increased the price of the [handsets] paid by Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147, 152. Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs plausibly allege that their injuries in purchasing handsets are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the injuries Qualcomm sought to inflict in the modem chip market. Having found\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   distinguishable, the Court turns to Qualcomm's contention that\n   <em>\n    Feitelson\n   </em>\n   is indistinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feitelson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Feitelson\n   </em>\n   is also distinguishable because the plaintiffs' complaint in that case suffered from many of the same infirmities as the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   . There, the plaintiffs alleged that Google entered into agreements with OEMs that limited the default mobile search engine options on Android to Google's own products.\n   <em>\n    Feitelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266510\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/1019/\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at 1023-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the plaintiffs' theory, that setup cut off available subsidies from search engine competitors and drove up the price of Android phones for consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266510\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/1019/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court found that the plaintiffs' allegations of \"antitrust injury in the form of supracompetitive pricing in Android phones\" were insufficiently connected to Google's challenged conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266510\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/1019/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266510\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/1019/\">\n    at 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Plaintiffs also suffered injury in another market, Plaintiffs do not merely declare injury. Plaintiffs connect the injuries suffered to Qualcomm's conduct. Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Feitelson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs do not \"elide allegations concerning the number of supply chain levels between OEMs...and end consumers,\" like Plaintiffs. Instead, Plaintiffs provide their position in the supply chain and describe why Qualcomm's surcharge is passed down through the chain of distribution to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266510\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/1019/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77, 146, 150-51. Moreover, as noted above, Plaintiffs allege that Qualcomm's royalty rate is based on the wholesale price of the entire handset, rather than the modem chip, further reinforcing Plaintiffs' allegation that the effect of Qualcomm's conduct is \"targeted at\" the handset market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148. In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Feitelson\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs' allegations provide a sufficient basis to conclude that Plaintiffs' injuries were \"sufficiently close to [Qualcomm's] alleged anticompetitive conduct\" and were \"inextricably intertwined\" with the injuries sought to be inflicted by Qualcomm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Accordingly, the Court DENIES Qualcomm's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' CCAC for failure to plead antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Under the 2011 agreement, Apple could not sue Qualcomm for intellectual property infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.

Subsequent Ninth Circuit authority has confirmed that whether\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   fashioned a new exception is at best \"unclear\" because \"standing existed in\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   based on the control or co-conspirator exceptions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050772\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/741/\">\n    686 F.3d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749 &amp; n.3 (9th Cir. 2012). In particular, the broad interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   conflicts with the United States Supreme Court's downplaying of the concern that \"direct purchasers sometimes may refrain from bringing a treble-damages suit for fear of disrupting relations with their suppliers.\"\n   <em>\n    Ill.

Reflecting the \"limited\" nature of the exceptions, courts have applied the exceptions narrowly, allowing damages suits to proceed, for example, when customers or sellers \"own or control the direct purchaser\" or when the indirect purchaser \"establishes a price-fixing conspiracy between the manufacturer and the middleman.\"\n   <em>\n    In re ATM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050772\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/741/\">\n    686 F.3d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Thus, they cannot bring a damages claim under \u00a7 1 or \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act as a matter of law.
