On August 22, 2017, this Court found that EEOC had not provided a reasoned explanation for its decision to promulgate regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) (\"the Rules\") that set particular incentive levels for providing certain medical data to healthcare providers. Mem. Op. [ECF No. 47] at 33. The Rules allowed employer-sponsored wellness plans to offer employees discounts of up to 30% of the cost of self-only health coverage for divulging certain private medical information, or to impose penalties of up to 30% for not doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201630.14\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1630.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3), 1635.8(b)(2)(ii)-(iii).

However, in light of the potential for disruption were the Court to vacate the challenged Rules in the middle of a plan year, the Court decided to remand without vacatur \"for the present.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201630.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201630.14\">\n    at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now, \"[t]o avoid manifest injustice,\" AARP asks that the Court reconsider that decision and either (1) vacate the Rules but stay the mandate until January 1, 2018, or (2) issue an injunction against enforcement of the Rules effective January 1, 2018.

In its reply brief, AARP raises another alternative: vacating the Rules but applying the order of vacatur only to plans that begin at least six months after\n   the order is issued. AARP's Reply Supp. Rule 59(e) Mot. to Alter or Amend Order and Response to Def.'s Status Rep. (\"Reply\") [ECF No. 52] at 7-8.

This Court decided the issue without thorough argument from the parties. Neither side discussed the question of remedy in its summary judgment briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 34. At oral argument, the Court asked each side what the Court should do if it determined that EEOC had not provided a sufficient explanation for the Rules; but neither party discussed its position in much detail, and neither addressed the legal framework used to determine whether vacatur is proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Mot.

Opp'n at 7. But there are good reasons to reexamine the Court's prior holding here. First, the Administrative Procedure Act itself contemplates vacatur as the usual remedy when an agency fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) (\"The reviewing court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   ... hold unlawful\n   <em>\n    and set aside\n   </em>\n   agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law ....\" (emphases added)). And while the courts do not always vacate in such circumstances, vacatur is \"normally require[d].\" Mem. Op. at 33-34 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Advocates for Highway &amp; Auto Safety v. Fed.

Indeed, agency vacatur determinations are unusually well-suited to post-judgment briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp. v.

The Court was particularly concerned about the \"potentially widespread disruption and confusion\" that could be caused by vacating the Rules in the middle of the 2017 plan year, when employers and employees alike had been relying on the Rules for eight months. Mem. Op. at 35. But it provided the parties with numerous signals that the decision not to vacate was subject to change: the opinion stated that disruption concerns \"currently\" outweighed the agency's deficiencies in reasoning, that vacatur would be \"inappropriate at this time,\" that the Court assumed the agency could come up with new rules \"in a timely manner,\" and that the Court would remand without vacatur \"for the present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36. In light of the parties' briefing, therefore, the Court will take a second look at remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The decision whether to vacate depends on [1] 'the seriousness of the order's deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and [2] the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal, Inc. v.

Cir. 1993). In its prior opinion, the Court determined that vacating the Rules would punish the employers and employees\n   who relied on them, and that the disruption vacatur would thereby cause outweighed the agency's serious failure of reasoning. Mem. Op. 34-35. AARP argues that the calculus is different for 2018-that stakeholders will easily be able to adjust to a vacatur that takes effect next year. AARP Mot. at 9-10; Reply at 4-6. It therefore requests vacatur effective January 1, 2018. AARP Mot. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This request would have been problematic even had AARP attempted to expedite the initial summary judgment briefing or asked the Court to conduct the Rule 59 proceedings on an expedited basis. There is significant evidence in the record that employers need to know the regulatory incentive structure for the following year by June or July, at the latest, in order to have enough time to design their wellness plans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 2-5; AR 2576 (Commonwealth of Ky.), 2863 (ERISA Indust. Comm.), 3379 (Alston &amp; Bird LLP), 3415-16 (Nat'l Bus. Grp. on Health), 3485 (Chamber of Commerce of U.S.), 3559 (Coll. &amp; Univ. Prof'l Ass'n for Human Res.), 3649 (Epstein, Becker &amp; Green), 7202 (Soc'y for Human Res. Mgmt.). Any order vacating the Rules therefore would have had to come several months prior to the Court's August 22 decision in order to avoid nationwide disruption. AARP's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AARP Mot. at 4-6, the Court cannot simply assume that employers will be able to adjust their wellness plans on the fly, or that employees will be able to cope with a shift in their healthcare plans on such short notice. \"The Commission is in a better position than the court to assess the disruptive effect of vacating the Rule[s],\"\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3453971,6046445\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/890/\">\n    443 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and it is clear from the record that vacatur is not a realistic option for early 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Moving further into the future, however, the balancing test begins to shift toward vacatur. Courts in this circuit \"have not hesitated to vacate a rule when the agency has not responded to empirical data or to an argument inconsistent with its conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n    579 F.3d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, EEOC failed to take into account statutory and other concerns with its decision to set incentive levels at 30%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 33 (\"Neither the final rules nor the administrative record contain any concrete data, studies, or analysis that would support any particular incentive level as the threshold past which an incentive becomes involuntary in violation of the ADA and GINA.\"). This despite numerous comments pointing out EEOC's lack of reasoning and condemning the 30% incentive level as coercive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n    at 22, 25-26, 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   prong thus suggests that vacatur is the proper remedy here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, the concerns about disruption that caution against vacatur in the near future disappear over time. Nearly all of EEOC's arguments against AARP's motion revolve around the harm that employers and employees would face if the Court were to vacate the Rules weeks before the 2018 wellness plans come into effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 2-8. But unlike with 2018 plans, for which \"[t]he egg has been scrambled,\"\n   <em>\n    Sugar Cane Growers Co-op. of Fla. v.

Cir. 2002), there is plenty of time for employers to develop their 2019 wellness plans with knowledge that the Rules have been vacated. EEOC has suggested that businesses need six months' lead time to adjust to a change in the regulatory scheme, Opp'n at 3; the longest lead time for which any commenter asked during EEOC's notice-and-comment process was twelve months,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 3415-16 (Nat'l Bus. Grp. on Health), 3559 (Coll. &amp; Univ. Prof'l Ass'n\n   for Human Res.). Thus, vacating as of January 1, 2019 would appear to avoid any substantial disruptive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover, \"the second\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factor is weighty only insofar as the agency may be able to rehabilitate its rationale for the regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Comcast Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n    579 F.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is far from clear that EEOC will view a 30% incentive level as sufficiently voluntary upon reexamination of the evidence presented to it. That \"the agency's decision may very well be different on remand,\" Mem. Op. at 34 (citation omitted), further reduces the significance of the disruption prong of the vacatur test. And, since AARP's members could be pressured by their employers to give up private medical data as long as the current Rules remain in place, AARP can credibly show prejudice from a decision to remand without vacatur. Given this prejudice, and that the balance of the equities weighs in favor of vacatur in 2019, it would constitute manifest injustice to keep the Rules in place beyond 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is also noteworthy that, since the Court issued its August 22 decision, EEOC has provided new information regarding its rulemaking timeline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Status Report at 1 &amp; n.1. Though AARP did not provide (and could not have provided) this information in its initial Rule 59 motion, the information is properly before the Court as the Court considers AARP's motion. According to EEOC, the agency does not intend to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking until August 2018, and does not plan to issue a final rule until October 2019.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545692,4052847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/579/1/\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court will also hold EEOC to its intended deadline of August 2018 for the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Status Report at 1. But an agency process that will not generate applicable rules until 2021 is unacceptable. Therefore, EEOC is strongly encouraged to move up its deadline for issuing the notice of proposed rulemaking, and to engage in any other measures necessary to ensure that its new rules can be applied well before the current estimate of sometime in 2021. A separate order has been issued on this date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Both parties have treated the instant motion as properly brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), rather than Rule 54(b). It is not entirely clear whether Rule 59(e) is, in fact, the correct vehicle for this motion. \"Rule 54(b) operates while a case is still ongoing in district court and before any appealable final judgment has been entered ....

AARP's motion, therefore, may be better thought of as a request to revise a non-final judgment-which would invoke the Court's inherent equitable powers and Rule 54(b)-rather than as a motion to alter a final judgment under Rule 59(e).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Butler v.

However, the Court need not determine which Federal Rule governs here, because it finds that AARP can meet even the more stringent standards of Rule 59(e).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The Court's determination that the balance of the equities favors vacatur as of January 2019 differs somewhat from AARP's alternative proposal, which calls for applying the Court's decision to any plans \"that begin six months or more after\" the Court issues its opinion. Reply at 7-8. However, as noted above, there are indications in the record that some employers may need as long as twelve months to comply with a new regulatory regime. Additionally, some wellness plans do not follow the calendar year; providing a year's notice ensures that no employer will have its current plan disrupted, and will give all employers at least some lead time to adjust for the 2019 plan year. And, as discussed below, waiting to vacate until January 2019 gives EEOC more time to come up with new interim or permanent rules. Thus, a vacatur decision that takes effect early in 2019 would best balance the need to protect employees' privacy with the need to avoid disrupting healthcare plans nationwide. In the Court's view, such a decision ultimately does not conflict with AARP's request to \"issue an order of vacatur effective as soon as practicable after January in 2018.\" Reply at 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The two nominees EEOC has mentioned have yet to have a final confirmation vote scheduled, and may be subject to further hearings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PN 724, Janet Dhillon, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/724; PN 859, Daniel M.
