In their motion for discovery, Petitioners request discovery of any and all communications\n   concerning practices, policies, guidance, or instructions relating to parole at the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") Office located in Batavia, New York (\"Batavia Detention Facility\"). (Dkt. 31). Respondents oppose the discovery motion on several grounds, and argue that the requested discovery is not relevant and is overly broad. (Dkt. 46). For the following reasons, Petitioners' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"A habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in federal court, is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary course.\"\n   <em>\n    Bracy v.

Petitioners describe their requested discovery as \"a single document request within a brief date range.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). Petitioners argue that the communications sought from Respondents \"would be important supplements\" to the \"substantial factual record\" they intend to submit in support of their motion for preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners also make general assertions that such discovery would be relevant to their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, Petitioners do not indicate how the requested communications will\n   <em>\n    \"actually advance\n   </em>\n   [their] claims of error.\"\n   <em>\n    Pizzuti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176615\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/809/164/#p176\">\n    809 F.Supp.2d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). It is not enough to simply surmise that the communications exist and that they may be relevant, it is Petitioners' heavy burden to \"produce[ ]\n   <em>\n    specific evidence\n   </em>\n   that the requested material\n   <em>\n    will sup\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    port\n   </em>\n   [their] habeas corpus petition... \"\n   <em>\n    Charles v.

Accordingly, Petitioners' generalized claims regarding the possible relevancy of these communications do not establish the requisite \"good cause\" to warrant court-sanctioned discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022358799\">\n    2003 WL 22358799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (\"Though there may exist discoverable materials in the sole possession of the Parole Board, which might yield good cause to justify discovery, the generalized nature of [the petitioner's] requests renders them merely speculative, and likely unworkable from a practical perspective.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Furthermore, despite Petitioners' characterization of this discovery motion as a \"single document request,\" the fact that \"all communications\" are sought signals that this request could become voluminous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

May 3, 2012) (determining that discovery requests, including \"all communications between every Genesee County Public official involved in any aspect of his various criminal proceedings,\" were overbroad and amounted to a \"fishing expedition\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022358799\">\n    2003 WL 22358799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (denying discovery where the petitioner requested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[a]ll press releases, transcripts or memoranda of statements, or the statements themselves, made by Governor Pataki to the media at any time during his governorship; and [a]ll documents (including electronic ones) received by the Division [of Parole] from, or sent by the Division [of Parole] to, the New York State Legislature or any member of the Legislature\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Petitioners' putative class action contends, among other things, that Respondents have failed to follow a particular internal agency policy relating to the parole of aliens who remain detained subsequent to the successful completion of a credible fear interview. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17 at \u00b6 96;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81; Dkt. 17-7 at 5-14). Petitioners' motion does not indicate why it would be necessary, at this point in the proceedings, for the Court to permit broad discovery of\n   <em>\n    any and all\n   </em>\n   communications relating to any and all \"policies, practices, guidance, or instructions, both formal and informal,\" about paroling asylum-seekers at the Batavia Detention Facility. Such a request could theoretically involve communications with other agencies in the federal government that have no relationship to the claims brought by this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Therefore, the Court determines that Petitioners have not established \"good cause\" warranting discovery at this point in time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Petitioners' motion for discovery (Dkt. 31) is denied, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Indeed, Petitioners have since submitted a \"substantial factual record\" in support of their motion for preliminary injunction. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 38; Dkt. 51).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
