Plaintiff Jacqueline Tucker brought this action in state court challenging the foreclosure on multiple grounds, most of which have been rejected multiple times by the governing caselaw. Defendants are U.S. Bank, N.A., as Trustee for Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust, Inc., 2006-HE3, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-HE3 (\"U.S. Bank, as Trustee\"); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

In Count III, Plaintiff asserts that U.S. Bank, as Trustee slandered the title of her property. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 130-38.
