Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment contending that defendant Rosemarie Pelfrey (\"Mrs. Pelfrey\") is vicariously liable as a matter of law for any FHA violations committed by Mr. Pelfrey.

By March 17, 2017, however, Mr. Pelfrey was \"no longer involved in Pelfrey Rentals &amp; Investments. His son, Jesse, and wife, Rosemarie, [ ] assumed all aspects of the rental business.\" Doc. # 141-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mrs. Pelfrey, as trustee, may be vicariously liable for Mr. Pelfrey's action towards plaintiffs who rented properties owned by the Rosemarie Trust. The FHA definition of a \"person\" includes trustees.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203602\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Further, under the Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 246, a \"trustee is subject to personal liability to third persons for torts committed in the course of the administration of the trust to the same extent that he would be liable if he held the property free of the trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Three plaintiffs lived in properties that were owned by the Rosemarie Trust during a period of time when Pelfrey Rentals, acting through Mr. Pelfrey, managed the properties. Raquel Hall-Hubbard resided at 423 NE 115th Street, Oklahoma City, after the property was transferred to the Rosemarie Trust on September 15th, 2015. Doc. # 134, p. 2 [Fact # 1]; Doc. # 140-2; Doc. 135-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maeisha Pennon resided at 4000 SE 10th Street, Del City, after the property was transferred to the Rosemarie Trust on September 15th, 2015. Doc. # 134, p. 2-3 [Fact Nos. 4 &amp; 5]. And Andria Collins resided at 345 NW 86th Street, Oklahoma City, after the property was acquired by the Rosemarie Trust at a sheriff's sale on May 24, 2016. Doc. # 134, p. 3 [Fact Nos. 6 &amp; 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the Rosemarie Trust was the admitted owner of these three properties during the time periods shown, and Mrs. Pelfrey as the trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the course of administering the trust, Mrs. Pelfrey is vicariously liable as a matter of law for any of Mr. Pelfrey's actions towards those three plaintiffs that occurred during this time period of ownership. Because the Rosemarie Trust relied on Pelfrey Rentals-acting through Mr. Pelfrey-to manage the properties, if Mr. Pelfrey is found to have sexually harassed these three plaintiffs in violation of the FHA during this period of Rosemarie Trust ownership, such sexual harassment would have been aided\n   and abetted by the agency relationship that necessarily existed to manage the properties. To this extent alone, summary judgment will be entered holding Mrs. Pelfrey vicariously liable as trustee of the Rosemarie Trust under the FHA for Mr. Pelfrey's actions during the period of Rosemarie Trust ownership of those three properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Mrs. Pelfrey is vicariously liable to all plaintiffs as a de facto partner in Pelfrey Rentals or that Pelfrey Rentals was a joint venture between Mr. and Mrs. Pelfrey. Plaintiffs further argue that, because Mr. and Mrs. Pelfrey were both members of PIC and that PIC and Pelfrey Rentals were jointly utilized to control and run \"Pelfrey rental operations,\" a joint venture was established such that vicariously liability would attach to Mrs. Pelfrey for actions related to all Pelfrey rental operations. Defendants strongly contest that Pelfrey Rentals or PIC were any form of partnership or joint venture between Mr. and Mrs. Pelfrey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A genuine dispute exists as to material facts relating to ownership and control of Pelfrey Rentals, management and control of PIC, and whether Mr. and Mrs. Pelfrey operated any enterprise as a partnership or joint venture. Accordingly, both partial motions for summary judgment, beyond the limited determinations above, will be denied as to Mrs. Pelfrey's liabilities in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants also move for summary judgment as to certain claims presented by plaintiff Collins. As noted above, the court has already concluded that Mrs. Pelfrey will be vicariously liable as trustee of the Rosemarie Trust if Mr. Pelfrey is found to have violated the FHA during the time period in which the Rosemarie Trust owned 345 NW 86th Street and that otherwise, genuine issues of fact remain regarding Mrs. Pelfrey's liabilities. Plaintiffs concede, however, that summary judgment should be entered in favor on Omega and PIC on Collins' because neither owned 345 NW 86th Street. Accordingly, defendants' motion regarding Collins' claims will be granted in part only as to defendants Omega and PIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Doc. # 134] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in PART\n   </strong>\n   . The motion is granted such that Mrs. Pelfrey will be vicariously liable as a matter of law as trustee of the Rosemarie Trust for any of Mr. Pelfrey's actions directed at plaintiffs Hall-Hubbard, Pennon, and Collins that are found to violate the Fair Housing Act during the period of time these plaintiffs resided in properties owned by the Rosemarie Trust. The motion is otherwise denied. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 135] is also\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in PART\n   </strong>\n   . The motion is granted as to plaintiff Collins' claims of invasion of privacy against Omega and PIC. The motion is otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <em>\n     References to filings with this court are to the CM/ECF document and page number.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     The parties disagree as to whether these properties were jointly owned by Mr. and Mrs. Pelfrey or whether they were owned by Mr. Pelfrey alone.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <em>\n     Under the Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 106, a trustee is personally liable \"for a tort committed in the course of trust administration ... if the trustee is personally at fault.\n    </em>\n    \"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <em>\n     Contrary to plaintiffs' contention, Lot 12, Block 3 of Summit Ridge Section I, representing 423 NE 115th Street, was not transferred to the Rosemarie Trust by the Warranty Deed dated March 31, 2002; Doc. 134-3 at p. 4.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
