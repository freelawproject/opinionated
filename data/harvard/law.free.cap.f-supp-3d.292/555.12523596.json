BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I recite as background the facts as alleged in Plaintiff's complaint and in public judicial records of which I take note. Plaintiff became pregnant in 2009 at age fourteen and gave birth to her child in October 2010. In 2011, Melendez pled guilty in the Commonwealth's Norfolk Superior Court to statutory rape of the plaintiff and was sentenced to sixteen years of probation. As conditions of probation, the sentencing judge ordered Melendez to acknowledge paternity of the child, to support the child financially, and to abide by any orders of support issued by the Commonwealth's Probate and Family Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff has consistently objected to conditions of Melendez's probation. After seeking in May 2012 in Norfolk Probate and Family Court to establish paternity and child support by Melendez, she learned in June 2012 that Melendez sought to obtain visitation rights with the child. Plaintiff, who was at that time not represented by counsel, filed an action in Probate and Family Court to obtain child support from Melendez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2012, Plaintiff sought in the Superior Court to revise the conditions of Melendez's probation and thereby displace continuing Probate and Family Court jurisdiction. She requested that Melendez be required to pay criminal restitution, rather than child support, in order to relieve her of the burden of engaging in Probate and Family Court proceedings with him. Plaintiff sought to avoid the prospect of an unwanted sixteen year relationship with Melendez under which the Probate and Family Court would supervise and adjust respective responsibilities for the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While Plaintiff's motion was pending in the Superior Court, she filed a petition with a single justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to G.L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, requesting that the single justice order the Superior Court to rule on her motion and vacate the challenged portion of Melendez's probation conditions. Thereafter, the Superior Court denied Plaintiff's motion and the single justice rejected Plaintiff's petition. The Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the single justice's denial of relief in June 2013.\n   <em>\n    H.T.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275695\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/1011/\">\n    465 Mass. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20N.E.2d%20424\">\n    989 N.E.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In August 2013, Plaintiff filed suit in this court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , raising the same challenge to Melendez's probation conditions she had raised in state court. Judge Stearns dismissed Plaintiff's suit on the grounds that the Eleventh Amendment barred her claims and that the doctrines of\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   abstention and of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention counseled against exercising jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Tyler\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026116\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/92/#p95\">\n    981 F.Supp.2d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95-97 (D.

Judge Stearns observed that Plaintiff was not without an appellate remedy in the state courts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   As the Single Justice pointed out, her remedy-if one need be sought-is an appeal from any order eventually entered by the Probate and Family Court that plaintiff believes to impinge on her rights under the United States Constitution or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, rights which she is free to assert in the Probate Court proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026116\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/92/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026116\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/981/92/#p95\">\n    at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly after Judge Stearns dismissed her federal claims, Plaintiff returned to\n   Probate and Family Court and moved to vacate that court's jurisdiction or, in the alternative, to terminate Melendez's potential parental rights. The court denied the motion to vacate jurisdiction and, after an evidentiary hearing, denied Melendez visitation rights and required him to pay weekly child support of $110.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Appeals Court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    H.T.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    J.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201118\">\n    90 Mass.App.Ct. 1118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.E.3d%2031\">\n    65 N.E.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Table),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207046435\">\n    2016 WL 7046435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The Appeals Court held that the Probate and Family court had jurisdiction to adjudicate parental rights in this case pursuant to G.L. c. 209C, which grants the Probate and Family Court \"exclusive jurisdiction to make determinations regarding custody and visitation in a paternity proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court noted that \"nothing in the language of G.L. c. 209C expressly limits its applicability solely to children born as a result of lawful intercourse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court also discussed a 2014 amendment to G.L. c. 209C, \u00a7 3(a), which expressly provides that a court may grant visitation rights to a parent convicted of statutory rape if certain conditions are met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 &amp; n.8. Although the Appeals Court did not decide whether the 2014 amendment governed Plaintiff's case, it found the amendment reflected the legislature's recognition \"that the Probate and Family Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the parental rights of a parent convicted of statutory rape.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Finally, the court rejected Plaintiff's arguments that public policy favored vacating jurisdiction, finding that it \"would be inconsistent with 'the declared public policy of this Commonwealth that dependent children shall be maintained 'as completely as possible' from the resources of their parents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    L.W.K.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    E.R.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285286\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/438/\">\n    432 Mass. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20N.E.2d%20359\">\n    735 N.E.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Judicial Court denied Plaintiff's application for further appellate review on January 26, 2017.\n   <em>\n    H.T.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    J.M\n   </em>\n   , --- Mass. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20N.E.3d%201130\">\n    75 N.E.3d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In themes and variations, Plaintiff alleges the Supreme Judicial Court's decision violates her federal constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Count I, which claims deprivation of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment-incorporating the Fourth Amendment-to the United States Constitution, asserts that \"The Supreme Judicial Court's ruling threatens Plaintiff's rights by exposing Plaintiff to an unlawful restraint on her liberty and a seizure of her person.\" Count II, which is based on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, states that \"The Supreme Judicial Court's ruling threatens Plaintiff's liberty and privacy by forcing her to participate in [an] unwanted sixteen-year family court proceeding.\" Count III, which claims a violation of Plaintiff's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, declares that \"The Supreme Judicial Court's decision violates Plaintiff's equal protection rights because it subjects her and other females to different, inadequate and disparate legal protection on the basis of sex.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A judge of a federal district court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over such claims in this setting. Under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker - Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, federal district courts lack authority to hear \"cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district\n   court review and rejection of those judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/\">\n    544 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    McKenna\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Curtin\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff alleged that Rhode Island judicial officers and court administrators, including five named Rhode Island Supreme Court justices, violated his federal rights by suspending his license to practice law; the plaintiff sought a stay of his allegedly unlawful suspension as relief.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263668\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/44/\">\n    869 F.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2017). The First Circuit held the\n   <em>\n    Rooker - Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine barred consideration of the plaintiff's claims because he \"(1) complains of a personal injury arising from the Rhode Island Supreme Court's suspension order, and (2) asks the district court to countermand that order,\" making his claims \"precisely the 'functional equivalent of an appeal' that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker - Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine forbids.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263668\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263668\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/44/\">\n    at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Badillo-Santiago\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Naveira-Merly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9211599\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1/#p6\">\n    378 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (1st Cir. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under this reasoning, Plaintiff's claims here cannot elude application of the\n   <em>\n    Rooker - Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

For example, the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     Burford\n    </em>\n    abstention counsels against resolving Plaintiff's claims because they implicate difficult questions of domestic relations and criminal justice public policy which have been and will continue to be addressed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through its own courts and legislature.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Plaintiff alleges the clerk of the Probate and Family Court coerced her into filing the action when the clerk told Plaintiff she had \"no choice\" but to file.

In any event, a review of the record indicates that the state courts did consider her federal constitutional claims, but did not view them as significant enough to justify any written analysis. When it affirmed the Probate and Family Court's judgment, the Appeals Court observed in a footnote that \"[t]o the extent that we do not address other contentions made by the mother, 'they have not been overlooked.
