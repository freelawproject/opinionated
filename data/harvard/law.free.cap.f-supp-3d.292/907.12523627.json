No. 62] filed by Defendant Kendrick Ledelle Dotstry (\"Dotstry\"). On November 3, 2017, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on this motion, at which Dotstry offered testimony and counsel presented oral arguments. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Offense Conduct and Charges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Indictment [Doc. No. 1] in this case charges Dotstry with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) &amp; 924 (a)(2). Dotstry had prior felony convictions from this District for possession with intent to distribute cocaine in 2000, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine/cocaine base in 2009. (Indictment at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The current charges stem from events occurring on November 19, 2016, when several 911-callers reported an in-progress domestic abuse incident at a Minneapolis apartment complex. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R at 2 [Doc. No. 34].) While officers were en route to the scene, they learned the suspect's name and obtained a description of the suspect and his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The callers indicated that the suspect had also pointed a gun at several persons near the apartment complex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing on the instant motion, Dotstry testified that his actions on the day in question were in self-defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 12 [Doc. No. 73].) As he explained at the hearing and in a November 3, 2017 letter to the Court, on November 19, 2016, he visited the apartment complex to attend a baby shower for a woman named Juanita, with whom he was expecting a child. (Def.'s Nov. 3, 2017 Letter at 2 [Doc. No. 68].) At the same time, however, Dotstry was also expecting a child with a different woman-a fact that was apparently known to Juanita and members of her family, who were unhappy with Dotstry. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (stating, \"A couple of sisters of ... Juanita got involved and started a [w]hole bunch of drama and turn[ed] her family against me. (Ok[,] I deserve for them to be mad.)\"). While he was arguing with Juanita in front of the building, Dotstry contends that a man named Duke told him to leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dotstry then walked off and engaged in conversation with a man named Andre. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Andre left, Dotstry asserts that he was walking to his truck when Duke approached him and the two started fighting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Duke pulled out a gun, which Dotstry deflected, causing Duke to drop the weapon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shortly thereafter, Dotstry contends that \"about 20\" members of Juanita's family, who came out to help Duke, approached Dotstry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Believing that Juanita's family members meant him harm, Dotstry waved a gun in front of himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As he later explained, \"I did wave the gun to get all the people to back away from me.\" (Def.'s Nov. 3, 2017 Letter at 3.) Dotstry then got into his truck and started to leave. (Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the responding police officers arrived at the scene, they observed a suspect and vehicle that matched the callers' descriptions. (R &amp; R at 3.) After the driver, later identified as Dotstry, voluntarily pulled over, the officers initiated a stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because of concerns that Dotstry was armed, officers drew their weapons, crouched behind the doors of their squad car, and issued commands to Dotstry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dotstry initially refused to comply, but ultimately did so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) While the officers were securing him, the following exchange occurred between Dotstry and Officer Andrew Schroeder:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Schroeder: We got a call you were pointing a gun around.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Dotstry: I was pointing a gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Schroeder: That's why we're here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Dotstry: I do have one. There's one in the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Schroeder: Is there one in the car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Dotstry: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Officer Schroeder: Do you got a permit for it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Dotstry: No, I don't, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Schroeder: Ok. Very good. Right now you're under arrest for possession of a handgun, ok?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Dotstry: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Officer Schroeder: You want to tell me where it is just so my officers-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Dotstry: It's in the middle console.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Officers retrieved a loaded Sig Sauer 9-millimeter handgun from the center console of the truck and placed Dotstry under arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After transporting Dotstry to the jail's sally port, Dotstry asked Officer Schroeder how much \"time\" he would be facing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Officer Schroeder responded that \"everything happens for a reason\" and \"at least you're above ground.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dotstry then stated that he had initially considered drawing his gun in response to the officers' commands to exit his truck, but reconsidered because he was a new father. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dotstry's family retained attorney F. Clayton Tyler (\"Tyler\") to represent Dotstry on the felon-in-possession charge. (Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 13-14.) Tyler had previously represented him on his two prior felony convictions in federal court and Dotstry testified that he was satisfied with Tyler's prior services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    at 14-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his pretrial motions in this case, Dotstry moved to suppress the statements he made at the scene of arrest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. to Suppress at 4 [Doc. No. 32].) He argued that those statements were obtained without a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following a hearing on his motions, Magistrate Judge Bowbeer found that Dotstry's statements at the scene of arrest concerning the gun's location fell under the public safety exception to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   set forth in\n   <em>\n    New York v. Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/\">\n    467 U.S. 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205709\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/649/\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). (R &amp; R at 7-10.) In addition, even though Dotstry did not argue for the suppression of his statements made in the jail's sally port, in an abundance of caution, the magistrate judge nevertheless addressed them as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) Because Magistrate Judge Bowbeer found that Dotstry's statements made in the jail sally port were voluntary, and not in response to custodial interrogation, she found the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   inapplicable. Accordingly, the magistrate judge denied Dotstry's suppression motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dotstry appealed the magistrate judge's recommendation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Obj. [Doc. No. 35].) On review, this Court denied Defendant's motion as to the challenged scene-of-arrest statements concerning the possession of the firearm and its location in the vehicle, and likewise adopted the magistrate judge's recommendations as to the statements made in the sally port.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (May 26, 2017 Order at 10 [Doc. No. 37].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On June 13, 2017, Dotstry and his counsel appeared at a change-of-plea hearing. He did not enter into a plea agreement with the Government, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   June 13, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 14 [Doc. No. 51],) but chose to plead guilty to the single felon-in-possession charge in the Indictment. During a lengthy colloquy with the Court, Dotstry: (1) acknowledged his competence and ability to understand the proceedings (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6); (2) twice expressed his intention to plead guilty, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 12); (3) attested three times to his understanding that once he entered a guilty plea, and the Court\n   accepted it, he would not be able to withdraw it, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 11, 17); (4) stated that he had reviewed the charges with his attorney and was satisfied with Tyler's legal representation, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6); (5) indicated his understanding of the constitutional rights that he was waiving by pleading guilty instead of going to trial, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11); (6) understood the charges against him, and the possible statutory penalties that he faced by entering a guilty plea, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14); (7) understood the advisory sentencing guidelines and the range of sentences that might be applied to him; (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17); (8) understood that the parties disagreed about the applicability of a guideline enhancement, which they would have an opportunity to argue at a later time, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17); (9) provided a sufficient factual basis for the guilty plea, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-23); and (10) stated that he was making the plea voluntarily and of his own free will, without any coercion or force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). The Court also advised that by pleading guilty, criminal defendants relinquish the right to bring pretrial motions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) But because Dotstry had already filed his pretrial motions, the Court stated, \"You brought pretrial motions, you had a full opportunity to be heard, there was a hearing, there was a ruling, it was appealed, I ruled on it. So, you've been through that process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court ultimately accepted Dotstry's guilty plea, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I find that Mr. Dotstry is aware of the nature of the charges against him and the nature of these proceedings and the consequences of your plea of guilty. I find that your plea is free and voluntary and knowing and informed and well supported in the record by facts that establish each of the elements of the offense with which you're charged. Therefore, sir, I accept your plea of guilty, and I find you guilty as charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In July 2017, Attorney Tyler moved to withdraw as Dotstry's counsel, citing a deterioration in the attorney-client relationship. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counsel's Mot. to Withdraw at 1 [Doc. No. 44].) Dotstry testified that the cause of the deteriorating relationship was Tyler's refusal to assert self defense, i.e., a \"justification\" defense, in response to the felon-in-possession charge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 30-31.) The Court granted Tyler's motion, and appointed Dotstry's current counsel, Mr. Paule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order [Doc. No. 54].) At the hearing on the instant motion, Mr. Dotstry waived his attorney-client privilege rights and testified about his communications with Tyler. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Dotstry filed his Motion to Withdraw Plea of Guilty, asserting that his guilty plea was not made knowingly and voluntarily, although his written motion contains no legal argument or additional information to explain the specific basis for his claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Withdraw Plea at 1.) At the November 3, 2017 evidentiary hearing, however, he shifted the basis for his motion to withdraw his plea, arguing that his former counsel had provided ineffective assistance, sufficient to provide a fair and just basis for withdrawing his plea. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 26, 42-43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dotstry contends that his former counsel misled him by giving incorrect legal advice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the evidentiary hearing, he testified that during the course of Tyler's representation, the two had discussed several issues, including whether to assert a justification defense, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18), and whether Dotstry could retain his right to appeal any of the pretrial rulings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22.) Tyler's purportedly incorrect advice consists of: (1) advising Dotstry that\n   self-defense was not an available defense to a felon-in-possession charge, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, 22); and (2) failing to properly advise him concerning the possible retention of his appellate rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) He appears to argue that by giving him this \"misleading\" advice, Tyler \"coerced\" him into pleading guilty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23) (Q: \"Mr. Dotstry, you're basically telling this judge that you want to withdraw your plea because you felt that your plea of guilty was coerced by activities by Mr. Tyler. Isn't that correct?\" A: \"Yes.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court is unconvinced by Dotstry's recent suggestion that because he was \"nervous\" and \"discombobulated\" at the change-of-plea hearing, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 36), he was somehow unable to accurately express his satisfaction with his counsel's services. Furthermore, at the change-of-plea hearing, Dotstry testified that he entered the plea voluntarily, of his own free will and absent any coercion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 13, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 23.) At the November 3, 2017 hearing on the instant motion, Dotstry reaffirmed that he was not forced to plead guilty.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22.) He testified that he had discussed these issues with Tyler.

Dotstry's counsel was not constitutionally deficient for failing to raise such a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Dotstry's other ground for claiming ineffective assistance is his apparent belief, based on Tyler's alleged advice, that a guilty plea would still allow him to retain the right to challenge this Court's suppression rulings on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 21-22, 44.) Yet during the change-of-plea hearing, no such conditions or stipulations were placed on the record. In\n   <em>\n    Haubrich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119280\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/554/#p557\">\n    744 F.3d at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming ineffective assistance based on counsel's allegedly misleading statements concerning a possible five-year sentence. The Eighth Circuit was unpersuaded, noting that the plea agreement contained no such stipulations and the defendant indicated that he understood the 20-year maximum sentences for four of his counts, and that the judge would consider the sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119280\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/554/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court stated, \"In this circuit, if the defendant understands the possible punishment, it matters not that he says counsel made other promises.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119280\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/554/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the change-of-plea hearing is devoid of any reference to a \"conditional plea.\" Instead, Dotstry testified to his understanding of the constitutional rights that he was waiving by pleading guilty instead of going to trial, (June 13, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 7-11), understood the possible statutory penalties that he faced by entering a guilty plea, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14), understood the advisory sentencing guidelines and the range of sentences that might be applied to him, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17), and understood that the parties disagreed about the applicability of a guideline enhancement, which they would have an opportunity to argue at sentencing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17). The Court therefore finds that Dotstry fails to establish that his counsel's performance was deficient on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nor does the record support any claim that Tyler's advice somehow \"coerced\" Dotstry into pleading guilty. Mr. Dotstry's own testimony contradicts any\n   such assertions. At the change-of-plea hearing, Dotstry testified that he entered the plea voluntarily, of his own free will and absent any coercion. (June 13, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 23.) At the evidentiary hearing, Dotstry reaffirmed that his plea was voluntarily given. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because the Court finds that Dotstry has not established a fair and just reason to withdraw his plea, the Court is not required to address the additional factors noted earlier, i.e., whether the defendant claims innocence, the length of time between the guilty plea and the motion to withdraw it, and whether the government will be prejudiced if the motion is granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5411644\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/824/#p826\">\n    449 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   826 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nichols\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"662143\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/1199/#p1201\">\n    986 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1201 ). The Court does observe, however, that while Dotstry wished to assert a justification defense, he does not proclaim his innocence-to the contrary, he has admitted to the charge against him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 13, 2017 Hr'g Tr. at 6, 22-23.) At the change-of-plea hearing, he testified that he had two prior felony convictions, knew that he was ineligible to possess a firearm, and on November 19, 2016, he physically possessed the Sig Sauer 9-millimeter handgun. (Id.) In addition, the timing of Dotstry's motion to withdraw, filed on September 20, 2017-three months after the June 13, 2017 change-of-plea hearing, and shortly after the September 14, 2017 issuance of the Presentence Report-suggests that his motion to withdraw was prompted by his disagreement with information contained in the Presentence Report, in addition to his continued disagreement with this Court's ruling on his suppression motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Dotstry has not established a just and fair reason for the withdrawal of his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1.
