(Doc. 632.) Following the jury's verdict, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Enhanced Damages [Doc. 644] that is now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In April 2004, Plaintiff Canon, Inc. (\"Canon\") developed and sold the first Set On III toner bottle that can be used in Canon copier machines. Defendant General Plastic Industrial Co., Ltd (\"GPI\") manufactures aftermarket toner bottles and cartridges, meaning they can be used in copiers and printers made by other companies, such as Canon. One of GPI's customers is Defendant Color Imaging, Inc. (\"Color Imaging\"), which purchases empty toner bottles from GPI, fills them with toner, and sells them in competition with Canon and other OEM (original equipment manufacturer) companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2005, GPI made an aftermarket version of Canon's Set On III toner bottles known as Type A and began selling it, including in the United States. In 2008, GPI made Type B bottles, another aftermarket version of Canon's Set On III toner bottles, and also sold it in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Canon applied for the '012 patent, the patent at issue in this case, on July 9, 2008, and the '012 patent issued on January 12, 2010. Soon after, Canon sued Densigraphix, one of GPI's customers, for infringing the '012 patent based on Densigraphix's sales of Type A and Type B bottles. GPI and Color Imaging both learned of the '012 patent and Canon's infringement allegations against Type A and Type B bottles in January 2010, when Densigraphix was sued. A few months later, Densigraphix entered into a consent order that provided for a permanent injunction in the case brought by Canon, and Densigraphix told GPI it could no longer sell Type A and Type B bottles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   GPI continued selling Type A bottles to U.S. customers for over a year after January 2010. GPI also continued selling Type B bottles, and in April 2011, Color Imaging began selling Type B bottles in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 15, 2011, Canon brought the current suit against GPI and Color Imaging for infringing three claims of the '012 patent. The case was litigated for several years and went to trial in June 2017. On June 19, 2017, the jury returned a verdict finding that Defendants had infringed the three claims of the '012 patent, that their infringement was willful, and that Defendants had not sufficiently proven their affirmative defenses. The jury awarded Canon $3,740,603 in damages for GPI's infringement and $730,380 for Color Imaging's infringement based on a reasonable royalty rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff now moves for enhanced damages based on the jury's finding of willful infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Factor One: Copying\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the evidence shows Defendant GPI deliberately copied Plaintiff's toner bottles when making Type A bottles and later used the same measurements-derived from the Type A copying exercise-when making Type B bottles. Defendants argue that Type A was GPI's own invention and that Plaintiff did not inform Defendants about its '012 patent application prosecution activity when GPI was openly selling Type A bottles (i.e., before the '012 patent issued). And as to Type B, Defendants argue that it is also GPI's own invention, and they once again highlight that GPI designed Type B before the '012 patent issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court first addresses Defendants' argument that they developed Type A and Type B bottles\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the '012 patent issued, thus demonstrating that they were not copying the patent and were instead trying to develop a competitive alternative to Plaintiff's bottles. The first\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor does not focus on whether Defendants copied the '012 patent itself, but whether they copied the \"ideas or design\" of Plaintiff's bottles-which could have occurred before the '012 patent issued.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barry v.

Mich. July 12, 2017). Accordingly, Defendants' conduct before as well as after the '012 patent issued may be probative for this factor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court now examines the parties' arguments with respect to Type A and Type B bottles separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As to Type A, the evidence shows GPI obtained Canon Set On III toner bottles, disassembled them, measured them, determined their structure, and then used that information to make the Type A bottles in 2005. (Trial Transcript at 618-25.) Defendants do not present persuasive evidence that GPI made design-around changes to the Type A bottle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For instance, Mr. Li, one of GPI's employees who oversaw the development of the infringing bottles in this case, testified that Type A had some \"dimensional issues\" when it fit into the copier machine and some gaps between the bottle body and the upper cap. (Trial Transcript at 1129-31.) Defendants cite to these \"issues\" as evidence that GPI could not have copied Canon's toner bottles, since Canon's bottles were supposed to be the ideal standard. However, Mr. Li does not describe any specific adjustments or changes his team made to the Type A that made it\n   different from Canon's bottles. He only generally says he made \"some changes.\" (Trial Transcript at 1128.)\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517602\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/816/#p827\">\n    970 F.2d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (not finding copying where the defendant used the patented invention as a \"starting point\" for design-around efforts and also \"made specific changes deemed adequate by counsel to avoid infringement of both of Read's patents\"). The fact that GPI manufactured Type A bottles in a way that still resulted in some \"issues\" does not automatically mean GPI did not engage in copying; it could simply mean that GPI encountered flaws in its manufacturing process, for example. Moreover, Mr. Hsu, GPI's vice president of sales, agreed that the cap or sealing member of the Type A bottles and the Canon bottles appear \"pretty much the same\" with only \"minor differences.\" (Trial Transcript at 574-75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants' Type B bottles are a different story. While the jury had sufficient evidence to find that Type B bottles were infringing, Defendants also presented evidence of noticeable changes they made to Type B bottles when compared to Canon's bottles. Mr. Li testified that he designed around the Canon bottles by using a \"different [ ] operating principle and designed a part that looks like a duckbill\" instead of the engaging projections in Canon bottles. (Trial Transcript at 1135.) He stated that \"my thinking was that if I could avoid using the engaging projections I would be able to design around most of the Canon patents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1138-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants further emphasize that they applied for and obtained a patent, the '910 patent, which they argue covers their Type B bottles. Defendants applied for the patent on January 31, 2011, after they had started manufacturing and selling the Type B bottles. The Court precluded Defendants from introducing the actual '910 patent or patent application into evidence, as such evidence \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   relevant to a determination of whether or not Defendants infringed the '012 patent\" and moreover might confuse the jury. (Doc. 533 at 6.) But the Court also ruled that such evidence \"could potentially be relevant to the issue of willful infringement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 6-7.) Accordingly, the Court has reviewed the '910 patent (Doc. 498-5),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and without making an legal or factual conclusions about whether it covers Type B bottles, the Court finds the patent to be indicative of Defendants' intent to not copy Canon's bottles when making their Type B bottles. Arguably, Defendants would not have applied for the '910 patent if they did not believe they had successfully designed around Plaintiff's '012 patent. Indeed, Defendants do not make this same argument with respect to Type A bottles, which is telling. The '910 patent is not conclusive evidence either way, particularly given that Defendants applied for it\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they had already sold the infringing Type B bottles. But it is additional evidence, along with Mr. Li's testimony and the Type B bottle design itself, suggesting that Defendants did not deliberately copy when making the Type B bottles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, this first factor weighs slightly in favor of enhanced damages. The evidence suggests deliberate copying as to Type A bottles but not as to Type B bottles, which made up the majority of the infringing sales at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factor Two: Investigation into the Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second factor considers \"whether the infringer, when he knew of the other's patent protection, investigated the scope of the patent and formed a good-faith belief that it was invalid or that it was not infringed.\"\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517602\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/816/#p827\">\n    970 F.2d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on the evidence in this case, this second factor tracks the first factor. Defendants do not appear to have formed a good-faith belief of non-infringement with respect to their Type A bottles, but they appear to have done so with respect to their Type B bottles. There is simply no evidence that, after learning of the '012 patent in January 2010, Defendants investigated or even discussed whether Type A bottles infringed the patent. Defendants point to the testimony of Mr. Hsu, the vice president of GPI's sales, when asked how GPI determined Type A bottles did not infringe. Mr. Hsu stated, \"During the process of research, my engineer reported to me that there was no infringement for the patents. It is matched with the machine.\" (Trial Transcript at 972.) He explained that \"matched with the machine\" means no infringement because when customers buy the OEM machine (i.e., the Canon copier), they own the machine and therefore have a choice of buying Canon toner bottles or GPI's after-market toner bottles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 980-81.) This discussion between Mr. Hsu and his engineer occurred \"during the process of research\" about Type A bottles, which would have occurred around 2005 when Type A bottles were first manufactured. Defendants present no evidence of discussions about Type A bottles' infringement at a later date, particularly after learning of the '012 patent-which is the relevant time frame for this second factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, Ms. Hsieh, GPI's patent specialist, contradicted Mr. Hsu's testimony regarding pre-patent discussions; she testified that she was not aware of anyone else at GPI, including Mr. Hsu and Mr. Li, forming beliefs about whether the '012 patent covered Type A bottles. (Trial Transcript at 1100.) Rather, the evidence shows that Defendants learned of the patent in January 2010, continued to sell Type A bottles for approximately one year after that point, and meanwhile, conducted no new investigations or made any determinations regarding whether Type A bottles infringed or not. Thus, there is insufficient evidence here to support a good-faith belief of non-infringement by Defendants about their Type A bottles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, the record supports Defendants' good-faith belief with respect to their Type B bottles. For one, Defendants point to a meeting on April 20, 2010-within months of learning about the '012 patent-regarding \"patent circumvention\" for their Type B bottles. (Doc. 633-35 at 38-40) (Trial Transcript at 1159-1161.) Mr. Li attended the meeting, and he describes box 18 of the meeting minutes as distinguishing between Type B bottles and the '012 patent based on Type B bottles lacking an engaging projection. (Trial Transcript at 1160.) He testified that the \"operating principles\" of the Type B bottles were not contained in the '012 patent, or any other Canon patents, noted in box 18 of the meeting minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1161.) Additionally, Mr. Li described a document titled \"Order for New Development\" and dated March 9, 2011, in which GPI noted that it had a \"patent strategy\" with respect to Type B bottles. (Doc. 633-35 at 66.) Mr. Li explained that this document \"indicated that we have a patent countermeasure\" or a \"design-around design\" for\n   Type B. (Trial Transcript at 1076.) More specifically, Mr. Li stated that he redesigned the Type B bottles shortly after GPI learned of the '012 patent, by introducing a curved surface on the duckbill part \"to ensure better driving and make it harder to be deformed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1155-58.) Before redesigning Type B, Mr. Li stated that he \"searched through all the patents we knew at the time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court therefore finds sufficient evidence that Defendants formed a good-faith belief that their Type B bottles were non-infringing, design-around products. This good-faith evidence about Type B stands in stark contrast to the lack of good-faith evidence about Type A. Based on the Court's findings as to Type A bottles alone, this second factor weighs slightly in favor of enhanced damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Factor Three: Infringer's Litigation Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   factor examines whether the infringer engaged in litigation misconduct, which refers to \"bringing vexatious or unjustified suits, discovery abuses, failure to obey orders of the court, or acts that unnecessarily prolong litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    i4i Ltd.

Both sides fought hard during litigation-at times almost stepping over the line, though not quite. For instance, Plaintiff takes issue with Defendants raising new defenses of exhaustion, implied license, and repair on an untimely basis after claim construction. However, as the Court stated in its July 1, 2016 Order, Plaintiff was on notice that these were possible defenses as early as January 9, 2014, the date of the claim construction order finding a combined patent construction. The Court then extended fact discovery in light of the claim construction ruling, and at the end of discovery, the Court allowed Defendants to amend their answers to add these three defenses based on Plaintiff's prior notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 431 at 2 n.1.) Plaintiff points to Defendants' representations that it had a good-faith belief of non-infringement all along based on exhaustion, and therefore Plaintiff argues Defendants should have raised the defense much earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the same July 1, 2016 Order referenced above, the Court found that Plaintiff was attempting to get expert testimony in through its new Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Mr. Fujino, and on subject matter that the prior 30(b)(6) witness did not testify about. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The Court limited Mr. Fujino's testimony to the scope of the prior witness's testimony and also granted Defendants' motion to exclude Plaintiff's new documents. In this way, Plaintiff employed some of the same questionable tactics it accuses Defendants of using.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This is not to say that Defendants' litigation conduct was straight arrow. Defendants unquestionably shifted their theories on the eve of trial and even during trial. For instance, the Court had to preclude Defendants' expert from opining on a brand new theory, the reverse doctrine of equivalents theory, which Defendants raised for the first time just days before trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 604.) But based on the evidence and the Court's experience with both sides over several years, the Court finds that Defendants' conduct does not rise to the level of egregiousness that warrants enhanced damages.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274136\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/107/#p112\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Enhancement analysis is not an opportunity for this court to penalize a zealous trial team that engaged in hard-fought battles but ultimately lost the war.

Though the jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff, Defendants' defenses were not frivolous or completely without merit. Even in the Court's Order denying Defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial, the Court made a point of noting that \"[t]he exhaustion defense and its relationship to the repair defense were difficult issues\" and that \"case law is sparse on [the] three particular defenses.\" (Doc. 685 at 4.)

(Trial Transcript at 1027-1030.) They continued to sell Type B bottles after Plaintiff filed the instant suit on September 15, 2011, and up through September 2, 2015, when they entered into a consent order with Plaintiff before the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 594-95; ITC Consent Order, Doc. 644-5.)

Defendants' decision to voluntarily stop selling Type A bottles after learning of the '012 patent-albeit over a year later-may be considered\n   a small remedial step.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517602\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/816/#p827\">\n    970 F.2d at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the voluntary withdrawal of the infringing product from the market during the pendency of litigation as an example of remedial action).

Defendants' good-faith non-infringement beliefs\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the '012 patent issued only get them so far; for this seventh factor, the Court looks to the steps that Defendants took\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they learned of the patent and their potential infringement of it. Defendants do not even attempt to argue or point to evidence that they made design-around modifications to Type B after learning of the patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, Defendants' argument about Plaintiff's failure to seek a preliminary injunction in this case is unavailing. Plaintiff rightly points out that it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek damages based solely on Defendants' conduct after this case was filed; therefore, Plaintiff was not required to file a preliminary injunction to establish willfulness and later move for enhanced damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mentor Graphics Corp. v.

Aug. 22, 2016). When discussing the copying factor, the court mentioned that the infringing product was developed \"10 years\" before the plaintiff's patent issued.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204427490\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    But the court did not rely on this fact alone when concluding that the copying factor weighed in favor of the defendant. The court emphasized that the plaintiff presented no evidence that the defendant copied its design or source code (as opposed to the patent itself), and that there was no evidence that the defendant ever possessed the patented invention before releasing its own product. Thus, this case does\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    state that a defendant's pre-patent activities are not probative for the copying factor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The '910 patent includes an embodiment that appears to have a \"duckbill\" sealing member. The Court does not make a finding as to whether the '910 patent's claims actually cover Type B bottles, but the embodiment suggests that Defendants intended for the '910 patent to cover Type B bottles. Furthermore, the '910 patent references Canon's '012 patent as prior art, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office authorized issuance of the '910 patent on April 16, 2013. While the Court makes no findings as to the validity of the '910 patent, the fact that it references the '012 patent as prior art suggests that Defendants were not trying to mislead the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office when applying for the '910 patent and that they had a good-faith belief that their Type B bottle design constituted a new invention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Court does not consider the size of Color Imaging for this factor, as Color Imaging and GPI announced in the news that GPI agreed to indemnify Color Imaging for all potential liability and costs arising from this case.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 644-3 at 11.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The Court recognizes an apparent tension between the sixth factor and the second factor (i.e., whether Defendants formed a good-faith non-infringement belief after learning of the '012 patent). In light of Defendants' good-faith non-infringement belief as to their Type B bottles, as discussed above, it is arguably logical why they would continue to sell Type B bottles for several years after learning of Plaintiff's patent. However, a defendant's good-faith belief is merely \"one consideration that can color this analysis\"; for example, a court may enhance damages more so for a defendant's infringing sales made\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    a finding of liability compared to sales made\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    a finding of liability.\n    <em>\n     Milwaukee Elec.
