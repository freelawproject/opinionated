After evaluating whether the transferee district is one in which the action could have originally been brought, the Court must then \" 'weigh in the balance a number of case-specific factors' related to both the public and private interests\" to determine whether transfer is warranted.\n   <em>\n    Chariots for Hire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p31\">\n    918 F.Supp.2d at 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stewart Org.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    487 U.S. at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Both parties assert that at least some of the events giving rise to this case happened in that district. And it appears that there are no defects in subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction in the Eastern District of Virginia. Accordingly, the Court agrees that the Eastern District of Virginia is a proper venue for this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court next considers whether the balancing of the relevant factors counsels in favor of transfer to the Eastern District of Virginia-the forum preferred by the defendant in this matter. Generally, a plaintiff's choice of forum is a \"paramount consideration\" in determining a transfer request.\n   <em>\n    Thayer/Patricof Educ. Funding, LLC v.

By contrast, M &amp; S's chosen forum-the Eastern District of Virginia-is the home forum for Mr. Aguilar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M &amp; S Mem. at 3. Furthermore, although M &amp; S does some business in the District of Columbia, Mr. Aguilar never performed any work for M &amp; S outside of the Eastern District of Virginia, and all decisions about his compensation were made and processed in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M &amp; S Mem. at 2-3. Therefore, the controversy over Mr. Aguilar's unpaid overtime compensation has substantial ties to the Eastern District of Virginia-M &amp; S's chosen forum-and has no meaningful ties to the District of Columbia. Accordingly, Mr. Aguilar's chosen forum is entitled to little deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In evaluating the next consideration-where the claims arose-courts in this district examine \"where most of the significant events giving rise to the claims occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Treppel v.

By contrast, as noted above, Mr. Aguilar never performed any work for M &amp; S outside of Eastern District of Virginia, his tasks were assigned by supervisors in the Eastern District of Virginia, and all decisions made about his compensation were made and processed in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M &amp; S Mem. at 2-3. Therefore, because the significant events giving rise to the claim occurred in the Eastern District of Virginia, the third factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The three remaining private-interest factors-the convenience of parties, witnesses, and ease of access to sources of proof-weigh slightly in favor of transfer to the Eastern District of Virginia. Many of the likely witnesses-including Mr. Aguilar's supervisors, who work in the Norfolk office-and records pertaining to Mr. Aguilar's work are located in the Eastern District of Virginia. Indeed, Mr. Aguilar himself lives in the Eastern District of\n   Virginia. And while parts of the Eastern District of Virginia neighbor this judicial district, most sources of proof in this case can be found in Norfolk, Virginia, which is approximately 200 miles from the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LaFleur v.

Va. 2016) (noting that the Norfolk Division is 200 miles from the District of Columbia metropolitan area). The Court recognizes, though, that the District of Columbia's relative proximity to the Eastern District of Virginia and advances in technology may minimize potential inconveniences to the parties and may reduce the significance of the ease-of-access-to-proof factor. Accordingly, the Court will not give this factor overwhelming weight.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Volkswagen of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3858830\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/304/#p317\">\n    545 F.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317 (5th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (finding that the 150 miles the witnesses would have to travel from the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division to the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division was a sufficient inconvenience to weigh in favor of transfer).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Turning to the public-interest factors, the Court finds that the first (familiarity with the governing law) and second (congestion of the court) factors are neutral. The transferee forum's familiarity with the governing law-here, the Fair Labor Standards Act-is neutral because \"where the heart of the case involves violation of federal law, this factor is less significant.\"\n   <em>\n    Chariots for Hire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304595\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/918/24/#p31\">\n    918 F.Supp.2d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The second factor is similarly neutral because there is no evidence in the record to support a finding, one way or the other, that transfer would result in a faster or slower resolution of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

In evaluating this factor, courts in this jurisdiction look at where the claim arose and where a \"clear majority of the operative events took place.\"\n   <em>\n    Maysaroh v. Am.

As previously discussed, Mr. Aguilar never left the Eastern District of Virginia for his work with M &amp; S, his supervisors and records were all located in the Eastern District of Virginia, and the pay policy decisions were made at M &amp; S headquarters in the Eastern District of Virginia. Therefore, the Eastern District of Virginia has a strong interest in deciding this controversy. In sum, six of the nine private- and public-interest factors weigh in favor of transfer from the District of Columbia to the Eastern District of Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

This claim arose from events that happened in Norfolk, Virginia (which is where all tasks were assigned to Mr. Aguilar and where he performed all of his worked-related duties); the parties, witnesses, and most of the relevant evidence is located in Norfolk, Virginia; and the Norfolk Division has an interest in deciding the case since the claim arose within that division. M &amp; S has supported its request for transfer to the Norfolk Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By contrast, Mr. Aguilar's entire argument in support of transfer to the Alexandria Division is that \"the pay policy decision was made in Alexandria, payroll utilized an Alexandria address and the named Plaintiff is expected to move to New York prior to the conclusion of this case.\" Pl.'s Opp. Mot.

He does not address why these factors are important or whether they outweigh the factors in favor of transfer to the Norfolk Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5905845\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/638/1/#p12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, it is unclear how Mr. Aguilar's plans to move to New York weigh in favor of transfer to the Alexandria Division.
