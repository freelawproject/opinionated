Plaintiff's Privacy Act Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The parties agree that the plaintiff learned of the \"accusatory 'warning' \" regarding his HIV status while the plaintiff was detained at the Indianapolis County Jail in January 1996. Am. Compl. at 9; Defs.' Mem. at 7. The plaintiff then submitted a formal amendment request to the FBI, which request was denied by the FBI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., Ex. B. On February 13, 2002, the OIP affirmed the FBI's decision to deny amendment of agency records by expunging records indicating that the plaintiff is known or suspected of having been infected with HIV.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2026398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the two-year statute of limitations applicable to Privacy Act claims would have expired on or about February 13, 2004. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the plaintiff's Privacy Act claim is time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if the plaintiff's Privacy Act claim had been timely filed, the plaintiff fails to demonstrate that he is entitled to damages. A plaintiff who proves an intentional or willful violation of the Privacy Act also must prove some actual damages before he is entitled to the statutory minimum award of $1,000 under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(g)(4)(A).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

The Court has reviewed\n   the plaintiff's pleadings, opposition to the defendants' summary judgment motion and his other submissions, and identifies no support for an award of damages-actual or otherwise-arising from a purported violation of the Privacy Act. The defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiff's Privacy Act claim is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C. The Plaintiff's Tort Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Scattered amongst the plaintiff's disorganized and ever-shifting factual allegations are tort claims, none of which survive. First, the plaintiff is a prisoner who may not bring a civil action \"for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). The plaintiff alleges emotional injuries,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 10, 14, but neither alleges nor shows a prior physical injury resulting from the FBI's actions. Consequently, the plaintiff is not entitled to damages for emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Bock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=55%20Fed.%20Appx.%20310\">\n    55 Fed.Appx. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 312 (6th Cir. 2003) (finding that prisoner \"cannot maintain his claim for money damages to compensate him for the defendants' failure to expunge inaccurate information from his prison file\" because he \"has not alleged, nor has he shown, a prior physical injury resulting from the defendants' alleged actions\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, the plaintiff's property,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. at 16-17, 21-22, and constitutional tort claims,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 22, cannot proceed because they are barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Generally, the United States is immune from suits for damages unless there is an express waiver of that immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v.

The Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") is an example of a waiver of the federal government's immunity, albeit with limitations and exceptions. For example, \"the United States has not waived sovereign immunity with respect to actions for damages based on violations of constitutional rights by federal officials, whether brought against the United States directly ..., or against officers sued in their official capacities.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamrick v.
