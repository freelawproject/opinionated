GRITZNER, Senior Judge\n   This matter comes before the Court on a Motion for Summary Judgment (the Motion) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 filed by Defendants Southwest Iowa Narcotics Enforcement Task Force (Task Force), Pottawattamie County Deputy Sheriff Brian Miller (Miller), Assistant Pottawattamie County Attorney Shelly Sedlak-Sudmann (Sudmann), and the Pottawattamie County Attorney's Office (PCAO) (collectively, Defendants). Plaintiff Phillip Anthony Flora (Flora or Plaintiff) resists the motion. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on October 6, 2017. Attorneys Alex Grasso and Michelle Rodemyer were present for Defendants, and attorneys Glen Downey and Nathan Mundy were present for Flora. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Traffic Stop\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Flora's action, which comprises five claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and a supplemental state law claim for conversion, stems from a traffic stop that occurred shortly before 2:00 p.m. on August 27, 2015. Flora was driving a Toyota Camry with Tennessee license plates in the westbound lane of Interstate 80 outside Council Bluffs, Iowa. Flora alleges that he had set the cruise control to 70 miles-per-hour-the posted speed limit on that stretch of the interstate-when he was observed by Miller. Miller was parked in his patrol car, facing westbound traffic, at the same time and in the same area as Flora when Flora passed him. In addition to serving as a Pottawattamie County Deputy Sheriff, Miller is a trained drug interdiction officer, a K-9 handler, and a member of the Task Force. Miller activated his emergency lights and initiated a stop of Flora. Flora alleges that Miller's speed radar equipment was not engaged at any point during his pursuit and stop of Flora and, in fact, a radar reading does not appear in Miller's unredacted patrol car video.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Miller approached Flora's passenger side window and informed him that he had been traveling 74 miles-per-hour. Miller requested Flora's driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller began to question Flora about his occupation and travel itinerary. Flora replied that he worked in information technology and had flown into Cedar Rapids, Iowa the day prior. Flora stated that he was planning on meeting a client \"off the freeway\" in Omaha, Nebraska, yet did not know which exit to take and would call his client when he got close.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs' SUF \u00b6 20, ECF No. 22-1; Pl's RSUF \u00b6 20, ECF No. 70-1. Flora\n   stated for a second time that he did not know his intended exit, though he was less than ten minutes from the Omaha area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Within minutes of the initial stop, Miller returned to his patrol car to review the documents that Flora had provided to him. Miller observed that Flora had rented the vehicle on August 27, 2015 at 8:49 a.m. in Cedar Rapids, and the vehicle needed to be returned in Huntington Beach, California on August 29, 2015 at 9:00 a.m., with the total cost of the rental being $1,535.90. Miller checked Flora's information and vehicle on the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Miller completed and printed a traffic warning memorandum for Flora. Miller spent between seven and seven and one-half minutes reviewing Flora's documents and printing the warning before returning to Flora's vehicle. Upon returning to Flora's vehicle, Miller did not return Flora's paperwork and warning memorandum, but instead asked if Flora had anything illegal in his car, which Flora denied. Miller informed Flora, \"I have a narcotics dog, I'm going to take him around your car real quick.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:00:10-14:00:20). Miller asked Flora if he had been \"back to Iowa before,\" to which Flora replied that he had been once before, \"maybe a year ago.\" Pl's SAF \u00b6 10, ECF No. 70-2; Defs' RSAF \u00b6 10, ECF No. 73; Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:00:23-14:00:33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before running his drug dog, Francesco, around Flora's rental car, Miller instructed Flora to exit the vehicle. Flora exited the vehicle without objection. Miller informed Flora, \"I'm going to pat you down here real quick,\" to which Flora responded \"Yeah,\" and Miller completed the pat down. Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:00:40-14:00:47). No weapons or contraband were found on Flora's person. Miller commented, \"We just get a lot of stuff being moved around, this is a major interstate,\" to which Flora responded, in audible part, \"Yeah, no problem.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:00:47-14:00:51). Miller again stated, \"I'm going to run my dog around your car real quick.\" Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:00:51-14:00:54). Miller asked Flora about his customer, and the two briefly conversed about Flora's business. For a third time, Miller informed Flora that he was going to run Francesco around Flora's car, stating \"Just stay right there and I'm going to move him around.\" Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:01:15-14:01:18). Flora at no point objected to Miller performing the dog sniff. Miller then walked Francesco along Flora's car. Francesco alerted by\n   sitting outside the rental car's trunk. Flora acknowledges that Francesco alerted but alleges that Miller triggered the alert by gesticulating wildly and pulling something from behind his back to show Francesco when the dog approached the rear bumper. Miller's unredacted patrol car video shows that Miller looped Francesco twice in a circle around his body, that Miller moved his arms in an ambiguous fashion as he walked Francesco counterclockwise around Flora's rental car, and that, after Francesco sat behind the car's trunk, Miller reached behind his back and presented something to the dog. Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:01:35-14:02:05). The trunk was later revealed to be empty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miller allowed Flora to get back into his vehicle and placed Francesco in his patrol car. Miller retrieved Flora's documents and warning memorandum and returned to Flora's vehicle. Flora alleges that, for a second time, Miller asked if he had anything illegal in his car, which Flora denied. Miller then handed Flora his documents and requested Flora's consent to search the vehicle. Flora refused to consent to the interior search. Miller informed Flora that Francesco had alerted to drugs and that he had probable cause to search Flora's vehicle. Flora exited the vehicle, and Miller began his interior search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Miller began searching the passenger compartment, he asked Flora if there was a large amount of cash in the car. Flora acknowledged there was a large amount of cash in the backseat. Flora alleges that he told Miller the cash would be used to purchase a customer list from his Omaha client. Miller's search revealed $120,090 in U.S. currency, bundled together with rubber bands, packaged in vacuum-sealed bags, wrapped in several grocery bags, and placed inside an Igloo-brand cooler. Flora alleges that the roadside search revealed no contraband, and Miller's incident report does not indicate such a discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Flora's Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After locating the currency, Miller requested backup from Pottawattamie County Deputy Sheriff Eric Shea, who arrived on the scene at approximately 2:10 p.m. Miller then returned to his patrol car and telephoned Sudmann. Sudmann prosecutes civil asset forfeiture cases in Pottawattamie County and provides legal advice to officers in the field on civil forfeiture. Miller told Sudmann that Flora was driving a rental car that cost in excess of $1500 for a two-day trip from Cedar Rapids to Huntington Beach. Miller relayed that he had located a large amount of cash in Flora's rental car, which he believed was packaged as if it was drug related, though Flora was adamant that the money was related to his business and otherwise refused to answer questions about the cash. Miller also told Sudmann that Flora said he was meeting a client off the interstate in Omaha, that Miller's drug dog alerted, and that Flora had refused to consent to a search of his car. Pl's App. 106, ECF No. 70-3 (Unredacted Miller Patrol Car Video 14:27:50-14:30:20). Sudmann advised Miller that he could seize Flora's cash and vehicle and to transport them to the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Office (PCSO).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the call with Sudmann, Miller advised Flora that he was \"detaining Flora and Flora's vehicle for an expanded search of the vehicle.\" Defs' SUF \u00b6 37, ECF No. 22-1; Pl's RSUF \u00b6 37, ECF No. 70-1. Miller then read Flora his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Flora refused to answer any questions and requested an attorney. Miller instructed Flora to wait with Deputy Shea while Miller again telephoned Sudmann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Seizure of Flora's Cash\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At approximately 2:36 p.m., Task Force Officers Ken McClure and Bob Christensen arrived at the scene. Together, the officers transported Flora and Flora's vehicle to the PCSO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the officers conducted a more thorough search of Flora's car. Miller stated that, during this search, he found a small amount of a green, leafy substance, which tested positive for marijuana in a field-testing kit before he threw the test kit away.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller stated that he also disposed of the substance tested by the kit. Flora alleges that no photographs were taken of the marijuana or positive test kit, and the record contains no photographs of the kit or the supposed contraband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Flora refused to answer additional questions about the packaged cash, Miller determined that Flora was engaged in criminal activity and that the seized money was forfeitable, and Flora was given a \"Notice of Seizure of Property for Forfeiture Under Iowa Law.\" Defs' SUF \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, ECF No. 22-1; Pl's RSUF \u00b6 49, ECF No. 70-1. Flora alleges that no marijuana or other illegal substance was ever in his rental vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Task Force is an interdepartmental agency made up of individuals from various law enforcement agencies in southwest Iowa, including the Council Bluffs Police Department and the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Department. The Task Force conducts drug law investigations, enforcement, and prosecution efforts. The Task Force is the agency responsible for conducting civil asset forfeiture investigations, including deposits and distributions. Decisions on whether to pursue civil forfeiture are made jointly by the Task Force Board of Directors and the county attorney responsible for prosecuting the forfeiture case. In the event of a successful prosecution of a forfeiture action initiated by a Task Force member, the initial distribution is as follows: 10% to the State of Iowa, 20% to the county attorney, and the balance retained by the Task Force. A secondary distribution schedule is followed with respect to the balance retained by the Task Force if, at any time, the Task Force Unit Supervisor determines that the forfeited funds available to the Task Force become \"excessive\": 60% of the Task Force balance to the Council Bluffs Police\n   Department, 20% to the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Department, 10% to the Mills County Sheriff's Department, and 10% to the Department of Narcotics Enforcement. Flora alleges that the PCAO has a drug forfeiture fund with a balance that can exceed $1 million, which is used to pay for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , office products and equipment, credit card and cell phone bills, attorney travel and training, and CLE registration fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Civil Forfeiture Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 3 and 4, 2015, respectively, Flora filed a demand for a probable cause hearing and Sudmann filed an In Rem Forfeiture Complaint in the Iowa District Court for Pottawattamie County, pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 809A. Meanwhile, on September 24, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued a Writ of Execution against Flora pursuant to a $148,310 unsatisfied judgment the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) obtained against Flora for violating the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA). Sudmann filed a motion to determine the disposition of Flora's cash based on the federal writ. The Pottawattamie County District Court interpreted Sudmann's motion as a motion to dismiss the forfeiture complaint. There was no final adjudication on the merits of the In Rem action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction under Iowa Code \u00a7 809A.7, the Pottawattamie County District Court dismissed the forfeiture action and directed that Flora's cash be returned to him no later than October 23, 2015, in the presence of U.S. Marshals. On October 20, 2015, U.S. Marshals served the FTC's writ on the Task Force. Task Force officers Christensen and Bob Brietzke met U.S. Marshals at the U.S. Bank in Council Bluffs where the money was located and delivered a cashier's check made payable to the U.S. Treasury in the amount of $120,090. Flora alleges that Sudmann coordinated with FTC officials to execute on the funds before Flora could reacquire his cash. On January 1, 2016, Flora filed an affidavit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, formally waiving his right to request a hearing on, or claim an exemption to, the FTC's execution on his money and waiving any objection to his counsel satisfying an attorney's lien held against the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Section 1983 Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Flora filed this action alleging six claims against Defendants. Flora's action comprises five claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and a supplemental state law claim for conversion. Count I alleges that Miller violated Flora's Fourth Amendment rights by unreasonably seizing Flora and searching Flora's car. Count II alleges that Miller, Sudmann, and the PCAO violated Flora's Fourth Amendment rights by falsely arresting Flora. Count III alleges that Defendants violated Flora's Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully seizing $120,090 in U.S. currency from Flora. Count IV alleges that Defendants violated Flora's due process rights based on improper financial motivation in seizing Flora's property for civil forfeiture. Count V alleges a facial due process challenge against Iowa Code \u00a7 809A.17, a provision of Iowa's civil forfeiture law that allows for forfeiture share agreements between law enforcement and county attorneys. Count VI alleges that Defendants are liable for conversion for failing to return Flora's $120,090 pursuant to a court order. Flora seeks compensatory damages against all Defendants, punitive damages against Miller and Sudmann, and injunctive relief. Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The court reasoned that despite the officer's inexperience issuing speeding citations, lack of use of speed radar equipment, late night timing of the stop, and speed estimate that was 15 to 20 miles-per-hour greater than the driver's actual speed, the totality of the circumstances at the time of the stop supported the reasonableness of the officer's belief that the defendant was speeding \"at all.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232703\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/866/#p868\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232703\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/866/#p868\">\n    at 869-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Flora alleges that he had engaged cruise control at 70 miles-per-hour, the speed limit through the relevant section of Interstate 80, at the time Miller observed and stopped him. Flora submits that Miller's speed radar equipment was never engaged during his pursuit of Flora, and in fact, Miller's patrol car video does not show a radar reading for Flora's car. Flora also disputes Miller's contention that he clocked Flora before initiating his radar recording equipment. However, Flora acknowledges that Miller observed his car while Miller was parked and facing westbound traffic. At no point in either his brief or record materials does Flora contest the notion that Miller, at minimum, visually estimated Flora's speed; he merely contests Miller's use of equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Flora as the Court must, Miller's traffic stop of Flora did not violate clearly established law. Miller, at the least, visually estimated Flora to be traveling 4 miles-per-hour over the speed limit. Additional factors bolstered Miller's visual estimate. The parties agree that Miller was facing westbound traffic at the same time and in the same area as Flora when Flora passed him, and Miller's unredacted patrol car video shows that the weather was clear at the time of the stop. Moreover, the record contains no evidence regarding the proper and accurate operation of the cruise control in Flora's rental car such that, even if set at 70 miles-per-hour, cruise control would have precluded a greater speed of just a few miles-per-hour. Even if Flora's cruise control had kept Flora's speed within the 70 miles-per-hour posted speed limit, Miller was entitled to make a \"reasonable but mistaken judgment[ ]\" so long as his determination that Flora was speeding was not \"plainly incompetent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blazek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151893\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/920/#p922\">\n    761 F.3d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stanton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701993,12583108\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/3/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   5 ).

Defendants cite the currency's suspicious packaging, Francesco's discretionary alert to the cash at the PCSO, and Miller's discovery of a green, leafy substance in Flora's rental car, which tested positive for marijuana. Flora alleges that there was no positive drug test, as the record contains no picture of the kit or evidence of the green, leafy substance that Miller claims to have discovered during his search of Flora's car. Flora disputes Miller's account of the discretionary sniff test\n   at the PCSO, which is not visible in either Miller or Deputy Shea's patrol car videos. Flora contends that vacuum-sealed cash alone could not support probable cause for seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Though Flora correctly highlights several disputed issues of fact-the reliability of Francesco's roadside alert, the circumstances of the officers' discretionary station house sniff test, and the existence of a positive drug test-these are not\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   to Flora's unreasonable seizure claim. The Court's probable cause analysis for Miller's warrantless arrest of Flora is identical to the probable cause analysis for Miller's warrantless seizure of Flora's property pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 809A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained above, Miller had probable cause to believe that Flora was engaged in drug trafficking. Miller discovered a large sum of cash that was suspiciously packaged, and Flora presented a suspicious travel itinerary. Although an undisputed drug dog alert and a positive drug test would have provided additional indicia supporting probable cause, such indicia were not necessary given the weight of the remaining evidence. Miller had probable cause to believe Flora's cash was forfeitable contraband under Iowa Code \u00a7 809A, and the seizure occurred on the interstate, a public place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133490\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/559/#p565\">\n    526 U.S. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133490\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/559/#p565\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Miller did not violate Flora's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures. Miller is entitled to summary judgment on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sudmann\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants argue that Sudmann is entitled to summary judgment on Count III because Sudmann's advice to Miller to seize Flora's cash did not violate Flora's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures, as Sudmann relied on facts from which a reasonable person could conclude that Flora's money was used in or derived from drug trafficking. They further argue that Sudmann is entitled to absolute immunity for refusing Flora's demand that the money be returned because Sudmann was advocating on behalf of the State in a pending probable cause hearing. Flora argues that Sudmann's advice was not intimately associated with the judicial process. Flora further argues that Sudmann is not entitled to qualified immunity because her advice to seize the cash without probable cause violated Flora's clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The same law regarding a prosecutor's entitlement to qualified or absolute immunity that is discussed above in Count II applies here. After Miller informed Sudmann of the additional evidence that Miller allegedly discovered at the station house, Sudmann determined that Flora's cash should be seized for civil forfeiture pursuant to Iowa Code \u00a7 809A. This reflected both a decision on which type of lawsuit to file and the initiation of a civil forfeiture prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/#p424\">\n    424 U.S. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/#p424\">\n    96 S.Ct. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity when \"deciding which suits to bring\");\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140579\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/327/762/#p768\">\n    327 F.3d at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity\n   for the \"initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecution\"). Thus, Sudmann is entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability for the seizure of Flora's cash and to summary judgment on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Task Force and PCAO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendants argue that the Task Force and PCAO are entitled to summary judgment on Count III because there is no underlying liability against a government official (either Miller or Sudmann, respectively). They argue that, regardless, the Task Force is entitled to qualified immunity for relying on Sudmann's legal advice to continue seizing Flora's cash. Flora failed to resist the Task Force and PCAO on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As with Flora's false arrest claim, municipal liability does not attach unless the Task Force and PCAO maintained a municipal policy which itself violated federal law or a facially lawful municipal action led Miller and Sudmann to violate Flora's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seymour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550681\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/790/#p800\">\n    519 F.3d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Flora has not identified a Task Force or PCAO policy which itself violates the Fourth Amendment or directs an employee to do so, nor has individual liability been found for the seizure of Flora's cash. Therefore, no municipal liability can be attached, and the Task Force and PCAO are entitled to summary judgment on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Due Process Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Count IV alleges that Defendants violated Flora's due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Because Defendants had a financial incentive to seize and retain Flora's cash, Flora argues, Defendants acted with unconstitutional bias in stopping Flora, seizing his assets, and deeming them subject to forfeiture.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count V asserts a facial challenge against, and seeks enjoinment of, Iowa Code \u00a7 809A.17, which allows for entities like the Task Force and PCAO to share in the proceeds of civil forfeiture. Flora argues that this statute violates due process by incentivizing local law enforcement to indiscriminately seize property for forfeiture. Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Count IV because the Task Force/PCAO forfeiture share agreement does not create unconstitutional incentives. Defendants further argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on Count V, as \u00a7 809A.17 allows for forfeiture share agreements that do not offend due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Count IV: Improper Financial Incentive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendants argue that none of them have the personal authority to render a final disposition of Flora's seized assets; rather, it is the sole prerogative of Iowa district courts. Defendants also assert that forfeited assets are divided according to official capacity. Flora responds that unconstitutional bias is pervasive in Pottawattamie County because of the built-in financial incentives of the forfeiture share agreement between the Task Force and PCAO. He argues that, though prosecutors are accorded deference with respect to legislative schemes that provide incentives to secure civil penalties, such deference is not absolute.

The structure of the Task Force/PCAO civil forfeiture agreement is such that, with successful prosecutions of forfeitures not deemed excessive, the Task Force and PCAO are guaranteed to profit economically as penalties will flow to their offices.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    446 U.S. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181682\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/238/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Flora's conversion claim turns on the ultimate disposition of his cash once the State's civil forfeiture action was dismissed. On September 24, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued a Writ of Execution against Flora, pursuant to a $148,310 judgment delivered against Flora on November 25, 2013. On September 30, 2015, U.S. Marshals served a copy of the writ on Task Force officer Christensen. The PCAO advised Christensen that Flora's property was in the legal custody of the Iowa District Court for Pottawattamie County, and thus, subject only to the orders and decrees of the Iowa court. On October 5, 2015, the State moved to determine disposition of property-a motion that was construed by the Pottawattamie County District Court as a request by the State to dismiss the action and dispose of the property pursuant to the federal writ. On October 6, 2015, Pottawattamie County District Judge Mark Eveloff dismissed the civil forfeiture proceeding against Flora and directed that Flora's seized property be returned to Flora \"in the presence of U.S. Marshals to ensure compliance with valid federal process (such as a Writ of Execution) ... by no later than October 23, 2015.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs' App. 82, ECF No. 22-2. Rather than the cash being returned to Flora, U.S. Marshals served the writ on the Task Force. On October 20, Task Force officers Christensen and Brietzke met U.S. Marshals at the U.S. Bank in\n   Council Bluffs where the money was located and delivered a cashier's check to the U.S. Treasury for the sum of $120,090. Flora alleges that Defendants violated the court order by turning over the seized cash to the FTC instead of Flora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Though Flora's conversion allegation charges \"Defendants,\" he has presented no evidence suggesting that Miller or the PCAO took individual or municipal action, respectively, to violate the October 6, 2015 court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Flora alleges that Sudmann orchestrated the writ's execution through correspondence with FTC officials during the pendency of the forfeiture proceeding. This charge is unavailing. For one, Sudmann's emails regarding the FTC writ were sent prior to the court order, and thus, her conduct cannot be regarded as flouting the order. Moreover, Sudmann expressed reservation about U.S. Marshals seizing Flora's assets directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Similarly unavailing is Flora's charge against the Task Force. Flora did not suffer a substantial interference with his \"right of control.\" The Iowa district court ordered that Flora's cash be returned \"in the presence of U.S. Marshals\" to ensure that the Marshals could immediately execute upon the FTC writ. Defs' App. 82, ECF No. 22-2. There was no \"harm done to the chattel,\" and Flora was not caused significant \"inconvenience and expense\" given that his repossession of the cash would have been fleeting. The Court is similarly unable to construe Christensen and Brietzke's bank transfer as the \"civil equivalent\" of theft, given that neither the Task Force nor these officers retained any of Flora's cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   There is no issue of material fact relating to Flora's conversion claim against Defendants, and thus, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as to Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
