Although the defendant initially disclosed some documents in response to the individual plaintiffs' FOIA requests,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 12, it withheld in full the assessments prepared in each of the individual plaintiffs' cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am.

Consequently, the plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that \"the first several paragraphs\" of each assessment were reasonably segregable and that the defendant's failure to release those paragraphs violated the FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2015, the defendant initially moved for summary judgment as to the individual plaintiffs' claims regarding their requests for production of their asylum assessments, asserting that it had properly withheld the assessments in their entirety pursuant to Exemption 5 of the FOIA, in particular, the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 1st Summ. J. Mem. at 7. In support of its position, the defendant relied on a declaration from Jill A.

Second, the defendant's representation that it conducted a \"line-by-line examination\" of each of the assessments to determine whether any portions were reasonably segregable, Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 20, is seemingly undermined by what appears to be the defendant's blanket policy not to release any portion of an assessment, irrespective of its contents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The plaintiffs argue that the defendant's disclosure of \"the first few sentences\" of each assessment does not satisfy the defendant's obligations to release all reasonably segregable information, and that \"the first several paragraphs [of each assessment] should be released,\" specifically, \"the first three parts of an assessment [which contain sections regarding the applicant's] biography, basis of claim, and testimony.\" Pls.'

As the Court explained in its prior Memorandum Opinion, the\n   <em>\n    Abtew\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gosen\n   </em>\n   courts reviewed assessments to refer\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and either concluded or strongly suggested that the defendant could reasonably segregate several introductory paragraphs from the assessments, including paragraphs that \"recite and summarize the facts that [the] plaintiff presented to the [asylum officer] during his asylum application interview.\"\n   <em>\n    Abtew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5738968\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/47/98/\">\n    47 F.Supp.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ordering the defendant to release the first six paragraphs of the assessment);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gosen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359397\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/232/\">\n    118 F.Supp.3d at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the government to reassess its segregability determination as to \"factual introductory information\" and \"a paragraph that is (mostly) just a chronological list of what the applicant testified\"). And since this Court issued its Memorandum Opinion, a third member of this Court has also reviewed an assessment\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and similarly concluded that the defendant could reasonably segregate several introductory paragraphs, including paragraphs that \"recit[e] and summar[ize] [the plaintiff's asylum] application.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264938\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/165/#p174\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   177 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264938\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/165/#p174\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264938\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/165/#p174\">\n    at 176-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ordering the defendant to release \"the first eight paragraphs\" of the assessment). Here, by contrast, the defendant has released only the first one or two paragraphs in each assessment, which contain a limited set of facts, such as the plaintiff's age, citizenship, immigration status, date and location of entry into the United States, and information regarding the logistics of a plaintiff's asylum interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

C (Portions of Assessment of Ms. Lemus Miranda, Released on June 9, 2017) (releasing limited additional information regarding the basis for plaintiff Lemus Miranda's asylum application). The defendant has not released any paragraphs summarizing the content of a plaintiff's testimony during an asylum application interview or the factual content of a plaintiff' asylum application supporting the plaintiff's asylum claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The supplemental Eggleston declarations fail to adequately explain why the defendant has not disclosed the additional factual paragraphs that the\n   <em>\n    Abtew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gosen\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bayala\n   </em>\n   courts determined could be released. Specifically, they lack sufficient detail to allow the Court to determine whether the assessments at issue here even contain such additional factual paragraphs, and if so, whether the defendant is correct that those paragraphs are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Although the declarations have provided an individual description of each of the eight assessments at issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 12; 3d Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 6, these descriptions are largely identical and fail to describe the factual content being withheld with any level of specificity. For seven of the eight assessments, Eggleston merely asserts that each assessment contains an \"introduction,\" \"analysis,\" and \"conclusion/recommendation\" section, and describes the factual content in each section as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [t]he introduction section is not a verbatim transcript of information provided by [the] plaintiff[ ] but reflects a selective recording of information the USCIS asylum officer deemed particularly pertinent to [the] plaintiff['s] request for asylum and, therefore, focused specifically on select information. Likewise, the factual distillation noted in the analysis section does not purport to be a verbatim transcript of the plaintiff['s] asylum interviews but only reflects selective information pertinent to the asylum officer's deliberative process. Finally, the conclusion/recommendation section, and any facts included therein, does not include a list of all facts raised by the plaintiff but is a direct reflection of the selected information used during the asylum officer's deliberative process to highlight[ ] those facts most relevant to the officer's conclusion/recommendation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 12. These descriptions largely reiterate the language used in the categorical description that the Court previously rejected.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 17,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Supp. Eggleston Decl. \u00b6 12. Further, they provide little to no information about the type or origin of the factual content in each section, or the length or structure of each section.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, the plaintiffs have submitted evidence, some of which the defendant relies on in its briefing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 11-12, suggesting that all assessments follow a \"standard format\" and therefore, the assessments at issue here likely contain the same factual paragraphs that the courts in\n   <em>\n    Abtew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gosen\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bayala\n   </em>\n   determined could be released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Their Motion for Class Certification, Ex. 1 (Declaration of David L.

More importantly, this statement fails to provide the Court with any basis upon which to conclude that the factual content in the assessments at issue here is different from the factual content that the\n   <em>\n    Abtew\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gosen\n   </em>\n   (and now\n   <em>\n    Bayala\n   </em>\n   ) courts determined could be segregated and disclosed.
