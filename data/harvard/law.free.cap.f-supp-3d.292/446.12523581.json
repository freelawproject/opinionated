Compl. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Roseberry-Andrews alleges that she was harmed in a number of ways while serving at the DCMA. Broadly speaking, her allegations fall into two categories. First, Roseberry-Andrews alleges that two of her active-duty orders should have been medically extended due to an ankle injury that she suffered, which would have provided her various employment-related benefits. Second, she alleges that various Air Force personnel retaliated against her in a number of ways for claiming that certain Air Force personnel had engaged in improper conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Roseberry-Andrews' Ankle Injuries While Serving on Active-Duty Orders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Roseberry-Andrews injured her ankle twice while serving on active-duty orders. She was placed on active-duty orders from January 1, 2003, to May 28, 2004. AR 5. In August 2003, she fell while conducting agility and obedience training with a show dog, severely injuring her left ankle. Compl. \u00b6 39; AR 8. The injury was determined to be in the \"line of duty,\" meaning she was on active duty and did not act negligently or irresponsibly in causing it. Compl. \u00b6 40; AR 30-31. On March 25, 2004, Roseberry-Andrews underwent reconstructive ankle surgery. Compl. \u00b6 42.

Roseberry-Andrews argues that this Court is not divested of jurisdiction because she has \"petitioned this court to 'review' the Agency's decisions and remand her AFBCMR petition to the AFBCMR to properly correct her records.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 9. Of course, the mere fact that her complaint requests other types of relief-such as correction of her records-in addition to monetary relief does not help her.

That raises what appears to be a novel question in this Circuit: whether a request to\n   <em>\n    remand\n   </em>\n   for monetary relief-instead of seeking such relief directly from the Court-is a distinction that matters for purposes of determining whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction in light of the Tucker Act. Although it is a close case, the Court holds that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court reaches this conclusion because Roseberry-Andrews appears to seek to invoke the Court's authority to obtain relief (including monetary relief) by ordering the AFBCMR to provide it, rather than by merely instructing the AFBCMR to conduct further proceedings. The language in the complaint reflects as much, as she requests \"remand to the Board\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   the following relief,\" as opposed to merely for the consideration of that relief after further proceedings. Compl. \u00b6 232 (emphasis added). There is simply no other reason for her to have set forth the requested relief in such detail, other than to request that the Court ensure that she receives it from the AFBCMR. Thus, just as if she had requested the Court award her that relief directly, the monetary relief she requests here \"would ... flow directly from the exercise of the court's jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Motorola, Inc. v.

As a result, the Court concludes that it does not have subject matter jurisdiction over her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court's conclusion is bolstered by the contrast between this case and the line of cases holding that a district court retains jurisdiction when any monetary relief would come from \"subsequent administrative proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Smalls\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561466,5252831\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/186/\">\n    471 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   190 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tootle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2840822,3455839\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/167/\">\n    446 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   175 ;\n   <em>\n    Remmie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285609\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/108/#p114\">\n    898 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   117-18 ;\n   <em>\n    Calloway v.
