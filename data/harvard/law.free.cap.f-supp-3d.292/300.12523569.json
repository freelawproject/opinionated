That child, Z.B., is currently attending the nonpublic Kingsbury Day School, but District of Columbia Public Schools (\"DCPS\") has determined that the proper location of service to implement Z.B.'s Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\") is another nonpublic school, Kennedy Krieger. Plaintiff has filed this lawsuit seeking an order that Z.B. remain at Kingsbury Day School at public expense. After filing suit, Plaintiff filed the currently pending [9] Motion for Preliminary Injunction to Compel Stay-Put under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"). In summary form, Plaintiff's motion seeks to take advantage of a provision of the IDEA which allows a child with disabilities, under certain circumstances, to remain in his or her current educational placement while the appropriateness of a proposed change is litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the administrative record, the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the relevant\n   authorities, the Court determines that Plaintiff is not entitled to a stay-put injunction because the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, ECF No. 13 (\"Defs.' Opp'n\"); Plaintiff is not challenging a fundamental change to Z.B.'s current educational placement.

Both are nonpublic schools at which Z.B. would receive speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral support services and physical therapy services outside of the general education setting.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR287\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR304. The record before the Court contains testimony from Kennedy Krieger officials and the determination of the Hearing Officer that Kennedy Krieger is able to implement Z.B.'s current IEP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR12 (finding that Kennedy Krieger \"can provide the services listed on [Z.B.'s] IEP\"); AR16 (same); AR901 (testimony from Kennedy Krieger official that the school can implement Z.B.'s IEP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, the Court is not convinced that the proposed change of schools constitutes a change in educational placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff is correct that the educational services that Z.B. is intended to receive at Kingsbury Day School (which are reflected on his IEP) are not\n   <em>\n    exactly\n   </em>\n   the same as those Z.B. would receive at Kennedy Krieger. Primarily, Plaintiff's complaint about Kennedy Krieger is that it has a one-month longer school year (and therefore a shorter summer vacation) and a slightly shorter bell schedule than Kingsbury Day School. These differences between the schools are not fundamental enough to allow Plaintiff to invoke the \"stay-put\" provision. The schools simply take a slightly different approach to scheduling: While it is true that Kennedy Krieger's bell schedule (30 hours per week) is two hours shorter than Kingsbury Day School's (32 hours per week), this difference is due to the fact that Kennedy Krieger's school year (11 months) is longer than Kingsbury Day School's school year (10 months). AR12-13, 15. Kennedy Krieger apparently believes that its students benefit from this schedule adjustment because they \"need a great deal of support and maintaining their structure is important for them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Hearing Officer determined, and the Court preliminarily agrees, that the fact that the \"schools structure their weeks differently, resulting in a different bell schedule,\" represents only a \"minor discrepancy in services.\" AR15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Relatedly, Plaintiff argues that a stay-put injunction is warranted here because at Kennedy Krieger Z.B. would receive slightly fewer weekly hours of \"specialized instruction\" during the school year than the amount listed on his IEP. This change is merely derivative of the differences in the school's bell schedules that the Court has already discussed above, and determined does not constitute a fundamental change to Z.B.'s educational placement. \"Specialized instruction\" in this context apparently\n   refers to the instruction Z.B. receives at all times during the school day except when Z.B. is receiving particular services required by his IEP (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech-language pathology and behavioral support services). AR1101-03. The number of \"specialized instruction\" hours on Z.B.'s IEP was derived by simply subtracting the time set for those specific types of services Z.B. was determined to need from the total bell schedule of Z.B.'s school (at that point, Kingsbury Day School).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The testimony in the record before the Court is that the difference in the bell schedules, and the resulting difference in \"specialized instruction\" hours, does not mean that Kennedy Krieger cannot fulfill Z.B.'s IEP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805787,593139\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/745/1577/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR12 (finding that Kennedy Krieger \"can provide the services listed on [Z.B.'s] IEP\"); AR16 (same); AR901 (testimony from Kennedy Krieger official that the school can implement Z.B.'s IEP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's concerns regarding the difficulty Z.B. might have transitioning between schools, and the extra distance Z.B. would have to travel to reach Kennedy Krieger-while by no means inconsequential-are not sufficient to demonstrate a \"fundamental\" change in Z.B.'s educational program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Plaintiff Sanchez concedes, she herself has sought to change Z.B.'s location of service from Kingsbury Day School in the past.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

A stay-put injunction is accordingly not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that DCPS's determination that Kennedy Krieger is the appropriate location of services for Z.B. constitutes a \"fundamental change\" to Z.B.'s \"then-current educational placement.\" Accordingly, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction to Compel Stay-Put. An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion, which sets forth dates for moving forward with this litigation. However, the Court encourages the parties to consider ways to work together to resolve this sensitive dispute without further litigation.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Mot. for Preliminary Injunction to Compel Stay-Put under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, ECF No. 9 (\"Pl.'s Mot.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Preliminary Injunction to Compel Stay-Put under\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Preliminary Injunction to Compel Stay-Put under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, ECF No. 15 (\"Pl.'s Reply\").\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Court has also reviewed the administrative record submitted by Defendants. In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument in this action would not be of assistance in rendering a decision.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    LCvR 7(f).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Plaintiff's claims under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act are not relevant to the currently-pending motion. Defendants have indicated that they intend to move to dismiss those claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Opp'n at 17 n.7. The parties shall meet and confer before any such motion is filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Accordingly, the Court has not focused on the arguments about the traditional four-part test in Defendants' opposition to Plaintiff's motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Opp'n at 16-18. Both parties agree that that test does not apply.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Opp'n at 17; Pl.'s Reply at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Without making any final ruling on the issue, it appears that, if anything, it is Kingsbury Day School that may have been having difficulty implementing Z.B.'s IEP recently.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR16 (citing \"the reasonable concerns DCPS continued to have about [Kingsbury Day School's] appropriateness to meet [Z.B.'s] needs\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877444\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/227/#p232\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (noting that an independent education consultant determined that Kingsbury Day School \"was not appropriate for\" Z.B.).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Plaintiff indicates that by regulation the IDEA requires that a child's placement be as close as possible to the child's home.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mot. at 14; Pl.'s Reply at 6. The Court views this argument as relating more to the merits of Plaintiff's complaint about the proposed change, not to whether a stay-put injunction is warranted because a fundamental change to Z.B.'s current educational placement has been proposed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
