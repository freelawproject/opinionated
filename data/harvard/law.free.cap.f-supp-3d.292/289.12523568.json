On April 29, 2016, Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey, to whom this matter had been referred for full case management, issued his Report and Recommendation. Judge Harvey recommended that the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") be affirmed. Thereafter, Callaway filed timely Objections to the Report and Recommendation pursuant to Local Civil Rule 72.3(b), and defendant, the Acting Commissioner of Social Security, filed a response. For the reasons set forth in the Report and Recommendation and those explained further below, the Court finds that the ALJ properly denied Callaway's claim. The Court accordingly adopts the Report and Recommendation, denies plaintiff's motion for judgment of reversal, and grants defendant's motion for judgment of affirmance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To qualify for disability benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (the \"Act\"), a claimant must establish that she is \"disabled.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Callaway's claims were denied initially on June 2, 2011, and again upon reconsideration on November 18, 2011. AR 161, 172. Callaway filed a timely request for a hearing on December 1, 2011, AR 175, and the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") held three hearings before an ALJ on March 8, 2012, September 26, 2012, and February 28, 2013, AR 40, 61, 140. On May 21, 2013, the ALJ denied Callaway's claim, finding she was not \"disabled\" under the Act. AR 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In performing the five-step evaluation process, the ALJ found (at steps one and two) that Callaway had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged disability onset date and that she had the following severe impairments: \"rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, disorders of the back, osteoarthritis of knees, headaches, obesity, fibromyalgia, and affective mood disorder.\" AR 24. At step three, the ALJ determined that Callaway did not have an impairment that met or equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. AR 25-27. And at step four, the ALJ found that Callaway was incapable of performing her past relevant work as a retail sales clerk, sales manager, or silent auction clerk. AR 33. Finally, after considering the entire record, the ALJ found that Callaway had the RFC to perform a range of sedentary work: she could occasionally lift or carry ten pounds; frequently lift or carry less than ten pounds; sit for a total of about six hours in an eight-hour workday; stand or walk about two hours in an eight-hour workday if allowed the option to change between sitting and standing for two minutes, once every half hour, at the workstation; frequently but not constantly engage in fine/gross manipulation; occasionally stoop, crouch, crawl, and kneel; and understand, remember, and carry out detailed but not complex tasks. AR 27. Relying on testimony from a vocational expert, the ALJ determined that Callaway was capable of performing work in the national economy-for instance, as a personnel clerk, maintenance clerk, or freight shipment clerk-and hence that she was not disabled. AR 34-35. Callaway sought review of the ALJ's decision with the Appeals Council, which denied her request for review on August 29, 2014, making the ALJ's ruling the Commissioner's final decision.

Dr. Gonzalez-Fuentes rated Callaway's condition as significantly\n   worse than did Dr. Kapoor on several dimensions, including the level of stress Callaway could handle (\"low\" versus \"moderate\"), how often and for how long Callaway would need to move around during a workday (10 minutes every 30-60 minutes versus 5-10 minutes every hour), and how often Callaway would have to miss work (more than 3 times monthly versus 2-3 times monthly).

There is thus substantial evidence that contradicts the medical bases for Dr. Kapoor's and Dr. Gonzales-Fuentes's RFC estimates.

Pl.'s Objections to R &amp; R at 5. This objection does not warrant reversal, for two reasons. First, a review of the record clearly reveals that the ALJ's RFC determination was derived from the opinions of Dr. Sterling Moore, a rheumatologist called as a State medical expert. The ALJ's functional findings all tracked Dr. Moore's testimony, taking the lower-capacity end of any range Dr. Moore provided.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   AR 86 (statement of Dr. Moore) (opining that Callaway could lift and carry 10 pounds maximum and less than 10 pounds frequently, could walk for 2-4 hours per workday, could sit for 6 hours per workday, would need to change positions for 1-2 minutes every half hour; could not use ropes, ladders, or scaffolds, but could occasionally engage in other postural activities; and could engage in frequent gross or fine manipulation),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   AR 27 (opinion of ALJ) (finding that Callaway could lift and carry 10 pounds occasionally and less than 10 pounds frequently; could stand or walk for 2 hours in a workday; could sit for 6 hours in a workday; would need to change positions for 2 minutes every half hour; could occasionally stoop, crouch, crawl, or kneel; and could engage in frequent but not constant gross or fine manipulation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Callaway claims that the Court cannot rely on the obvious similarity between Dr. Moore's RFC determination and the ALJ's because \"the ALJ did not say\" that it relied on Dr. Moore's testimony.

Callaway quotes\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   somewhat out of context:\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   was discussing what evidence is required to reject a treating physician's opinion, not the evidence the ALJ then needs to put forward for his\n   RFC determination once he has shown why he has not followed the treating physician.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556744,6049673\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/350/\">\n    647 F.3d at 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    The treating physician rule\n   </em>\n   requires an explanation by the SSA, not the court.\" (emphasis added) ). Regardless, the connection between Dr. Moore's estimates and the ALJ's own are plain enough that little would be gained by remanding to the ALJ.

And indeed, the sitting and walking capabilities that the ALJ attributed to Callaway look rather like Dr. Kapoor's estimates, adjusted upward because of the more positive medical record and Dr. Kapoor's statement that Callaway was \"a very high functioning lady who is capable of doing work during her disease-free days.\" AR 442. Both Dr. Kapoor and the ALJ found that Callaway could stand or walk for two hours in an eight-hour workday, and the ALJ found that Callaway could sit for six hours a day as compared to Dr. Kapoor's five hours. AR 27, 440. The ALJ found that Callaway would need a sit/stand option for two minutes every half hour, or a total of four minutes per hour-slightly below the low end of Dr. Kapoor's estimate that five to ten minutes per hour would be necessary. AR 27, 440. The ALJ cited the mostly normal medical evidence in the record, and gave weight to the views of experts whose findings were consistent with that objective medical evidence-all of which counsels for a more optimistic RFC than those estimated by Callaway's treating physicians. AR 26-33. Hence, the ALJ met the SSA's narrative discussion requirements for ALJ RFC determinations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provided substantial evidence for a sedentary but non-disabled RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Credibility of Callaway's Statements\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Callaway next argues that the ALJ erred by assigning \"little probative weight\" to her statements about the severity of her impairments.

And by limiting Callaway to sedentary work with further restrictions on standing, sitting, carrying, and postural exertions, it is clear that the ALJ considered Callaway's statements and recognized that she had significant (but not extreme or disabling) work-related restrictions resulting from her impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 27, 33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 34 (\"[T]he claimant's additional limitations do not allow the claimant to perform the full range of sedentary work ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the ALJ properly applied the law in making his credibility determination.

The ALJ did not make this credibility determination by asking whether there was objective corroborating evidence for Callaway's claims of pain. Rather, he showed that Callaway's \"alleged functional limitations and restrictions due to ... pain [could not] reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence,\" and did so in a manner \"sufficiently specific to make clear to the individual and to any subsequent reviewers the weight the [ALJ] gave to [Callaway's] statements and reasons for that weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3720842,9298076\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/992/\">\n    353 F.3d at 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

The ALJ then concluded that Callaway's statements regarding the intensity and duration of symptoms were inconsistent with \"medical record signs, laboratory findings, [and] the medical record as a whole,\" and that her \"allegations of experiencing disabling pain and limitation, made under oath, are not corroborated in the overall record.\" AR 33. Judge Harvey thoroughly explained the evidence that the ALJ laid out in his opinion, and correctly determined that (1) the objective evidence showing no functional loss, (2) the opinions of Callaway's treating and consulting physicians, (3) Callaway's inconsistent statements about the intensity and duration of her pain, (4) Callaway's claims that she could engage in many activities of daily life, and (5) the evidence regarding the effects of treatment together provided substantial evidence for the ALJ's decision to \"consider[ ] but grant[ ] little probative weight\" to Callaway's testimony.
