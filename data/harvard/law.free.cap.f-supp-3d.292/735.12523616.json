BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Wright's Well Control Services, LLC (WWCS) and defendant Oceaneering International, Inc. (Oceaneering) both provide hydrate remediation services for the oil and gas industry. A hydrate is an ice-like solid that forms when water becomes mixed with oil and/or gas at high pressure and low temperature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hydrates can cause a pipeline to become blocked by \"hydrate plugs,\" resulting in a loss of production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties' Initial Hydrate Remediation Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2008, ATP Oil and Gas Corporation contracted with Oceaneering to remove hydrates from a pipeline (Canyon Express project).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, Oceaneering had a hydrate remediation skid designed to clear hydrate plugs in smaller tubing; Oceaneering had not yet used it on a pipeline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This hydrate remediation skid featured a low-volume pump, and was fitted onto and powered by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering successfully cleared some, but not all, of the hydrate plugs from ATP's pipeline in early 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering's hydrate remediation skid also suffered various problems because of the presence of gas in the system, such as reduction in pumping capability and formation of hydrates in tubing connected to the skid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering employees began discussing potential improvements to the hydrate remediation skid as early as February 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ATP then contracted with WWCS to conduct further hydrate remediation in ATP's pipeline (Kings Peak project), even though WWCS did not yet have a complete hydrate remediation system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS developed its hydrate remediation system specifically for high-volume, deepwater applications, like ATP's pipeline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS's system, later patented, used a pump with a much higher displacement rate than the pump used in Oceaneering's skid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This pump included a drill motor powered by pressurized seawater.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C435%2C185\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,435,185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ('185 Patent).

The Nondisclosure Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 11, 2009, WWCS and Oceaneering allegedly executed a Reciprocal Nondisclosure of Confidential and Proprietary Information Agreement (NDA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The NDA's introductory section states: \"It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement to exchange proprietary information. The disclosure and use of any proprietary data shall be governed in accordance with the following....\" Section One defines the \"information\" that is covered by the NDA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   For the purpose of this Agreement, confidential and proprietary information \"Information\" shall be defined as but not limited to, performance, sales, financial, contractual, and special marketing information, ideas, technical data, all intellectual property including inventions, patents, pending patents and all other business, technical and financial information that the Disclosing Party develops, learns or obtains during the period over which it is (or is supposed to be) providing services as contracted for between the parties that relate to Recipient Party or the business or demonstrably anticipated business of the Recipient Party, or that are received by or for Recipient Party in confidence and concepts originated by the Disclosing Party. Proprietary information is further defined as data not previously available to the Receiving Party or others without restriction, nor normally furnished to others without compensation, and which the Disclosing Party desires to protect against unrestricted disclosure or competitive use, and which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement and appropriately identified as being proprietary when furnished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Two provisions restrict a recipient's use of disclosed information. Section Two states: \"With respect to all proprietary information disclosed hereunder, the Recipient Party agrees that for a period of three (3) years following the date of this Agreement, unless terminated sooner by either party, such party shall not...[u]se such information except for purposes of its business relationship with the Disclosing party.\" Section Four provides: \"Neither party shall divulge or use any proprietary information disclosed to it hereunder by the other party for any purpose not connected with the effort contemplated by the Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section Six places limits on a recipient's duty to protect and handle information. It provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The obligation with respect to the protection and handling of proprietary information, as set forth in this Agreement, is not applicable to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   a) Information which is or becomes lawfully known or available to the receiving party without restriction from a source other than the Disclosing Party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   b) Information which is or later falls within, the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the recipient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   c) Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to others on a nonrestrictive basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. WWCS's Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   David Wright, who founded WWCS, and Jeffrey Dufrene filed Provisional Application No. 61/290,168 for their hydrate remediation system in December 2009, shortly after signing the NDA with Oceaneering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   This application specifically included the subsea separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright and Dufrene filed non-provisional Patent Application No. 12/978,486 for the separator on December 24, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   These patent applications were published on June 30, 2011.

The Parties' Working Relationship and Oceaneering's Alleged Misuse of WWCS's Confidential Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties worked together on the Kings Peak project for ATP in late 2009 and early 2010. While WWCS designed the hydrate remediation system itself and provided most of its components, Oceaneering provided support and project management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS's system successfully cleared the remaining hydrates in ATP's pipeline by March 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties worked together on several additional jobs using WWCS's system. Shortly after completing the Kings Peak project, WWCS and Oceaneering performed hydrate remediation for Williams Field Services Gulf Coast Company, L.P. (Williams job).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties later performed hydrate remediation for Marubeni Oil &amp; Gas (Marubeni job)\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and worked on another project for ATP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of\n   Oceaneering's working relationship with WWCS, Oceaneering had access to designs of WWCS's system and numerous operational details.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While the parties were working together on these jobs using WWCS's hydrate remediation system, Oceaneering was developing its own Flowline Remediation System (FRS). Oceaneering completed a draft functional specification of the FRS in January 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like WWCS's hydrate remediation system, Oceaneering's FRS was designed to pump high volumes of fluid through a separator.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering has performed hydrate remediation using the FRS on multiple jobs since 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   WWCS asserts that Oceaneering developed the FRS using confidential information disclosed under the NDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to WWCS, Oceaneering's FRS and separator rely on the technologies described in the '725 and '185 Patents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS further contends that Oceaneering benefitted from information about how WWCS's hydrate remediation system operates in practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Additionally, WWCS alleges that Oceaneering made false and misleading statements about WWCS to a potential client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS and Oceaneering both bid for a hydrate remediation job on a BP pipeline (Thunder Horse Restriction project).\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to WWCS, BP awarded the project to Oceaneering in July 2013 after Oceaneering used WWCS's designs without permission and maligned WWCS's safety record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On May 21, 2015, WWCS filed its initial complaint against Oceaneering, pleading patent infringement as well as various claims under Texas and Louisiana state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 16, 2015, the Court dismissed WWCS's breach of contract claim with prejudice to the extent that it rested on information in WWCS's patent applications or on conduct that occurred after December 11, 2012, and dismissed plaintiff's statutory trade secret misappropriation claim under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   After plaintiff filed a second and third amended complaint, Oceaneering moved to dismiss plaintiff's patent infringement claims. On February 13, 2017, the Court dismissed WWCS's patent claims, but without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On February 27, 2017, WWCS filed its fourth amended complaint, which is the operative complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint asserts patent infringement claims, as well as claims for Texas common law misappropriation, Texas common law misappropriation of trade secrets, Louisiana statutory misappropriation of trade secrets under the Louisiana Uniform Trade Secrets Act (LUTSA), and Texas common law breach of contract, breach of confidential relationship,\n   tortious interference with prospective business relations, fraudulent inducement, business disparagement, and unfair competition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 23, 2017, the Court dismissed WWCS's LUTSA claim and its claims for Texas common law misappropriation, Texas common law misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of confidential relationship, and business disparagement as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also dismissed WWCS's claim for unfair competition to the extent the claim is based on misappropriation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, on August 28, 2017, the Court dismissed WWCS's claim for infringement of the '185 Patent because Oceaneering had not used the FRS since the '185 Patent issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After the parties briefed the disputed claim language of the '725 Patent, the Court held a claim construction hearing on October 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman v.

Information in the Public Domain\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the Court has already held that the NDA does not cover any information in the public domain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court based this holding on Section Six, subsection (b), of the NDA, which states that \"[t]he obligation with respect to the protection and handling of proprietary information...is not applicable to...[i]nformation which is within or later falls within, the public domain without breach of this Agreement by the recipient.\" Because this provision uses prospective language, the Court held, the effect of an informational item falling into the public domain is that it was never protected by the NDA at all. This is so regardless of whether Oceaneering's alleged misuse occurred before the information became public. Thus, WWCS cannot base its breach of contract claim on misuse of information that has fallen within the public domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Most importantly, as the Court has already held,\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS cannot rely on allegedly confidential information that is contained within WWCS's patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tewari De-Ox Sys., Inc. v.

This information includes the use of a separator for hydrate remediation, structural details of WWCS's separator, the use of a drill motor powered by pressurized seawater, and the drawings reproduced in WWCS's patents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   '725 Patent ; '185 Patent. By the same logic, WWCS also cannot rely on allegedly confidential information contained within published articles or on internet sites. Such sources include a white paper authored by WWCS employee Fernando Hernandez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   two presentations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   and three magazine articles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, there is no genuine dispute\n   that Oceaneering did not breach the NDA by misusing information now in the public domain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Information Disclosed to Third Parties on an Unrestrictive Basis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, allegedly confidential information disclosed by WWCS to contractors and clients remains covered by the NDA. Oceaneering's argument to the contrary is based on Section Six, subsection (c), of the NDA, which excludes \"[i]nformation disclosed by the Disclosing Party [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , WWCS] to others on a nonrestrictive basis.\" Oceaneering contends that WWCS provided design and engineering information on a nonrestrictive basis to GCM, ATP, Keystone Engineering, and SRC Engineers during the development of WWCS's hydrate remediation system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering also argues that WWCS freely provided details about its system in presentations to potential clients, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp., ConocoPhillips Co., and BP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   WWCS contends that it did not provide information to these parties on a nonrestrictive basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In construing this provision of the NDA, the Court first looks to the plain meaning of the contractual language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kachina Pipeline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837658\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/471/445/#p450\">\n    471 S.W.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ordinary meaning of \"restrict\" is \"to confine within bounds,\" or \"to place under restrictions as to use or distribution.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster Dictionary\n   </em>\n   Online, www.merriam-webster.com. Thus, information disclosed on a nonrestrictive basis is information disclosed without any restrictions as to use or distribution. Furthermore, this provision of Section Six excludes information from the scope of the NDA only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the information is disclosed on an unrestrictive basis. While subsection (a) covers information that either is\n   <em>\n    or becomes\n   </em>\n   lawfully known to the receiving party, and subsection (b) covers information that either is within\n   <em>\n    or later falls within\n   </em>\n   the public domain, subsection (c) lacks any such prospective language. It simply excludes information disclosed to others on a nonrestrictive basis. Thus, unlike the provision of Section Six addressing information in the public domain, the provision addressing information disclosed to other parties on a nonrestrictive basis does not apply retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This exclusion has a clear parallel in trade secrets law: voluntary disclosure destroys secrecy, but \"an owner of a trade secret will not lose the secret by disclosure if he creates a duty in some manner and places that duty upon another not to disclose or use the secret.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

This duty need not be explicit. \"[A] voluntary disclosure made within the periphery of a confidential relationship,\" even without an express confidentiality agreement, does not destroy the secrecy of a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509492\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/623/#p630\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 631 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyde Corp. v.

Generally, the recipient of a trade secret owes the disclosing party a duty of confidence if \"the relationship between the parties to\n   the disclosure or the other facts surrounding the disclosure justify the conclusions that, at the time of the disclosure,\" the recipient \"knew or had reason to know that the disclosure was intended to be in confidence,\" and the disclosing party \"was reasonable in inferring that the person consented to an obligation of confidentiality.\" Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \u00a7 41 (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fifth Circuit precedent suggests that a duty of confidence may arise when trade secrets are disclosed to contractors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Metallurgical Industries Inc. v.

Accenture, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962190\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/823/555/\">\n    823 F.Supp.2d 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Tex. 2011), the plaintiff disclosed confidential documents \"to customers or potential customers in hopes of obtaining business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962190\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/823/555/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962190\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/823/555/\">\n    at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court regarded these disclosures as limited because they \"were made to further economic transactions and would not, by themselves, expose any substantive\n   information contained in the disclosed material to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962190\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/823/555/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, a jury would also be entitled to find that WWCS's disclosure of confidential information to customers and potential customers, such as ATP and Anadarko, was not on a nonrestrictive basis. Moreover, WWCS's presentations to potential clients were sent by email, and at least some of these email communications included a confidentiality notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, there are genuine disputes as to whether the NDA covers confidential information disclosed to WWCS's contractors and clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Information Disclosed to Oceaneering Before the NDA Was Executed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Third, the NDA may cover information disclosed by WWCS to Oceaneering before the execution of the NDA. As Oceanering points out, the NDA lacks an explicit provision granting retroactive protection. But the NDA defines confidential information as, among other things, various types of information that \"the Disclosing Party develops, learns or obtains during the period over which it is (or is supposed to be) providing services as contracted for between the parties that relate to Recipient Party or the business or demonstrably anticipated business of Recipient Party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   This definition covers confidential information developed by WWCS during the period when it was, or was supposed to be, providing services as contracted for between the parties-not simply during the term of the NDA.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Molina v. Air Starter Components, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 01-03-00175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201277491\">\n    2004 WL 1277491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Tex. App. June 10, 2004) (affirming trial court's holding that NDA, which applied to \"confidential information relating to or learned...by [employee] while in the employ of [employer],\" covered information disclosed before NDA was executed). Thus, there are genuine disputes as to whether the NDA covers information disclosed by WWCS before execution of the NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Oceaneering is not entitled summary judgment based on the grounds presented in its motion. But the Court does not rule on whether WWCS has introduced enough evidence to prevail on its breach of contract claim at trial. Neither side has proposed a construction of what\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   the NDA prohibits. And neither side adequately briefs WWCS's allegations of misuse. The Court declines to interpret the NDA's language in a vacuum, without sufficient context as to Oceaneering's alleged misconduct. If the parties again move for summary judgment on WWCS's breach of contract claim, they must: (1) specifically state what WWCS information is covered by the NDA (subject to the Court's interpretations in this order); (2) propose constructions of what type of conduct is prohibited by the NDA; and (3) specifically state what conduct by Oceaneering violated the NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fraudulent Inducement and Tortious Interference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Oceaneering argues that it is entitled summary judgment on WWCS's fraudulent inducement and tortious interference claims because these claims are predicated on WWCS's meritless breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oceaneering's argument fails because, as explained earlier, Oceaneering is not entitled summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Moreover, Oceaneering's breach of the NDA is not a necessary element of WWCS's fraudulent inducement and tortious interference claims. Fraudulent inducement requires the existence of an enforceable contract, but not the breach of that contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohnsack v. Varco, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049155\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/262/#p277\">\n    668 F.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (5th Cir. 2012) (listing the elements of a fraudulent inducement claim). And WWCS's tortious interference claim is based on false and misleading statements made by Oceaneering to potential clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Oceaneering is not entitled summary judgment on WWCS's fraudulent inducement and tortious interference claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, Oceaneering and Mancini request summary judgment on their counterclaims for attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   This request is moot in light of the Court's earlier dismissal of defendants' counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants may still move for attorney's fees under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54 within 14 days after entry of judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
