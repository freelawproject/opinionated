CREW has presented no argument finding fault with the search methodology described by DOJ. CREW nonetheless makes two arguments for why the results of DOJ's search merit denying summary judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-18\">\n      First, CREW claims that irregularities in the Attorney General's calendar for March 2, 2017, mean that DOJ's search\n     must have been inadequate.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      CREW Br. at 7-10. In particular, the calendars do not account for a press conference, held at 4:00 p.m. that day, in which the Attorney General announced his recusal.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 8; ECF No. 22 \u00b6 2. In addition, even though the Attorney General had reportedly met with advisors to discuss recusal earlier on March 2, the only such meeting on his calendar that day was at 5:15 p.m., after his press conference.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      CREW Br. at 3, 8; ECF No. 22 \u00b6 3. According to CREW, these irregularities are simply \"inexplicable\" because DOJ possesses a \"technology\" that makes its calendars \"easily modified with a single click.\" CREW Br. at 8. That technology-a computer program called Microsoft Outlook-means, in CREW's view, that it \"is simply not credible\" that the Attorney General's calendars \"are not updated as his schedule changes.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 9. CREW also notes that the Attorney General's calendar entries are \"permanent records\" that should have been preserved per DOJ retention policies.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      These facts, CREW claims, not only mean that DOJ conducted an inadequate search, but also raise the possibility that other entries on the Attorney General's calendar \"are incomplete, inaccurate, or were not corrected or updated in other ways.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 10.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      Second, CREW points to \"startling information\" that this lawsuit has uncovered: that \"no paper trail exists of what the attorney general has represented was a careful, deliberate decision.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 2. CREW complains that DOJ, after four months, \"ultimately produced only 11 pages of documents, nine of which it had located months earlier.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 11. Moreover, none of those documents contained advice given to the Attorney General about his possible recusal.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 10.

Unfortunately for CREW, courts have rejected such arguments time and time again. \"[T]he adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search.\"\n      <em>\n       Iturralde v.

And even as supposition, it cannot withstand scrutiny. It is hardly surprising that a busy day might turn out differently for a senior government official than was planned on his calendar. Nor is it unheard of that an official might receive sensitive advice orally rather than in writing. It is also of no consequence that DOJ took several months to process CREW's FOIA request. \"Courts routinely find that delays in responding to FOIA requests are not, in and of themselves, indicative of agency bad faith.\"\n      <em>\n       Skurow v. DHS\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276153\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/892/319/#p326\">\n       892 F.Supp.2d 319\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 326-27 (D.D.C. 2012).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-22\">\n      Finally, the relief that CREW seeks is telling. CREW asks the Court to \"order DOJ to conduct new searches,\" but provides no inkling of how those searches would differ from the ones that DOJ has\n     already undertaken. CREW Br. at 11. \"[A] requester's argument about the alleged inadequacy of a search is necessarily an argument for forward-looking relief. Therefore, what matters once the agency has fulfilled its burden under FOIA of conducting 'reasonably calculated' searches is whether the requester can identify any additional searches that must be conducted.\"\n      <em>\n       Hodge v. FBI\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3649387,3661438\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/575/\">\n       703 F.3d 575\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013). CREW apparently wants DOJ to keep tilling the same ground until it hits pay dirt. But there is no good reason to compel DOJ to undertake that Sisyphean task. Thus, DOJ's labors in this case are at an end.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-23\">\n      <strong>\n       IV.
