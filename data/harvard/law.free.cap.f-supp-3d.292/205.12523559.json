Plaintiff seeks $8,000,000 in damages from Progressive Insurance Co. and Progressive Corporation in an opaque Complaint that mentions wrongful death, negligence, and possible constitutional claims. The Progressive Defendants now move to dismiss, arguing that the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over them and that all causes of actions are barred by the relevant statutes of limitations. The Court, finding that Plaintiff lacks standing and that Defendants' arguments are sound, will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

She died less than two hours after the crash in a local hospital.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, Exh. A (Upshaw Exhibit) at 9. Plaintiff alleges that Alarcon, though not listed as a party to this action, operated his vehicle negligently at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 2. Although the Complaint never explains Progressive's role or indicates whether it insured either driver, Plaintiff's Opposition does allege that the company insured Alma Upshaw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 6 at 6. On May 26, 1995, Alarcon sued Alma Upshaw's estate and Alma Rae Upshaw Doleman, as executor of her mother's estate, alleging that the decedent's negligence had directly caused his own injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Upshaw Exh. at 2-5. The Complaint does not indicate the result of the Georgia tort action in Muscogee County Superior Court, but Plaintiff nonetheless included the pleading as part of the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now, 24 years later, Upshaw has filed this action against Progressive. He rests part of his claim for relief, however ambiguous, on the Georgia wrongful-death statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 2. Construing the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Complaint liberally, the Court also finds that Plaintiff alleges a claim for negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (seeking recovery for the \"death of a human being result[ing] from a crime or from criminal or other negligence\").

Upshaw's claim for relief concerns an alleged wrongful death that occurred in Georgia in 1993, and he fails to allege\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   relevant contact with the District of Columbia. Because the underlying activity has no connection with the District, Plaintiff cannot establish specific jurisdiction here. The Court must therefore dismiss on this ground as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if this Court had personal and subject-matter jurisdiction, Progressive contends that Plaintiff's wrongful-death, negligence, and constitutional claims are time-barred under both the Georgia and D.C. statutes of limitation. As the Court agrees, Upshaw would still come up short even if the merits questions could be reached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The D.C. Code prescribes a three-year limit to actions for negligence, wrongful death, and constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    D.C.

This period begins to run upon the time of the actual injury or, if subject to the discovery rule, when \"the plaintiff has knowledge of (or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have knowledge of) (1) the existence of the injury, (2) its cause in fact, and (3) some evidence of wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    Firestone v.

Both the actual injury and all three elements prescribed by the discovery rule were readily apparent on June 19, 1993, the day of the car accident. As Plaintiff offers no reason for any type of tolling, his claims are untimely under the District's statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Similarly, Upshaw's wrongful-death claim, as alleged under Georgia Code Section 51-4-5, and any suit for negligence under Georgia law are subject to a two-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ga. Code \u00a7 9-3-33. In Georgia, the statute of limitations \"begins running at the time the victim of the negligent or wrongful act suffers death or injury resulting from such acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanflik v.
