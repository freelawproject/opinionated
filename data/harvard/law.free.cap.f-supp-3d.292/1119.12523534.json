ONDA claims that these two decisions violate the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Act of 2000 (the Steens Act), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 460nnn - 460nnn-122 ; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201701\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 87 ; the Wilderness Act of 1964,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201131\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 36 ; and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 61.

Defendants are BLM; Brendan Cain, Burns District Manager, BLM; Rhonda Karges, Manager, Andrews Resource Area, BLM (I refer to these defendants collectively as BLM); and the IBLA. Harney County has intervened as a defendant, and asserts cross-claims against BLM under NEPA and the Steens Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, BLM issued the Travel Management Plan (TMP) decision at issue here. In 2008, ONDA appealed the TMP to the IBLA. In 2009, the IBLA affirmed the TMP decision almost in its entirety, reversing only the TMP's allowance of motorized traffic on Obscure Routes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ONDA then filed this action seeking judicial review of the IBLA's decision. In 2011, on cross-motions for summary judgment, I remanded the case to the IBLA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   for further proceedings on seven of the nine issues raised by ONDA.\n   <em>\n    Oregon Natural Desert Ass'n v.

In preparing the CRP, BLM reexamined the Obscure Routes and decided to close many of the Obscure Routes to motorized travel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ONDA now seeks judicial review of the 2014 IBLA decision and the 2015 CRP. For the following reasons, I conclude that the 2014 IBLA decision and BLM's 2015 CRP decision are supported by substantial evidence in the record, are not contrary to law, and are not arbitrary or capricious. I therefore deny ONDA's Motion for Summary Judgment and grant BLM's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. I deny Harney County's Motion for Summary Judgment.

I find that the IBLA comprehensively addressed the \"overriding factual issue\" of \"the accuracy and completeness of BLM's route inventory.\" IBLA Op. at 76. The IBLA concluded, \"Based on our careful review of the administrative record presented to the Court and as supplemented on judicial remand, we are persuaded that BLM's November 2007 [Decision Record] was based on a complete and accurate inventory of the 555 miles of routes designated as open to motorized vehicle use in the CMPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

ONDA also contends that BLM's Route Analysis Forms (RAFs) and post-decision declarations submitted during remand proceedings were incomplete because the RAFs covered only about 45 miles of the 121 miles of routes that ONDA had identified as being of concern, and did not address any Obscure Routes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ONDA also contends that the RAFs did not address whether the routes existed on the ground, and included almost no ground-based photographs. ONDA contends that BLM failed to address the thousands of photographs ONDA provided during the EA NEPA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to the Obscure Routes issue, ONDA contends that the IBLA's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   decision to reverse its prior decision and to reinstate Obscure Routes as open to motorized travel was arbitrary and capricious because no new evidence in the record supported that decision. ONDA also contends that the IBLA's reinstatement of the Obscure Routes violated the Steens Act's prohibition against driving cross-country and against establishing new roads in the CMPA, ONDA also attacks the IBLA Opinion's ruling that a route may exist as a matter of record, even if the route cannot be found on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. BLM's Route Inventory Was Reasonable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After considering ONDA's objections to the IBLA's affirmance of BLM's route inventory, I conclude that the IBLA's decision was not arbitrary or capricious. The IBLA reasonably concluded that BLM was not required to survey all possible routes on the ground, but instead could rely on \"other reliable evidence that can be used to determine the existence of a route, whether that evidence consists of aerial photographs taken of the land in question at or near the critical date, first-hand accounts by members of the public who visited the land in question at or around the critical time, or other appropriate evidence.\" IBLA Op. at 86-87 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The IBLA \"considered ONDA's ground-level geo-referenced photographs and aerial photographs of various routes,\" but noted that \"this evidence suffers from the fact that ONDA's documentation does not concern all the challenged routes, and even where it does concern such routes, the data is limited in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87-88. The IBLA stated that ONDA had provided \"only a few ground-level photographs for each of the challenged routes, and each of the photographs shows only a relatively short stretch of that route, i.e., the segment where the route is obscure to some degree.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 88.

I agree with BLM that even if the handbooks cited by ONDA required the exhaustive procedures ONDA advocates, the handbooks are not binding on BLM.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

In responding to ONDA's argument that routes may be visible in aerial photographs but difficult or impossible to follow on the ground, the IBLA ruled that the issue was not \"whether the routes at issue may be easily followed, only whether they exist. If they can be discerned from the air, we conclude that they exist.\" IBLA Op. at 87 n.31. The IBLA reasoned that the Steens Act gives BLM discretion to designate existing routes, and that the statute \"does not define what is meant by an existing route. It does not exclude routes that have become overgrown or otherwise naturally reclaimed, but whose line may be traced on the ground, or exclude routes that have been infrequently used in the past.\" IBLA Op. at 87 (footnote omitted). The IBLA's interpretation of the Steens Act as applied to the existence of a route is reasonable and entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The IBLA also ruled that the Steens Act does not exclude \"routes that exist only as a matter of record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11216161\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/864/#p868\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The IBLA stated that the Steens Act \"prohibit[s] any '\n   <em>\n    off road\n   </em>\n   ' motorized travel or the creation of any '\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   road or trail for motorized or mechanized vehicles,' except in limited circumstances.

The IBLA Opinion explained its reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   So long as a route existed as a matter of record, the fact that it has become overgrown or otherwise has been reclaimed by natural processes, which affects the degree to which it might be restored to full use by blading or other means, does not render it a new route or its use a \"\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   construction of new road.\" Nor does BLM's authorization of blading or other maintenance of a route that existed as the time of enactment of the Steens Act, either on the ground (although obscure) or as a matter of record (although apparently nonexistent), even where it dramatically improves the ability to follow the route on the landscape, constitute impermissible new construction. The use of any such route is not properly characterized as \"off-road\" within the meaning of the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IBLA Op. at 102 (citation omitted). I conclude that the IBLA's interpretation of the Steens Act's application to routes that exist only as a matter of record is entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The IBLA's opinion also resolved the ambiguity in the Steens Act's prohibition of off-road motorized travel, which I noted in the O &amp; O remanding this action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The Steens Act, however, contains a strange textual ambiguity. While [ 16 U.S.C.] \u00a7 460nnn-22(b)(1)(A) prohibits motorized \"off road\" travel, \u00a7 460nnn-22(b)(1)(B) permits motorized travel on \"roads and trails\" designated by the\n   transportation plan. Thus, in the same breath, the Steens Act bans motorized vehicles on anything but \"roads,\" yet permits motorized vehicles on \"trails.\" This inherent contradiction undercuts the IBLA's reasoning based on the definitions of Obscure Routes, and ONDA's proposed extension of that reasoning to Historical Routes. Even if a route characterized as a Historical Route is hard to locate on the ground and thus cannot be a \"road,\" it could potentially be a \"trail\" which BLM can designate for motorized travel under \u00a7 460nnn-22(b)(1)(B). It is not my role to harmonize these apparently contradictory provisions of the Steens Act or to conduct a judicial review of the IBLA's determination that opening Obscure Routes violated the Steens Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   O &amp; O at *14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On remand, the IBLA concluded that \"since the statute clearly meant to allow BLM to designate roads and trails as open to motorized travel, the prohibition against motorized off-road travel logically can only mean that motorized travel\n   <em>\n    that does not occur on either a road or a trail\n   </em>\n   is prohibited.\" IBLA Op. at 98 (footnote omitted). Based on this conclusion, the IBLA ruled that \"to the extent Obscure Routes constitute trails, their designation as open to motorized travel does not violate the statutory prohibition of motorized off-road travel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99. After resolving the statutory ambiguity, the IBLA concluded that it had erred in its previous opinion when it ruled that BLM had improperly designated Obscure Routes as open to motorized travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I find that the IBLA's decision on this issue is a reasonable interpretation of the Steens Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ONDA contends that regardless of whether BLM classifies a route as a \"road\" or \"trail,\" ONDA's photographs show that driving or mechanical maintenance on Obscure Routes \"will involve cross-country travel that crushes vegetation and establishes new roads.\" Pl.'s Reply-Response 28. BLM responds that most of the Obscure Routes ONDA challenges are classified as \"ways\" in the Wilderness Study Area, where mechanical maintenance is prohibited. BLM also notes that many routes in the CMPA are primitive and maintained \"by use more than equipment,\" so safety and use dictate the maintenance provided, and correcting drainage issues is the focus of primitive route maintenance. Defs.' Reply 5. The IBLA noted that although BLM is prohibited from authorizing the construction of new trails for motorized or mechanized use \"where a route never existed,\" BLM \"may authorize the use of trails for motorized or mechanized use where an exiting road has been naturally reclaimed to the point that it becomes an\n   <em>\n    existing trail.\n   </em>\n   \" IBLA Op. at 100-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ONDA also argues that the IBLA Opinion improperly affirmed BLM's authorization of motorized travel on about 9 miles of ATV routes. ONDA contends that these ATV routes \"will have to be mechanically reconstructed ... [because] [o]therwise even motorists on an ATV ... will have to drive around large rocks and eroded gullies-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , drive cross-country ....\" Pl.'s Reply-Response 28. The IBLA determined, however, that ATV routes \"are not routes that 'have been\n   <em>\n    destroyed\n   </em>\n   by landslides and natural erosion events,' \" but rather are \"routes that have been\n   <em>\n    affected\n   </em>\n   by landslides and natural erosion events to the point that they are no longer safe for full-sized vehicles.\" IBLA Op. at 102 (quoting ONDA's brief) (emphasis added by the IBLA). BLM states that ONDA's own photographs show the ATV routes on the ground, and argues that these existing ATV routes may be maintained to ensure safety and avoid undue harm. I find that BLM's designation of ATV routes as open\n   to motorized travel is reasonable and does not violate the Steens Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I conclude that the IBLA Opinion affirming BLM's inventory of routes is supported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary or capricious. I therefore affirm the IBLA's ruling that the TMP did not violate the Steens Act. I also conclude that the CRP does not violate the Steens Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

I stated in the O &amp; O, \"FLPMA requires BLM to manage the [Wilderness Study Areas] 'in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness, subject, however, to the continuation of existing mining and grazing uses and mineral leasing in the manner and degree in which the same was being conducted on October 21, 1976.' \" O &amp; O at *15 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I noted in the O &amp; O, \"While ONDA repeatedly objected to an extension of public motorized access, it conceded that continued motorized use by grazing permittees was proper, even if that use was not documented in BLM's late-1970's Wilderness EIS.\" O &amp; O at *16. Furthermore, I stated that \"[i]f indeed the TMP only allows grazing permittees to continue their pre-FLPMA access over what are now termed Historical Routes, I cannot see how those Historical Routes violate the FLPMA, especially since ONDA repeatedly conceded that 'recollected' historic use by permittees would not run afoul of the FLPMA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    at *16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ONDA argues that if a route has become \"overgrown-in effect, 'closed' by nature-then BLM cannot now designate it as open in the Steens Mountain travel plan.\" Pl.'s Mot. 39. BLM responds that accepting ONDA's position would in effect punish permittees who do not use an Historical Route frequently enough to keep it visible on the ground. I agree with BLM that closing overgrown Historical Routes would not be consistent with FLPMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ONDA also argues that BLM has not properly documented Historical Routes in Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). ONDA contends that BLM relied on inadequate evidence of grazing routes, such as the recollection of Dick Jenkins, a rancher, and reports submitted by Harney County. ONDA contends that BLM's Wilderness EIS does not disclose several \"pioneered routes\" that BLM now contends were in existence when FLPMA was enacted in 1976. However, as discussed above, I agree with the IBLA that BLM's inventory methods were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As to the 2015 Comprehensive Recreation Plan (CRP), ONDA argues that the CRP violates FLPMA's non-impairment provision because BLM did not close all of the Obscure Routes potentially reopened by IBLA's 2014 ruling. ONDA argues that these Obscure Routes have been \"naturally reclaimed\" and no longer exist on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   BLM responds that these routes are not open to the public, and will be used only by grazing permittees, landowners, and BLM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   and its contractors, and will be maintained only by the passage of vehicles, absent a site-specific NEPA analysis for safety or resource concerns. BLM argues that it is required to provide access for grandfathered grazing, and the Steens Act requires it to provide reasonable access to non-federal lands. I conclude that BLM may designate these routes as open for motorized travel so long as they are used only by grazing permittees and other authorized users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   ONDA also argues that the 2007 Travel Management Plan (TMP) violates a FLPMA regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%208342.1\">\n    43 C.F.R. \u00a7 8342.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)-(c), on minimizing impacts to soil, vegetation, wildlife, air, water, and cultural resources.

BLM also argues that ONDA's FLPMA minimization argument fails because the Steens Mountain Resource Management Plan (RMP) previously established off-road vehicle designations, and ONDA litigated and lost a minimization challenge against the RMP designations.\n   <em>\n    Shuford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201695162\">\n    2007 WL 1695162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14.I conclude that even if ONDA may bring a claim that was not included in the issues for remand, ONDA has not shown that it is entitled to prevail on the merits of its FLPMA minimization claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ONDA cites the potential of motorized travel on the designated routes to fragment sage-grouse habitat, and to cause the spread of noxious weeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   BLM responds that the EA's analysis of effects on wildlife, including the sage-grouse, was \"tiered\" to the 2007 EIS prepared with the Steens RMP, which discussed the potential fragmentation issue. The IBLA noted, \"BLM concluded, in its EA and DR, that designating the 555 miles of routes as open to motorized travel was not likely to significantly fragment wildlife habitat or otherwise adversely affect wildlife or wildlife habitat.\" IBLA Op. at 126. The IBLA also noted, \"While the motorized use of individual roads and trails will undoubtedly affect sage-grouse, we are not persuaded, given the distribution of roads throughout the 496, 136-acre CMPA, which generally provides year-long habitat, and the exclusion of motorized travel during most of the critical breeding season, that the TMP decision may cumulatively impact sage-grouse in a significant manner,\" IBLA Op. at 127, Conversely, the IBLA stated, \"If BLM were to close existing routes to motorized travel, this action would concentrate motor vehicle use on a smaller number of routes, potentially increasing impacts to sage-grouse and other aspects of the human environment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As I ruled when addressing a similar issue in\n   <em>\n    Oregon Natural Desert Ass'n v.

In\n   <em>\n    Cain\n   </em>\n   , I concluded that BLM had reasonably found that \"its [road] maintenance activities would not contribute to the spread of noxious weeds.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258522\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/17/1037/#p1056\">\n    17 F.Supp.3d at 1054-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The IBLA noted that ONDA has shown \"only a difference of professional opinion regarding likely impacts, which is not sufficient to establish a NEPA violation.\" IBLA Op. at 129. I agree that when specialists' views conflict,\n   the agency \"must have discretion to rely on the reasonable opinions of its own qualified expert even if, as an original matter, a court might find contrary views more persuasive.\"\n   <em>\n    Marsh v.

In this context, however, \"controversial\" \"refers to disputes over the size or effect of the action itself, not whether or how passionately people oppose it.\"\n   <em>\n    Wild Wilderness v.

BLM notes that \" 'many commenters asked the BLM to preserve the remaining vehicular routes.' \" Defs.' Reply 33 (quoting AR 798). I agree with BLM that the controversy over motorized travel does not rise to a level that would require BLM to prepare an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to the uncertainty factor, ONDA argues that the possible effects of BLM's travel plan are highly uncertain because BLM's inventory and methods are so unreliable. Because I have found that BLM did not act unreasonably in creating the route inventory, I disagree that the effects of the TMP and CRP are so uncertain as to require an EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Defense of Animals v.

Rather than authorizing a new activity with an uncertain effect, the TMP instead authorized a continuation of the use of already existing routes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IBLA Op. at 131 (in the EA, BLM \"expressly determined that the likely impacts of designating the routes as open to continued motorized travel was not likely to impact any aspect of the human environment in a highly uncertain manner, because they had been in existence for quite some time\"). I conclude that the IBLA reasonably determined that BLM was not required to prepare an EIS for the TMP based on significant impact, controversy, or uncertainty. For the same reasons, I conclude that BLM did not violate NEPA in deciding not to prepare an EIS for the CRP decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    V. BLM's and Harney County's Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   BLM and Harney County have filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Harney County's cross-claims against BLM under the Steens Act and NEPA. Harney County claims that BLM violated its duty under the Steens Act to consult with the advisory council and the public when deciding whether \"to permanently close an existing road in the [Cooperative Management and Protection Area (CMPA) ] or to restrict the access of motorized or mechanized vehicles on certain roads.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460nnn-22(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460nnn-51 (defining role of advisory council). Harney County objects to BLM's procedures leading up to the CRP decision to close some Obscure Routes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   BLM contends that it adequately consulted with Harney County about the closures, and Harney County lacks standing to raise this objection. Based on the record, I agree with BLM that it complied with the Steens Act and NEPA in the procedure it used to issue the CRP. Harney County has not shown it was unable to adequately consult on BLM's decision to\n   close some of the Obscure Routes. I need not address standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Motions to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
