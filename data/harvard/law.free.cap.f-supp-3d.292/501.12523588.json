Before the Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 17]. For the reasons that follow, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 7, 2017, President Donald J. Trump announced his intention to nominate Noel J. Francisco as Solicitor General of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part. Mot. for Summ. J. (\"MSJ\"), Ex. 1, at 1-2 [Dkt. 17-3]. At the time, Francisco was serving as Acting Solicitor General.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Dispute (\"Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\") \u00b6 1 [Dkt. # 17-9]. Prior to January 20, 2017, Francisco had been a partner at the Jones Day law firm in Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Acting Solicitor General, Francisco noticed his appearance in a case filed in the Ninth Circuit challenging an executive order issued by President Trump regarding the so-called \"travel ban\" of certain aliens into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Two days later, General Francisco's former firm, Jones Day, entered the case as an amicus opposed to the Government's position.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. That afternoon, the Government filed its Reply brief\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. The Government's brief stated in a footnote that Francisco had \"refrained from signing the brief, out of an abundance of caution, in light of a last-minute filing of an amicus brief by [his] former law firm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Reply Supp. Emergency Mot.

General Francisco did not, however, withdraw from the case, and went on to sign subsequent filings.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.

Plaintiff therefore failed to meet its burden, \"[b]ecause [plaintiff's] request did not demonstrate\n   that the matter attracting media interest (the nomination) was a matter in which there exist possible [ethics] questions, and because the cited media coverage did not indicate any public concern over the questions that American Oversight raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Measure of Deference Due the DOJ's Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the DOJ is not entitled to deferential review of its interpretation because \"there is no evidence that the interpretation advanced in this litigation results from an agency's reasoned and considered view of the regulation entitled to deference.\" Reply in Support of Pl.'s Mot. for Part. Summ. J. (\"Reply\"), at 11 [Dkt. # 20]. More specifically, plaintiff contends that DOJ's requirement that the matter of \"widespread public attention\" also be the matter in which \"possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence\" exist is unreasonable because of the absence of (i) \"regulation or guidance\" memorializing this interpretation, (ii) \"publicly available statements regarding how to interpret the regulation,\" and (iii) \"internal guidance or training material relying on this interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Put simply, plaintiff misunderstands the governing case law. Although plaintiff's catalogue of preferred materials may constitute evidence of a \"reasoned and considered view,\" those materials are not required to ensure one. Indeed, the DOJ has noted that an interpretation of a regulation otherwise entitled to deference may, itself, warrant deference even if it \"first appears during litigation, unless the interpretation conflicts with prior interpretations or amounts to nothing more than a convenient litigating position.\"\n   <em>\n    Shieldalloy Metallurgical Corp. v.

But\n   this, of course, is a wholly appropriate way for the DOJ to analyze the issue. The regulation does not ask whether possible questions exist that\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   -should they become known-affect public confidence in the government's integrity. It asks whether there are possible questions as to the Government's integrity \"that affect public confidence,\" full stop. The primary way to determine whether such possible questions exist is by examining the state of public coverage of the matter at issue, and whether that coverage surfaces possible ethics issues so potentially significant as to reduce public confidence in governmental institutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the final analysis, Director Flores correctly concluded that plaintiff had met its burden of showing that there was the necessary media interest concerning General Francisco's nomination, but that none of the articles raised any ethical issues concerning his nomination, or his work in the Solicitor General's Office, or for Jones Day. As such, the Department reached the only conclusion supported by the plain meaning of the rule and their existing precedent in analyzing it. That decision was both reasonable and legally sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [Dkt. # 17].
