The Department of Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its previous memorandum opinion, the Court concluded that DOD's search was inadequate because it limited its search to electronic mail when plaintiff's request was broad enough to cover all correspondence \"to, from, or cc'd to Elizabeth King or Mary McVeigh,\" including, but not limited to, electronic mail, memoranda, or other documents, in electronic or handwritten format.\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DOD maintains that it has now conducted an adequate search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mem. at 6; Defs.' Renewed Reply at 3-5. But the Court finds that DOD still falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Supplemental DOD Searches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To support its contention that it has conducted an adequate search, DOD offered the declaration of Mark H. Herrington, the Associate Deputy General Counsel in the agency's Office of General Counsel (\"OGC\"), who is currently supervising this FOIA case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Decl. of Mark H. Herrington [Dkt. # 25-2] (\"Third Herrington Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Herrington averred that, pursuant to the Court's opinion, he instructed the Office of the Secretary of Defense/Joint Staff FOIA office to task the offices of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative\n   Affairs and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to conduct a search of their paper records for responsive material. Third Herrington Decl. \u00b6 4. He explained that he asked the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs to conduct a search because it was the \"office in which the two individuals worked.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And he stated that the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics conducted a search because the \"broad mission of the office\" covered the subject matter of plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 31, 2017, a management services specialist and the deputy director of operations for the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs informed the FOIA office that they did not locate any responsive documents to plaintiff's request, and they further advised that any correspondence by Elizabeth King or Mary McVeigh during the relevant time period \"would only be stored electronically.\" Third Herrington Decl. \u00b6 5. And a few days later, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health and the Assistant for Safety and Health within the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics told the FOIA office that no responsive materials were located because the office \"does not maintain paper files of correspondence on coordination or collaborations\" during the relevant time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. But this does not end the matter because the Court cannot find that the searches were adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Supplemental DOD Searches are Inadequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his original declaration, Herrington said that he asked DOD Enterprise IT Services Directorate (\"EITSD\") to search the emails of the two individuals named in plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Decl. of Mark H. Herrington [Dkt. # 11-3] (\"First Herrington Decl.\") \u00b6 6. The Court ruled that DOD's initial searches were inadequate not only because they did not include a search for paper records, but because the search for electronically stored material was improperly limited to electronic mail and not other digitally stored records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DOD's declarant now avers that he originally asked EITSD to search all electronic files, not just emails, in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. Fourth Decl. of Mark H. Herrington [Dkt. # 28-1] (\"Fourth Herrington Decl.\") \u00b6 7. As a result, DOD argues that it has conducted an adequate search for electronic records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Reply at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff contends that \"there remains a factual dispute as to whether the agency actually performed a search for all electronic records, as [defendant] now claim[s], [or] if the agency's prior sworn testimony evidence, indicating that [it] only searched for email records, was true and accurate.\" Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Reply at 1-2. And plaintiff requests \"leave to undertake a limited telephonic deposition of a DOD designated witness\" pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) to clarify what search was actually performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While there is a presumption of good faith that attaches to agency declarations, and the fourth declaration is supported by the fact that three electronic records that are not emails were produced,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fourth Herrington Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, the discrepancy gives rise to a question of fact that is best resolved by discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court's previous analysis of the DOD's search was based on its declarant's description of an electronic search that only covered emails. DOD never once sought to supplement or correct Herrington's declaration, it did not seek reconsideration of the Court's ruling on the grounds of mistake, and it never argued in its papers that the search included electronic files other than emails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For those reasons, the Court will grant plaintiff's request to take a limited telephonic deposition of a DOD witness that is no more than ninety minutes in length.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Turning to DOD's search for paper records, DOD maintains that it conducted an adequate search of the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs and of the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics because the declaration \"describes with reasonable detail DOD's search processes and the document retention policies\" of the offices. Defs.' Renewed Reply at 5. However, the Herrington declarations do not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The declarant averred that he was informed by the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs that because Ms. King and Ms. McVeigh no longer worked there, all of their paper files had been \"placed into burn bags and incinerated,\" and any other correspondence by them \"would only be stored electronically.\" Third Herrington Decl. \u00b6 5; Fourth Herrington Decl. \u00b6 4. This account raises a number of concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, even if the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs has a policy to incinerate paper files when a staff member departs, that does not automatically mean that a physical search for records would not have turned up responsive documents. Since the request covered correspondence\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the two employees in question, as well as to them, the declarant failed to explain why other searches would not have been fruitful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, in his fourth declaration, Herrington avers that the person currently at the work space that was once occupied by Ms. McVeigh was asked \"to search the space\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   to ensure no files of these individuals remained in the space.\" Fourth Herrington Decl. \u00b6 4 (emphasis added). Not only is this description vague, but it suggests that a prior search occurred that has not been previously described.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At bottom, Herrington fails to provide the \"rationale for searching certain locations and not others,\"\n   <em>\n    Defs. of Wildlife v. U.S. Border Patrol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4161055\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/623/83/#p92\">\n    623 F.Supp.2d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92 (D.D.C. 2009), and he does not describe how the spaces were actually searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinberg v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820209,10509411\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/548/\">\n    23 F.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551-52 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Therefore, his description of a search for paper records is too cursory to enable the Court to determine whether the search was adequate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 326 (observing that a declaration describes an adequate search because it sets forth a comprehensive description of how an office maintains records and how the search was conducted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The same problems arise in connection with the search conducted by the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. In his third declaration, Herrington makes the conclusory statement that \"a paper search was conducted, but the office does not maintain paper files of correspondence on coordinations or collaborations during the time of May 1, 2013, and December 12, 2014.\" Third Herrington Decl. \u00b6 6. His supplemental declaration adds little; it states that the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics \"searched their files and informed [him] that they have no paper records of correspondence\" during the relevant time frame. Fourth Herrington Decl. \u00b6 5. Neither declaration contains the necessary description of the search that was undertaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, summary judgment in favor of DOD is inappropriate at this\n   time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Environmental Protection Agency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In its original decision, the Court found EPA's searches to be inadequate because the agency's declarant did not explain why the three record systems searched in the OIG Office of Investigation were the only places where responsive documents were likely to be found, and because the description of the search of the OIG Immediate Office was \"too cursory to persuade the Court that the search was adequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also observed that the search terms used in both searches were too limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With its renewed motion for summary judgment, EPA has offered the supplemental declaration of Scott Levine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Decl. of Scott Levine [Dkt. # 25-4] (\"Suppl. Levine Decl.\"). The Court concludes that the EPA has now conducted an adequate search for records with the exception that the declaration concerning the new search of the Office of Congressional and Public Liaison records is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Supplemental Search of the OIG Office of Investigations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Scott Levine of the EPA averred that he \"requested that the Office of Investigations conduct a supplemental search of the three electronic databases which maintain investigative complaints.\" Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 3. The Office of Investigations conducted another search of the Inspector General's Operation and Reporting System (\"IGOR\"), a case management system called 12M, and the Office of Investigations hotline database.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 n.2. In addition to using the search terms identified in Levine's original declaration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Office of Investigations added the following terms in order to ensure \"that this search would more broadly search for any documents related to the subject matter of the letter\": \"Heather\"; \"Heather White\"; \"Monsanto\"; \"June 26, 2003\"; \"Rule 3.4\"; \"ABA Formal Ethics Opinion 93-378\"; \"Glenn A.

Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 5. After he manually reviewed the lists and the subject of each complaint, and he confirmed that no hotline complaint or investigation relevant to plaintiff's FOIA request had been opened, Levine concluded that \"no potentially responsive investigative records existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Office of Investigations also expanded its search to include any hard copy correspondence \"that may have been sent\n   in response to the complaint described in the FOIA request because this is the only other type of record the Office of Investigations could have relating to the FOIA request.\" Suppl.

Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 15. The \"Agency point of contact\" for CMS conducted keyword searches of CMS metadata, which also included the metadata from NCTIMS that had been imported into CMS.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. He or she searched the \"[p]rimary subject field\" using the following terms: \"Heather, White, Heather White, EWG, 'Environmental Working Group,' Weinischke, Monsanto, Anniston, MacGillivray, Riverkeeper\"; the \"[c]itizen field\" with the following terms: \"Heather White, EWG, 'Environmental Working Group' \"; and the \"[a]ddressee field\" for \"White,\" \"Tinsley,\" and \"Fine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   All of the keyword searches were conducted without a date restriction.

The results consisted of a list, which included the date on which the communication was received, the sender's name, and the subject.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Susan Barvenik, Associate General Counsel in the OIG Office of Counsel, reviewed the lists provided, identified CMS record OIG-0300945 as a potentially responsive document, and requested that the OIG Immediate Office designee retrieve the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Susan Barvenik [Dkt. # 28-3] (\"Barvenik Decl.\") \u00b6 6.

She requested that the OIG Immediate Office designee search CMS using the tracking number as the search term for the following fields: \"notes\"; \"comments\"; \"instruction\"; and \"instr related note.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No responsive records were identified during this additional search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Levine noticed that the \"instruction notes\" on the produced CMS record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Levine Decl. \u00b6 19. He then requested that the administrative officer search for potentially responsive OCPL records related to the 2003 complaint letter, which Levine averred would have been in hard copy files called \"Chron Files.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since the administrative officer \"determined that no 'Chron Files,\" other than congressional correspondence, are now maintained ...[,] no responsive files were located for [p]laintiff's FOIA request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Levine also instructed the OIG IT Specialist to search for email accounts of the following five former OIG employees: Nikki Tinsley, the Inspector General; Mark Bialek, Counsel to the Inspector General; Eileen McMahon, the Assistant Inspector General for Congressional and Public Liaison; Michael Speedling, the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations; and Lorraine Gentile, Acting Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 20, 22. Between June 2003 and July 2004, OIG used the Lotus Notes application for email, but as of 2013, OIG changed to Microsoft Outlook for email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The Lotus Notes Administrator could only locate email accounts for three people-Nikki Tinsley, Mark Bialek, and Eileen McMahon-after searching \"all possible locations for the Lotus Notes email accounts,\" which included: the main OIG Lotus Notes server, a 90-day rolling backup OIG Lotus Notes server, a secure OIT IT physical vault that contained the Ms. Tinsley's email on CD, and a 450 GB Seagate FreeAgent external storage device that contained a temporary backup of Lotus Notes email accounts as they existed on November 24, 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Ms. Tinsley's email records were found on a CD for the time period August 2002 to March 2006; and Mr. Bialek's email account and Ms. McMahon's email account were found on the OIG external storage device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The OIG IT Specialist indexed the three email accounts so that the email records and any electronic attachments were searchable. Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 25. Levine then searched all emails and electronic files attached to emails in the three accounts, whether the emails were sent to or from the account user, by \"entering the following keywords into the search function field for the Lotus Notes email accounts: Anniston, Weinischke, Heather &amp; White, 'Heather White,' 'Environmental Working Group,' 'Glenn Fine,' 'DOJ OIG,' 'June 26,' EWG, Monsanto, Whitman, Glenn.A.Fine@usdoj.gov, DOJ &amp; investigation &amp; joint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the search, he concluded that two records were potentially responsive, and they were ultimately produced to plaintiff with redactions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28; Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Supplemental Search of the OIG Immediate Office is Adequate with One Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   EPA's subsequent Immediate Office search has largely satisfied the Court's initial concerns, but with the exception of the inquiry made to the Office of Congressional and Public Liaison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   With regard to the renewed search for hard copy files, the Court concludes that the declarant has described an adequate search. Plaintiff takes issue with EPA's \"failure to locate any hard copy record for the applicable 2003 or 2004 time period from the OIG Immediate Office 'General Correspondence' system of records,\" and he argues that defendant made no effort \"to determine where the 'missing' applicable hard copy correspondence files for that time period could be found.\" Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mem. at 12. But the OIG Records Office took steps to confirm that no Immediate Office general correspondence records had been sent offsite between 2003 and the present. Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 14. And, as the Court has previously noted, the agency's failure to locate particular documents does not undermine the determination that the search was adequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court also concludes that the declarant has adequately described and explained the search methodology for the CMS search. Plaintiff argues that EPA failed to undertake appropriate follow-up search actions once Barvenik determined that CMS record OIG-0300945 was a responsive record. Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mem. at 9. He contends that EPA had a responsibility to conduct searches in the three databases utilizing the control number,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but the Court is satisfied with the steps that were taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Barvenik explained why she concluded that it was \"unlikely that the CMS tracking number 'OIG-0300945' would identify any investigative records in the [other] relevant electronic databases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Barvenik Decl. \u00b6 9. First, the tracking number \"is not in a format recognizable as a tracking number used by Office of Investigations\" electronic databases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Second, the tracking number \"was not even an OIG tracking number-but an automatically generated tracking number in the Agency correspondence management and tracking system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. And third, \"it is unlikely [the] CMS tracking number would have appeared in any investigative record without any of the key word terms that the OIG had already searched.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the previous searches in the three electronic databases had not identified any responsive documents, and the tracking number was in an unrecognizable format, the Court concludes that defendant's approach was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   , 806 F.3d at 582 (noting an agency's search is \"generally adequate where the agency has sufficiently explained its search process and why the specified record systems [not searched] are not reasonably likely to contain responsive records\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   With respect to EPA's search for responsive emails, defendant's supplemental declaration details the locations searched and the search terms used, and it provides an explanation for why it was likely that only five email accounts would include responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 20. There is no explanation for why only three out of the five Lotus Notes email\n   accounts were located. But, Levine averred that the \"Lotus Notes Administrator searched all possible locations for the Lotus Notes email accounts for the five former OIG employees identified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. And an agency's failure to turn up particular documents does not undermine the reasonableness and adequacy of the search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilbur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9061762,3720450\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/675/\">\n    355 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   678 ;\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   , 806 F.3d at 583. Further, plaintiff does not seem to challenge the agency's failure to find these two additional email accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, plaintiff does argue that the agency's search was inadequate because there \"is not any indication that the agency made any effort to try to locate all responsive archived records (other than a search limited to archived emails) for any of the three specific individuals at the EPA OIG who are directly referenced\" in the responsive emails that were produced. Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mem. at 10. He insists that these three staff members \"were in the initial stage of the process of discussing appropriate investigative actions regarding the complaint submitted by Ms. White,\" and that the EPA should have followed up on these leads \"to determine the outcome of these initial OIG investigation actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   While an agency \"must revise its assessment of what is 'reasonable' in a particular case to account for leads that emerge during its inquiry,\"\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n    164 F.3d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28 (D.C. Cir. 1998), an agency's search is \"generally adequate\" where the agency has explained its search process and why additional searches are not likely to produce responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   , 806 F.3d at 582. Here, Levine adequately explained why no further searches were necessary. He averred that \"no complaint, case, or investigation records in the Office of Investigations would be created without a corresponding entry in one of the three [database] systems,\" and \"[n]o other OIG system exists for tracking complaints, cases or investigations.\" Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 3. And he stated that it is standard practice that whenever investigative emails or notes related to a complaint are created, they are attached to a case or complaint file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Thus, if further investigative steps had been taken by one of the three named individuals, those notes would have turned up in one of the searches that had already been conducted and that produced no responsive records. So Levine has sufficiently explained why specified record systems did not have to be searched again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, looking to the OCPL search, although the Levine declaration does contain some descriptive information about the files maintained by that office, it falls short in describing the search methodology used. The declaration simply states that Levine \"requested that the administrative officer for OCPA search for potentially responsive OCPL records related to the 2003 complaint letter,\" and that the administrative officer determined that no responsive files were located. Suppl. Levine Decl. \u00b6 19. But he does not provide any description of how the search was actually conducted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3820209,10509411\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/23/548/\">\n    23 F.3d at 551-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Renewed DOJ Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   With its renewed motion for summary judgment, DOJ has offered two supplemental declarations of Jeanetta M. Howard, a \"Government Information Specialist for the Office of the Inspector General, United States Department of Justice (OIG).\" Suppl. Decl. of Jeanetta M. Howard [Dkt. # 25-3] (Suppl.

According to Howard, these declarations \"elaborate on\" the declarant's original description of the agency's search. Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Howard explains that she failed to state in her earlier declaration that \"a search was also conducted using other identifiers listed in [p]laintiff's request.\" Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 4. Not only did she search the names \"Todd Whitman and William A. Weinischke,\" but she also searched for \"Heather White\" and \"Nikki L. Tinsley\" at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also clarified that, in order to \"ensure to encompass any records that would be retrievable by that name,\" the keyword searches included the first and last name of each person, as well as other searches involving various combinations of first, last, and middle name and initials.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Further, Howard now adds that she also \"conducted a search in the OIG's electronic correspondence file for the immediate office of the Inspector General\" by using the identifier \"Heather White,\" as well as the June 26, 2003 date of the letter. Second Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 5. She explained that \"[t]he correspondence file only tracks incoming and outgoing correspondence received in the OIG Front Office and does not contain any substantive records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of her search, she located an entry in the database \"indicating that the OIG had received correspondence from Heather White to Inspector General Glenn Fine\" on June 26, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the entry, the letter from Heather White had been sent to the Investigations Division on June 27, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 to Suppl.

Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 10; Second Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 6. Phelps \"conducted a search of all names referenced in [p]laintiff's request in the IDMS and no responsive records were located.\" Suppl.

Howard Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 11. She determined that the name \"Heather White\" did not appear on the log. Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 11. Phelps informed Howard that the Investigations Division did not start keeping a mail log until\n   August 2003, and that prior to that time, the \"mail was logged in a series of paper books,\" which Phelps stated she was \"pretty sure have been destroyed by now.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Suppl.

The Renewed DOJ Search is Inadequate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Putting aside the question of why the DOJ declarant wasted everyone's time the first time around by submitting a declaration that left more out than it included, the Court finds that the new declarations are still insufficient. While Howard clarified that she originally conducted searches using combinations of first names, middle names, and initials for \"Christine Todd Whitman,\" \"William A. Weinischke,\" \"Heather White,\" and \"Nikki L. Tinsley,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-8, and that she made efforts to follow up on those searches by seeking records from the Investigative Division, the fact that she used no search terms other than the names mentioned in the FOIA request renders the search incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As it observed in its previous opinion, the FOIA request \"attached a copy of the White complaint, and from that complaint, Howard could have and should have identified additional search terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Pulliam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The use of only the four names identified in plaintiff's request still \"demonstrates that Howard did not understand the scope of plaintiff's request, which sought all documents\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to the complaint filed by Heather White.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268064\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/179/#p194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   And while Howard attempts to explain why not searching \"indexes of the OIG's audit and inspection records\" was justified, her rationale is based on the flawed understanding of the scope of plaintiff's request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12(13)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Because OIG audit and inspection records do not focus on the conduct of individuals, there is no reasonable possibility that those records will contain information regarding plaintiff's request.\"). As illustrated by the list of search terms used by EPA, terms exist that could have been used in a supplemental IDMS search and a search of the audit and inspection records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The information provided about the mail log is also unsatisfactory. While the reasonableness of a search is not necessarily undermined due to the failure to locate responsive documents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilbur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9061762,3720450\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/675/\">\n    355 F.3d at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a search is not adequate if the record \"raises substantial doubt\" that certain materials were overlooked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 326, citing\n   <em>\n    Founding Church of Scientology v.

Cir. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In her second supplemental declaration, Howard states that the OIG Investigations Division retention policy provides that records such as paper mails logs \"are to be deleted/destroyed 5 years after the end of the fiscal year during which the complaint was dispositioned or when the agency determines\n   that they are no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes, whichever is later.\" Second Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 8. Based on that, she reported that that \"OIG presumes the paper mail logs have been destroyed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785360,11114\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/610/824/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   But this is entirely conclusory, and \"generalized claims of destruction or non-preservation cannot sustain summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   , 180 F.3d at 328. Since the representative of the office involved was only \"pretty sure\" the paper mail logs had been destroyed, the agency should have made additional inquiries to determine whether the logs had in fact been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As defendant concedes, all it has done is \"reevaluate[ ]\" its search \"in response to the Court's February 16, 2017[ ] Opinion and Order.\" Defs.' Renewed Mem. at 6. But a reevaluation was not enough to cure all of the deficiencies in DOJ's searches. Therefore, summary judgment is still inappropriate and the case will be remanded to the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that defendants' renewed motion for summary judgment will be DENIED IN PART, plaintiff's motion will be DENIED as moot, and the Court will remand this case back to the agencies. The agencies are instructed to conduct a further search for responsive records, to provide a more detailed justification for the adequacy of their searches, and to release any reasonably segregable non-exempt material to plaintiff consistent with FOIA. The Court will grant plaintiff limited discovery as to the DOD's searches pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) according to the terms set out in the attached order. With respect to the documents EPA produced to plaintiff, the Court concludes that those documents were properly redacted under FOIA Exemption 6, and that EPA met its segregability requirement.

After Howard searched IDMS, she contacted Phelps, who \"conducted a search of all names referenced in [p]laintiff's request in the IDMS and no responsive records were located.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Suppl. Howard Decl. \u00b6 11;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Ex. 2 to Suppl. Howard Decl. [Dkt. # 25-3]. Even assuming that this conclusory description is referring to a search of the names \"William A. Weinischke,\" \"Christine Todd Whitman,\" \"Heather White,\" and \"Nikki L. Tinsley,\" those search terms leave much to be desired since responsive records could have been overlooked.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Howard's supplemental declaration contains two paragraphs both designated as \u00b6 12, so the Court will refer to the first of those paragraphs as \u00b6 12, and the second paragraph bearing that same number as \u00b6 12(13).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
