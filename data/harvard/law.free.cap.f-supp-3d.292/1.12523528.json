Opp. \u00b6 7. The Court disagrees. In determining whether to accept the parties' plea agreement, the Court ruled that the applicable Guideline range was 168 to 210 months, and noted that the plea \"came out somewhat less ... than the [G]uidelines['] suggested minimum; more than the mandatory sentence but less than the [G]uidelines call for.\" Sentencing Hr'g Tr., at 11, 4. Despite \"[c]om[ing] out to somewhat lower than the [G]uidelines,\" the Court found the plea to be \"a fair and appropriate ... sentence for the nature of the activity in th[e] case,\" and agreed to depart below the Guideline range \"[b]ecause of the plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.

Defendant's active involvement in a potentially violent, drug distribution conspiracy weighs against a reduction in his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's mature age and criminal history at the time of his arrest also weigh against a sentence reduction. Defendant was not a young man during his involvement in the two-year conspiracy-he was a mature adult between the ages of 33 and 35. Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 5, Feb. 02, 2009, ECF No. 430. Nor was this defendant's first foray into drug distribution.

Further, given the extensive amount of his prison term that he has already served, and his positive, post-sentencing conduct, it does not appear that a sentence reduction would expose the community to danger.
