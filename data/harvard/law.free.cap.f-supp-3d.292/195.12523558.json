Kennedy Memorial Stadium. Plaintiff, the decedent's daughter, has brought this lawsuit alleging that several of the businesses involved in the construction of that stage were negligent in failing to provide the proper protective equipment to prevent her father's fall. Two of the Defendants, Mountain Productions, Inc. (\"Mountain\") and It's My Party, Inc. (\"IMP\"), have filed third-party complaints against the decedent's employer, Conder, Inc. (otherwise known as Charm City Crewing Company). Presently before the Court are Conder's motions to dismiss those third-party complaints. Upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as a whole, the Court will GRANT Conder's [29] Motion to Dismiss the Third-Party Complaint by Mountain, but DENY Conder's [30] Motion to Dismiss the Third-Party Complaint by IMP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants Mountain, IMP and Washington Convention and Sports Authority in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Compl., ECF No. 1-2. Plaintiff alleged that on June 30, 2015, her father, James L. Truesdale, was working to construct a concert stage at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium at a jobsite controlled by one or more of the Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Mr. Truesdale was a day laborer employed by Conder, a company that was not named as a Defendant in Plaintiff's lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. He fell from a platform while working and died eight days later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to ensure that the platform from which her father fell had \"appropriate fall protection equipment and/or other necessary systems in place to prevent the employees of subcontractors from falling off of heights greater than six feet, which is required,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , by federal OSHA regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiff asserted two counts against the Defendants: one for \"negligence; wrongful death\" and another for \"negligence; Survival Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-24. Defendant IMP removed Plaintiff's lawsuit to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants IMP and Mountain then filed third-party complaints against the decedent's employer, Conder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. It's My Party, Inc.'s Third-Party Compl. Against Conder Inc., ECF No. 17 (\"IMP Compl.\"); Def. Mountain Production, Inc.'s Third-Party Compl. Against Conder Inc., ECF No. 19 (\"Mountain Compl.\"). In its third-party complaint, IMP alleges that Conder entered into an agreement with IMP \"to provide employees and/or agents to build the concert stage ... and to provide vetting, training, instruction, supervision\n   and oversight, including but not limited to onsite supervision of these employees and/or agents.\" IMP Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14. IMP also states that \"[p]ursuant to the terms of the Agreement, [Conder] agreed to indemnify IMP for any negligence by [Conder] occurring during [Conder's] operations pertaining to the Concert, and to add IMP as an additional insured to [Conder's] commercial general liability insurance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. IMP alleges that it had an ongoing relationship with Conder and that the two businesses had entered into numerous similar agreements in the past.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. IMP claims that it was Conder's duty and responsibility to provide fall protection equipment or other necessary systems to prevent falling-not IMP's.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. IMP asserts causes of action against Conder for breach of contract and implied indemnity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Mountain has also asserted causes of action against Conder for breach of contract and implied indemnity. Mountain Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-32. However, the factual allegations underlying those claims are different than IMP's. Mountain alleges that it \"entered into a contract with IMP and/or one of its affiliates to provide staging for a pending concert, whereby IMP would provide local labor for work to be done at RFK from on or about June 28 to July 7, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Mountain does not claim that it contracted with Conder. Instead, Mountain alleges that \"[u]pon information and belief, on or before June 25, 2015, IMP contracted with [Conder] to provide vetting, training, instruction, supervision, oversight, and employees to perform work at RFK from on or about June 28 to July 7, 2015, whereby Mountain was an intended beneficiary of this contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Mountain also states that \"[b]y providing employees to work at RFK from June 28 to July 7, 2015, Mountain had a special relationship with [Conder] by virtue of the day-to-day interaction and decision-making between the parties regarding the work at RFK.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Conder has moved to dismiss both of these third-party complaints under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The remedies provided for by the WCA are exclusive. The WCA states that \"[t]he liability of an employer prescribed in \u00a7 32-1503 [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for compensation for injury or death without regard to fault] shall be exclusive and in place of all liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, spouse or domestic partner, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law on account of such injury or death.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1504\">\n    D.C.

However, Conder claims that this exclusivity goes a step further, and also prevents Third-Party Defendants from recovering against it.

That being said, the\n   <em>\n    Myco\n   </em>\n   court noted two circumstances where indemnification is allowed despite the exclusivity of the WCA. First, with respect to claims based on express indemnification agreements-which were not actually at issue in\n   <em>\n    Myco\n   </em>\n   -the court noted that \"[i]t is well settled in most jurisdictions that when the third party's claim against the employer is for indemnity pursuant to an express contractual provision, the exclusivity provisions of workers' compensation laws do not bar the indemnification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7348355\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/293/#p294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7348355\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/565/293/#p294\">\n    at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

IMP Compl. \u00b6 4. The agreement also allegedly contained a promise by Conder to \"indemnify IMP for any negligence by [Conder] occurring during [Conder's] operations pertaining to the concert, and to add IMP as an additional insured to [Conder's] commercial general liability insurance policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15.

The Court understands that Conder disputes IMP's claim on the merits, but there is no indication that IMP's allegations are merely an \"attempt to disguise a precluded negligence claim into a fictitious contract dispute.\" IMP Mot. at 7. Conder will, of course, have the opportunity to attack the merits of IMP's claim at a later stage after a factual record has been developed.

IMP\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    IMP has plausibly alleged the type of relationship that could support a claim for implied indemnity. IMP and Conder allegedly have had a long-standing business relationship, pursuant to which IMP relies on Conder to handle personnel-related matters. Specifically, IMP has alleged that in addition to the business arrangement at issue in this case, it \"had an ongoing relationship with [Conder] in which IMP entered into similar prior agreements with [Conder] pursuant to which [Conder] agreed to provide its employees and/or agents to build concert stages, and to provide the necessary vetting training, instruction, supervision, oversight and safety protection of these employees and/or agents.\" IMP Compl. \u00b6 17. IMP alleges that it \"reasonably relied upon [Conder's] industry knowledge and experience in vetting, training, staffing, supervising and overseeing\" the work of its agents.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18. IMP alleges that the parties' \"long-standing relationship ... created a specific duty by [Conder] to provide competent, well-trained and safety aware employees and/or agents with necessary equipment in conformance to applicable industry standards to build a concert stage.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 32. Finally, IMP also alleges that Conder had included IMP as an additional\n    insured on its insurance liability policy.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 15. Accepting these allegations as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences for IMP, the relationship between IMP and Conder could plausibly support a claim that Conder had a distinct implied duty to indemnify IMP that would not be barred by the exclusivity of the WCA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Howard Univ. v.

Mountain\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Mountain's claim for implied indemnity, on the other hand, is not supported by sufficient factual allegations. Mountain's third-party complaint merely alleges that \"[d]ue to the day-to-day interaction and decisionmaking between Mountain and [Conder] from on or about June 28 through July 7, 2015, a special relationship existed between the parties.\" Mountain Compl. \u00b6 30. As far as the Court can tell from Mountain's complaint, the extent of the relationship between Mountain and Conder was that they both contracted with IMP to help erect a stage for a particular concert, and then both worked toward that joint goal for a little over a week. Mountain's third-party complaint does not allege any \"ongoing and comprehensive contractual relationship,\"\n    <em>\n     Howard Univ.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7927216\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/608/116/#p118\">\n     608 A.2d at 124\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , like the relationship that allegedly existed between IMP and Conder.

The Court agrees with Conder that allowing Mountain's claim to go forward based on the minimal allegations in its third-party complaint would effectively \"eviscerate the exclusivity of Worker's Compensation.\" Mountain Reply at 5.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In sum, the Court finds that IMP has plausibly pled an implied indemnification claim that could survive the exclusivity of the WCA, but Mountain has not done so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT Conder's motion to dismiss Mountain's third-party complaint, but DENY Conder's motion to dismiss IMP's third-party complaint. The Court finds that IMP has plausibly pled the existence of an express indemnification agreement and sufficient facts to support an implied indemnification theory as well. Mountain has not adequately pled either an express or implied indemnification claim. The dismissal of Mountain's third-party complaint, however, will be WITHOUT PREJUDICE. If Mountain can\n    <em>\n     in good faith\n    </em>\n    add factual allegations to its third-party complaint that would show that it was an intended beneficiary of IMP's contract with Conder, or that its relationship with Conder was sufficient to establish a claim\n    for implied indemnity, it may seek leave to file an amended complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Attias v.
