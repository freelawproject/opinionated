The court considered the interpretive guidance in its entirety, including its provision that other \"conditions, such as pregnancy, that are not the result of a physiological disorder are also not impairments.\" 29 C.F.R. app. \u00a7 1630.2(h). The court concluded that \"a more natural reading of the interpretive guidance is that an individual's weight is generally a physical characteristic that qualifies as a physical impairment only if it falls outside the normal range\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   it occurs as the result of a physiological disorder.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813860\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1104/#p1112\">\n    817 F.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Eighth Circuit's analysis of the statutory text finds clear support in the EEOC interpretive guidance. The guidance distinguishes \"between conditions that are impairments\" and physical \"characteristics that are not impairments,\" and then lists weight as a physical characteristic. 29 C.F.R. app. \u00a7 1630.2(h). Additionally, the relevant section of the interpretive guidance focuses upon limiting the definition of impairment rather than expanding it.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813860\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1104/#p1112\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, it is logical to conclude, as did the Eighth Circuit, that a plaintiff within the normal weight range should be precluded from asserting that he has a weight-based physical impairment, regardless of whether his weight is affected by an underlying physiological disorder or condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, citing the EEOC guidance, Plaintiff interprets the physical characteristic of weight as a qualifying impairment if\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   of the following is true: (1) the employee's weight is not within the normal range; or (2) the weight is the result of a physiological disorder. [85] at 15. This overly-broad interpretation, however, would permit a plaintiff of normal weight to claim a weight-based physical impairment-a result that does not withstand scrutiny. Neither the statutory text, nor the EEOC's interpretive guidance, supports Plaintiff's contention that some types of physical characteristics may unconditionally qualify as physical impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 C.F.R. app. \u00a7 1630.2(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff points to out-of-circuit district court cases concluding that severe obesity can qualify as a physical impairment under the ADA. In\n   <em>\n    Human Development\n   </em>\n   , the EEOC alleged that a woman suffered from severe obesity, that her employer regarded her as disabled because of her obesity, and that the employer terminated her because of her perceived disability.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3978130\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/827/688/#p695\">\n    827 F.Supp.2d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court quoted a 2009 EEOC Compliance Manual, which stated that while being overweight is not generally an impairment, \"severe obesity, which has been defined as body weight more than 100% over the norm, is clearly an impairment.\" EEOC Compliance Manual: Section 902 Definition of the Term Disability \u00a7 902.2(c)(5)(ii). The court concluded that, giving this manual \"appropriate deference, the Court should recognize that severe obesity qualifies as a disability under the ADA and that there is no requirement to prove an underlying physiological basis.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3978130\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/827/688/#p695\">\n    827 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   695 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCollum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20608665\">\n    2017 WL 608665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *35 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Human Development\n   </em>\n   and the manual, however, is unavailing.

But a review of the ADA, its accompanying regulations, and\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   itself demonstrates that the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   fails to support Plaintiff's contention.

By contrast, Plaintiff has provided no evidence here that his severe obesity results from any underlying physiological disorder or condition. As a result, Plaintiff has not established a key element of his \"regarded as\" claim: he has not shown that Defendant regarded him as having a qualifying physical impairment, because he has not alleged a physical impairment within the meaning of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, summary judgment for Defendant is granted.\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 322,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (summary judgment is appropriate as to a party who fails to establish \"an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\").
