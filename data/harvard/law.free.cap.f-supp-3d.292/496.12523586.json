(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 12, ECF No. 1-1.) Harris Teeter has filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the undisputed facts are legally insufficient to support Hudson's negligence claim. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 24 (\"Mot.\").) Upon consideration of the pleadings and the record before it, the Court concludes that Hudson has failed to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists and thus grants defendant's motion for summary judgment.</p><p id=\"p-9\"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\"><strong>I. FACTS</strong></p><p id=\"p-11\">On May 26, 2015, plaintiff Antoinette Hudson and her work supervisor, Boyle Stuckey, went together to a Harris Teeter supermarket in northeast Washington, D.C., to buy lunch. (Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Summ. J. at 2, ECF No. 25 (\"Opp.\"); <em>see</em> Mot. \u00b6 1.) Hudson and Stuckey were talking and walking from the dairy section to the front of the store when Hudson \"slipped on applesauce that was on the floor, and attempting to brace herself struck her left shoulder and head on a display of mayonnaise jars before finally falling on her right hip.\" (Opp. at 2 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 1, at 41-46, ECF No. 25-1); <em>see</em> Mot. \u00b6 2.) No Harris Teeter representative was nearby, so Stuckey \"left to get the manager, Charles Magaraci.\" (Opp. at 2 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 2, at 18, ECF No. 25-2).) Hudson told Magaraci that \"she had hurt her hip and felt dizzy.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 3 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 1, at 49-50).) She then left the Harris Teeter with Stuckey and returned to work, but she soon left and \"drove herself to an urgent care center for treatment.\" (<em>Id.</em> (citing Pl.'s Ex. 1, at 54-56).)</p><p id=\"p-12\">Neither Hudson nor Stuckey saw the applesauce before Hudson fell, nor do they know when or how the applesauce came to be on the floor. (Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5; Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.) Hudson and Stuckey also do not know whether anyone from Harris Teeter knew the applesauce was on the floor. (Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 1, at 50; Pl.'s Ex. 2 at 19).) Hudson adds that she and Stuckey testified in their depositions that they saw someone stocking wine near where she fell, that Hudson \"remembers the unknown wine stocker as the person who cleaned up the mess,\" and that Stuckey \"believed the Harris Teeter Manager [Magaraci] actually instructed the wine stocker to do so.\" (Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 1, at 50-51; Pl.'s Ex. 2, at 19).)</p><p id=\"p-13\">It is also undisputed that Harris Teeter uses a \" 'Gleason System' for tracking store inspections,\" and that the Gleason Report for the day in question indicates that \"checks were made every hour and that the area of the fall was marked 'clear.' \" (Opp. \u00b6 10 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 5, ECF No. 25-5); Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J. at 2, ECF No. 26 (\"Reply\").)</p><p id=\"p-14\"><strong>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</strong></p><p id=\"p-15\">Plaintiff filed her complaint in the Civil Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on January 23, 2017. (Compl. at 3.) Harris Teeter filed a notice of removal and an answer to the complaint on March 2, 2017. (ECF No. 1; Answer, ECF No. 2.) After discovery, on December 6, 2017, Harris Teeter moved for summary judgment.

Stated in a context similar to the one at bar, \"[w]hile it is true that plaintiff is entitled to every legitimate inference which may be deduced from the evidence, she is not entitled in the absence of any evidence as to how long the alleged defect existed, to have a jury speculate in her favor on this essential element.\" <em>Jones v.

(Mot. at 6-9.) Hudson argues in response that she has either presented the necessary evidence, or that defendant's evidence is unreliable. (Opp. at 5-7.) The Court finds that Hudson has not met her burden.</p><p id=\"p-20\">\"To succeed in a negligence action under District of Columbia law, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof on three issues: the applicable standard of care, a deviation from that standard by the defendant, and a causal relationship between that deviation and the plaintiff's injury.\" <em>Martin v.

(Mot. at 7-8.) As to actual notice, Hudson responds that \"Stuckey testified that he seemed to remember the wine stocker stating that he had 'told them [Harris Teeter] about it [the dangerous condition]' prior to [ ] Hudson's fall.\" (Opp. at 5 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 2, at 38).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to constructive notice, Hudson argues that there had been no inspection of the area where she fell \"for approximately 59 minutes\" and that Harris Teeter's \" 'Gleason System' is demonstrably inadequate in establishing a record of safety conditions, as it failed to record the spill that resulted in Ms. Hudson's injury fall less than 10 minutes after\" it had occurred. (<em>Id.</em> at 6.)</p><p id=\"p-23\">First, Hudson's actual notice argument is flawed since Hudson admits that she does not know whether any \"official Harris Teeter employee knew of the alleged applesauce.\" (<em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Even without this concession, however, her argument is doomed because Stuckey's testimony is equivocal, based on a vague memory, and thus cannot be credited. <em>See</em> <em>Martin</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20115\">206 F.Supp.3d at 123</extracted-citation> (\"At the summary judgment stage, the Court must assess whether there is sufficient non-speculative evidence to support a verdict in favor of the non-movant.\"). Stuckey responded to a question about whether the wine stocker had seen the applesauce before Hudson fell by saying, \"I'm not sure. And I kind of recollect him saying-making a comment, something like he told them about it or something like that, but I'm not sure.\" (Def.'s Ex. 3, at 37, ECF No. 24-3.) Veiled in uncertainty, this statement does not constitute even a scintilla of evidence, let alone more. <em>See</em> <em>Liberty Lobby</em> , 477 U.S. at 252, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p255\">106 S.Ct. 2505</extracted-citation> (\"[T]here must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"). Finally, even if Stuckey's memory were reliable about what was said, when and to whom, there would be no affirmative evidence that the wine vendor was a Harris Teeter employee, so the statement is inadmissible hearsay. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c)(2) ; Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). In fact, to the extent that there is any evidence of the wine stocker's relationship to Harris Teeter, that evidence tends to suggest that he was not an employee. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Ex. 3, at 23-24 (Stuckey: \"... I don't know if he worked for Harris Teeter. I think they might be, like, vendors ... that stock the shelves.\"); <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em> at 24 (Stuckey noting that he is familiar with \"how grocery stores work\" and that the man nearby \"was probably a vendor stocking the shelves because he didn't have-because the people that work there, they have certain shirts on and he didn't have one of those shirts\").) Plaintiff has therefore failed to offer any evidence that Harris Teeter had actual notice of the spilled applesauce.</p><p id=\"p-24\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"501\" href=\"#p501\" id=\"p501\">*501</a>Second, Hudson's constructive notice argument is equally flawed. After admitting that she has no evidence to show how long the applesauce was on the floor and admitting that neither she nor Stuckey could \"say with certainty whether an official Harris Teeter employee knew of the alleged applesauce,\" (Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8), Hudson argues that it is enough to show that defendant's system for recording spills and maintaining safe conditions is inadequate. (Opp. at 6.) There is no evidentiary support for the claim that Harris Teeter's system is inadequate, but perhaps more importantly, Hudson also fails to demonstrate how this alleged inadequacy would be relevant to the Court's analysis because it is unrelated to whether Harris Teeter had notice of the applesauce. \"[F]rom this record no reasonable jury could conclude that the [applesauce was on the floor] '... for such a duration of time that had reasonable care been exercised the hazard would have been discovered.' \" <em>See</em> <em>Martin</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20115\">206 F.Supp.3d at 128</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Wilson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8446752\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/912/1186/#p1190\">912 A.2d at </extracted-citation>1190 ). Establishing evidence that could show how long the applesauce was on the floor is Hudson's burden and she has not carried it.</p><p id=\"p-25\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-26\">Defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted and the case is dismissed because the plaintiff failed to show that a genuine issue of material fact exists. A separate Order, ECF No. 28, accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
