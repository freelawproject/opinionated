ARGUELLO, United States District Judge\n  This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Second Unopposed Motion for Approval of FLSA Settlement and Stipulation of Dismissal of Settled Claims. (Doc. # 128.) For the following reasons, the Court grants the motion, approves the Settlement Agreement (Doc. # 128-4), and dismisses this case.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case commenced in September 2015, when Plaintiff Darell Davis filed his original Complaint alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) against his employer Sanjel USA Inc. (Doc. # 1.) In May 2016, this Court issued an order staying and administratively closing this case pursuant to Sanjel's Notice of Bankruptcy and the automatic stay requirements. (Doc. # 55.) In August 2016, Plaintiff Davis filed a notice with this Court that the case was subject to reopening based on an order from the Bankruptcy Court granting him relief from the automatic stay. (Doc. # 56.) Once re-opened, Plaintiff Davis amended his Complaint to add two new Plaintiffs (Steven Sullivan and Jonathon Malone) and three new Defendants: Paul Crilly, Chief Financial Officer of Sanjel; Warren Zemlak, Chief Operating Officer of Sanjel; and Dain MacDonald, the Chief Executive Officer, President, and Secretary of Sanjel (Defendants, collectively). (Doc. # 60-1.) Sanjel was dismissed from the action. (Doc. # 66.) A fourth Plaintiff, Victor Amador, was added thereafter. (Doc. # 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meanwhile, numerous other Sanjel employees learned of this lawsuit. No conditional certification was ever requested from or approved by this Court, and no formal notice ever circulated. Yet, numerous employees opted into the collective action, signing and submitting their consents to join. (Doc. ## 72-73, 84, 94-97, 102, 112.) Each one has also consented to the Named Plaintiffs representing their interests in this proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To date, 178 Plaintiffs have opted-into this action. (Doc. # 128 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the course of the past year and half, numerous negotiations have taken place between the Parties, including a formal mediation and an attempted approval of at least one prior settlement agreement. Those negotiations ultimately culminated in the instant Settlement, which involves all 178 Plaintiffs (Settling Plaintiffs) (Doc. ## 128-1, 128-2, 128-3), all Defendants, and will accordingly result in a dismissal of all claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     SETTLEMENT APPROVAL\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a suit by employees against their employer to recover back wages under the FLSA, the parties must present any proposed settlement to the district court for review and a determination of whether the settlement agreement is fair and reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynn's Food Stores, Inc. v.

The Court must then review the proposed settlement to ensure (1) the litigation involves a bona fide dispute, (2) the proposed settlement is fair and equitable to all parties concerned, and (3) the proposed settlement contains a reasonable award of attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Lynn's Food Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"553243\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/679/1350/#p1353\">\n    679 F.2d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FINAL CERTIFICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As mentioned, there was no conditional certification or notice stage in this case. The Parties now request that this Court now certify two classes of employees under the FLSA for settlement purposes only: a Fluctuating Workweek (FWW) Class and a Caterina Class (Settlement Classes, collectively). Having thoroughly reviewed the Parties' briefing and attached exhibits, the Court finds that final certification of these Settlement Classes for purposes of this Settlement only is warranted. The Court notes however that conditional certification is an important step in the FLSA collective action process that is meant to ensure all prospective class members have the opportunity to participate. Nonetheless, given the procedural protections discussed below and the limited scope of the Parties' proposed Settlement, the Court finds that final certification absent the typical conditional certification stage is warranted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Final certification for settlement purposes requires the Court to determine whether the settlement class members are similarly situated.\n   <em>\n    Thiessen v. GE Capital Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500362\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/1095/#p1105\">\n    267 F.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1105 (10th Cir. 2001). Doing so generally requires consideration of several factors, including (1) the disparate factual and employment settings of individual plaintiffs; (2) various defenses available to defendant which appear to be individual to each plaintiff; and (3) fairness and procedural considerations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500362\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/1095/#p1105\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The FWW Class consists of employees who were all paid under the same fluctuating workweek scheme that included overtime compensation. They allege that various prerequisites of the fluctuating workweek scheme were not satisfied, defendants made improper deductions, and plaintiffs received compensation that was inconsistent with the \"fixed salary\" component of this scheme. (Doc. # 128 at 9.) The Caterina Class consists of employees who were paid hourly with overtime but who allege that their regular rate of pay was improperly calculated and they were required to perform off-the-clock work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The employees in both Settlement Classes were all manual laborers who worked at oil and gas wells across the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) According to a financial consultant who analyzed the pay and time data in this case, the members of each Settlement Class were all subject to the same pay practices and their overtime was similarly miscalculated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) The Court finds that Plaintiffs' claims and pertinent employment duties were substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Further, Defendants' defenses appear to apply equally. In short, they allege that neither pay policy-that applicable to the FWW Class and the Caterina Class-was illegal, that Plaintiffs consented to each payment scheme and the applicable deductions, and that the prerequisites for implementing such payment schemes were satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) Defendants do not assert any individualized defenses with respect to any particular Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Moreover, fairness and procedural considerations-such as allowing Plaintiffs to\n   pool their resources for litigation-also favor collective treatment. Although there was no notice approved or circulated in this case, the Plaintiffs learned about this lawsuit by word of mouth and all Plaintiffs included in this Settlement signed opt-in consent forms-forms to which Defendants do not object. More importantly, only those Plaintiffs that have opted into one of the Settlement Classes will be affected by this Settlement. In other words, this Settlement does not affect the rights of any employees who have not already joined in this case; they may bring a separate action alleging the same claims against these Defendants, regardless of this Settlement and regardless of which Class they belong to, if either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiffs' Motion states that the Parties agree to the Settlement and jointly request approval. Although it is unclear to this Court whether each individual opt-in Plaintiff was given the opportunity to review the final Settlement and object, the Parties represent that each of the opt-in Plaintiffs \"signed consent forms that give the class representatives the right to make decisions about the litigation and settlement of their claims\" (Doc. # 128 at 21).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halle v.

Even so, in the event that any Plaintiffs do not agree, the Settlement provides another layer of protection for them. Specifically, any Plaintiff that does not agree may elect not to deposit his settlement check; if he does so, he will retain all rights under the FLSA, as if he had never joined into this case, i.e. his claims will be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For all of these reasons, and in consideration of the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Thiessen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500362\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/1095/#p1105\">\n    267 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court grants the Plaintiffs' request for final collective action certification.

The Parties likewise disagree about the merits of Plaintiffs' claims and the validity of Defendants' defenses. Plaintiffs acknowledge that resolution of these issues would therefore require significant litigation, with the possibility of limited to no recovery on either side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds that a bona fide dispute exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Colo. Feb. 24, 2014). When determining whether a settlement is fair and reasonable, courts weigh a number of factors, including: (1) the extent of discovery that has taken place; (2) the stage of the proceedings, including the complexity, expense and likely duration of the litigation; (3) the absence of fraud or collusion in the settlement; (4) the experience of counsel who have represented the plaintiffs; (5) the probability of plaintiffs' success on the merits and (6) the amount of the settlement in relation to the potential recovery.\n   <em>\n    Hargrove v.

Further, the Court finds that this settlement is a product of arms-length negotiations that took place over the course of years with numerous offers being exchanged and an attempt at mediation at least once. The settlement also delivers fair value to Plaintiffs, who will receive compensation for lost wages without the risk, expense, and heartache that comes with protracted litigation and trial. The Settlement specifically obligates Defendants to pay a gross amount of $2,180,000, which will be proportionally distributed to each Plaintiff after deductions are made for attorney fees, enhanced payments to the named class representatives, and other administrative costs. Each Plaintiff's pro rata share was determined by a forensic analyst based on payroll data provided by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Settlement is fair and reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
