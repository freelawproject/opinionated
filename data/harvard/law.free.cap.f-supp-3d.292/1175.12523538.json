Hegarty, United States Magistrate Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this employment action against Defendants on October 30, 2015, alleging essentially that they suffered adverse employment actions in retaliation for reporting what they believed to be improper conduct affecting security at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. Plaintiffs allege claims against their former employer, Defendant Vectrus Systems\n   Corp. (\"Vectrus\"), for common law retaliatory termination (Claim I); violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Department of Defense whistleblower statute (Claim II); and common law outrageous conduct (Claim III).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Vectrus seeks summary judgment in its favor on Plaintiffs James Walker's (\"Walker\") and Steven Wascher's (\"Wascher\") first and third claims for relief. In addition, the Court will analyze James Walker's second claim for relief in this order. The Court finds Walker and Wascher raise genuine issues of material fact regarding their first claims for relief and Walker raises material issues of fact concerning his second claim for relief, but the Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate factual issues regarding their third claims for outrageous conduct. Accordingly, the Court grants in part and denies in part Vectrus' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact viewed in the light most favorable to Walker and Wascher, who are the non-moving parties in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   1. On June 27, 2007, Fluor Corporation (\"Fluor\") entered into contract number W52P1J-07-D-0008 (the \"Prime Contract\") with the U.S. Department of the Army to provide services to the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program (\"LOGCAP\") in Afghanistan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Vectrus, previously known as Exelis Systems Corporation and ITT Systems Corporation, is a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3. On June 20, 2008, Vectrus entered into a subcontract with Fluor, titled \"Blanket Ordering Agreement,\" to provide support for the LOGCAP program in Afghanistan (the \"BOA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   4. Plaintiffs James Walker and Steven Wascher were hired by Vectrus effective January 7, 2013 as security investigators (or, \"screeners\") on the LOGCAP program. Deposition of James Walker, February 9, 2017 (\"Walker Dep.\") 40: 3-9; Deposition of Steven Wascher, January 23, 2017 (\"Wascher Dep.\") 25: 21-26: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   5. At Vectrus, Walker and Wascher, along with other security investigators including the Plaintiffs, worked at Bagram Air Force Base (\"BAF\") in Afghanistan in a Force Protection Screening Cell (\"FPSC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reported to Brandon Spann (\"Spann\"), senior security supervisor, who reported to Kevin Daniel (\"Daniel\"), regional Manager, who reported to Richard Diaz, program manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   6. While the screening cell was supervised by Spann, Walker and Wascher also reported to the military oversight officer, Sergeant First Class John Salinas (\"SFC Salinas\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Deposition of Victor Cejka, January 26, 2017 (\"Cejka Dep.\") 121: 15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   7. The security investigators, including Walker and Wascher, conducted interviews and investigations required for the issuance of access badges to over 6,500 non-military personnel for daily entry to the military base. Investigators prepared investigation reports (known as \"dossiers\") which, along with fingerprints, iris scans,\n   and facial photos, were entered into the Biometric Automated Toolset System computer database (\"BATS\"), a security database maintained by the Department of Defense (\"DOD\") and shared with the United States' NATO allies. Answer \u00b6 30, ECF No. 104; Deposition of Andrew Albright, Dec. 21, 2016 (\"Albright Dep.\") 19: 11-25; 22: 5-24: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   8. The maintenance of accurate information in BATS was vital to the security of the base and the military's other bases throughout the world.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   26: 2-13; 27: 2-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   9. The dossiers summarized the security investigations and recommendations for access to the base (as well as other privileges such as access to laptops, cell phones, or even in some instances weapons), but only the military was authorized to issue access badges. Cejka Dep. 109: 23-110: 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   10. While Wascher was initially assigned to BAF, he was shortly thereafter transferred to forward operating base (\"FOB\") Sharana. He had \"no objections\" to the transfer, because \"it was where the company needed [him] to go.\" Wascher Dep. 54: 16-55: 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   11. In April 2013, Fluor issued a \"call form\" directing the descope of security investigator positions at FOB Sharana and, as a result, Wascher's position was eliminated. Vectrus offered him the position of biometric clerk at Camp Spann, a satellite camp at FOB Marmol, which Wascher acknowledged was a \"demotion\" that paid about $30,000 per year less than his prior position, but he accepted it and had no objection because \"at the time, I didn't feel it was anything personal. It was the needs of the company.\" Wascher Dep. 56: 3-58: 20. In addition, Wascher's supervisors promised him that, if he took the position, \"as soon as another investigator position comes open, you know, we'll make sure you get that spot.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   58: 21-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   12. On June 3, 2013, a security investigator position opened up at BAF; Wascher was promoted to the position and transferred back. Wascher Dep. 62: 3-63: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   13. In or about the summer 2013, Walker observed that another security investigator, Marc Salazar, accessed the BATS using the name and account of a military oversight official, Sergeant Shahan, without her permission. Walker Dep. 203: 13-205: 8. Walker asked Sergeant Shahan whether she had placed \"alerts\" on certain people entering the screening cell, who were noted to meet with Salazar, and she said, \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   205: 4-25. Walker reported this to military oversight Sergeant Shahan and SFC Salinas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   14. Wascher also witnessed Salazar using Sergeant Shahan's name and account to access the BATS system to place alerts on certain people without Shahan's permission, and he reported it to Tom Robin. Wascher Dep. 165: 21-167: 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   15. In or about August 2013, Wascher was asked to conduct an investigation of a person suspected of possessing a cell phone, which was not allowed on base absent military approval. Wascher Dep. 107: 8-108: 10. Wascher interviewed the suspect and, during a break, Daniel approached Wascher and told him that he \"knew for a fact\" that \"she does have a cell phone\" because either \"Agron or Artan [Fana] gave her the phone\" to arrange \"meetings\" with her during lunch or in the evenings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   110: 17-111: 13; 139: 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   16. Immediately following the interview with the suspect, Wascher completed a dossier on the BATS, in which he included the information Daniel reported to him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   111: 20-25, 112: 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   17. Walker was also asked to conduct an interview of a third country national in relation to the same incident and he prepared\n   a dossier on the BATS. Walker Dep. 192: 19-193: 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   18. The next morning, Plaintiff Lytle told Wascher that Conklin had approached him saying that someone had deleted information from Wascher's reports. Wascher Dep. 112: 15-113: 6. That \"someone\" according to Conklin was Shajaida Rivera, biometrics clerk, who allegedly deleted information at Spann's request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   101: 14-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   19. Wascher reviewed the previous day's report and discovered that the information Daniel had given him was missing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   114: 4-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   20. That same day, Specialist Siewell entered Walker's office, closed his door, and told Walker to check on his report from the previous day; Walker saw that several paragraphs of his dossier on BATS concerning Artan Fana and Agron Fana were missing. Walker Dep. 194: 8-195: 9. Walker replaced the altered dossier with a complete copy he had saved and reported the alteration to his supervisor, Tom Robin.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   197: 17-198: 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   21. Wascher reported the information missing from his report to his \"lead,\" Plaintiff Cross, who told him to put the information back into the report, file it, and save a copy of the report. Wascher Dep. 114: 13-22. Wascher did so, then sent an email to Cross, Robin, Spann, and Daniel \"informing them of the deletion of details in [his] report, [and] asked them if they could provide an explanation and what...steps would be taken to rectify it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   115: 4-11. Only Cross responded to the email saying he would speak to Spann about the matter, but Wascher had no knowledge whether Cross ever did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   116: 14-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   22. The next day, Wascher sent a second \"exact same\" email \"to ensure that everyone was receiving the email.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   116: 1-3. That morning, in the daily security meeting, the investigators \"discussed reports being altered\" in a general sense and that \"everyone should double check their reports when they're filed to make sure everything's right, in case there's any alterations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   119: 3-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   23. Later that day, Wascher and Cross were called to Spann's office, in which Daniel was also present, and Spann \"yelled\" at Cross asking whether Cross was \"telling people that reports had been altered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   117: 6-21. When Cross answered that he was \"checking to see what was going on,\" Spann told him to \"never bring it up, never talk about it, drop the subject immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   117: 22-118: 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   24. At some point thereafter, Wascher was called to a meeting with Spann and Daniel at which Spann asked Wascher whether he \"was providing statements to the military.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   46: 2-48: 4. Wascher testified he told Spann and Daniel that Salinas was conducting an investigation into the alterations of the reports and Spann ordered Wascher not to cooperate, but when Wascher stated it would be illegal not to cooperate, Spann \"changed his tone and stated that what he meant to say was that he would go with me to the meeting and-and help me if I needed it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   48: 5-49: 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   25. Wascher states that he did not report the alterations to the military; rather, Specialist Siewell approached Wascher two to three days later saying there was going to be an investigation concerning the alterations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   120: 11-121: 21. Wascher later learned that it was likely Conklin who informed Siewell that she suspected Rivera had altered the reports.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   123: 13-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   26. Wascher and Walker also learned later from Specialist Siewell that the deletions, in fact, occurred at Rivera's computer terminal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   133: 5-17; Walker Dep. 200: 20-202: 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   27. SFC Salinas first testified at his deposition that both Cross and Wascher brought the alterations to his attention in or about August 2013. Salinas Dep. 43: 9-15; 54: 15-55: 13. He testified later, however, that Wascher reported the problem to him verbally with no one else present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 167: 10-14; 168: 17-169: 3. Salinas \"consider[ed] this to be a serious matter\" due to the nature of the BATS system, and he reported it to Andrew Albright, DOD director of plans, training, mobilization, and security at BAF, and Sergeant Major Bianco, the garrison commander.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   55:14-56: 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   28. Thereafter, the Air Force OSI (office of special investigations) and Army CID (criminal investigation command) interviewed the Plaintiffs and \"took over\" an investigation. Deposition of SFC John Salinas, November 30, 2016 (\"Salinas Dep.\") 55: 4-57: 1. Salinas was authorized by Garrison Command to monitor the situation and instructed the security investigators, including Walker and Wascher, to meet with him periodically if they observed or experienced \"anything out of the ordinary, anything that wasn't policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   57: 7-58: 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   29. Wascher also testified that he discussed the deletions of his report with the \"Air Force OSI, United States Army Counter-Intelligence, task force biometrics, Garrison Commander Albright, Garrison Sergeant Major Bianco, and the BAF JAG office.\" Wascher Dep. 136: 24-137: 8. He told these officials that he believed Rivera deleted the information at the request of Spann, with whom she was having a sexual relationship and who was trying to help his friend, Daniel, who regretted giving the information to Wascher.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   139: 9-142: 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   30. While he was at BAF, Wascher was approached by Sergeant Shahan and asked to conduct an interview of two men who had access to the base through \"common access cards\" usually provided only to United States citizens. Wascher Dep. 238: 18-239: 7. Wascher brought up the dossiers of the men on the BATS system, but found very little information input by his fellow security investigator, Salazar.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   239: 7-24. Wascher never interviewed the men because, while he was preparing to start the interviews, Spann burst into his office yelling, \"What business do you think you have interviewing these people?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   241: 24-242: 20. Wascher reported this incident to the military agencies on base.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   243: 20-244: 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   31. Walker testified that Spann and Daniel authorized James Brown, Fluor security manager, to attend \"two or three\" of his interviews. Walker Dep. 233: 15-234: 6. Both Walker and Wascher witnessed Brown attend interviews by other security investigators, including Salazar, Lytle, and Ed Sapp.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   234: 7-12; Wascher Dep. 258: 12-259:16, 263: 4-17. They reported this conduct to Cross and SFC Salinas. Walker Dep. 234: 19-25; Wascher Dep. 262: 3-10. Wascher testified that some of the interviews related to reports of Fluor security violations and, thus, it was improper for Brown to participate in the interviews. Wascher Dep. 262: 19-263: 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   32. Wascher observed Fana, Vectrus database administrator, bring uncleared foreign females into the biometrics room, which was the most secure room in the building; he heard them have sex in the room, then saw them leave the room putting their clothes back on. Wascher Dep. 163: 8-20; 170: 1-172: 7. Wascher reported this conduct to Robin and to the military.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   33. Walker reported to his supervisors at Vectrus and to military oversight that Spann and Daniel kept at least two interpreters on staff, although they were not qualified, because the interpreters would do \"favors,\" such as \"get them things at\n   the bazaar at cut rate or get them alcohol.\" Walker Dep. 215: 21- 221: 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   34. Wascher reported to Robin and to the military that Spann ordered him and the other screeners repeatedly to use either someone else's information or a generic account number to access the BAT system; Wascher believed such access constituted a violation of the National Industrial Security Program Manual (\"NISPOM\"). Wascher Dep. 187: 20-188: 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   35. Spann testified that in early October 2013, he knew that Wascher, Lytle, and Walker were having secret meetings with SFC Salinas, counterintelligence personnel, and the Army CID. Deposition of Brandon Spann, March 20, 2017 (\"Spann Dep.\") 306: 4-308: 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   36. Spann believed that Wascher, Lytle, Cejka, and Walker were the \"worst offenders\" of a directive he gave that the screening cell personnel were required to have a Vectrus HR representative present when reporting wrongdoing to military agencies other than military oversight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   295: 17-299: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   37.

Plaintiffs' evidence reflects that Spann and Daniel considered Walker and Wascher to be \"troublemakers\" including that they were the \"worst offenders\" of Spann's directive not to meet with the military or government officials without a Vectrus supervisor or HR official present. In addition, Spann admitted knowing in early October 2013 that Walker and Wascher were having \"secret meetings with the military.\" Walker and Wascher testified that two weeks before they were transferred, Daniel announced a meeting of the security investigators, then asked for two volunteers to transfer to FOBs Shank and Marmol; Sapp and, possibly, Glover raised their hands. Nevertheless, Vectrus chose Walker and Wascher to be transferred to the FOBs in October at a time when Askew admits BAF personnel suspected that the FOBs were going to close.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Vectrus contends that Riley/Scott made the decision to transfer Walker and Wascher based solely on seniority; however, Askew specifically asked Daniel in an\n   email whether it was\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   decision to transfer Walker to FOB Shank; Daniel answered,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he and Spann had discussed it. Askew Dep. 61: 18-62: 19. The Court finds this raises a question of fact as to whether Spann and Daniel were involved in the decision-making process concerning Walker's and Wascher's transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, once they were transferred, Walker and Wascher were not allowed to return, despite the fact that BAF was almost immediately in need of security investigators due to the November 5, 2013 raid. The evidence reflects that Cleary \"pleaded\" with Vectrus to bring in experienced personnel, and when he asked about bringing Walker and Wascher back to BAF, he was told \"they were needed where they're at.\" Cleary responded, \"I was like, 'we're the biggest base with the most traffic. We need personnel here.' \" In fact, Maker recalls that Cleary stated his belief to both Maker and Diaz that Wascher would be a good replacement for Daniel, who had been debarred; Diaz responded, \"that's a company decision and we will go through our hiring process and make a decision on the appropriate person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The denials to return to BAF continued during the months Walker and Wascher worked at the FOBs. Kelly Harris testified that in the spring 2014 he and Walker were present at a meeting at FOB Shank at which Askew presided. Askew reported to the entire screening cell that Vectrus was \"downsizing\" and it \"needed investigators at [BAF] and sought volunteers to transfer from Shank to BAF.\" According to Harris, Walker was the only investigator who raised his hand and verbally volunteered to transfer to BAF, but Askew did not respond. After the meeting, Askew approached Harris in his office and asked him whether he would agree to transfer to BAF; Harris declined and encouraged Askew to speak to Walker since Harris knew Walker wanted to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Similarly, in May 2014, Michael Zink, Vectrus senior supervisor, attended a meeting with Askew, who was then Vectrus' regional manager. Vectrus was reducing positions at FOB Marmol and considering which employees should be transferred to other locations, including BAF. Zink believed that Wascher was a \"strong\" investigator, so suggested to Askew that he \"would like to see [Wascher] among those transferred back to Bagram.\" Askew refused saying that \"Wascher and Jamie Lytle had tried to take the company down,\" Askew \"did not trust Wascher who he referred to as a 'snake in the grass,' \" and \"if [Zink] had the information that Askew knew from his prior position in Employee Relations, [Zink] would not trust Wascher and would not want him at Bagram.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Importantly, Glover, who had arrived at BAF in August 2013, testified that \"everything was closing down, so the best place to be was Bagram, if you wanted to, you know, work out your contract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court finds this evidence sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact as to whether Walker's and Wascher's late October 2013 transfers to FOBs Shank and Marmol, which eventually led to their terminations during reductions in force, were imposed in retaliation for Walker's and Wascher's cooperation in the military's investigation of security violations at Vectrus. The evidence raises material issues as to whether Vectrus management considered Walker and Wascher \"troublemakers\" whom they denied returns to a facility that was not (at least, at the time) in danger of closing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870474\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/497/#p507\">\n    703 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lorenz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10358572\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/823/100/#p109\">\n    823 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   109 ) (\"Colorado law requires that an employer 'was aware, or reasonably should have been aware' that the employee's actions were legally protected.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Constructive Discharge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Vectrus argues that it did not actually terminate Walker and Wascher, but offered them \"demotions\" in lieu of termination.

A number of employees quit their jobs rather than be stationed at Shank.\" Walker testified that he was fearful of working at Shank, but stayed on because he was receiving a six-figure salary as a security investigator. Wascher testified that he was\n   very upset when he was characterized as a \"dissatisfactory\" employee during the reduction in force at Marmol.

First, there is nothing in the evidence demonstrating that FOB Marmol was any more dangerous than BAF; in fact, Wascher testified that, other than less \"permanent\" building facilities (i.e., tents vs. huts), Marmol was not much different than BAF for him in terms of security. Wascher Dep. 77: 20-81: 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As for FOB Shank, Kelly Harris testified that it was \"among the most dangerous [FOBs] in Afghanistan. [It] was attacked by direct and indirect fire nearly every day, often more than once per day.\" While this may be true, and while Walker testified that he lived in fear of the attacks while assigned there, he did not immediately \"quit\" his job \"rather than be stationed at Shank,\" as Harris testified many employees did. Moreover, and more importantly, the evidence lacks any indication that the decision to transfer Walker to Shank was reckless or motivated by an intent to harm Walker emotionally, particularly as Vectrus transferred Tom Robin to Shank at the same time Walker was transferred there. Certainly, the Plaintiffs have proffered no evidence nor argument that Robin also participated in reports to the military or, otherwise, engaged in conduct that would lead Vectrus to transfer Robin to Shank in an effort to inflict on him severe emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court finds material factual issues exist concerning whether Vectrus retaliated against Walker and Wascher by transferring them to FOBs, denying them returns to BAF, then terminating their employment after they reported potential security violations. However, the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate material factual issues regarding whether Vectrus inflicted on them severe emotional distress by transferring Walker and Wascher to allegedly \"dangerous\" FOBs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   THEREFORE, Defendant Vectrus Systems Corporation's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff Steven Wascher's and James Walker's First and Third Claims for Relief [\n   <em>\n    filed October 2, 2017; ECF No. 120\n   </em>\n   ] is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   .
