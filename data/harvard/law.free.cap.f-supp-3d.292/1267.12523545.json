The Complaint names the following Defendants: Nathan Ayers, the Assistant Principal of Etowah Middle School; Jeff Johnson, the Principal of Etowah Middle School; the Etowah Middle School; the Attalla Board of Education (the \"Board\"); and David Bowman, the Superintendent of Attalla City Schools. The Complaint also names as Defendants the following members of Attalla City Schools Board of Education: Wyman Cash, Gary Huff, Preston Nix, Deborah Dixon, and Duane Smith. The Complaint alleges that all of the Defendants are liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for \"Violation of Substantive Due Process Rights.\" (Count One). Against Ayers alone, the Complaint sets out claims under Alabama law for battery, negligence, and wantonness. (Counts Two, Four, and Five respectively). Against Johnson, Bowman, the Etowah Middle School, and the Board, the Complaint sets out the Alabama state law claim for negligent supervision and training. (Count Three).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Complaint alleges\n   that all of the Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to commit battery. (Count Six). All Counts arise out of a paddling which Ayers administered to C.M.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The case comes before the Court on the Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (the \"Motion\"). (Doc. 20).

All dismissals, except for Etowah Middle School, will be\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   prejudice. Etowah Middle School will be dismissed\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice. Furthermore, the Plaintiff agrees that Count Three, the negligent supervision claim, is due to be dismissed as well. (Doc. 21 at 9). That claim will be dismissed\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice as to all Defendants except the Board. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 21 at 9, n. 10).

The teacher referred C.M.H. to Assistant Principal Ayers's office for discipline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   28. Ayers decided to paddle C.M.H. despite the fact that it was C.M.H.'s first time to be in trouble at Etowah Middle and the offense involved was, at best, minor, at worst, a mere miscommunication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   29.

Early the next week, Wells met with Ayers and school nurse Krystal Moon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   40.

Ayers was arrested for child abuse on December 16, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   48. The Attalla City Schools Board of Education sided with Ayers and did not discipline him for his actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   49.

A teacher, principal, or assistant principal may punish corporally; but, only in the presence of a principal or assistant principal (preferably the same sex as the offender), who should be informed beforehand of the reasons for the punishment.

The instrument used to corporally punish should be wisely selected and approved by the principal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   E.

Other forms of corporal punishment are not permitted in the schools of the School System.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   F. Utmost care, tact, and judgment shall be exercised; and all cases of corporal punishment shall be documented by both the person administering the punishment and the witness and delivered to the principal. Such documentation shall be submitted by the end of the day the incident occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   G. School principals, assistant principals, or teachers who have administered corporal punishment shall provide the student's parents or guardians, upon request, a written explanation of the reason(s) and the name of the witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   H.
