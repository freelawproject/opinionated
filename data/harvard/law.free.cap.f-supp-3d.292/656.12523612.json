Payne, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on DEFENDANT JELD-WEN, INC.'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNTS I AND IV OF PLAINTIFF STEVES AND SONS, INC.'S COMPLAINT (ECF No. 375). For\n   the reasons set forth below, the motion was denied, except on the issue of future lost profits damages under Count One, as to which the Court ordered further briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 578. The Court has considered that briefing in the context of JELD-WEN, Inc.'s (\"JELD-WEN\") motion for judgment as a matter of law on the future lost profits damages claim at trial, after Steves and Sons, Inc. (\"Steves\") had put on its fact witnesses. Accordingly, only the ripeness of that claim, and not its validity, is addressed in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Pre-2012 Interior Molded Doorskin Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Steves and JELD-WEN are both participants in the interior molded doorskin market in the United States. That type of doorskin is used to make interior molded doors, which are built to resemble solid wood doors at a much lower cost. Interior molded doorskin manufacturers create and ship doorskins to assembly plants, where molded door manufacturers use the doorskins to build door slabs that are then sold to retailers or distributors. Steves is an independent door manufacturer that is currently unable to produce its own doorskins, and has never done so. As a result, it must purchase doorskins from doorskin manufacturers. JELD-WEN, however, is a vertically integrated door manufacturer, meaning that it both produces doorskins and uses those doorskins internally to manufacture and sell finished doors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before 2012, Steves and other independent door manufacturers purchased interior molded doorskins from three main suppliers: JELD-WEN, CraftMaster Manufacturing, Inc. (\"CMI\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Masonite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like JELD-WEN, CMI and Masonite were both vertically integrated manufacturers of interior molded doorskins and doors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Execution of Supply Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 1, 2012, Steves and JELD-WEN entered into a long-term supply agreement (\"the Supply Agreement\"), pursuant to which Steves would purchase,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , interior molded doorskins from JELD-WEN. ECF No. 379-2 (Under Seal) \u00a7 1; JELD-WEN's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (ECF No. 379) (Under Seal) (\"Def. SUMF\") \u00b6 1. The Supply Agreement would be in effect through December 31, 2019, but would automatically renew for a successive seven-year term at that time unless either party terminated the contract. Supply Agreement \u00a7 2. The Agreement further provided that Steves could terminate it for any reason upon two-year written notice to JELD-WEN, and that JELD-WEN could likewise terminate it without cause upon seven-year\n   written notice to Steves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3(a) (2) (b); Def. SUMF \u00b6 2; Steves' Statement of Additional Material Facts (ECF No. 452) (Under Seal) (\"Pl. SAMF\") \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the Supply Agreement, Steves had to purchase at least 80% of its interior molded doorskin requirements from JELD-WEN. Pl. SAMF \u00b6 2. Steves could, however, purchase any quantity of doorskins from another supplier that offered a price at least 3% lower than JELD-WEN's purchase price, after JELD-WEN had the chance to match that lower price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3; Supply Agreement \u00a7 4. The prices that JELD-WEN would charge Steves for doorskins were variable and were calculated using a formula based on JELD-WEN's key input costs. Supply Agreement \u00a7 6(c). In addition, the contract obligated JELD-WEN to provide Steves with doorskin products of satisfactory quality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8. Finally, if any disputes arose under the Agreement, the parties were required to participate in an alternative dispute resolution process before initiating litigation. That process began with an internal conference between the parties' senior executives, and then mediation if the conference was unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. JELD-WEN's Acquisition of CMI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 15, 2012, JELD-WEN and CMI announced that JELD-WEN was acquiring CMI and merging CMI's operations and assets into JELD-WEN (\"the CMI Acquisition\"), pending due diligence and the signing of a definitive agreement. Def. SUMF \u00b6 14. Although Steves knew before it executed the Supply Agreement that JELD-WEN was planning to purchase CMI, Steves and JELD-WEN did not condition the effectiveness of that contract on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the merger. Steves was aware at that time that the Acquisition would reduce the U.S.-based doorskin manufacturers to only JELD-WEN and Masonite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 17, 2012, the DOJ's Antitrust Division notified JELD-WEN that it had opened a preliminary investigation into the proposed CMI Acquisition. Steves indicated to the DOJ that it did not oppose the merger. The Antitrust Division closed its investigation on September 28, 2012 without having taken any action to prevent the CMI Acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. The Acquisition was then completed on October 24, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the merger, JELD-WEN closed the head office of CMI in Chicago, as well as two of CMI's four door manufacturing plants, and transitioned CMI's sales staff into JELD-WEN's organizational structure. JELD-WEN also shut down its own doorskin manufacturing plants in Iowa and North Carolina. In addition to those broader changes, JELD-WEN consolidated the JELD-WEN and CMI doorskin dies into one portfolio, retired more than one hundred obsolete dies, and reduced the number of doorskin designs from 31 to 19.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   JELD-WEN also acquired CMI's Towanda plant. JELD-WEN subsequently constructed a $1.6 million paint plant inside that building, and JELD-WEN's MiraTec and Extira products are now manufactured at the Towanda plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The effect of this consolidation of operations at the Towanda plant is disputed. JELD-WEN contends that it cannot physically separate the manufacturing lines for the MiraTec and Extira products from the doorskin manufacturing lines that are also at the Towanda plant,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, but Steves points to evidence that JELD-WEN has not conducted an extensive analysis of the effects of a divestiture order with respect to the plant, Pl. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Post-Merger Interactions Between Steves and JELD-WEN\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the merger, JELD-WEN's key input costs declined, and have continued to\n   do so in most years since then. The parties disagree about whether these declining costs are the result of JELD-WEN having acquired the low-cost Towanda plant, or whether the input costs for JELD-WEN's \"legacy\" plants would have declined notwithstanding the CMI Acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Despite these declining costs, however, Steves claims that JELD-WEN has increased the prices it charges Steves to purchase doorskins under the Supply Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Steves also highlights documents indicating that JELD-WEN might have imposed price increases for certain doorskins that JELD-WEN believed were outside the scope of the Supply Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Some JELD-WEN employees also acknowledged quality problems with the company's doorskins after the CMI Acquisition, and Steves complained to JELD-WEN about the declining quality of the doorskins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Moreover, Steves cites evidence that JELD-WEN made it more difficult after the merger for external customers, such as Steves, to return defective products. It is unclear, however, whether these problems were caused by the CMI Acquisition. Indeed, JELD-WEN began internal testing of thinner doorskins in early 2012, and informed Steves before the Acquisition was consummated that it had reduced the target thickness of its doorskins. Def. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The acrimony between Steves and JELD-WEN peaked in July 2014 when, according to Steves, JELD-WEN demanded that Steves agree to a new pricing structure for the Supply Agreement, including a \"capital charge\"-an 11% increase in the price of doorskins. JELD-WEN asserts that it never made this demand, noting that Steves has never paid any capital charge under the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. In any event, shortly thereafter, on September 10, 2014, JELD-WEN provided Steves with notice of termination of the Supply Agreement. Consequently, the Agreement will terminate on September 10, 2021.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties present conflicting evidence about JELD-WEN's interest in continuing to sell doorskins to Steves after that date. Steves claims that JELD-WEN has refused to provide Steves with any proposal for terms of a new long-term supply agreement, but JELD-WEN insists that it has told Steves it is interested in negotiating future doorskin sales after 2021. Notwithstanding this dispute, the parties agree that JELD-WEN has supplied doorskins to Steves since giving notice of termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Steves' Efforts to Obtain Alternative Doorskin Supply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After JELD-WEN notified Steves that it would terminate the Supply Agreement, Steves began to explore ways to produce or acquire interior molded doorskins without relying on JELD-WEN.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. One other supplier that Steves considered was Masonite. However, in July 2014, Masonite announced that it would no longer sell doorskins to third parties. Whether Masonite is, or ever was, amenable to selling doorskins to Steves at reasonable prices is highly disputed. Steves points to documents indicating that, after the merger, Masonite has not entered into long-term supply agreements with any third-party customers; will not negotiate the price of its doorskins; limits external sales of doorskins to customers or products with which Masonite does not compete; cannot sell Steves enough doorskins to meet Steves' needs; and has only offered Steves doorskins at prices much higher than prices Masonite offered in 2012, or prices JELD-WEN charged under the Supply Agreement in 2015. Pl. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 16-22. JELD-WEN, however, claims that some evidence indicates that Masonite would sell\n   doorskins to Steves at standard prices; that Masonite has sold doorskins to external customers from 2010 to 2016; and that Steves has not determined whether the 2015 prices that Masonite quoted to Steves would be unprofitable for Steves. Def. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Steves has also pursued relationships with foreign doorskin suppliers like Teverpan, Kastamonu, and Yildiz, although it is unclear whether those suppliers can provide Steves with the quantity and range of doorskins that Steves requires. Negotiations with those suppliers are at various stages. Pl. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 24-27. Some evidence indicates that Steves could obtain doorskins from Teverpan at prices more than 3% lower than those JELD-WEN charges under the Supply Agreement, but other evidence suggests that the quality of doorskins from foreign suppliers is inadequate to satisfy Steves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Steves has considered becoming vertically integrated by building its own doorskin manufacturing plant. The parties disagree about how long this process might take. JELD-WEN highlights evidence indicating that the timeline is closer to two years, and Steves has presented evidence showing that three to four years is a more realistic estimate. In any event, Steves has not yet identified a partner to help it build any manufacturing facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Initiation of Alternative Dispute Resolution Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In January 2015, consistent with the Supply Agreement, Steves requested an affidavit from JELD-WEN supporting its announced price increases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Then, in March 2015, Steves demanded an internal conference to resolve its dispute with JELD-WEN over doorskin pricing and quality issues. When no resolution was reached, the parties participated in mediation, and then entered into a standstill agreement regarding Steves' claims under the Supply Agreement and \"the antitrust laws.\" Even after mediation, the parties continued settlement discussions, and agreed to four extensions of the standstill agreement between September 2015 and April 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, that agreement did not at any point explicitly prevent Steves from filing an antitrust claim. Def. SUMF \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following the failure of the parties' required dispute resolution process, Steves initiated this action on June 29, 2016, asserting antitrust and contract claims against JELD-WEN related to the CMI Acquisition and JELD-WEN's alleged breach of the Supply Agreement. Complaint (ECF No. 5) (Under Seal). The Complaint contained the following claims: COUNT ONE, a claim under the Clayton Act, Section 7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; COUNT TWO, Breach of Contract; COUNT THREE, Breach of Warranty; COUNT FOUR, Declaratory Judgment, concerning certain rights under the Supply Agreement and the putative termination of that contract; COUNT FIVE, Specific Performance, regarding the Supply Agreement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   and COUNT SIX, Trespass to Chattels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 175-206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count One sought two forms of relief. It primarily requested injunctive relief pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2026\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to force JELD-WEN to divest assets sufficient to: (1) create a doorskin manufacturer with the same market significance that CMI had before the Acquisition; or (2) restore the interior molded doorskin market to its competitive state before the CMI Acquisition. Alternatively, Steves sought treble damages pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for injuries suffered by Steves as a result of the anticompetitive effects of the CMI Acquisition, including JELD-WEN's refusal to sell doorskins to Steves at prices consistent with the Supply Agreement and JELD-WEN's termination of the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 5, 2016, JELD-WEN moved to dismiss Count One for failure to state a claim. ECF No. 20. The Court denied that motion on October 21, 2016, concluding that the Complaint plausibly alleged that the CMI Acquisition violated Section 7 by causing higher doorskin prices, lower doorskin quality, reduced doorskin output, and increased coordination between JELD-WEN and Masonite, and that these anticompetitive effects impacted both Steves and the broader doorskin market. ECF No. 64. At a pretrial conference on October 19, 2016, the matter was set for trial to begin on June 12, 2017, and a detailed schedule for the conduct of pretrial proceedings was thereafter implemented. ECF No. 65. Pursuant to that schedule, the parties engaged in extensive discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 27, 2017, JELD-WEN sought leave to amend its Answer and to add counterclaims against Steves based on JELD-WEN's recent detection, from documents produced by Steves during discovery, of \"Steves' theft of JELD-WEN trade secrets and confidential information.\" ECF No. 101 at 1-2. In relevant part, the counterclaims alleged that Steves and two former JELD-WEN employees, John Pierce and John Ambruz (\"Ambruz\"), had engaged in a conspiracy to steal trade secrets from JELD-WEN concerning how to build and operate a doorskin plant that could produce the type of doorskins that Steves was buying from JELD-WEN under the Supply Agreement. Although the Court granted JELD-WEN leave to assert the counterclaims, the Court also ordered that they be tried separately from the antitrust and contract claims. ECF Nos. 239-240. Trial for the counterclaims is set to begin on April 9, 2018, and the parties are proceeding on a separate pretrial schedule for that case. ECF No. 374. Those counterclaims are not relevant to the Court's decision on summary judgment here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After completing discovery, Steves and JELD-WEN both moved for summary judgment on September 22, 2017. Steves sought a ruling from the Court that it had established its prima facie case under Count One that the CMI Acquisition is likely to have anticompetitive effects in the interior molded doorskin market. ECF No. 381. The Court denied Steves' motion on November 21, 2017, based on the Court's finding at oral argument that there were genuine disputes of material fact as to whether Steves had satisfied the elements of its prima facie case. ECF No. 575.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   JELD-WEN sought summary judgment on Count One, as to both the divestiture claim and the claim for future lost profits damages caused by the CMI Acquisition,\n   and Count Four. On November 27, 2017, the Court denied JELD-WEN's motion to the extent it sought summary judgment on Count One's divestiture claim and Count Four, for reasons to be explained in a forthcoming memorandum opinion. ECF No. 578. However, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the question of whether JELD-WEN was entitled to summary judgment on Steves' future lost profits damages claim under Count One. ECF Nos. 574, 578.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on December 1, 2017, JELD-WEN notified the Court that Steves had recently produced to JELD-WEN more than two hundred pages of handwritten notes of Gregory Wysock (\"Wysock\"), a Steves employee whose testimony is relevant to certain aspects of Steves' claims. ECF No. 603. After allowing JELD-WEN to conduct a supplemental deposition of Wysock, the Court granted JELD-WEN's request to conduct limited additional discovery of Wysock, Sam Steves II, and Ambruz based on information obtained during that deposition. The Court also amended the briefing schedule for the supplemental briefs as to Steves' future lost profits damages claim under Section 7, to allow the parties to include evidence from Wysock's deposition and recently-produced notes. ECF No. 732. As a result, JELD-WEN's motion for summary judgment did not become ripe for decision on all issues contained therein until January 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court then heard further argument on the future lost profits damages claim at the Final Pretrial Conference on January 22 and 26, 2018. It did not, however, decide whether summary judgment should be granted on that claim before trial commenced. Instead, the Court allowed Steves to present evidence at trial to attempt to establish a factual predicate upon which the jury could determine the fact and amount of the future lost profits damages with reasonable certainty. On February 6, 2018, after Steves had introduced that evidence but before its damages expert presented his future lost profits damages estimates, JELD-WEN moved for a judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) on the future lost profits claim-effectively converting its motion for summary judgment on that issue to a motion for judgment as a matter of law. The Court denied that motion, but its reasons for doing so are irrelevant here. In any event, having entertained Steves' trial evidence about future lost profits damages, the Court will not consider in this opinion whether summary judgment on that claim would have been appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Count One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   JELD-WEN seeks summary judgment on Count One on three grounds. First, it contends that Steves has not suffered any antitrust injury from the CMI Acquisition that is separate from the contract injury caused by JELD-WEN's alleged breach of the Supply Agreement. Moreover, JELD-WEN says, even if its breach of contract could have caused cognizable antitrust harm, Steves has not shown that any anticompetitive effects of the Acquisition impacted Steves by forcing it to pay higher prices or receive lower quality doorskins. Second, JELD-WEN asserts that Steves' claim for future lost profits damages is not ripe because those damages are based on speculation about future antitrust injury. Alternatively, those future damages depend on the occurrence of certain future events and are thus entirely speculative. Third, Steves' divestiture claim is barred by the doctrine of laches and because Steves cannot show a significant threat of antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Existence of Antitrust Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   JELD-WEN's first argument is that Steves' injuries do not satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Brunswick\n   </em>\n   definition of antitrust injury because those harms arose under the Supply Agreement, not because of any reduced competition from the CMI Acquisition. JELD-WEN compares this case to others in which courts rejected Section 4 claims based on injuries that were linked to defendant's breach of an existing contract between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orion Pictures Distribution Corp. v. Syufy Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758381\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/946/#p949\">\n    829 F.2d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949 (9th Cir. 1987) (movie theater owner's repudiation of guarantees owed to film distributor by contract, after owner acquired competitor, was not antitrust\n   injury because \"[owner]'s duties to [distributor] were fixed by its contractual commitment to pay guarantees,\" so \"competition was no longer a factor in determining [owner]'s obligation to [distributor]\"). Noting that the parties entered into the Supply Agreement five months before the CMI Acquisition closed, JELD-WEN argues that, as in those cases, Steves' injuries (JELD-WEN's price increases under the Supply Agreement and its refusal to reimburse Steves for claims of defective doorskins) stem from the contract rather than as a consequence of the lessening of competition as a result of the CMI Acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This argument mischaracterizes Steves' Section 4 claim and ignores key differences between this case and those cited by JELD-WEN. As JELD-WEN acknowledges, contractual harm can still constitute antitrust injury even if the parties' actions are bound by a contract. The relevant question is not whether the contract itself predated the anticompetitive effects at issue, but instead whether \"the only\n   <em>\n    competition\n   </em>\n   alleged to be injured predated\" the anticompetitive activity.\n   <em>\n    Z Channel Ltd. P'ship v.

In\n   <em>\n    Orion Pictures\n   </em>\n   , there was no antitrust injury because \"the injury to competition in that case (allegedly acquiring monopoly power) had ended before the ... injury (loss of revenue from the broken contract) occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1801821\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/931/1338/#p1342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1345 n.10. Here, by contrast, competition was not eliminated by the time that the doorskin pricing and quality injuries occurred. To the contrary, Steves asserts that the Supply Agreement contained provisions intended to preserve competition: for instance, the requirement that Steves purchase only 80% of its doorskins from JELD-WEN, or the allowance of purchases from other suppliers if JELD-WEN could not match their low prices. Consequently, breaches of the Supply Agreement can also be considered antitrust injuries to the extent that they resulted from the reduced competition under that contract that was facilitated by the CMI Acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Steves has produced sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of fact on this issue. It has shown at least that the Acquisition may have allowed JELD-WEN to raise prices under the Supply Agreement or provide lower quality doorskins because the merger undercut Steves' ability to seek favorable prices or higher-quality doorskins from other suppliers. JELD-WEN claims that there is no evidence to support these theories, but the post-merger availability of alternate supply-from either Teverpan or Masonite, both of which JELD-WEN focuses on-is a subject of intense dispute. In addition, Steves has presented evidence indicating that the merger permitted JELD-WEN to raise prices on Madison and Monroe doorskins, to coordinate with Masonite to limit doorskin supply to the market, and to terminate the Supply Agreement in September 2014 because of JELD-WEN's enhanced market power. A jury could conclude that these steps were \"anticompetitive acts made possible by the [CMI Acquisition].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brunswick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    429 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6310\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/477/#p489\">\n    97 S.Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, even if is not extensive, this evidence raises a genuine dispute about whether Steves has suffered an antitrust injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Impact from Anticompetitive Effects\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   JELD-WEN further contends that, even if JELD-WEN's breaches of the Supply Agreement could establish antitrust injury, Steves has not shown that those injuries are causally linked to the CMI Acquisition. In the antitrust context, the injury element \"is often referred to as impact or fact of damage. It is the causal link between the antitrust violation and\n   the damages sought by plaintiffs[,] [and] thus requires both injury-in-fact and a showing that the injury is the result of the antitrust activity.\"\n   <em>\n    In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp.

Thus, for example, proof of impact in a Section 4 case can be shown by proof of what price the plaintiff would have paid had the merger never occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Steves asserts that its liability expert, Carl Shapiro (\"Shapiro\"), did not conduct an empirical analysis of the prices that JELD-WEN would have charged absent the Acquisition because he did not need to: the Supply Agreement set the competitive benchmark of prevailing doorskin prices before the merger. JELD-WEN certainly disagrees that the Agreement is an accurate benchmark, but the weight of Shapiro's analysis is a question for the jury, not the Court. Moreover, evidence indicates that JELD-WEN increased doorskin prices from pre-merger levels even as key input costs at JELD-WEN's legacy plants declined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, there is genuine evidence that the decrease in JELD-WEN's doorskin quality was exacerbated by the CMI Acquisition-even if JELD-WEN had begun to thin its doorskins before the merger-and that customers other than Steves suffered from quality issues. This circumstantial evidence is sufficient to create a dispute about whether the Acquisition caused anticompetitive effects that impacted Steves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zenith Radio I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771915\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/100/\">\n    395 U.S. at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771915\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/100/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (circumstantial evidence was sufficient to \"sustain the inference\" of impact).

Future Lost Profits Damages Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   JELD-WEN makes two separate arguments as to Steves' Section 4 claim for\n   future lost profits damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, it asserts that the claim is not ripe, as Steves' future damages relate to an antitrust injury that Steves may never suffer. Second, JELD-WEN contends that even if those damages are based on an existing antitrust injury, Steves cannot recover them because they are unreasonably speculative. As noted, the Court reserved its decision on the second argument until Steves had presented evidence at trial, so the validity of Steves' future lost profits damages claim is not discussed in this opinion. However, because the ripeness contention calls into question the Court's jurisdiction over that claim at trial, the Court will address it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Article III of the Constitution limits federal courts to deciding actual \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

The disagreement on this issue concerns whether to characterize the injury causing the future damages as a present injury or a future injury. Steves contends that those damages stem from JELD-WEN's 2014 termination of the Supply Agreement. That injury, says Steves, is a consequence of the CMI Acquisition, which enhanced JELD-WEN's power in the interior molded doorskin market and allowed it to make long-term decisions that would limit the ability of competing door manufacturers to obtain a stable doorskin supply. As a result, whatever damages Steves incurs when the Supply Agreement terminates in September 2021 will relate to a previous anticompetitive act that impacted Steves long before 2021.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   JELD-WEN, on the other hand, concedes that claims for\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   injuries from the CMI Acquisition may be ripe-such as, presumably, increased door prices. Nonetheless, it insists that Steves will only incur lost profits damages if it suffers another antitrust injury in 2021, when JELD-WEN stops providing Steves with doorskins and Steves cannot obtain an alternate doorskin supply. JELD-WEN asserts that even if that harm could be linked to the CMI Acquisition, its occurrence necessarily requires speculation about whether certain intervening events will come to pass. Specifically, the parties must fail to enter into another long-term doorskin supply agreement, JELD-WEN must refuse to supply doorskins to Steves on commercially viable terms, Steves must be unable to find any other source of doorskin supply, and Steves must go out of business or suffer a substantial loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This framing of the injury relies on the Supreme Court's discussion of antitrust injury and damages in\n   <em>\n    Zenith Radio Corp. v.

Rather, the relevant question is whether JELD-WEN has shown that there is no genuine dispute about the reasonableness of Steves' delay or the prejudice to JELD-WEN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The evidence in the record shows that JELD-WEN has not met that burden. The application of laches is generally a fact-intensive analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532705\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/99/#p102\">\n    909 F.2d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hether laches bars an action depends upon the particular circumstances of the case.\"). And here, unresolved factual questions remain as to both prongs of the laches inquiry. First, with respect to Steves' delay, it is unclear when Steves believed that the CMI Acquisition would have anticompetitive effects, given the possibility that doorskin prices and quality might have been protected by the Supply Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PBM Prods.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200740\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/111/#p121\">\n    639 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, evidence suggests that Steves acted promptly once it learned of JELD-WEN's anticompetitive conduct, initiating the requisite dispute resolution procedure under that Agreement. Second, even assuming JELD-WEN's burden is\n   lower in light of the length of Steves' delay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532705\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/99/#p102\">\n    909 F.2d at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the degree of prejudice is uncertain, as the parties dispute the costliness of integrating JELD-WEN's and CMI's operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that these issues are unresolved, summary judgment on the basis of laches is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Threat of Antitrust Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Of course, to prevail on its divestiture claim, Steves still must be able to demonstrate \"a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws or from a contemporary violation likely to continue or recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Zenith Radio I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771915\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/100/\">\n    395 U.S. at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771915\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/100/\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garabet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190404\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/116/1159/#p1172\">\n    116 F.Supp.2d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Section 16 requires a threatened loss or injury cognizable in equity ... proximately resulting from an antitrust violation.\" (internal quotations omitted) ). JELD-WEN asserts that Steves cannot do so because its speculative claims of future injury are belied by evidence that Steves can obtain alternative doorskin supply once its contractual relationship with JELD-WEN ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   This argument fails for the same reasons as JELD-WEN's assertions regarding Steves' damages claim. JELD-WEN's contention that potential future injury could be prevented by Steves' efforts to find another doorskin supplier or manufacture doorskins itself is mistaken, because the evidence of Steves' ability to do either is disputed. Moreover, there is a genuine disagreement-supported by evidence on both sides-about whether the CMI Acquisition has already caused anticompetitive effects that are likely to continue or recur.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.

JELD-WEN contends that there is no controversy about the termination date of the Agreement because, notwithstanding its previous position, it now agrees that the termination date is September 10, 2021, and that it will supply Steves with doorskins until that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, disputes about the credibility of JELD-WEN's current stance prevent summary judgment on Count Four. As recently as March 2015, JELD-WEN asserted that the proper termination date under the Supply Agreement was ambiguous, and reserved the right to argue that the Agreement terminated on the original December 31, 2019 date, rather than seven years after JELD-WEN gave notice of termination-that is, September 10, 2021. ECF No. 452-64 (Under Seal) \u00b6 13. JELD-WEN now claims that its position has changed and it believes that the later date is correct.
