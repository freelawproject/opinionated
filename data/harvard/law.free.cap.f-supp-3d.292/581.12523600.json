Derek L. Diggett seeks attorney's fees under the EAJA after this Court ruled in his favor concerning his application for Social Security disability benefits. The Commissioner objects to an award of fees claiming that she was \"substantially justified\" in defending the case. Alternatively, the Commissioner urges the Court to reduce the fee requested. After a review of the Commissioner's actions and having studied and reviewed the entire record in this case, the Court finds that the Commissioner has failed in her burden of proving that her position was substantially justified and that Mr. Diggett's attorney's fees are reasonable.

The ALJ's decision denying benefits, adopted by the Commissioner, ignored a significant change in Mr. Diggett's condition-his weight gain.

Mr. Diggett is entitled to attorney's fees under EAJA; now the Court turns to the Commissioner's challenge to the reasonableness of the hours and rate that Mr. Diggett's attorney requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his motion, Mr. Diggett requests a total award of $20,937.56, which represents the original request of 88.2 hours\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a total of $17,273.30 plus the additional $3,664.26 for the 18.7 hours spent in 2017 responding to the Commissioner's objection to the EAJA fee request. The Commissioner arbitrarily proposes that the Court limit Mr. Diggett to 40 hours at the EAJA's statutory rate of $125 per hour not to include any annual cost of living adjustment. The Commissioner initially offered no support for this proposition except its bald assertion that the case was \"garden variety,\" but in her sur-reply, she points to average EAJA fees in some other jurisdictions that are substantially less than the fees requested here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously noted, the Court is required to render an independent judgment about whether Mr. Diggett is entitled to fees under the EAJA and what a reasonable fee is in the circumstances of his case. This Court finds after having presided over this case, that the work done by counsel was appropriate, thorough, and of exceptional quality. His hours and rate, to include a cost of living adjustment, are more than reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Diggett's Motion for EAJA Fees (ECF No. 22) is GRANTED and he is awarded $20,937.56. The Commissioner's motion for oral argument is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The Commissioner does not contest that Mr. Diggett is an eligible party or a prevailing party. (ECF No. 23\n    <em>\n     passim\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Mr. Diggett's attorney spent 2.9 hours in 2016 at the EAJA adjusted rate of $192.68/hour and 85.3 hours in 2017 at the EAJA adjusted rate of $195.95/hour.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The average amount paid in these jurisdictions (Eastern District of Michigan, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Western District of Michigan) is between $4000 and $6000. This is perhaps where the Commissioner came up with the suggestion that 40 hour times $125/hour formula is reasonable in this case. That formula would total a $5000 award.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
