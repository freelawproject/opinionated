MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff Ann Holiday received a statement from Navient Solutions, Inc. (\"NSI\"), a loan servicing company, reflecting a balance of $45,000 for multiple student loans purportedly made to her son, Plaintiff Anwar Armstrong. Asserting that they took out a single student loan for only $9,000, Plaintiffs allege that they contacted NSI to dispute the account balance and that NSI failed to correct the error. Instead, according to Plaintiffs, NSI reported the incorrect loan balance to consumer reporting agencies, which, in turn, used the faulty information from NSI to generate credit reports that negatively affected Armstrong's ability to secure employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, alleging that NSI violated the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\") by making a \"misleading\n   statement ... regarding their credit worthiness and credit balances.\" Dkt. 2-2 at 4 (Compl. \u00b6 14). They also asserted common law claims for negligence and breach of contract, alleging that NSI \"breached its duty of care by failing to safeguard [Plaintiffs'] information, and failing to correct errors in their account balances,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (Compl. \u00b6 26), and breached its contract with Plaintiffs by \"not revers[ing] or adjust[ing] erroneous charges ... and [by] assert[ing] an invalid account balance,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (Compl. \u00b6 20). NSI removed the action to this Court, and now moves to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 5. NSI asserts that all three of Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and, alternatively, that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that the FCRA preempts Plaintiffs' CPPA and negligence claims in part. In addition, the Court concludes that any non-preempted portion of Plaintiffs' negligence claims fails to state a claim, as does Plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract. With respect to the non-preempted portion of Plaintiffs' CPPA claim, it is unclear whether Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to sustain Article III standing. The Court will, accordingly, grant NSI's motion to dismiss in part and deny it in part, and will direct that the parties show cause why the remaining portion of Plaintiffs' CPPA claim should not be dismissed (or remanded) for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

That fact, however, is far from compelling. As the Seventh Circuit has explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   we do not perceive any inconsistency between the two statutes. Section 1681h(e) preempts some state claims that could arise out of reports to credit agencies; \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F) preempts more of these claims. Section 1681h(e) does not create a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to recover for wil[l]fully false reports; it just says that a particular paragraph does not preempt claims of that stripe. Section 1681h(e) was enacted in 1970. Twenty-six years later, in 1996, Congress added \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F) to the United States Code. The same legislation also added \u00a7 1681s-2. The extra federal remedy in \u00a7 1681s-2 was accompanied by extra preemption in \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F), in order to implement the new plan under which reporting to credit agencies would be supervised by state and federal administrative agencies rather than judges. Reading the earlier statute, \u00a7 1681h(e), to defeat the later-enacted system in \u00a7 1681s-2 and \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F), would contradict fundamental norms of statutory interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   .... [T]he statutes are compatible: the first-enacted statute preempts some state regulation of reports to credit agencies, and the second-enacted statute preempts more.... This understanding does not vitiate the final words of \u00a7 1681h(e), because there are exceptions to \u00a7 1681t(b)(1)(F). When it drops out, \u00a7 1681h(e) remains.
