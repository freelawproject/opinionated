For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Remand is due to be denied, and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is due to be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The present lawsuit relates to an earlier medical malpractice action brought by VEV (\"Plaintiff\"), a minor, by and through Victoria Vestal and Emmanel Vestal, VEV's parents. On February 22, 2013, VEV was injured in an automobile accident. (Doc. 2, \u00b6 8). The complaint alleges that VEV's healthcare providers were negligent, resulting in severe injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Plaintiff then filed a medical malpractice suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   12). Defendant, Armando Payas (\"Payas\"), was appointed guardian ad litem to VEV and was a named defendant in the malpractice case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7). Plaintiff alleges Payas is an attorney licensed in Florida, and maintains a regular office in Florida. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 7, 2017, Defendant First Recovery Group, LLC (\"FRG\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   advised Plaintiff it was asserting a $14,089.79 subrogation lien in connection with the suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). In reliance of FRG's representation, Plaintiff settled the medical malpractice lawsuit; the settlement was approved by a court on May 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14). Subsequently, on July 18, 2017, FRG advised Plaintiff that it was actually asserting a $144,861.95 subrogation lien. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This suit followed. On July 26, 2017, Plaintiff filed a state court complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that FRG is only entitled to recover $14,089.79 for Medicaid claims paid on VEV's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). On August 29, 2017, FRG removed to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1). In the Notice of Removal, FRG asserted that Payas is not a proper defendant, and that the parties are completely diverse if Payas is properly disregarded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Motion for Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff now moves to remand to state court, arguing that removal was improper for two reasons: (1) the parties are not completely diverse, and (2) Plaintiff failed to obtain consent from all Defendants to\n   remove. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 37). Plaintiff contends that Payas is a proper defendant in this suit, thus complete diversity of citizenship is absent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 32, 35). Moreover, because Payas was a proper defendant, FRG was required to obtain Payas' consent as a pre-requisite to removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant counters that Plaintiff fraudulently joined Payas to defeat diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 14, \u00b6 6). Defendant avers that no \"bona fide controversy\" exists between VEV and Payas, VEV's guardian ad litem, thus barring Payas from being joined as a defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1.

(Doc. 3, pp. 7-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Challenges to subject matter jurisdiction come in two forms: \"facial attacks\" and \"factual attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v.

Facial attacks only require the court to determine if the plaintiff has alleged a sufficient basis for subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245118\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1525/#p1528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245118\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1525/#p1528\">\n    at 1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, courts may consider information outside of the pleadings-including testimony, affidavits, and other evidence-and may make factual findings to resolve the motion.\n   <em>\n    McElmurray v.

Subject matter jurisdiction must exist at the time the action is commenced, and the party who invokes a federal court's subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the propriety of exercising that jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mas v.

Because the same result is reached under either characterization, the Court will assume without deciding that FRG's subject matter jurisdiction characterization is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to FRG, the MTPLA prescribes an administrative appeals process that must be exhausted before filing a lawsuit, (Doc. 3, pp. 8-9), and Plaintiff's failure to follow that procedure before bringing this action deprives the Court of jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11). In response, Plaintiff avers that an earlier version of the MTPLA applies which does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. (Doc. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26). Plaintiff asserts that, because the lien at issue attached \"on\n   or before March 15, 2013,\" more than three months before the amended MTPLA went into effect, the pre-amendment MTPLA governs this case.

(Doc. 27, \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Declaratory judgment is proper only where an actual controversy is before the court. The Florida Supreme Court has held that all \"antagonistic and adverse interest[s]\" must be present in an action as a precondition to the entry of declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    May v. Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20So.%202d%20636\">\n    59 So.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639 (Fla. 1952).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court agrees that FRG is the improper Defendant in this action. The Complaint alleges that FRG acted as an agent to represent WellCare in connection with subrogation and/or lien rights belonging to WellCare. FRG has no legal claim to the funds purportedly subject to WellCare's lien. Therefore, in this action seeking a declaration as to the amount of\n   <em>\n    WellCare's\n   </em>\n   statutory lien, the proper Defendant is Wellcare, not FRG. That FRG acted as WellCare's agent does not disturb the conclusion that Plaintiff and WellCare are the parties with antagonistic legal interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
