(Docket No. 130.) For the reasons set forth below, Montijo's motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denied in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Montijo's motion is granted as to the section 2422 count, and Montijo may raise a \"mistake of age\" defense as to that count. Montijo may not, however, raise a \"mistake of age\" defense to the charges brought under section 2423 for the reasons the Court has previously indicated. (Docket Nos. 98 &amp; 124.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Montijo has observed correctly, the Court's prior written decision precluding Montijo from raising a \"mistake of age\" defense are in relation only to the charges brought pursuant to section 2423. (Docket No. 124.) The Court reiterates that it will not permit Montijo to raise a \"mistake of age\" defense as to the section 2423 charges because this defense is legally impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Guivas-Soto\n   </em>\n   , Crim. No. 14-80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203439100\">\n    2015 WL 3439100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2070052\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 (D.P.R. May 29, 2015) (Besosa, J.) (observing that \"knowledge of the victim's age is not an element of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202423\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and therefore mistake as to age is not an available defense.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Tavares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659040\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/4/#p20\">\n    705 F.3d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (1st Cir. 2013) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States has, nonetheless, conceded that \" 'mistake of age' is an available defense with respect\" to section 2422(b). (Docket No. 122 at p. 1.) Indeed, the United States must so concede because proving a defendant's knowledge of the age of the minor victim is an element of a section 2422(b) offense.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dwinells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046246\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/63/#p68\">\n    508 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (1st Cir. 2007) (observing that section 2422(b)\"requires that a defendant possess the\n   <strong>\n    specific intent\n   </strong>\n   to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce\n   <strong>\n    a minor\n   </strong>\n   into committing some illegal activity.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Montijo may legitimately raise a \"mistake of age\" defense as to the section 2422 counts, the Court admonishes Montijo that he must do so in strict compliance with the Federal Rules of Evidence. This Court will not permit Montijo to elicit from third-party witnesses any self-serving statements he may have made to them regarding his belief as to the age of the victim.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Palow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1521775\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/777/52/#p56\">\n    777 F.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (1st Cir. 1985) (\"The requirement of Rule 801(d)(2)(A) that an admission be offered against a party is designed to exclude the introduction of self-serving statements by the party making them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
