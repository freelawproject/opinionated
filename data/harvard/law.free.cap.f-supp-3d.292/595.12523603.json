LARIMER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Rochester City School District (\"RCSD\") commenced this lawsuit by filing a complaint in New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County, on or about June 30, 2017. The action is brought against defendant Aramark Educational Services LLC (\"Aramark\"), seeking damages in the amount of $1,020,000 for an alleged breach of a contract between RCSD and Aramark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 16, 2017, Aramark, which is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in Pennsylvania, removed the action to this Court, on the ground of diversity jurisdiction, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441 and 1446. RCSD has moved to remand the action to state court, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Any action or proceeding arising out of this contract shall be brought in the appropriate courts of the State of New York.\" (Dkt. # 1-2 at 49.) Aramark contends that this means that any action arising out of the contract may be brought in either a state or federal court\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   New York; in other words, that the clause is geographical, not jurisdictional, in its focus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Notice of Removal \u00b6 3 (asserting that \"disputes involving the contract are to be brought in the state or federal courts of New York\").

Metz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513381\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/145/#p149\">\n    973 F.2d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (2d Cir. 1992). According to Aramark, interpreting the contract to limit jurisdiction to state courts would render the contract's use of the plural \"courts\" meaningless, since only one New York state court-Supreme Court, Monroe County-would be an appropriate state forum here. Thus, so Aramark's logic goes, the parties must have envisioned that\n   some additional, other court-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , federal court-might also be an appropriate forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That reasoning is unpersuasive. Had the parties meant to allow for an action to be litigated in this Court, they could very easily have made that clear, in their contract. For example, they could have inserted the words \"state or federal\" before the word \"courts.\" Since there is both a state and federal court in Monroe County, the parties could also have stated that an action had to be brought in \"an appropriate court in Monroe County, New York.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eklecco Newco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202185405\">\n    2009 WL 2185405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (stating that since there is a federal court in Syracuse, New York, a clause requiring an action to be brought in Syracuse allowed for jurisdiction in either state or federal court). Or they could simply have stated that an action had to be commenced in an appropriate court \"in\" New York, rather than a court \"of\" New York state. In short, I do not view the forum-selection clause's use of the plural \"courts\" as a veiled allusion to both state and federal courts, as Aramark suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Aramark next argues that \"[a]t most, the [forum-selection] clause only mandates the court where any dispute must be\n   <em>\n    brought\n   </em>\n   .\" Def. Mem. (Dkt. # 8) at 2-3 (emphasis in original). In other words, according to Aramark, under the contract, an action arising out of the contract must be\n   <em>\n    brought\n   </em>\n   in state court, but may be removed to, and litigated in, federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That contention is contrary to the law of this Circuit.

Discussing the contract's reference to the \"commence[ment]\" of a proceeding, the court stated that \" the only plausible construction of the pertinent phrase is that Koch's removal constitutes the commencement of a 'proceeding' in federal court. Indeed, the parties' inclusion of the forum-selection clause makes little sense unless it precludes removal by Koch.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309284\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/656/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309284\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/656/\">\n    at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The same reasoning applies here. The self-evident purpose of a forum-selection clause is to establish the forum in which a case will be litigated. To require that a case be filed in state court, knowing that it will be subject to removal to federal court, seems pointless. If that had been the parties' intent, they could certainly have spelled that out, but in the absence of language doing so, the Court will not presume that the parties intended such a result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As noted, Aramark also cites the principle that an ambiguous forum-selection clause will be construed against the party who drafted it. Aramark states that RCSD drafted the contract at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. (Dkt. # 8) at 3. RCSD responds that the contract was based on a standard form\n   contract drafted by the New York State Education Department, which is a separate entity from RCSD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Reply Mem. (Dkt. # 9) at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regardless of who drafted the contract, this principle only comes into play if the forum-selection clause is ambiguous. As stated, this clause is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is also worth pointing out that this was not a \"consumer\" contract, or a contract of adhesion, with the drafter of the contract in a position of economic power, relative to the other party. Both parties are sizable entities that were represented by counsel. Aramark has presented no reason why it could not have sought to negotiate a modification of the forum-selection clause, if it had any qualms about agreeing to it. By all indications, this was an arms-length contract, freely entered into by both sides, regardless of whether the contractual language was originally taken from a template or form contract. If Aramark wanted to have the option of litigating claims arising out of the contract in federal court, it was free to make that a condition of its entering into the contract. Aramark did not do so, and the Court will give full effect to the parties' forum-selection clause, as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The motion to remand this action to state court filed by plaintiff Rochester City School District (Dkt. # 5) is granted, and this case is remanded to New York State Supreme Court, Monroe County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Karl Koch\n    </em>\n    , the appellant, NYCCDC, brought a suit against the appellee, Koch, in state court. Koch then brought a diversity action against NYCCDC in federal court, and removed the state court action to federal court. The district court granted NYCCDC's motion to dismiss the federal action and remand the action that had been filed in state court. Although the facts in\n    <em>\n     Karl Koch\n    </em>\n    thus differed slightly from those here, the Second Circuit's reasoning is equally sound in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Court notes that a case relied on by Aramark,\n    <em>\n     John's Insulation, Inc. v.
