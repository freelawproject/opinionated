R. Civ. P. 1 -I granted summary judgment for defendants. The cornerstone of my ruling was the determination that plaintiffs lacked sufficient admissible evidence to prove the essential elements\n   of their claims.

On February 16, 2002, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device inside a crowded pizzeria in the West Bank village of Karnei Shomron. The blast killed two people, both U.S. nationals, and wounded thirty others, including four U.S. nationals. The U.S. victims and their personal representatives initiated the instant suit against the Palestinian Authority (\"PA\") and the Palestine Liberation Organization (\"PLO\") (collectively, \"defendants\"), alleging that the bombing was enabled by those entities.

Kaabi is a member of the Central Committee for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\n   (\"PFLP\"), a faction within the PLO that has been designated by the United States as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shatsky III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202666111\">\n    2017 WL 2666111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. According to plaintiffs, Kaabi has a decades-long history of personal involvement in violent extremist and terrorist activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. 8-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The interview, which the Court has viewed in full, together with its English-language translation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot., Exs. 7 &amp; 7A, Certified Translation and Video File [Dkt. # 354-9], was streamed live on Facebook by the PFLP,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot., Ex. 10, PFLP Facebook Page [Dkt. # 354-12], and maintained in a video archive on that site, Pls.' Mot., Ex. 11, PFLP Facebook Page [Dkt. # 354-13]. It is unclear from the exhibits and briefs whether Kaabi's interviewer was \"in-house\" with the PFLP or just a friendly member of the Palestinian press.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the interview, Kaabi recounts events occurring in 2001 and 2002 during the Second Intifada. Kaabi's narrative begins with the death of Abu Ali Mustafa, then Secretary General of the PFLP. According to Kaabi, Mustafa \"planted a bomb inside a watermelon\" that an unnamed individual then placed \"on a Zionist bus in Jerusalem.\" Pls.' Mot., Ex. 7, Certified Translation, at 4. Israeli intelligence discovered the booby-trapped watermelon and killed Mustafa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Within hours of Mustafa's death, members of the PFLP retaliated by killing a rabbi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. After that, the PFLP renamed its militant elements as the \"Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades\" and launched a campaign of terror attacks where, in Kaabi's words, \"the cells fired at bypass roads, at vehicles of settlers, at settlements, at military posts and bases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. According to Kaabi, \"[t]he most significant operation carried out by the Front was the assassination of Rehavam Ze'evi,\" Israel's Minister of Tourism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kaabi also reports in his interview that PFLP cells began using suicide bombers in the wake of Mustafa's death. Kaabi's narrative describes three such attacks, including, of most relevance here, the bombing of the pizzeria in Karnei Shomron:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The first suicide attack was carried out in the settlement of Ariel by\n   <em>\n    istish'hadi\n   </em>\n   [suicide attacker] Shadi Nassar, a resident of Madama village in Nablus. He was recruited and prepared by Comrade Yamin Faraj. I think that he had been in jail and was a member of the Yamin Faraj cell. A lot of people were killed and injured in that operation, but the occupation chose not to reveal the number of those killed and injured in that operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    After that, the Karnei Shomron operation was executed by comrade Raed Nazal from Qalqilya\n   </strong>\n   in coordination with the comrades in the Brigades in Nablus. It was a joint, distinguished effort. I think it was carried out by\n   <em>\n    istish'hadi\n   </em>\n   [suicide attacker] Sadeq Abd al-Hai. Many settlers were killed inside the settlement. After the operation the Israeli army attacked several Front headquarters in Nablus with aircraft and artillery fire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Brigades in Nablus was the first organization to carry out a suicide attack within the '48 borders-in Netanya's city market-after Operation Defensive Shield and after Sharon boasted that he had destroyed the resistance and that the resistance would not be heard of\n   anymore, telling the Zionists to enjoy a long, undisturbed sleep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The now-liberated comrade Duaa al-Jayyousi participated in the operation. I was among the members of the cell....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (bold emphasis added). Not surprisingly, plaintiffs seek to introduce the statement attributing the Karnei Shomron bombing to Ra'ed Nazal. They contend, naturally, that the admission of this statement would enable them to overcome the evidentiary deficiency identified in my prior opinion granting summary judgment for defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs are less than forthcoming, however, about the circumstances surrounding their discovery of the Kaabi interview. In their memorandum, they state that it was \"recently discovered\" by counsel. Pls.' Mem. 3. In response to questions raised by defendants, plaintiffs report that they \"stumbl[ed] upon\" the interview \"shortly before the release of this Court's June 20, 2017 Memorandum Opinion.\" Pls.'

In a footnote, they clarify that counsel \"became aware\" of the interview on May 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11 n.3. They also state that a rough draft of a translation was completed by May 25, 2017, and that counsel \"was in the midst of determining whether the evidence would be admissible and therefore could and should be brought to the Court's attention\" when my summary judgment opinion issued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unfortunately, plaintiffs do not describe how they \"stumbled upon\" or \"became aware\" of the interview, or what steps they took, if any, that could have allowed them to discover it sooner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) permits \"motion[s] to alter or amend a judgment [that are] filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\" Fed.

Specifically, plaintiffs seek to introduce the statement in Allam Kaabi's interview linking Ra'ed Nazal to the Karnei Shomron bombing. Although plaintiffs concede that this out-of-court statement is hearsay, they argue that it is admissible as a statement against interest pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before reaching the issue of admissibility, I must pause briefly to address the timing of plaintiffs' Motion. Kaabi's Facebook interview was given on December 17, 2016-six months\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to entry of summary judgment. Plaintiffs' failure to bring this evidence to the Court's attention sooner raises a serious concern that they may be using Rule 59(e) to \"present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon Shipping\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677373\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/471/\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   485 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677373\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/471/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Oddly, plaintiffs make little effort to assuage that concern. They report that they \"became aware\" of the Kaabi interview on May 22, 2017. Pls.' Reply 10-11 n.3. But, as noted previously, they never recount\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   they became aware of the interview, or what steps they took, if any, that could have allowed them to become aware of it sooner. Plaintiffs' decision to omit that information, even when pressed by defendants, makes it difficult for the Court to conclude, as I must under Rule 59(e), that plaintiffs' late-produced evidence \"is newly discovered or previously unavailable\n   <em>\n    despite the exercise of due diligences.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Niedermeier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9494670\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/153/23/#p29\">\n    153 F.Supp.2d at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Putting aside the difficulties imposed by plaintiffs' delay, it is clear that Kaabi's statement about Nazal is not admissible.

The record in this case confirms that warped reality. Kaabi's interviewer treated him like a heroic celebrity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot., Ex. 7, Certified Translation, at 2 (\"You mobilized the furious youth to confront the enemy. Please tell us about that role ....\").

In such a morally-twisted environment, Kaabi likely expected that any apparent insider-knowledge of recent terrorist attacks would help, not hurt,\n   his proprietary and pecuniary interests, not to mention the cause to which he is so dearly committed. That expectation created an incentive to lie, thus undermining \"the commonsense notion\" of reliability on which Rule 804(b)(3) is founded.\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p600\">\n    512 U.S. at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p600\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Compounding this problem further is the likelihood that Kaabi would not have perceived any risk of increased \"expos[ure] to ... liability\" flowing from the Facebook interview.

Moreover, as plaintiffs explain, at the time Kaabi gave the interview, he had already been sentenced by Israel for the role he played in the Second Intifada and subsequently released through a prisoner exchange program. Pls.' Reply 11-12. On this record, then, it appears there was no reason for Kaabi to believe that associating himself with the terrorist attacks discussed in his interview, including the Karnei Shomron bombing, exposed him to any additional liability.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As such, any presumption that Kaabi would not have made the statement identifying Nazal unless it was truthful, is further undermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To summarize, I conclude that Kaabi's statement identifying Nazal is not admissible because that particular statement does not inculpate Kaabi.
