Because the liability and damages questions in this case were bifurcated for trial, the Court then proceeded to hold an additional one-day bench trial to evaluate the monetary damages and other remedies available to Plaintiffs Prince Immanuel Ben Yehuda and Yah Kai World Wide Enterprises, Inc. Following the damages trial, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that addressed the facts that had been established relating to damages and the remedies to which Plaintiffs were entitled as a result of Napper's violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Proposed Conclusions of Law on Damages (\"Pls.' Dam. COL\"), ECF No. 111; Def.'s Proposed Conclusions of Law on Damages (\"Def.'s Dam.

This Court's own findings of fact and conclusions of law appear below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In short, after reviewing the evidence presented at both trials, the parties' submissions, and the legal theories that the parties contend apply to the established facts of this case, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are entitled to monetary damages for Napper's violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201051\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1129, in the form of (1) the profits that Napper's infringing conduct generated, (2) actual damages, and (3) attorney fees and costs-all of which overlap with the damages Napper owes for unfair competition under Maryland common law. Plaintiffs are also entitled to compensatory damages related to Napper's tortious conversion of both their tangible assets and certain intangible rights, along with prejudgment interest related to the conversion damages, but Plaintiffs have not sustained their burden with respect to any claims for injunctive relief, nor have they shown that an award of punitive damages under Maryland common law is appropriate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT WILL BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFFS' FAVOR\n   </strong>\n   against Napper for monetary damages in the amount of $2,598,849 (consisting of: $1,856,144 for Napper's profits and $545,407 for Plaintiffs' actual damages for trademark infringement/unfair competition, plus $142,864 in compensatory damages for conversion and $54,434 in prejudgment interest on those conversion damages). In addition, Plaintiffs will recover a yet-to-be determined amount of attorney fees and costs arising from the litigation of Plaintiffs' trademark infringement claims.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Findings of Fact &amp; Conclusions of Law, ECF No. 69.) The background facts are recited at length in that opinion, and need not be reproduced here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It suffices to recall now that Plaintiffs are members of the African Hebrew Israelite Community (\"the Community\"), which follows a strict vegan diet,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the Community founded and maintained a foodservice business called the \"Everlasting Life Health Complex\" (\"the Complex\") through the service and monetary contributions of its members, including Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Napper-a former member of the Community-played a key role in starting the Complex and served as its first manager, but Community leaders eventually replaced\n   Napper with Yah Kai World Wide Enterprises, Inc., an incorporated entity that the Community created.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 301-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to the Community's decision to remove him from the manager's post, Napper utilized his legal status as the Community's agent on the Complex's lease to evict members of the Community and Yah Kai and to assert total control over the business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 303-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs filed the instant legal action because Napper appropriated their business for himself, and has continued to operate essentially the same food-service establishment using the trademarked name \"Everlasting Life\" in the same location as that business operated prior to the takeover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs claimed that Napper's operation of what he now calls the \"Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge\" (\"the Restaurant\") infringed upon Prince Immanuel and Yah Kai's trademark rights in violation of the Lanham Act, and constituted unfair competition under both the Lanham Act and Maryland's common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 293-94, 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To be specific, this Court held that Napper had committed trademark infringement under Section 32 of the Lanham Act and the tort of unfair competition under both Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and Maryland common law, and the Court also found that Napper had converted tangible and intangible property owned by Yah Kai in violation of Maryland common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 308-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Present Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After this Court issued its liability findings, the parties proceeded to engage in additional discovery related to the question of damages, with the initial intention of presenting the damages issues to a jury. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 73.) However, Plaintiffs subsequently opted to litigate damages in the context of a second bench trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice, ECF No. 85.) That trial began on February 13, 2017, and concluded later that same day. During the trial, Plaintiffs offered the testimony of three witnesses: Prince Immanuel, Napper, and Darrel Edwards (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Feb. 13, 2017 Trial Tr. (\"Damages Trial Tr.\") at 23:20-155:22); Edwards had served as Yah Kai's accountant and is currently the accountant for Napper and Fair and Balanced, LLC, which is the umbrella corporation that Napper formed to manage his restaurant businesses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 295-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Napper elected not to call any witnesses or to provide any independent evidence regarding damages, and the parties proceeded immediately to closing arguments at the conclusion of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 159:1-169:6.) The parties also agreed to keep the record open after trial so that Edwards could supply documents that detailed the Restaurant's expenses and gross sales for the years 2011 through 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 147:2-149:16; 153:3-154:23.) For the most part, these documents were filed with the Court on February 22, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Doc. Produc. Reqs. Pursuant to Feb. 13, 2017 Ct.

FINDINGS OF FACT PERTAINING TO THE MONETARY DAMAGES OWED TO PLAINTIFFS AND OTHER REQUESTED REMEDIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court's findings of fact with respect to Plaintiffs' request for damages and injunctive relief are based on the testimony and exhibits that the parties submitted during the second bench trial, the Court's observation of the witnesses' demeanor, the Court's conclusions regarding the witnesses' credibility, the parties' stipulations, and the record as a whole, which includes the evidence offered in the liability bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Overview Of The Evidence Presented During The Damages Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As explained above, Plaintiffs called Prince Immanuel, Napper, and Edwards to the stand during the bench trial on damages, and Defendant Napper opted not to put on any case-in-chief. Prince Immanuel was the first to testify. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 24:1-34:6 (Prince Immanuel).) Among other things, his testimony addressed his ownership of the Everlasting Life trademark, the recent expiration of his trademark registration, and the agreements he had with other individuals regarding their use of that trademark. In addition, Prince Immanuel testified about Napper's use of the Everlasting Life trademark to promote the Restaurant after\n   Napper evicted Yah Kai from the Complex, including Napper's use of the trademark with respect to internet advertising. For the most part, Prince Immanuel appeared to testify candidly, although he avoided providing direct answers to questions regarding the current registration status of the Everlasting Life trademark. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:5-11 (\"Q. Have you been made aware [ ] by either your counsel or any other sources that you are no longer the holder of that trademark? A. That's rumored. Q. Rumored? A. We heard that, but again, as I've said, we're following up on that to clarify the situation.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs called Napper as an adverse witness. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:14-130:21 (Napper).) While testifying, Napper spoke extensively about his management of the Restaurant and its current parent corporation, Fair and Balanced LLC. Napper's testimony also touched upon the contents of Napper's personal tax returns; the contents of Fair and Balanced's tax returns; Napper's purported ownership of the equipment and inventory present within the Complex on November 15, 2011; the gross sales for the various restaurants Fair and Balanced LLC manages and the amount of those sales that are attributable to the Restaurant; Napper's accountant's handling of Fair and Balanced LLC's profit and loss statements; the number of Everlasting Life employees; Napper's and the Community's relationships to the Restaurant; Napper's use of the Everlasting Life moniker to promote the Restaurant; and Napper's eviction of Yah Kai on November 15, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Napper was frequently unable to respond to questions regarding the Restaurant's finances from 2011 to 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:4-7), and his testimony regarding the equipment and assets he converted on November 15, 2011 was imprecise and, at times, evasive (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 113:25-114:4 (\"Q. And within the next several days you then took that business and everything that was in it and you reopened it in your own name; right? By that I mean you opened it as your restaurant? A. As Everlasting Life.\") ). Furthermore, throughout his testimony, Napper adamantly-and apparently sincerely-contended that he was the rightful owner of the Everlasting Life business. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:9-17 (\"Your honor, again with all due respect to you and the decision you made ... Everlasting Life has been my business ... and your decision didn't change my heart.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the conclusion of Napper's testimony, Plaintiffs called Everlasting Life's perennial accountant, Darryl Edwards. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 132:7-155:22 (Edwards).) Edwards testified about how he had prepared tax returns for Napper and for Fair and Balanced LLC, and also how the profit and loss statements for each of Napper's various restaurants are generated. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Throughout his testimony, Edwards appeared reluctant to answer questions regarding the Restaurant's profits and expenses, and he admitted that he had not yet complied with Plaintiffs' subpoena demanding individualized profit and loss statements for the Restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 142:5-143:10.) Given Edwards's incomplete testimony, the parties and the Court agreed to leave the record open so that Edwards could provide these missing documents for the Court's review after trial. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 148:23-149:13; 154:21-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to the live testimony presented during the damages trial, the parties stipulated to the admission of several documents, including: (1) all exhibits admitted at the liability trial; (2) personal tax returns for Napper, from 2012-2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 1, ECF No. 114); (3) tax returns for Fair and Balanced LLC, from 2011-15 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 2, ECF No. 114-1); (4) a 2015 notice regarding Prince Immanuel's Trademark Registration for Everlasting Life (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 4, ECF No. 114-2); (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   advertisements Napper generated for the Everlasting Life Restaurant and Lounge (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 5, ECF No. 114-3); and (6) one of Napper's Facebook posts about the bench trial in this case (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 8, ECF No. 114-4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also moved into the record various other summary reports and evaluations pertaining to the financial status of the Restaurant and Napper's other businesses, including: (1) a written report authored by Jerome S. Paige &amp; Associates, LLC that purports to analyze Fair and Balanced LLC's sales and costs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Damages Trial Ex. 11, ECF No. 114-5); (2) a spreadsheet titled \"Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge Expenses by Vendor Detail\" that allegedly demonstrates the Restaurant's costs and expenses from 2011-15 (Def.'s Damages Trial Ex. 1, ECF No. 105-1); (3) a summary of the Restaurant's gross sales and claimed profits (Def.'s Damages Trial Ex. 2, ECF No. 105-2); and (4) a list of itemized costs and expenses for the Restaurant in 2014 and 2015 (Def.'s Damages Trial Exs. 3 &amp; 4, ECF Nos. 105-3 &amp; 105-4). On the whole, these documents seek to generally address and illuminate the financial situations of Napper, Fair and Balanced LLC, and Everlasting Life between the years of 2011 and 2015. They are also relevant to this Court's conclusions regarding the status of the Everlasting Life trademark, Napper's state of mind regarding his use of that trademark, and the value of Yah Kai's equipment and inventory inside the Complex on the night of November 15, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Noted Record Deficiencies And How This Court Has Addressed Them\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court's findings of fact, as well as its ultimate determinations regarding the damages owed to Plaintiffs, come with a caveat: the parties in this matter have not presented the kinds of detailed business documentation that one would expect to see in a case such as this one, and this dearth of information has stymied the Court's evaluation of the monetary damages owed to Plaintiffs. For example, due to Napper's bookkeeping and business practices, this Court has had great difficulty determining the costs and expenses that the Restaurant incurred from 2011 to 2015-and, thus, the extent of the Restaurant's profits for that same time period. The difficulty has primarily arisen because, in addition to Everlasting Life, Napper opened two other restaurants (named \"Evolve\" and \"Vegaritos\") in this same timeframe (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 55:19-56:19 (Napper) ), and he has managed all three foodservice establishments through a single corporate entity-Fair and Balanced, LLC (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   3d Liability FOF Tbl. at 96, 103 (A, B) ). And rather than accounting for these businesses separately, Napper and his accountant appear to have commingled the proceeds and expenses from all of these restaurants in Fair and Balanced LLC's records of expenses and tax returns. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge Expenses by Vendor Detail (\"Itemized Expenses\") (attached hereto as\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix A\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ), Def.'s Damages Trial Ex. 1, ECF No. 105-1, at 177, 182 or A8-A9 (showing itemized rental payments for Napper's other restaurants Evolve and Vegaritos);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fair and Balanced's Tax Returns FY 2011-15; Damages Trial Tr. at 55:5-58:8.) Thus, despite the fact that the defense has submitted certain financial statements as evidence pertinent to the calculation of damages, there is considerable uncertainty regarding\n   the profits that Napper actually derived from Everlasting Life during the relevant timeframe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The additional fact that Napper has occasionally compensated himself (and his family members) directly-using business proceeds either to repay \"loans\" owed to his family or to pay himself and family members directly as \"contractors\"-further compounds the Court's uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the financial records that have been presented. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Itemized Expenses at 64-65, 82, 85, 94 or\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix A\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at A1-A5 (identifying expenses related to Napper or his family members with labels such as \"[l]oan,\" \"[r]eimbursement,\" and \"[c]ontractor\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 43:4-44:23.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Napper also appears at times to have conflated the revenue stream of his businesses with his own personal income; in fact, during the trial, Napper repeatedly maintained that goods or services that he purchased with proceeds earned by the business were\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   in a manner that suggested that he had purchased them personally. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , July 14, 2015 Trial Tr. at 80:15-81:20 (Napper); Damages Trial Tr. at 167:3-18 (Def.'s Counsel).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In short, these unorthodox accounting practices and unexplained discrepancies undermine the accuracy of many of Defendant's financial documents, including such significant records as Fair and Balanced LLC's tax returns for 2011-15 (ECF No. 114-1); Napper's personal tax returns for 2012-15 (ECF No. 114); the list of Itemized Expenses that Edwards submitted to the Court after the damages trial (ECF No. 105-1); and portions of the Supplement Itemized Costs and Expenses for Everlasting Life in 2014 and 2015 (ECF Nos. 105-3 &amp; 105-4). And because Plaintiffs' expert report relies on several of these documents to reach its conclusions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Expert Report, ECF No. 114-5, at 1-2), that report is rendered suspect as well. The Court further notes that in addition to the significant substantive uncertainty regarding the financial information that Napper has provided, various\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   deficiencies pertaining to the format in which the information has been presented are also clearly manifest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For present purposes, it is also important to note that Napper never submitted any documentation whatsoever regarding the Restaurant's sales, profits, or expenses\n   for the 2016 or 2017 calendar years. Plaintiffs served a subpoena seeking the 2016 information prior to the commencement of the damages bench trial, but Napper and his accountant failed to produce this information prior to trial. During the damages trial, the Court directly ordered Napper and his accountant to provide this documentation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 154:21-23 (Edwards).) And while Napper's accountant acknowledged that a printout of such information would \"not [be] a problem\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 153:5-15, 154:12-20), Defendant's tardy submission of other documents more than one week later did not contain this information; instead, defense counsel represented that \"[t]he accountant has not reconciled the raw data\" and thus \"this information is not in the Defendant's possession at this time,\" (Def.'s Doc. Produc. Reqs. at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For its part, Yah Kai has presented no records that represent the actual value of the equipment, goods, and inventory that Napper seized when he evicted Plaintiffs on November 15, 2011. To be sure, Yah Kai is not entirely at fault for this deficiency, because its business records and any pre-seizure inventory of tangible assets remained within the Complex and within Napper's control following his seizure o f the facility in November of 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 32:6-8 (Prince Immanuel).) However, with a potential legal claim against Napper on the horizon, this Court sees no reason why Yah Kai failed to take steps to generate a roughly contemporaneous accounting of its assets (albeit from memory), which would have been a far superior form of evidence than the testimony that Plaintiffs presented at trial regarding the restaurant equipment and other tangible items that Yah Kai had purchased prior to the seizure. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:15-32:8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In fairness, this Court also fully acknowledges that the parties' failure to gather and present the kinds of business records that are ordinarily required to generate a reasonably accurate damages calculation in a trademark infringement case stems in large part from their nontraditional beliefs regarding property ownership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is, as this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   , the parties here were once all members of the African Hebrew Israelite Community, which emphasizes communal ownership and does not recognize individual property rights with respect to Community-related endeavors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d FOF Tbl. at 19 (A, B);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   July 15, 2015 Trial Tr. at 55:11-15, 106:3-13, 109:23-110:20 (Prince Immanuel).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But the Community's culture is only a\n   <em>\n    partial\n   </em>\n   explanation for the record deficiencies that are apparent in this case; it is also clear that some of the problems are directly attributable to actions of Yah Kai\n   and Napper in the context of the instant dispute. For example, Napper served Yah Kai with a notice to vacate the Complex\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   before the eviction date-on July 20, 2011, and on October 15, 2011,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   304 -which means that Yah Kai was fully aware of Napper's claims of ownership and had plenty of time to move, copy, or otherwise secure its business records. It did not do so. Similarly, Napper refused to return Yah Kai's business documents and other assets when he evicted Plaintiffs from the Complex, and has presumably misplaced those records, since neither party has presented them in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, as noted above, neither party undertook a detailed accounting of the converted items after the eviction, despite being fully aware that they were engaged in a contentious legal dispute regarding ownership of the business. And perhaps most significantly, throughout this litigation, Napper has repeatedly failed to adhere to his discovery obligations, which has both delayed the proceedings and hampered Plaintiffs' ability to establish an accurate quantum of damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   All this means that the instant record provides an exceedingly thin factual foundation upon which to rest this Court's conclusions regarding the monetary damages owed to Plaintiffs. As a general matter, these record deficiencies have broad implications, because a plaintiff generally bears the initial burden of proof regarding damages, and that burden includes establishing the amount of damages owed or gross sales earned by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fishman Transducers, Inc. v. Paul\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880192\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/187/#p192\">\n    684 F.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (1st Cir. 2012) (\"The ordinary rule in civil cases is proof by a preponderance of the evidence ..., and the text of section 1117 does not prescribe a different burden of proof.\"). However, it is also well established that, in trademark infringement and unfair business practice cases, the evidence a plaintiff proffers related to the sales arising from the infringing use should be construed liberally (i.e., not mechanically) to ensure that the victimized party receives an adequate recovery for the defendant's infringing conduct.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros. &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689897\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/240/251/#p262\">\n    240 U.S. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689897\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/240/251/#p262\">\n    36 S.Ct. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3689897\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/240/251/#p262\">\n    60 L.Ed. 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1916) (\"[I]t is more consonant with reason and justice that the owner of the trademark should have the whole profit than that he should be deprived of any part of it by the fraudulent act of the defendant. It is the same principle which is applicable to a confusion of goods.

Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742079\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1105/#p1111\">\n    673 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1111-12 (9th Cir. 2012), so long as the Court exercises that discretion based on the standards that the D.C. Circuit has laid out for making these kinds of awards,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foxtrap, Inc. v.

Cir. 1982). Thus, even where the record fails to substantiate fully the parties' specific contentions regarding the extent of the defendant's profits and/or the scope of the infringing sales, the factfinder can undertake to estimate those figures, and to adjust them as needed, in order to arrive at a fair and just damages figure, given the facts presented and the goal of ensuring that justice is served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skydive Ariz.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742079\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1105/#p1111\">\n    673 F.3d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring only that \"the [factfinder's] award was supported by reasonable inferences and assessments, based on substantial evidence in the record\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Particular Factual Bases For This Court's Damages Calculation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   With that said, this Court will now undertake to set forth its findings of fact pertaining to its calculation of the monetary damages that Napper owes to Prince Immanuel and Yah Kai as a result of the violations that the Court identified in its liability opinion. In the main, the Court's findings concern: (1) the tangible and intangible assets of Yah Kai that were inside the Complex on the date of the eviction and that were converted when Napper took over the business; (2) the estimated profits that the Restaurant has generated during Napper's infringing use of Prince Immanuel's trademark; and (3) the actual damages Plaintiffs suffered due to Napper's infringement and unfair competition. The Court also addresses certain facts that have\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been established in the instant record, and that thus cannot be the basis for other requested remedies such as punitive damages or injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Certain Furniture, Equipment, And Other Tangible And Intangible Assets Belonging To Yah Kai Were Present In The Complex When Napper Took Over That Business\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When Napper evicted Yah Kai from the Complex on the evening of November 15, 2011, he seized control of all of the furniture, equipment, records, and inventory that was present at the facility on that date, including the food inventory, the food-production equipment, restaurant supplies, administrative supplies and document s, and computers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 15, 2015 Trial Tr. at 102:7-20, 103:4-24 (Prince Immanuel); Damages Trial Tr. at 114:5-11 (Napper).) Yah Kai and other members of the Community attempted to retrieve these items on the night that Napper evicted them in November of 2011, but Napper requested that the police eject them from the premises before Yah Kai's property could be accessed and removed.\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 113:2-23 (Napper).) Napper then changed the Complex's locks the next day, preventing Yah Kai from recovering any of the property, equipment, inventory, or records housed within the Complex. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 14, 2015 Trial Tr. at 100:21-101:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The record establishes the following regarding the equipment and inventory that was within the Complex when Napper executed his takeover. A few months prior to Napper's takeover of the Complex, its manager (Yah Kai's president, William Young) had provided information to Yah Kai's accountant about the value of the\n   furniture and equipment that Yah Kai had purchased for the Complex. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of William Young, Damages Trial Ex. 8 (\"Young Dep.\"), ECF No. 43-4, at 95:22-96:13.) As the president of Yah Kai and the one who made purchases on Yah Kai's behalf, Young would have had the personal knowledge necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the value of such goods. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:9-10; 17:16-19; 27:13-19.) In other words, Young was an individual \"familiar with the condition\" of the Complex's equipment and inventory, and thus was \"competent to testify as to its value.\"\n   <em>\n    Checkpoint Foreign Car Serv., Inc. v. Sweeney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1913202\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/250/251/\">\n    250 Md. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20148\">\n    242 A.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   During the deposition testimony that Young provided in 2014, in the context of this litigation, Young was asked to review a document dated June 27, 2011-titled \"balance sheet\"-that purportedly listed the value of the \"furniture and equipment\" within the Complex as $17,864, based on the aforementioned figures that Young had provided to his accountant. (Young Dep. at 96:1, 96:4;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 95:22-96:8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Young's deposition testimony is undisputed, and is the only available evidence of the value of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of Yah Kai's tangible assets at the time of conversion, this Court considers Young's testimony about a business record that reports the value of equipment and inventory to be reliable evidence regarding the minimum market value of Yah Kai's tangible assets within the facility at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Additionally, because Napper seized certain records that Yah Kai had been storing inside the Complex and used those documents to secure a substantial rebate from the Complex's utility provider (as fully described in the Court's prior memorandum opinion regarding liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   323-25 ), the Court finds that the value of the intangible property right that Napper converted when he secured the utility rebate for himself is the negotiated rebate amount-i.e., $125,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 325 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   July 15, 2015 Trial Tr. at 92:6-16; 93:15-94:6 (Allen).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    During Napper's Infringing Use Of The Everlasting Life Trademark, The Restaurant Has Generated Significant Sales And Has Also Incurred Some Costs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Napper reopened the Complex under the name \"Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge\" a few days after Plaintiff's eviction, and he has continued to operate that food-service business ever since. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. 99:4-6; 113:25-114:24 (Napper).) As the owner of the Everlasting Life trademark, Prince Immanuel formally notified Napper of his ownership of the mark two days before the eviction, and thereby specifically alerted Napper to the prospect of the potential infringement that would arise due to his then-threatened takeover of the business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Liability FOF Tbl. at 132 (A, B); Trademark Infringement Notice from Prince Immanuel, Pls.' Liability Trial Ex. 15, ECF No. 29-1.) Prince Immanuel's letter of November 13, 2011 specifically informed Napper that his use of the \"Everlasting Life\" trademark was unauthorized, and expressly revoked any license to use that mark that Napper may have believed he possessed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trademark Infringement Notice from Prince Immanuel.) Moreover, Napper received and understood this notice, but ignored it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 99:21-100:20 (Napper).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, Napper's infringing use of Price Immanuel's trademark was entirely knowing; indeed, during the trial, Napper admitted that he had continued to operate the Restaurant in violation of the \"Everlasting Life\" trademark despite the notice, partly because of his antagonistic personal relationship with Prince Immanuel, who Napper believed \"didn't look out for [his] best interest[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:18;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:13-20.) And even after this Court issued its memorandum opinion finding Napper liable for infringing upon Prince Immanuel's trademark, Napper has persisted in his willful use of the Everlasting Life trademark in connection with his operation of the Restaurant, because he still maintains that he is the rightful owner of the Complex. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:4-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Since Napper's November 2011 takeover of the business, the Restaurant has generated significant (albeit decreasing) gross sales. Between November of 2011 and December 2015, the business had a total \"ordinary income\" of $3,555,428, which is comprised of $136,475 in November and December of 2011; $1,019,788 in 2012; $1,084,287 in 2013; $771,341 in 2014; and $543,537 in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge Gross Profit, January 2011 through December 2015 (\"Everlasting Life Gross Sales Summary\") (attached hereto as\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix B\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ), ECF No. 105-2, at 1 or B1.) Meanwhile, the business spent $1,232,518 on the goods needed for sales during this same timeframe-specifically, $51,030 in November and December of 2011; $482,464 in 2012; $449,206 in 2013;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   $197,617 in 2014; and $52,201 in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) It appears that a total of $379,234 was paid for rent (excluding late fees) to Kingdom Management, the Restaurant's landlord, between November 2011 and the end of 2015.

The name [of that business] was Everlasting Life.\"); Damages Trial Tr. at 99:14-17 (\"And Everlasting Life had been my business. I established it, and I established it for the purposes that it serves now, and [the Court's] decision didn't change my heart.\").) Make no mistake, in the wake of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   , Napper knew that running the Everlasting Life Restaurant &amp; Lounge violated Prince Immanuel's legal rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 100:11 (\"I realized what was written on the paper[.]\").) But Napper was unwavering in his conviction that his pivotal role in conceiving of and managing the business from its inception conferred upon him the right of ownership, even if the financial equity belonged to someone else and the trademark was registered under someone else's name. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   100:11-13 (\"So I realized what was written on the paper, but I knew what was right. And I knew that I was, I was the person who did all of this.\").) In other words, Napper has consistently expressed certainty that the business formerly known as \"Everlasting Life Health Complex\" and its accompanying trademark belongs to\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   (without regard to the financial stake of Plaintiffs and other Community members), apparently because of a conception of property ownership that differs sharply from the precepts that are recognized under federal and Maryland law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, as the first user of the trademark, Prince Immanuel owned the Everlasting Life trademark and the right of businesses to use that trademark).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Thus, Napper is mistaken. But this Court finds that his mistaken ownership convictions are earnestly and sincerely held, and therefore, Napper's related actions in recovering what he viewed as his own property are not properly characterized as malicious.\n   <em>\n    See Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1101 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"malicious\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   as meaning \"[w]ithout just cause or excuse\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    The Registration Status Of The Everlasting Life Trademark Is Presently Uncertain\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There is no dispute that Prince Immanuel (and, by license, Yah Kai) was the rightful holder of the registered \"Everlasting Life\" trademark at the time that Napper evicted Plaintiffs and took over the Complex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, with the passage of time, the registration status of that trademark has become uncertain. The testimony at the damages trial indicated that Prince Immanuel may have allowed the Everlasting Life trademark's registration to lapse when it was up for renewal in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 29:17-30:15.) And additional evidence suggested that Napper spied an opportunity, and took steps to register the Everlasting Life trademark for himself. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3d Dam. FOF Tbl at 8 (B) (acknowledging that Napper had attempted to trademark the Everlasting Life mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in June or July 2016); Damages Trial Tr. at 11:20-12:16 (taking judicial notice that this application was still pending as of November 15, 2016).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To date, neither of the parties has provided the Court with any notice or other definitive evidence regarding the current status of the registered trademark, and therefore, this Court is not in a position to know whether Prince Immanuel continues to hold the trademark registration, or whether Napper has successfully registered that trademark with the USPTO. Given Napper's mistaken beliefs about legal ownership, as described above, the Court is not inclined to credit Napper's bald statements of present ownership, and without additional evidence, this Court cannot determine which party the USPTO recognizes as holding the registered trademark-a non-finding that has implications for the Court's conclusions regarding injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW REGARDING MONETARY DAMAGES AND OTHER REQUESTED REMEDIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As explained fully below, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are entitled to certain monetary damages but not all of the relief that they have requested in this case. Specifically, the evidence presented establishes that, as a remedy for Napper's willful trademark infringement and unfair competition, Prince Immanuel and Yah Kai are entitled to recover: (1) the profits that Napper generated (i.e., the Restaurant's gross sales minus its expenses) in connection with his operation of the Restaurant during the period of his infringing use of the \"Everlasting Life\" trademark-which amounts to $1,856,144-(2) their actual damages for Napper's seizure of their business and operation of that entity under the trademarked name \"Everlasting Life,\" which total $545,407; and (3) the yet-to-be-calculated attorney fees and costs that have arisen from this litigation. In addition, Yah Kai has also successfully claimed that it is entitled to compensation for Napper's conversion of its tangible and intangible property interests, in the amount of $142,864, along with $54,434 in prejudgment interest. However, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated any right to punitive damages or injunctive relief for their claims under the Lanham Act or Maryland common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, this Court will award Plaintiffs $2,401,551 plus attorney fees and costs with respect to Counts I, II, and III; and with respect to Count VI, Yah Kai is awarded a total of $142,864 in compensatory damages and $54,434 in prejudgment interest. Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to file a timely motion for attorney fees\n   and costs. No other damages or injunctive relief will be awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

These remedies include various types of monetary damages and the issuance of a permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201116\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 17. With respect to damages, the Lanham Act provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [w]hen a violation of any right of the registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, a violation under section 1125(a) or (d) of this title, or a willful violation under section 1125(c) of this title, shall have been established in any civil action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall be entitled ... to recover (1) defendant's profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201116\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1117(a). Thus, Congress has authorized the recovery of three different types of monetary damages for the Lanham Act violations at issue here: Defendant's profits, Plaintiffs' actual damages, and Plaintiffs' costs of litigating the Lanham Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A nearly identical set of remedies exists for claims of unfair competition under Maryland common law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Md.

Ct. Spec. App. 1975). Because punitive damages can be awarded under common law, it is not uncommon for plaintiffs to claim that the same trademark infringement activity violates both the Lanham Act and state common law prohibitions against unfair competition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suntree Techs., Inc. v.

Napper's own testimony at both phases of this trial clearly demonstrates that Napper's actions are not those of an infringer who is proceeding in good faith and with due respect for\n   Plaintiffs' ownership rights, but instead appear to be the deliberate actions of a misguided individual intent upon responding to perceived slights. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Damages Trial Tr. at 100:3-20 (Napper) (acknowledging that Napper considered changing the name of the restaurant, but decided not to do so because \"[Prince Immanuel] is an individual who has demonstrated throughout the time that I was in that community that he didn't look out for my best interest\").) Indeed, this Court previously noted in its liability opinion that Napper has chosen to exercise his own brand of \"vigilante justice\" in appropriating Plaintiffs' business and operating it in violation of Prince Immanuel's trademark rights.\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 321-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Prince Immanuel tendered notice of his registration of the \"Everlasting Life\" mark to Napper in November of 2011, and in that same notice, he clearly revoked any license Napper may have had to use the mark. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trademark Infringement Notice at 1.) Thus, when Napper began running the Restaurant on November 16, 2011, Napper knowingly, willfully, and immediately infringed upon Prince Immanuel's trademark. Furthermore, because Napper has not ceased using the \"Everlasting Life\" mark in connection with his operation of the Restaurant to date, Napper's infringing use of Prince Immanuel's trademark has continued to the present day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Napper argues that his infringing conduct should not be construed to continue through this present judgment, because Prince Immanuel's trademark registration lapsed in 2016 and was not renewed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Trial Tr. at 153:24-154:5.) But that argument misunderstands trademark rights, which are protected\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   by statute\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   by common law. It is well established that the termination or cancellation of a federally registered mark does not, in itself, represent the cessation of a priority user's rights in the mark at common law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , McCarthy \u00a7 20:40 (noting that cancellation of a registration does not \"invalidate state or federal rights in the trademark which do not flow from federal registration\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Two Pesos, Inc. v.

Thus, Napper can neither (1) reasonably contend that he was unaware of Prince Immanuel's trademark interests such that he should not be liable for the profits generated from the time the infringement began, nor (2) credibly maintain that Prince Immanuel has abandoned his trademark interests because of his nonuse of the mark.

Plaintiffs say that, \"[r]ather than ... attempting to parse through an intentionally designed, convoluted, commingled puzzle of Fair and Balanced's financial and tax corporate finances, which funds are substantially derived from Everlasting Life,\" the Court should, instead, \"simplify its task consistent with the letter of the law\" by (1) aggregating Fair and Balanced LLC's gross sales from 2011 through 2015, which Plaintiffs say is equal to approximately $4.04 million, and then (2) calculate 25% of this gross sales figure ($1.01 million) as a \"starting point\" for the determination of Plaintiffs' damages, and then (3) \"issue treble damages [by] multiply[ing] this amount three [ ] times,\" for a total award of $3.03 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) But, alas, Plaintiffs' requested methodology for determining the profits that resulted from Napper's infringing use of their mark is not at all consistent with the letter-or the spirit-of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To avoid being repetitive, the Court directs Plaintiffs' attention to Part VI.A.1 of this Memorandum Opinion,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , which explains that section 1117 of Title 15 of the U.S. Code specifies the forms of monetary damages that a court may award for Lanham Act violations, as well as the adjustments that a court may make to those damages amounts.\n   <em>\n    Ga.-Pac.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix B\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at B1.) This document, which Napper's accountant testified that he compiled from his contemporaneous QuickBooks account, shows that the Restaurant generated \"[o]rdinary [i]ncome\" of $3,555,428 between November 2011 and December 2015-a figure that breaks down to $136,475 for the last two months of 2011 (November and December); $1,019,788 in 2012; $1,084,287 in 2013; $771,341 in 2014; and $543,537 in 2015. In the absence of any other reliable evidence regarding the Restaurant's sales during this period, or any reason to doubt the reliability of these numbers in particular, this Court will rely upon these figures and consider them to represent the Restaurant's gross sales from November of 2011 through December of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiffs have also suggested that the applicable gross sales figure for the purpose of determining the Restaurant's profits should include the Restaurant's sales in 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Dam. Br. at 14; Pls.' Dam. COL at 13-14)-and presumably their request would now extend to gross sales for the year 2017 and sales-to-date for 2018, because Napper's infringement is still ongoing. But as explained in Part III.B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , this Court has no evidence regarding the sales figures for those years because Napper has not yet produced those records. And given the apparent and significant downward trajectory in the Restaurant's gross sales in the years since Napper has managed the facility (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix B\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at B1), any estimate of the sales for 2016, 2017, or 2018 that is derived from calculating the average of the gross sales from previous years would likely overestimate the Restaurant's recent sales volume. Thus, this Court is reluctant to reach any conclusion about the Restaurant's gross sales in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and early 2018, and will instead account for this time period by adjusting the overall award of profits as the Lanham Act allows.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.B &amp; n.13,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (explaining why not all of the costs listed in the documents contained within\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix A\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix C\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   are trustworthy).) With respect to the Itemized Expenses document in particular, the Court expressed its concerns about the commingling of business expenses during the damages trial, and both Napper's accountant and his defense counsel specifically acknowledged those deficiencies, and vowed to address them. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Damages Trial Tr. at 140:14-141:1 (Edwards) (agreeing it was not possible to identify which expenses were attributable to the Restaurant merely by reviewing the Itemized Expenses document);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 168:9-15 (Def.'s Counsel) (recognizing the need to \"ferret[ ] out [those expenses] that aren't Everlasting Life's expenses\" after trial) ). But no subsequent effort was ever undertaken to provide the Court with more reliable figures, much less any theory or formula for calculating the costs of Napper's production of the infringing goods and services. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Damages Trial Tr. at 157:1-158:8 (Def.'s Counsel) (lacking such a theory); Amended Joint Pretrial Statement, ECF No. 99, at 4 (asserting only that \"Defendant's profits were d[e] minimis\") ). And without any statement regarding\n   <em>\n    which\n   </em>\n   of the listed expenses are\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   attributable to the operation of the former Complex business (as opposed to Napper's other business concerns), this Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that the cost listings that Napper has provided prove all of the operating costs he now claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   But this is not the end of the matter as far as Napper's costs are concerned. Where a defendant in a trademark infringement case has failed to clearly demonstrate the costs attributable to their production of infringing goods, courts in this Circuit have nevertheless routinely considered other available evidence pertaining to a defendant's readily-attributable expenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breaking the Chain Found., Inc. v.

Here, an exhibit that has been offered to establish the Restaurant's gross sales also includes evidence of the \"[c]osts of [g]oods [s]old\" (i.e., the raw materials) between November 2011 and 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix B\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at B1.) According to this document, the Restaurant had a total Cost of Goods Sold of $1,232,518 in the period from November of 2011 through 2015, which consists of costs of $51,030 in the pertinent part of 2011, $482,464 in 2012, $449,206 in 2013, $197,617 in 2014, and $52,201 in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231029\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/625/1/#p3\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The accuracy of this document's representation of costs has not been disputed; therefore, this cost figure will be included in the deductions that must be made from the gross sales amounts calculated above in order to determine Napper's profits. Additionally, because the record reflects rent payments that Napper made to Kingdom Management from November 2011 through December 2015 totaling $379,234 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.2.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix A\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at A6-A7, A10-A11), the Court finds that these payments are directly attributable to\n   his infringing use of the mark and should also be subtracted from the Restaurant's gross sales. Finally, as noted in Part III.C.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court has found that two of the documents Defendant submitted provide credible evidence of additional expenses relating to the operation of the Restaurant in the last two years of the infringing period (2014 and 2015)-specifically, $227,210 in 2014, and $223,434 in 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.2. &amp; n.13,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Appendix C\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   at C1-C3.) These costs will be deducted as well. Thus, based on the record evidence, the proven expenses for operation of the Everlasting Life Restaurant between November 2011 and December 2015 total $2,062,396.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court will use this cost figure to calculate the profits that the Restaurant earned during this timeframe in accordance with the Lanham Act's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And after subtracting the established expenses attributable to the production of infringing goods from the total gross sales of the Restaurant for 2011 through 2015, the Court holds that Napper's profits from his infringing use of the mark from November 2011 until December 2015 total $1,493,032.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    d.

As previously mentioned, an award in that amount does not include any of the profits that the Restaurant has earned since January 2016, because the record contains no evidence regarding the Restaurant's gross sales or costs in 2016, 2017, or thus far in 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.2.c,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, the record lacks this evidence because Napper has failed to produce it (and not because the Restaurant ceased to operate and thus stopped infringing upon Prince Immanuel and Yah Kai's trademark rights). Therefore, the \"amount of ... recovery based on profits\" that consists only of the Restaurant's profits from November of 2011 until December 2015 is manifestly \"inadequate[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and as a result, the Court will adjust its award of profits upward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court is mindful that any such adjustment should be \"careful[ly] tailor[ed,]\"\n   <em>\n    Foxtrap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627155,670959\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/671/636/\">\n    671 F.2d at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and as a result, the Court will use the following approach. First, the Court will (generously) assume that the Restaurant's gross revenue and expenses in 2016, 2017, and the early part of 2018 (on a pro-rated basis of course) were the same as those figures were in the year 2015-which is the last year for which this Court has such information. Defendant's gross revenue and proven costs for 2015 were, respectively, $543,537 and $373,837 (consisting of rent payments, the cost of goods sold, and the expenses the\n   Court found were necessarily for the production of the infringing good and services in Part III.C.2,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), and thus Defendant's proven profits for 2015 were $169,700.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Next, the Court will attribute that amount of profits to the years 2016, 2017, and (on a pro-rated basis) 2018, because the Court has no better measure of Defendant's profits for those years, yet the profit generated in those years must be accounted for in the monetary damages award that the Court imposes. When this profit figure, $363,112, is added to the previously calculated profit from 2011 through 2015, the new total award is $1,856,144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Notably, in making this award of profits for the period from November 2011 to present, this Court rejects Plaintiffs' request for damages in the form of\n   <em>\n    treble\n   </em>\n   profits, which the Lanham Act allows in certain circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Dam. COL at 3-4, 9-10, 14.)

Nor can the Court credibly evaluate the loss to Yah Kai of having its business stolen based on the profits that the Restaurant generated when Napper reopened it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.C.2 &amp; n.13,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   (explaining that the Court has been able to determine Napper's actual profits only for 2014 and 2015).) It is clear from the record in this case that the Restaurant experienced a steady decrease in gross sales under Napper's management-which is entirely consistent with the Community's past experience with Napper's management of the Complex (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , July 15, 2015 Trial Tr. at 78:5-79:20)-and thus it cannot be said that the profits Napper earned after the takeover are necessarily representative of the full profits that Yah Kai would have generated if it had continued to run the Complex since 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Recognizing that the Court must do its best to evaluate actual damages regardless, this Court has scoured the record for credible evidence pertaining to Yah Kai's actual losses. During the liability trial, the parties stipulated to the admission of Yah Kai's corporate income tax returns for the Complex for 2009 and 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 14, 2015 Trial Tr. at 9:16-19.) Of the instant trove of financial records, the Complex's\n   tax return for 2010 provides the best indication of the Complex's true profits prior to Napper's takeover, and this document indicates that the Complex had profits totaling $161,602 for the year 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Everlasting Life Health Complex 2010 Tax Return, Pls.' Liability Trial Ex. 9, ECF 114-6, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that figure-which represents\n   <em>\n    12 months\n   </em>\n   of lost profits-the Court believes that it can confidently award Yah Kai actual damages in the amount of $181,802, as compensation for the 14-month period from November of 2011 through the end of 2012 (the first year of Napper's takeover). But the Court will stop there, and will not proceed further with the actual damages projections, due to its uncertainty regarding how the Complex actually would have fared under Yah Kai's management many years into the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In fact, it is at this point in the actual damages analysis that the Court will pivot away from attempted precision and exercise the discretion that is afforded to the Court under the Lanham Act when the actual harm to a plaintiff is evaluated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (authorizing a court to treble the award of actual damages). The Court finds that an equitable increase in the aforementioned actual damages amount is entirely justified given the facts presented in this case, for as hazy as the actual magnitude of the harm to Yah Kai in the seven years following the takeover might be, one thing is crystal clear: as a result of Napper's actions in November of 2011, Prince Immanuel, Yah Kai, and the Community went from being profitable Maryland business owners to having no business to speak of-literally overnight. There is no question that Plaintiffs have suffered a significant harm and that Napper's self-help strategy had long-lasting ramifications; therefore, in this Court's view, the actual damages figure\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   extend beyond the mere ascertainable profits that Plaintiffs were forced to forgo in the one year following their eviction. This Court concludes that trebling those damages, as the Lanham Act permits, is the\n   <em>\n    least\n   </em>\n   that can be done to compensate Plaintiffs for their substantial loss, and as a result, the total award of enhanced actual damages will be $545,407.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Foxtrap\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627155,670959\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/671/636/\">\n    671 F.2d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

And even though Napper is entirely and utterly wrong about his ability to claim legal ownership of the business,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yah Kai I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (making clear that \"Napper's vision of his rights and entitlements is inconsistent with the law and is not supported by the facts that were established during the trial\"), the Court concludes that Napper's actions were motivated by this mistaken belief-not by a malicious intent. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Damages Trial Tr. at 99:14-17 (\"Everlasting Life had been my business. I established it, and I established it for the purposes that it serves now, and your decision didn't change my heart.\"); 100:11-13 (\"So I realized what was written on the paper, but I knew what was right.

This is all I had, Your Honor.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This means that even though Napper wrongfully and willfully infringed upon the trademark and engaged in unfair business practices with respect to Prince Immanuel and Yah Kai, punitive damages are not appropriate, because the evidence does not support a finding of actual malice under Maryland law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food Fair Stores, Inc. v.

Therefore, Plaintiffs' request for punitive damages must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiffs have also failed to establish that they are entitled to an award of injunctive relief. Although the record does make clear that Napper has willfully continued to use the Everlasting Life trademark, Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is too vague to be enforced. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Dam. Br. at 6 (asking for \"injunctive relief including, but not limited to a ruling that invalidates Napper's continued use of Plaintiffs' trade name\"); Pls.' Dam. COL at\n   3 (same).) One wonders whether, by requesting \"invalidation\" of Napper's use of the trade name, Plaintiffs are seeking an injunction that requires Napper merely to change the name of his Restaurant, or are they asking this Court to enjoin Napper's continued operation of the business that is and has always operated under that trade name? Plaintiffs have not provided clarification, such as any proposed language for their requested injunction, and their lack of specificity makes it difficult for the Court to\n   <em>\n    evaluate\n   </em>\n   the scope of the requested injunction, much less order it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Even more significant is the fact that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the current status of Prince Immanuel's trademark registration or analyzed its impact on the requested injunctive relief, if any. The record indicates that Prince Immanuel's trademark registration lapsed in 2016, and not only have Plaintiffs ceased to manage any food-service establishment since the 2011 eviction, but Napper is also apparently in the process of applying for registration of substantially the same mark before the USPTO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.4,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the threat of future harm to Prince Immanuel as the trademark owner-which is a requirement for injunctive relief under the Lanham Act (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   )-is unclear at this time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ALPO Petfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5676827,10538037\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/958/\">\n    913 F.2d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (pointing out that the \"propriety of a permanent injunction\" depends in part on \"whether a defendant is likely to cause future harm\");\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836238\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/104/12/#p18\">\n    104 F.Supp.3d at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Without a demonstration of a threat of ongoing harm, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff will suffer any irreparable injury.\").

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) For the reasons explained below, this Court concludes that Yah Kai has demonstrated its entitlement to $17,864 in damages for its tangible equipment and goods, and that it is also entitled to recover $125,000 for Napper's conversion of its intangible interests, which represents the established value of Yah Kai's intangible interest in the PEPCO rebate.

To recover damages for the tangible items that Napper converted, Yah Kai must provide evidence of the market value of its equipment, inventory, and other chattels within the Capitol Heights Everlasting Life facility, and although the existing record is sparse in this regard (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), as explained above, this Court finds that Yah Kai has provided evidence-in the form of William Young's deposition testimony-to support the conclusion that the tangible items converted included assets with a market value at the time of at least $17,864 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Dam. Br. at 16.) This Court will award that measure of damages as well, because Maryland common law provides that conversion of a physical document evidencing an intangible property right permits recovery of \"the value of the right evidenced or represented by the document.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

Thus, as set forth in the accompanying order,\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT WILL BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFFS' FAVOR\n   </strong>\n   as follows. With regard to the trademark infringement and unfair competition claims, this Court finds Defendant liable to Plaintiffs in the amount of $2,401,551 based on an accounting of Defendant's profits from infringing goods and Plaintiffs' actual damages, and Plaintiffs are also entitled to attorney fees and litigations costs. Defendant is also liable to Plaintiff Yah Kai for common law conversion in the amount of $142,864, and for prejudgment interest totaling $54,434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Attachment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   APPENDICES\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   APPENDIX A\n   APPENDIX B\n   APPENDIX C\n   --------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Court rejected Plaintiffs' contention that Napper had usurped a corporate opportunity in violation of Maryland common law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yah Kai I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     195 F.Supp.3d at 325-26\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The entire corpus of the findings that the parties have proposed to the Court appear in two tables that were completed in several iterations.

Napper has presented the Court with a bound 8 \u00bd by 11-inch book in portrait orientation-rather than an actual spreadsheet-and thus has rendered virtually incomprehensible data that is ordinarily displayed on the computer across a much wider field and is critical to this case. It appears that defense counsel merely printed off the information sequentially, and made no effort to line up subsequent expense fields with the vendor to whom they relate or otherwise explain how the Court is supposed to access the information, and thus, as the Court explained at trial, this document borders on useless.

Napper testified that \"that was part of our code ... and when somebody was challenged ... we came together collectively and addressed it.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 89:15-22.) Community members also apparently believe that everything they built, and all of the resources that were brought to the effort, belonged to the Community; therefore, the Community's members did not always document what items or assets belonged to whom as a matter of law. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., id.\n    </em>\n    at 88:7-13 (noting that Napper did not document payments the community gave him).)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    In one paradigmatic example of the many epic discovery failures that took place in this case, Plaintiffs were forced to call both Napper and another witness back to the stand during the bench trial on liability (after they had previously testified) because Napper had not provided requested documents during the pretrial discovery process. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mot. to Recall Def. Napper, ECF No. 59, at 1.) The requested documentation was significant, because it revealed a written settlement agreement between Napper and Plaintiffs' landlord, Kingdom Management, regarding a PEPCO rebate-an intangible right to recover on a debt of which Plaintiffs were previously unaware. (\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    ) Similarly, Napper repeatedly failed to produce requested business and tax records, including data identifying gross sales attributable to the Restaurant that did not surface until after the bench trial on damages had concluded. These delays occurred despite Plaintiffs' repeated, urgent requests for exactly this information. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

Given all of the other years have a negative value for the \"Cost of Goods Sold\" column, and the value refers to a \"Cost[,]\" the Court presumes this to be a clerical error and treats the \"Costs of Goods Sold\" in 2013 as costs that are to be subtracted from ordinary income.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Determining Napper's rental expenses was a tedious and frustrating affair, largely due to the lack of documentation for rental payments for some months. For example, the Itemized Expenses document suggests that Napper did not pay rent in August 2012, March 2015, or September 2015, but, in other months such as October 2013, Napper paid significantly more than the amount due for that month - $10,771.48 instead of the $7,645.63 that appears to have been the typical rent during that time period. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Itemized Expenses at 96, 299 or\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Appendix A\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    at A7, A12.) The Court has thus settled on the following approach to arriving at the total cost of actual payments. Relying on the Itemized Expenses document, the Court determined what Napper's rental payments were likely to be for each month, based on the assumption that (1) Napper paid rent every month, and (2) the monthly rent stayed constant from month to month unless there was a rent increase borne out by the next few months. The estimated monthly rent amounts are: $7,000 (November 2011-December 2011); $7,076.97 (January 2012-October 2012); $7,351.13 (November 2012-June 2013); $7,645.63 (July 2013-April 2014); $7,624.67 (May 2014-December 2014); $7,926.93 (January 2015-April 2015); $8,213.65 (May 2015-October 2015); $8,681.02 (November 2015); and $8,531.02 (December 2015). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Itemized Expenses 95-96, 298-99 or\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Appendix A\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    at A6-A7, A10-A11.) Multiplying each of these amounts by the number of months for which that amount was owed and adding up the resulting sums produces the estimated total value of Napper's rental expenses between 2011 and 2015-$379,234.06.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    The Court arrived at these operating-expense figures by examining certain documents that Napper provided (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Supplement Itemized Costs and Expenses for Everlasting Life 2014; Supplement Itemized Costs and Expenses for Everlasting Life 2015, both attached hereto as\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Appendix C\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    ), and excluding certain listed expenses that the Court deemed inaccurate and/or impermissibly included for the purposes of the instant calculation. For example, for 2014, the Court did not consider: the listed payments made for rent or the Costs of Goods Sold (since those expenses had already been accounted for and should not be deducted twice from the business's revenue); \"[c]ontractor\" expenses (given Napper's habit of compensating himself or his family through these categories); and expenses for \"[t]ravel[,]\" \"[m]iscellaneous[,]\" and \"gifts\" (because it is unclear how those expenses relate to Napper's infringing use). The Court also excluded these same categories of expenses for 2015 for the same reasons (to the extent that the same categories appeared in 2015), the \"[r]eimbursement\" expenses for the same reason that it did not consider the \"[c]ontractor\" expenses in 2014, and 2015 expenses for \"[c]ashier error\" or \"[g]ift card payment\" in the absence of an explanation of how those expenses were necessary for the production of the Restaurant's goods and services.

Nevertheless, because this Court finds that Napper did willfully infringe upon Prince Immanuel's trademark (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Part IV.A.2.a,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    ), an award of profits is appropriate in this case under either of the approaches taken by the circuit courts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The Court acknowledges that this cost figure does not include Napper's expenses for running the Restaurant from 2011 through 2013, other than the rental payments that were made and the costs of the goods sold during those years. As this Court has previously noted, the defendant has not provided the Court with a trustworthy accounting of all of the Restaurant's expenses during this two-year period.

The Court's profit figure makes certain adjustments that reasonably account for the Complex's actual profit during the relevant period. The Court arrives at the profit amount of $161,602 by taking the Complex's gross income and deducting the costs related to salaries and wages, repairs and maintenance, rents, taxes and licenses, depreciation, and advertising. The Court has also subtracted the value listed for \"other deductions,\" because it is uncertain as to what expenses those deductions actually covered, and they could well have been related to expenses that were necessary to run the business. However, because the line-item pertaining to \"charitable contributions\" is not even theoretically related to actual cost of operating the Complex, the $125,836 in charitable contributions that the Complex made in 2012 has not been counted as a cost for the purpose of the Court's projections regarding the profit that Yah Kai would have generated if Napper had not evicted Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    As the Court noted in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at the liability phase of this trial, only Yah Kai has sustained its burden of demonstrating ownership of the converted tangible and intangible assets, as is necessary for entitlement to damages for conversion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Yah Kai I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173556\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/287/#p326\">\n     195 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    322 n.16.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    Napper does not, and cannot, contest that he had access to the business records left in the Capitol Heights facility when Yah Kai was evicted from the premises, nor does he contest that had access to the facility prior to the eviction. Thus, Napper had possession of Yah Kai's tax records, inventories, and the equipment itself, and therefore had the capacity to make a reasonable estimation of the value of the rebate at the time he converted those documents. Indeed, at the time of the lease and rebate negotiations, Napper himself was in a far better position than Yah Kai (and this Court) is now to estimate the value of the intangible rights that he converted. That is, as discussed previously, whatever the actual amount of the overpayment that was being reimbursed, Napper used the invoices for Yah Kai's utilities payments as the basis of the settlement price he negotiated, so t his Court's conclusion that Yah Kai's intangible right to recover for this debt had a value of $125,000 was, in fact, estimated by Napper at the time of the conversion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    To the extent that Napper maintains that the underlying overpayments that were the impetus for the rebate were made\n    <em>\n     by him\n    </em>\n    between 2004 through 2008-in his prior capacity as the Complex's manager before Yah Kai was formed (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Damages Trial Tr. at 167:3-7 (Def.'s Counsel) )-this representation not only reflects Napper's misunderstanding of legal ownership, it is also directly contrary to the testimony that the Kingdom Management representative provided at the liability trial. The witness specifically stated that the overpayment settlement amount was calculated using invoices for approximately \"a three-year period ... going into 2011 until we actually separated the meter\" (July 15, 2015 Trial Tr. at 88:4-20 (Allen) ). This means that Yah Kai was actually paying the utility bills during the relevant timeframe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    The following appendices contain relevant excerpts of documents discussed in the memorandum opinion and are included to provide the reader with a sense of the financial information the Court had access to in making its determinations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
