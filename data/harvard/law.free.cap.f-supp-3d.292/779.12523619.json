Cossairt (\"Cossairt\") was hired as a laborer by Jarrett Builders, Inc. (\"Jarrett\") in January 2015, and, on April 1, 2015, was promoted to foreman. Less than a year later she was fired, ostensibly because of conflicts with other employees and her inability to perform the duties of a foreman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Viewing the reason for her termination differently, Cossairt filed suit in the Circuit Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, alleging sexual discrimination and harassment, unequal pay, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. After the case was removed to this Court and Cossairt's deposition had been taken, Jarrett moved for summary judgment on her harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. In addition to the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 16) and accompanying Memorandum of Law (Doc. No. 17), Jarrett filed a\n   Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. No. 1) containing 75 paragraphs. In response, Cossairt filed her own Memorandum of Law (Doc. No. 26), along with a Declaration (Doc. No. 27-2) that largely serves as the basis for her own Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts (Doc. No. 27) containing 66 paragraphs. Jarrett then filed a reply (Doc. No. 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Typically, this Court begins its analysis of a summary judgment motion by setting forth the undisputed facts and noting any facts that may be in dispute. That approach is neither practical nor efficient in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Not only are the combined 141 paragraphs (and an equal number of responses) somewhat unwieldy for an uncomplicated single plaintiff employment case, they set forth a widely divergent view of the working atmosphere at Jarrett. More importantly, Cossairt's Declaration is the subject of a Motion to Strike (Doc. No. 31) by Jarrett that produced yet another round of briefing (Doc. Nos. 32, 35 &amp; 38). Because resolution of that Motion is effectively outcome determinative of the partial motion for summary judgment as it relates to Cossairt's sexual harassment claim, the Court turns to it first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Strike\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jarrett took Cossairt's deposition on June 26, 2017. Four months later, Cossairt filed her Declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jarrett moves to strike Cossairt's Declaration on the grounds that it \"attempts to contradict much of Cossairt's earlier deposition testimony and tries to breath life into her hostile workplace claim and her claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" (Doc. No. 31 at 1). Not only should the Declaration be stricken Jarrett argues, attorney's fees and expenses should be awarded \"as a result of the bad faith submission of that Declaration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Federal courts \"have held with virtual unanimity that a party cannot create a genuine issue of fact sufficient to survive summary judgment simply by contradicting his or her own previous sworn statement (by, say, filing a later affidavit that flatly contradicts that party's earlier sworn deposition) without explaining the contradiction or attempting to resolve the disparity.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v.

To address the problem, courts, including the Sixth Circuit, have developed the \"sham affidavit doctrine\" which \"prevents a party from submitting a new affidavit to manufacture a factual dispute by contradicting an earlier testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

With regard to the issue of whether the affidavit attempts to create a sham issue of fact, the\n   <em>\n    Aerel\n   </em>\n   court went on to endorse a \"non-exhaustive list of factors\" that asks \" 'whether the affiant was cross-examined during his earlier testimony, whether the affiant had access to the pertinent evidence at the time of his earlier testimony or whether the affidavit was based on newly discovered evidence, and whether the earlier testimony reflects confusion [that] the affidavit attempts to explain.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p907\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p907\">\n    at 908-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Franks v.

Based upon that review, the Court finds that Cossairt's Declaration is generally consistent with, and an amplification of, her prior deposition testimony, and was not submitted simply in an effort to forestall the entry of judgment against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jarrett's Motion to Strike is premised primarily on the argument that Cossairt stated in her deposition that she did not believe that she had been sexually harassed during the time she was a laborer, yet, in her Declaration, she points to incidents prior to March 30, 2015 (before she became a foreman) as supporting her sexual harassment claim. Cossairt's statements on this issue do not directly contradict her deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To the contrary, while Cossairt replied \"no\" to the question of whether she believed she was sexually harassed while a laborer, she also explained that it took her a while to realize exactly what was going on and that the harassment \"built up. So there was times I believe I was but didn't really start until I became a foreman..\" (Doc. No. 18-3, Cossairt Depo. at 131). Cossairt also elaborated on this point later in her deposition. When asked why she did not complain to Jason Jarrett, the owner of the company, when she met with him early in her employment, she explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. But my question is, what was on-Why didn't you tell him what was on your mind? If at that point you were sexually harassed, why didn't you tell him that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. In the beginning, I didn't-I didn't-I didn't feel that as much. It eventually-it brought me down slowly. It took me a long time to realize what I was actually going through, and it took me-still to this day, I-I'm still getting over it. I-I didn't know at the time. I though that I what I was being put through and dealing with was just part of working with men, and I wanted to fit in, so I didn't at the time realize I was being sexually harassed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Hostile environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts. Their very nature involves repeated conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    536 U.S. 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p115\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Absent egregious and exceptional circumstances, it is a cumulative series of acts or comments that build up subjectively and create objectively an alleged hostile work environment. The Court will not disregard what Cossairt claims occurred as a laborer simply because she may not have recognized it as sexual harassment at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Jarrett also argues that, in several of the paragraphs of her Declaration, Cossairt claims she \"made clear to [her] supervisor Steven Cook\" that various comments were not appropriate when, in fact, \"Cossairt\n   did not testify that she had told Cook or anyone else with Defendant that she considered the comments to be inappropriate or unwelcomed.\" (Doc. No. 32 at 3). As sole support for the argument, Jarrett relies on Cossairt's deposition responses to questions relating to Cook's alleged comments about \"beating the brakes\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   off of females. Jarrett argues Cossairt's responses are in \"keeping with\" her testimony about objecting to inappropriate statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. Now did you-did you tell him not to say this kind of stuff?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. I-yeah, Yes. I-I'd give him a disgusted look and kind of walk away and almost just laugh at-not-like, an awkward confusion as \"Do you think that's funny? Do you think that's okay?\" And he would just kind of smile at me like it was no big deal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. So you directly told him to stop?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Yes. Maybe not \"stop.\" Maybe, like I said, this is how rumors get started, why are you doing this, what-I mean, I didn't use the word \"stop.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Doc. No. 27-2 Cossairt Depo. at 289-90). Such testimony does not directly contradict Cossairt's statement in her Declaration that she endeavored to make clear to Cook that the comments were unwelcomed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Furthermore, in setting forth the foregoing colloquy, Jarrett omits the following exchange between counsel and Cossairt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Did you ever tell him not to say this anymore? I mean-and I don't mean like giving him the look. I mean actually say, \"Don't talk like that in front of me., don't talk-I'm offended by that.\" Anything like that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. I'm sure I did a couple of times. Not as much as I wish I would have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 290). Whatever discrepancies there may be between what Cossairt said in her deposition and her Declaration on this issue may be the fodder for cross-examination, but it is hardly a sufficient basis to strike Cossairt's Declaration in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jarrett also argues that Cossairt's Declaration contradicts her deposition testimony about how she felt when Brian Duncan (Cook's superior) allegedly asked her out on a date. Jarrett notes that, in her Declaration, Cossairt claims Duncan's request \"affected her job performance\" and \"she made it clear to him this was unwelcomed,\" but \"she did not say any such thing during her deposition testimony on this topic.\" (Doc. No. 32 at 4). As support, Jarrett relies upon the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q....Brian Duncan asked you out on a date, Was he joking in your estimation or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. He wasn't joking. He tried to play it off like he was joking when he was-I felt like he was putting the feelers out there to see what my reaction was, but said it in a certain way that he could act like he didn't meant it-or mean it when I responded to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Okay. Did you find that to be sexually offensive when he did that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. Not sexually, but offensive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q....Okay. So if he's done what you have said, he's asked you out, putting feelers out there, and you feel offended by that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Mm-hmm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. -why would you let him work with you in music?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Because I didn't understand it then. I thought that-I didn't accept it then. I tried to just think-I was surrounded by guys that are always joking about cheating on their wives or doing this or, you know, whatever, and I thought he was just talking at the time, and I-I didn't understand it. And now looking back at this mess, I do....But now that I've had a taste of better people in different companies, I would never do that again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Doc. No. 27-2, Cossairt Depo. at 151-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The foregoing does not show that Cossairt's Declaration directly contradicts her deposition testimony. Quite the opposite; she testified that, while she may not have found Duncan's request sexually offensive, she was offended by it and felt it to be inappropriate. Furthermore, Cossairt cannot be faulted for failing to answer a question that was not asked, to wit, whether she felt Duncan's request affected her job performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The failure to ask the right questions also leads the Court to conclude that Cossairt's Declaration should not be stricken insofar as it supports her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. True, Cossairt's Declaration goes into a litany of complaints about the physical and emotional toll the alleged harassment had on her, only a very minute portion of which was discussed at her deposition. However, the focus of the questioning at the deposition was largely on what Cossairt did or did not tell her physician and other medical providers, and the prescriptions she may have received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Counsel began the questioning by noting that \"part of the lawsuit says that there are emotional injuries,\" and then referenced a Vanderbilt University medical report. The questioning thereafter did not drill down into the basis for Cossairt's claim of anxiety, loss of sleep, extreme embarrassment, mood swings, crying, spells and depression, as alleged in the Amended Complaint. Instead, Cossairt primarily was asked whether she told her doctors about her emotional health and whether any medical professional had told her that her emotional state was due to her having worked at Jarrett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The deposition preparation checklist for every competent litigator instructs the deponent not to volunteer information and to tell the truth. A \"deponent is under no obligation to volunteer information not fairly sought by the questioner,\" and nothing \"prevent[s] a party who was not directly questioned about an issue from supplementing incomplete deposition testimony with a sworn affidavit. Such an affidavit fills a gap left open by the moving party and thus provides the district court with more information, rather than less, at the crucial summary judgment stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Aerel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113026\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/899/#p907\">\n    448 F.3d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will not strike Cossairt's declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because Cossairt's Declaration will not be stricken, Jarrett's additional request for attorney's fees and expenses must be denied.

Even under these facts, then-Judge Sharp carefully found the \"outrageousness\" element to be a \"closer call\" than the \"serious mental injury\" element, but allowed the claim to go forward because the matter was before the court on a motion to dismiss where plaintiff's burden was simply to articulate a plausible claim under the notice pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pollard\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff worked in the hydrogen peroxide area of a Dupont plant. Her intentional infliction of emotional distress claims was based upon years of mistreatment, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Co-workers refused to take directions from plaintiff because she was a woman, and placed a Bible on her desk open to the passage, \"I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over man. She must be silent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   After DuPont implemented a \"take your daughter to work day,\" an email titled\n   \"Bull Mularky\" that took issues with the program that was circulated at the plant. Thereafter, employees were instructed by the control room operator \"not to eat with [plaintiff], share food with her, be in the break room with her, talk to her,\" or take instructions from her without consulting him first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   At least five times a week the control room operator stated that he did \"not approve of women working in the peroxide department,\" and \"consistently, and routinely referred to women as 'bitches,' 'cunts,' 'heifers,' and 'split tails.' \" Several other men in the department also used such \"terms to refer to women in general and to plaintiff in particular.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The inappropriate conduct was brought to management's attention, but the control room operator \"made it plain he was not going to change his behavior,\" and nothing was ever done about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   After this ineffective counseling, \"the situation worsened,\" with the control room operator setting off fire alarms in plaintiff's work areas, and co-workers turning up the stove to burn the food plaintiff was cooking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Worker's also repeatedly sabotaged plaintiff's work area, such that it made it appear plaintiff was not doing her job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The tires on the bicycle plaintiff used to get around the plant were slashed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   When plaintiff claimed the control room operator tried to run her off the road, he \"got in plaintiff's face\" and said, \"[n]obody in this area likes you, you're here all alone, it's all your own fault.\" A manager who was present for this exchange did nothing to de-escalate the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff was \"afraid for her safety and was concerned that a dangerous situation might arise in the peroxide area of which the men would not inform her.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   When plaintiff went on short-term disability leave for six months based in part on the advice of Dupont's psychologist, the company would not guarantee that she would not be placed on the same shift as her chief tormenter, the control room operator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   After again finding Bible verses about the supposed superiority of men and unable to take it anymore, plaintiff left her employment, prompting the entire shift hold a party and fish fry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8969925\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/657/#p664\">\n    412 F.3d at 660-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
