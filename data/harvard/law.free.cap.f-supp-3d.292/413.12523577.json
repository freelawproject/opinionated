Regulatory Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As this matter involves a twist on a typical stay put case insofar as it intertwines IDEA's provisions regarding a request for a change in placement with those governing disciplinary proceedings, I begin with an analysis of the applicable regulatory scheme. The IDEA's stay put provision, as codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j) and implemented\n   in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.518\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Except as provided in \u00a7 300.533, during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a due process complaint notice requesting a due process hearing under \u00a7 300.507, unless the State or local agency and the parents of the child agree otherwise, the child involved in the complaint must remain in his or her current educational placement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While the Plaintiff believes that this fairly straight-forward regulation ends the query and necessitates M.K.'s return to Haynes because there indisputably is an ongoing administrative proceeding, the School presents the matter as more nuanced. It claims that it is acting pursuant to the specific exemption outlined in stay put, Section 300.533, \"Placement during appeals,\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   When an appeal under \u00a7 300.532 has been made by either the parent or the LEA, the child must remain in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer or until the expiration of the time period specified in \u00a7 300.530(c) or (g), whichever occurs first, unless the parent and the SEA or LEA agree otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the School has sought a hearing under Section 300.532, which permits a LEA \"that believes that maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others, may appeal the decision [of the placement] by requesting a hearing,\" it reads Section 300.533 to require M.K. to \"remain in the interim alternative educational setting pending the decision of the hearing officer\"-in this case, homebound education.

Injunction (\"Def.'s Opp.\") 6-7, ECF No. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   However, Section 300.533 sets forth limits to which the child may be in an interim alternative educational setting. The outer limit is bounded by either the \"decision of the hearing officer or [ ] the expiration of the time period specified in \u00a7 300.530(c) [governing behavior determined not to be a manifestation of the child's disability] or (g), whichever occurs first.\" As relevant here, subsection (g), \"Special circumstances,\" permits LEAs to \"remove a student to an\n   <em>\n    interim\n   </em>\n   alternative educational setting for\n   <em>\n    not more than 45 days\n   </em>\n   \" if the child \"[h]as inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.530\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphases added).

In the School's view, since it has sought a hearing to change M.K.'s placement to another school on the basis that his continuing at Haynes would be substantially likely to result in injury to himself or others, it is permitted to extend the original 45 day removal. Def.'s Opp. 7. This reading, however, is foreclosed by the language of the provisions upon which the Defendant relies. Section 300.532 relates to a hearing officer's authority to remove a child to an interim alternative educational setting, and it is clear that a\n   <em>\n    hearing officer\n   </em>\n   may prospectively order the change of placement for a 45 day period, which may be renewed upon further appeal and determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.532\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3). In contrast, M.K. was removed from the school upon Haynes' self-determination, not a hearing officer's.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.532\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300.530(g) (\"\n   <em>\n    School\n   </em>\n   personnel may remove a student ... for not more than 45 school days\") (emphasis added). Thus, upon expiration of the School's authority to remove pursuant to Section 300.530(g), the stay put provision governs until such time as the hearing officer issues a determination in the administrative hearing. Should the hearing officer order that the child be in an interim alternative educational setting, that determination would apply prospectively, and not function to ratify additional time already spent in an alternative education setting in excess of the 45 days permitted by Section 300.530(g).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

I agree that the four part test may apply, and conclude that it does warrant a different outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Application of the Traditional Four Part Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The first aspect of the test, the Plaintiff's substantial likelihood of success on the merits, weighs in favor of Ms. Olu-Cole for the reasons explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Part III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the second prong, I find that M.K. would not suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted. Although his IEP provides that most of his instructional time be in a general educational setting, it is not contested that he was properly removed from Haynes in November for 45 school days, and the earliest date that he could have returned was February 1, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim. Injunction 15 n.5. During this time, it appears that Haynes has made a good faith effort to continue providing services to enable M.K. to meet the goals set forth in his IEP, and to attempt to work with Ms. Olu-Cole to address her concerns about the services provided to M.K. in the interim alternative educational setting. Def.'s Opp. 14-15. Although Ms. Olu-Cole asserts that M.K. is floundering outside of the general educational setting, it appears that this is at least in part due to M.K.'s own unwillingness to cooperate with his tutors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 n.6. As a decision by the hearing officer is expected in the next two weeks, the incremental time that M.K. will have spent out of school does not amount to irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The third prong, which looks to whether an injunction would injure other interested parties, also weighs in the Defendant's favor. Granting an injunction in this instance would risk the safety of other students as well as to M.K. himself. The School alleges that this is not the first act of violence perpetrated by M.K., and that the other incidents involved both students and staff members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Although it appears that M.K. has made progress through mentoring and counseling sessions provided by the D.C. Superior Court's Balanced and Restorative Justice program, Mot. for Prelim. Injunction \u00b6 32, the risk of harm to himself, other students, and Haynes' staff is such that returning him to school at this time-with two weeks expected until the hearing officer's determination, one potential result of which is placement in an alternative educational setting-would raise an unacceptably significant potential of injury to other interested parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Last, consideration of the public interest strongly favors the School. There is a significant public interest in maintaining school safety.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Little Rock School Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651624\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/582/159/#p162\">\n    582 F.Supp. 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 162 (E.D. Ark. 1984). The Plaintiff candidly characterizes M.K.'s behavior as a \"violent physical altercation\" during which M.K. \"punched the student in the head repeatedly\" and resulted in the other student suffering a concussion. Compl. \u00b6 13. While the Plaintiff's description alone convinces\n   me of the significant public interest supporting the Defendant's position, the Defendant's description of the incident further reinforces this determination. The School alleges that the other student had to be transported to the hospital in an ambulance, and suffered a seizure, significant bruising, and memory loss. Pl.'s Opp. 1. That this incident resulted in \"serious bodily injury\" warranting suspension is uncontested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.530\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), (i)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"serious bodily injury\" as that involving \"a substantial risk of death; extreme physical pain; protected and obvious disfigurement; or protracted loss of impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty\"). Criminal charges have been filed against M.K. for this attack. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Nor was this an isolated incident; the record suggests that this attack was the latest in multiple violent incidents with other students and Haynes staff. Def.'s Opp. 12-13. Like the School, this Court must give due consideration to the best interests of M.K.'s classmates, not just his best interests. In light of this troubling attack, the evidence of other violent altercations, and the paucity of evidence suggesting that M.K. no longer poses a danger to other students, the public interest is a significant consideration and strongly weighs against the use of this Court's equitable powers to require the School to integrate M.K. into the student body pending the administrative hearing process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In weighing all four parts of the test, I find that only the first of the four prongs favors M.K. and that the fourth prong is entitled to substantial weight in this case. Thus, I agree with the School that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for this Court to issue a preliminary injunction requiring Haynes to re-admit M.K. at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Whatever detriment M.K. faces by remaining outside of a general educational setting for an additional ten school days is more than outweighed by the very real potential for physical danger that his presence at Haynes would pose to his fellow students and Haynes staff. For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction will be denied. A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Though the School briefly argues that the Plaintiff has not exhausted administrative remedies, it simultaneously recognizes that for IDEA stay put cases, parents are not required to exhaust the administrative process before seeking judicial review. Def.'s Opp. 14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Defendant also points out that the statute and implementing regulations do not have identical language, and that the statute does not set Section 300.530(g) (45 days) as an outer bound of the length of time a child shall be placed in an alternative educational setting. Def.'s Opp. 8. To Defendant, this means that the School is entitled to keep M.K. in an alternative educational setting until the hearing officer's decision.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n     at 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This misinterpretation also derives from a misreading. While\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201415\">\n     20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (k)(4) does not cross-reference to the special circumstances provision as it does in the regulation, it requires that the LEA arrange for an expedited hearing that \"shall occur within 20 school days ... and shall result in a determination within 10 school days after the hearing.\" Thus, the statute contemplates a decision within 30 school days, well within the 45 days provided by the special circumstances provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Henry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11552052\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/70/52/\">\n     70 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    58 n.5 (\"I disagree with those courts that have suggested that the stay-put provision provides the parents of a disabled child with a right to an automatic injunction .... the stay-put provision does not, strictly speaking, authorize the issuance of automatic injunctions. Instead, it entitles parents to injunctive relief upon proof of a violation unless the School District can determine that the application of the preliminary injunction favors the proposed change in placement.\"). Though district courts may disagree how to characterize the relief sought, it is nevertheless settled that a court may, in an exercise of its equitable powers, fashion appropriate relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11552052\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/70/52/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Honig\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601398\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/305/#p308\">\n     484 U.S. at 327\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601398\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/305/#p308\">\n     108 S.Ct. 592\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
