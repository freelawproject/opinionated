CROCKER, Magistrate Judge\n   This lawsuit presents a land contract dispute that arises out of a failed frac sand mining venture. Jurisdiction is present under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 13, 2017 Ord., dkt. 41 (denying motion to dismiss for lack of diversity jurisdiction). Plaintiff Larchmont Holdings, LLC (created by David Westrate, Neil Benham, and Patricia and Richard McHugh) agreed to pay defendant William Bethke and\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   LLC, North Shore Services (hereafter collectively referred to as North Shore) $4 million on a land contract for 300 acres of wooded land in North Central Wisconsin. Larchmont anticipated that it could quickly assemble and bring on line a frac sand mine from which Larchmont's members would reap millions in yearly profits and pay off the land contract. The mining operation never got off the ground, which left Larchmont with half a square mile of forest and past due installment payments on the land contract's $2,275,000 balance. So, Larchmont brought this lawsuit, asserting seven different claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint, dkt. 56. In its answer, North Shore filed counterclaims for strict foreclosure on its land contract and for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 58 at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the court is North Shore's motion for summary judgment on its strict foreclosure counterclaim and on all seven of Larchmont's contract-related claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 73. North Shore has not moved for summary judgment on its counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 58. In its response, Larchmont has raised a series of affirmative defenses to North Shore's claim for strict foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 91 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons explained below, I am granting North Shore's motion for summary judgment against all seven of Larchmont's contract claims. As for North Shore's motion for summary judgment on its strict foreclosure claim, I conclude that North Shore has the right of strict foreclosure under the terms of the land contract and has satisfied the elements of such a claim. That said, I am denying North Shore's motion because it has not developed an argument that some of Larchmont's affirmative defenses-specifically laches, equitable estoppel, and unclean hands-fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PRELIMINARY PROCEDURAL OBSERVATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the court's review and analysis of the summary judgment submissions, I found that, while the attorneys for both sides presented work that is well-above-average, sometimes they said too much, other times they said too little.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As for the \"too much,\" both parties failed to comply consistently with the court's summary judgment procedures, which are provided in the preliminary pretrial conference order (dkt. 22). The procedures state that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   When a responding party disputes a proposed finding of fact, the response must be limited to those facts necessary to raise a dispute. The court will disregard any new facts that are not directly responsive to the proposed fact. If a responding party believes that more facts are necessary to tell its story, it should include them in its own proposed facts, as discussed in II.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Proc. to be Followed on Mot. For Summ. Judg.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 II.D.4 at 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Contrary to this directive, both parties included new facts-often several paragraphs of new facts-in several of their responses to the opposing party's proposed findings of fact. Accordingly, I have disregarded new facts included only in a party's response to a proposed finding of fact.\n   <em>\n    Abraham v. Wash. Grp. Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200578\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/735/#p737\">\n    766 F.3d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (7th Cir. 2014) (\"[T]his Circuit has routinely held that a district court may strictly enforce compliance with its local rules regarding summary judgment motions.\");\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v.

Although I agree that Larchmont proposed findings of fact that duplicate its responses to North Shore's proposed factual findings, I did not see Larchmont violating this procedural requirement by proposing additional facts\n   <em>\n    in lieu of\n   </em>\n   providing responses to defendants' proposed findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As for the \"too little,\" notwithstanding the length, detail, and general thoroughness of their presentations, both sides waived arguments by failing properly to present them. As noted below where this occurred, this court does not have the time or resources to explore or analyze matters left unexplored or unanalyzed by the parties. So, pursuant to circuit law, the court has enforced the waivers against the waiving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following facts are undisputed except where noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Larchmont Holdings, LLC is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on December 18, 2012, with its principal place of business in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The members of Larchmont include David Westrate's Roth IRA and traditional IRA, Dr. Neal Benham's Roth IRA, Patricia and Richard McHugh, and Oakdale, LLC. Oakdale LLC's members are David Westrate and the Westerberry Family Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant North Shore Services, LLC is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the Wisconsin on October 18, 2000, with its principal place of business in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. William Bethke, a citizen of Wisconsin, is the sole member of North Shore. For ease of reference, I will usually refer to the defendants collectively as North Shore (primarily in the legal analysis) but will separate them when necessary for clarity (primarily in the facts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2011, North Shore LLC owned approximately 300 acres of land in Jackson County, Wisconsin (\"the Property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Benham and Bethke both are dentists and they have shared a dental office building in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, for over 25 years. Benham and Westrate are friends and both were involved in the negotiations with Bethke for the purchase of the Property on December 20, 2012. Although McHugh was a purchaser, he did not meet Bethke until sometime in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a September 2013 email, Westrate described the members of Larchmont as\n   retired or nearly retired businessmen who each has done business in Eau Claire for more than 40 years and who have a total of more than 150 years of diverse business experience. Westrate has a masters degree in economics and was the president of an Eau Claire company that created and marketed legal education seminars. Westrate has served on the board of directors of Citizens Community Federal Bank in Eau Claire since 1993. McHugh started Choice Products USA, LLC and served as its president for almost 30 years and served as chairman of the board of directors for Citizens Community Federal Bank for decades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Benham and Westrate Search for Frac Sand Mining Sites\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around September 2011, Benham started to look for properties to buy in Eau Claire County and Jackson County as possible sites for frac sand mining.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 7, 2011, Benham met with Mel Bollom, a professional in the sand industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two had a wide-ranging discussion about the frac sand market, including how quickly a prospective buyer would need to move into the market, how quickly a buyer could expect to make profits, the total initial investment that would be required, how big a parcel of land would be required, the logistics of transporting mined sand, and the permitting required. After this meeting, Bollom told Benham in an email that \"the sand buying companies have made most of their site selections,\" that \"to be in a marketable position\" Benham would need to be \"in the marketplace within 30-60 days\" and that \"if this land is located in a non-zoned township, it is a far more desirable situation than a site controlled by county zoning (but, Jackson County is a better County to deal with than Chippewa or Eau Claire).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Benham approached his friend, David Westrate, about buying land together to develop a frac sand mine. Westrate was receptive, so in 2011 and 2012, Westrate and Benham visited potential frac sand investment properties with Bollom. By late 2011 or early 2012, Benham approached Bethke about developing the Property-and possibly other nearby properties-as a sand mine. In December 2011 and February 2012, Bollom visited Benham's and Bethke's dental offices to provide an informal presentation about the frac sand industry. Jim Geraghty, Mark Sontag, and Jeff Jones, who all were landowners who owned property near the Property, also were present. (The parties dispute what these individuals understood Bollom's intended role would be with respect to the group.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 7, 2012, Benham emailed Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources (DNR), stating that he was \"getting ready to open a sand mine in Jackson County and would like to know what are the clean air regulations and any permitting that is required.\" On March 9, 2012, the DNR responded that the limited information provided about the proposal made \"it difficult to tell\" which DNR permits would be needed, but that \"in addition to an air permit,\" the \"[t]ypical permits\" would include \"non[-]metallic mining[,] general stormwater permits, high capacity well\n   permits, potential wetlands permits and endangered and threatened species and archeological reviews. In addition the counties administer NR 135 non[-]metallic mining reclamation permits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Benham also began researching the machinery needed for sand mining. After being told on May 18, 2012 about an 80-acre plot in the Dover, Wisconsin that was \"adjacent to other tested and proven frac land\" possibly coming on the market, Benham indicated that he was \"[r]eady to move ASAP.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Bethke's Actions With Respect to Using the Property for Frac Sand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In November 2011, Bethke began learning more about sand mining and began investigating whether the Property had frac sand reserves. He provided samples of sand from the Property to Bollom for testing, and those samples looked promising. Bollom also worked with Bethke, Benham, and others to collect and analyze sand samples from the nearby properties owned by Geraghty, Sontag, and Jones. On March 10, 2012, Bethke and his then-girlfriend (now wife), Connie Brenny, joined Benham on a visit to a sand processing operation owned by Badger Mining Corporation, in Merrillan, Wisconsin, less than ten miles from the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In an email to Bollum dated March 31, 2012, Bethke stated that he was \"leaning towards selling the whole property. I enjoy treating [patients]. I know there is a lot of money to be made in a frac sand operation. But I think I would prefer to sell the 300 plus acres and let someone else run with it.\" During the summer and fall of 2012, Bethke still was considering various potential ways to sell the Property, including selling the Property by itself or potentially selling the Property in a package deal involving neighboring landowners. In late July and August 2012, Bethke considered having Robert Archibald, a frac sand industry consultant, represent him as a broker to sell the property. On July 31, 2012, a testing company notified Bethke that the samples from his land showed it to contain \"excellent sand\" and \"very good frac sand.\" On the same day, Bollom told Benham in an email that Bethke was \"giving thought to how he might arrange some type of land contract sale on a portion of [his] land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As part of Bethke's investigation into finding potential buyers, Connie Brenny emailed Badger Mining Corporation on August 8, 2012 to see if that company would be interested in seeing Bethke's positive test results for the Property. On August 14, 2012, Benham sent a fax to Badger Mining-on Bethke's behalf from the fax machine of their shared office-that included maps of the Property, the sand testing results, and the cover emails from the testing company indicating that it was \"excellent sand\" and that various tests \"all show this to be very good 'frac' sand.\" Bethke sent additional sand test results to Badger Mining in September and October 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Between September and November 2012, Bollum was showing the Property and some of the nearby properties to sand company representatives who were interested in buying sand. During these visits, Bollum did not focus on the Property because the sand companies would view it as a viable site only in conjunction with the other properties. As late as November 2012, Bethke told Bollum he was doing \"good job\" when he learned about the visits Bollum arranged with sand companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Also in the fall of 2012, Bethke discussed with a few businesses-Falls River Group, Sand Source Services, and GulfStar Group-possible transactions involving the use or sale of the Property for frac sand mining. Bethke's wife, Connie Brenny, had\n   met Houston lawyer Robert Viguet on a plane, and Viguet was involved in Bethke's discussions with GulfStar and Sand Source. In late October or November 2012, Bethke asked Bryan Frederickson of GulfStar for a contract to represent both his land and that of Geraghty, and Bethke told Westrate this. On November 5, 2012, Bethke informed Westrate and Frederickson that sand companies were continuing to look at his property and that \"lots\" of groups were interested. Bethke's discussions with Frederickson continued through late November 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Pre-Contractual Efforts To Change The Property's Zoning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on a suggestion from Bollum, Bethke investigated the process necessary to change the zoning on his property from forestry to industrial. On February 14, 2012, Bethke told Bollum that Terry Schmidt, the head of zoning for Jackson County, told him that approval for mining should take 60 days or less. On or about February 21, 2012, Bethke submitted an application with the Town of Cleveland to have the property's zoning changed from forestry to industrial extractive. However, in May 2012, the town issued a resolution opposing Bethke's zone change petition; Jackson County later relied on that decision in part to deny a zone change petition that Bethke submitted in June 2012. Bethke told Benham about Cleveland's denial of the zoning change around the time it occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In August 2012, Benham knew that one of the reasons Bethke's zone change application was denied was regarding concerns about the effect on the 40-acre parcel owned by the Zillmer Family Trust that was bounded by Bethke's property. On August 5, 2012, Benham emailed one of the Zillmers to let them know that he was interested in the 40 acres and would entertain any offer to purchase it. (The parties dispute whether Bethke told Benham that the other issues that he had with the zoning petition had been resolved.) In a September 20, 2012 email, Bethke and Brenny told Viguet that Bethke \"had already applied for permits and attended some meetings, so the permit process is in the works and should be in place soon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Larchmont's Purchase of The Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Initial Proposals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 15, 2012, Benham emailed Westrate: \"Try this scenario. Dave and Neal buy Bill's land for 4M with 1.2M down.\" Westrate responded stating that Benham had done a \"[n]ice job\" and that it \"look[ed] like Plan A so far.\" In a document titled \"SAND PLAN A 8.15.12,\" Westrate wrote: \"One problem is that the investors may balk at investing in land that is not paid for, and has $2.8 million debt against it.\" On August 18, 2012, Westrate drafted various thoughts about a frac sand mining investment and created a spreadsheet outlining \"Plan A,\" which meant buying Bethke's land for $4 million with $1.2 million down, leaving Benham and him with what he considered an \"unrealistic\" amount of $80,000 in working capital. Westrate estimated that the various legal, accounting, consulting, permitting, and regulatory costs required to start a mining operation on Bethke's property would require $800,000 in working capital. He wrote: \"It will take upwards of $2.5 million working capital or more, to cover start-up costs and paying the miner/hydrosizer while waiting to sell wet sand and actually get paid.... It looks to me like the wet sand plant is more complicated than we have been led to believe.\" Westrate also wrote: \"I'm beginning to see why Bill wants to sell outright. I'm beginning to understand that there may not be an easy, or cheap, way to do this. We may have to put in more $ $, bring in more\n   people, or borrow money, thus increasing risk to our financial futures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On September 15, 2012, Westrate drafted notes to himself, which he titled \"LATEST SAND MINE THOUGHTS,\" and expressed an interest in buying the Property via a land contract. On September 28, 2012, Westrate sent a \"Purchase Pro-Forma\" spreadsheet to Benham outlining various possibilities for buying the Property at a sale price of either $4 or $5 million. The cover email to that spreadsheet outlined a deal in which Benham, Westrate, and Bollom would form a three-member LLC to purchase the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 28, 2012, Westrate sent Benham an email in which he wrote: \"Neal, it is getting close to the end of the year, and events are overtaking us. I think it is getting time for us to buy our share of Bill [\n   <em>\n    Bethke\n   </em>\n   ]'s property rather than waiting for the royalty deal to be made ... If Bill still wants to get this done by the end of the year, let's do it.\" Benham replied via email that same day that he would talk to his investment advisors \"to make sure\" he had \"all of the right procedures\" in place to move quickly and concluded, \"I think the time is now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the fall of 2012, Westrate and Benham began discussing proposals for a sand mine on the Property. One idea proposed by Westrate was acquiring the Property through the purchase of North Shore's assets. (The parties dispute the exact nature of their conversations with each other during this time period.) Bethke retained Michael Vinopal, an attorney from Eau Claire, to prepare the title conveyances and land contracts on behalf of North Shore with respect of the sale of the Property to Larchmont. Although Vinopal did not represent Larchmont, and Larchmont did not have legal counsel in its negotiations with defendants, Richard Eaton, an attorney in Vinopal's law office, had a role in drafting various versions of an operating agreement that Westrate proposed initially for North Shore and then Larchmont.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (The parties dispute whether Bethke and his wife met with Westrate and Benham about the Property or discussed frac mining in the fall of 2012, and whether Bethke told Westrate and Benham that he was only interested in selling the Property and not in partnering with them in a frac sand mining operation.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. November 12 Draft Operating Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On November 15, 2012, Vinopal's office sent Bethke a draft North Shore operating agreement, along with comments from Westrate. The draft provided that (1) Bethke, Westrate, Westrate's IRA, and Benham's IRA would be members of the limited liability company, with Bethke owning 25%; (2) Westrate, Westrate's IRA, and Benham's IRA would pay $4 million to Bethke to purchase their shares of North Shore; (3) they would pay Bethke a down payment of $1.4 million; (4) the remaining $1.6 million in payments to Bethke would be made over a three-year period; and (5) \"[t]he members anticipate that the payments will be made from periodic royalty payments received for the removal of sand from the property,\" but \"[t]he parties acknowledge that payment in full must be completed within three years, regardless of the source of funds.\" Dkt. 77, exh. 13 at 5-7. On December 4, 2012, Bethke faxed a version of Westrate's proposed draft operating agreement and a spreadsheet of property parcels to his financial advisor, Mark Orgel, with a request to \"get back to me please.\" Orgel\n   discussed the document with Bethke from a financial planning perspective, including making recommendations relating to tax structure. None of the parties signed this draft agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Badger Mining Offer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On December 3, 2012, Mathew Hess\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Badger Mining Corporation emailed Bethke a proposal with respect to an offer on the Property and adjoining land owned by others. Attached to the email was a spreadsheet entitled \"Parcels Offers\" in which Hess listed purchase prices that Badger Mining would offer for each of the separately-owned parcels. The offer for the Property was $3,449,750. However, Hess stated in his email that \"[a]ll five offers would be contingent upon one another as we would need to secure all in order to justify development in this area.\" Dkt. 77, exh. 4 at 1. Before leaving for a hunting trip in South Dakota on December 5, 2012, Bethke showed the spreadsheet to Benham. At some point, Bethke also notified Westrate about the offer amount with respect to the Property. (The parties dispute whether Bethke shared the email explaining the contingency with Benham or Westrate.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During his drive to South Dakota on December 5, 2012, Bethke spoke to Benham and Hess several times via cell phone regarding the sale of the Property. The other passengers in the vehicle with Bethke-including Greg Bohlig and Don Bethke-heard both sides of these conversations because Bethke's phone was connected by Bluetooth to the vehicle's speaker systems. (The parties dispute what Benham said to Bethke during the phone calls on that day and on what date Bethke made his decision to sell the Property to Benham and Westrate instead of selling to Badger Mining.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Initial Ideas for a Land Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On Monday, December 10, 2012, Connie Brenny sent Vinopal her understanding of what terms should be included in the land contract, including a purchase price of $4 million, a $2.5 million down payment, three annual payments of $500,000 to cover the remaining amount, an interest rate of 1.9%, and a provision that the Property would be returned to Bethke in the event of a default. (The parties dispute whether Bethke assured Westrate, Benham, or McHugh that he would never foreclose on the land contract.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    E. December 12 and 18 Draft Operating Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On December 12, 2012, Westrate emailed Benham and Bethke a new draft \"North Shore Services, LLC Operating Agreement,\" with a cover email that stated that \"I think this embodies what it sounded like [Bethke] wants to happen, together with what we need to make it work for us.\" Dkt. 77, exh. 41. This draft agreement provided that the Property would be sold for $4 million, with a $1.5 million down payment, three installment payments of $500,000, and final balloon payment of $1 million. The proposed members of the yet-to-be-incorporated purchasing LLC were Westrate and his Roth IRA, Benham and his Roth IRA, and McHugh. Bethke was identified as the seller in the document but neither he nor North Shore Services LLC was listed in the signature block in the draft operating agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On December 13, 2012, Bethke faxed a copy of the draft to Orgel with a cover sheet that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   I'm quite frustrated with Dave W. He sent me a purchase contract with a down payment of only 1.5m not 2.5. I\n   don't know if he's playing games or just a mistake. But I'm very close to calling Badger and ending it. At 1.5 down it doesn't make sense. I'd be getting 3.5 from Badger now. At a lower tax rate and the money is working for me. If Dave wants to do this he has to decide today or I'll call Badger and be done.

The agreement includes an Exhibit A that discusses capital contributions and membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Meanwhile, on December 20, Bethke and Brenny went to Vinopal's office to sign four documents drafted by Vinopal: a\n   four-page form land contract, Exhibit A, Exhibit B, and an Addendum. Vinopal had filled out a Wisconsin State Bar form land contract pursuant to Bethke's instructions: $4 million total for the land, with $1.5 million down, and five installment payments of $500,000-beginning on May 1, 2013 and continuing on December 1 for the next four years-at an interest rate of 0.9%. The form contract contains a provision allowing the vendor (North Shore) the option to terminate the contract and recover the property through strict foreclosure with a period of redemption to be conditioned upon full payment of the outstanding balance, in the event of a default lasting for a period of 10 days after a payment's due date. The addendum to the land contract gave Bethke exclusive control of hunting rights on the property until the contact was satisfied and provided him a life estate interest in the \"cabin and out buildings on the property, the pond and the surrounding property normally associated with the use of the cabin until he is paid in full.\" Dkt. 58, exh. 1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The two exhibits attached to the form contract are titled \"Legal Descriptions for Land Contract\" and \"Additional Terms for Land Contract.\" Bethke signed the form contract and the addendum, both of which Westrate and McHugh countersigned later that day. Bethke never told Vinopal to include the unsigned December 18 draft of the Larchmont operating agreement as part of the land contract, and it was not included as an exhibit. Vinopal did not record the land contract with the register of deeds, and neither Vinopal nor Bethke has the original signed version of the land contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

First Missed Installment and May 2013 Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In January 2013, Benham, McHugh, and Westrate emailed each other about contacting investors, buyers, or brokers for the Property that they had just purchased\n   from Bethke. However, no frac mining had begun by the time the first installment payment came due under the land contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On April 21, 2013, Westrate wrote to McHugh that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   It might be useful for you to ask Bill at the proper time, how he thought we would be able to make that May 1 payment. Even if we made a deal it was a pipe dream to expect that kind of cash so soon. That payment schedule makes no sense since our preference was to give him all earnings until he was paid off. If we actually had enough earnings to pay him we would get the money either way, so what did he expect to happen if, as is now the case, we didn't have enough earnings to pay him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   That same day, Westrate emailed Vinopal, stating that he \"urgently\" needed \"a copy of the land contract.\" Vinopal's assistant responded with an email that attached an unsigned draft Larchmont Holdings operating agreement dated December 17, 2012\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; the State Bar form land contract executed on December 20, 2012; Exhibits A and B; and the addendum. The assistant wrote: \"Here is a copy of what we have. As you can see, we do not have a signed copy of the Operating Agreement pages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In late April 2013, McHugh contacted Bethke to tell him that Larchmont could not make the first payment of $500,000. Bethke agreed to enter into an amendment to the land contract whereby Larchmont would pay North Shore $100,000 on May 1 and the remaining $400,000 on September 1. At the request of Larchmont, Vinopal drafted the May 6, 2013 amendment to the land contract. The May 6 amendment does not mention future payments coming from sand mining profits and states expressly that \"Vendor's forbearance in this instance shall not be construed as a waiver of their [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] rights and remedies in the future.\" Around the time the parties signed this amendment, Larchmont paid North Shore $100,000 that had been loaned to Larchmont by Westrate and Benham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. 2013 Zoning Denials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A March 20, 2013 frac sand assessment report commissioned by Larchmont concluded that the quality of the frac sand on the property was \"quite good,\" and a June 2013 report commissioned by Larchmont concluded that the property had a considerable volume of frac sand resources. On June 11, Westrate emailed Benham and McHugh about contacting potential investors, buyers, or brokers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Around August 1, 2013, Larchmont filed the paperwork for a zoning change in the Town of Cleveland and the Town of Garfield. The Town of Cleveland Board of Supervisors voted 2-1 to oppose the zoning petition. Supervisors Andrew Sorenson and Joe Egloff, who had both been elected as new supervisors in April 2013, voted against the petition. On August 23, 2013, Westrate emailed this message to Benham and McHugh:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   I think we need to get together with Bill as soon as possible to discuss the payment situation. I would like us to point out to him the dilemma we all are in, that we can't pay him the next two payments, total $900,000, for reasons that are not under our control, including the changes in the market: the drop in prices, the increase in supply, the unwillingness of buyers to give contracts to people who are not permitted and have a processing plant, etc. And the changes in the permitting process: that the new member of the Cleveland board is\n   against fracking and everyone is telling us it is going to be tough.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   If we got a buyer tomorrow, the earliest we can reasonably expect to begin mining sand and processing it is late summer 2014, possibly later....

Second Missed Installment and December 2013 Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   When the $400,000 September 1, 2013 payment came due on the amendment to the land contract, McHugh once again contacted Bethke with the news that Larchmont would not make the payment. North Shore and Larchmont eventually agreed to another amendment to the land contract on December 31, 2013: Larchmont would pay $125,000 on December 31, 2013, then another $100,000 on July 1, 2014, and $800,000 on September 1, 2015 (and the remaining $1,530,000 would then be paid in installments over the following three years). The December 2013 amendment did not mention future payments coming from sand mining profits and states that \"[f]ailure to comply with any of these terms shall constitute default and all remedies available under the original contract may be utilized by Vendor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Larchmont made a $125,000 payment to North Shore on December 31, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Larchmont has not made any more payments to North Shore under the land contract. The amount overdue is $1,415,000 plus interest. North Shore did not foreclose on Larchmont until it filed its counterclaim for strict foreclosure in this action on February 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Post-Contractual Uses of Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Bethke's use of the property after the land contract was signed-including ATV driving and horseback riding-did not interfere with or impair Larchmont's ability to develop a frac sand mine or sell the Property. Larchmont has never been denied access to the Property since entering into the land contract. Crops planted on the Property were directly in front of the cabin to which Bethke holds a life estate. Larchmont members were aware of these uses, yet did nothing to try to stop them. Bethke harvested timber on the Property because it was required on the state's managed forest crop law program. The amount paid for the timber removed from the Property was $11,549.24. (The parties dispute whether this amount ever got credited to Larchmont.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Westrate and Benham have identified three alleged interactions between Bethke and nearby property owners-Bob Zillmer, Jerry Jenks, and Dave Holman-claiming that Bethke caused problems with neighbors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In its answer to the counterclaim, Larchmont raised the affirmative defenses of laches, unclean hands, fraud, and equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The core dispute that drives this lawsuit is the parties' conflicting views as to which payment terms actually constitute the complete and final agreement purchase agreement.

Larchmont points to extrinsic evidence that it believes shows that the parties agreed that future payments owed under the land contract would be made from profits earned from the sale of sand mined from the property. Larchmont contends that the terms of the contract are hotly disputed and prevent entry of summary judgment as to defendants' foreclosure claim and many of its own claims and affirmative defenses. Larchmont also argues that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning whether Bethke promised Bentham and Westrate that he would never foreclose on the property and whether he made misrepresentations about rezoning the property and Badger Mining's intention to buy the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   I will first address the contours of the parties' agreement in the context of North Shore's strict foreclosure counterclaim and then turn to Larchmont's affirmative defenses and contract claims, which essentially function as affirmative defenses to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

North Shore contends that this puts Larchmont in default of the land contract. Larchmont contends that it did not breach any contractual obligation by failing to make the installment payments because those payments were contingent on Larchmont's generation of profits from the sale of frac sand mined on the Property, and to date, no frac sand has been mined on the property. Larchmont argues that a jury must decide the dispute whether Larchmont's duty to make installment payments arose per the written schedules in the contract regardless whether any frac sand had been sold, or whether Larchmont's duty to pay arises only after sand has been sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Authenticity of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As an initial matter, Larchmont contends that because North Shore is unable to produce the original signed land contract, it would be inequitable to accept the copy as a true and accurate representation of the parties' agreement. Under the best evidence rule, an \"original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless [the rules] or a federal statute provides otherwise.\" Fed. R. Ev. 1002. However, \"[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a genuine question is raised about the original's authenticity.\" Fed. R. Ev. 1003. Because Larchmont is challenging the admission of the duplicate contract, it has the burden to demonstrate that a \"genuine issue of authenticity exists.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chapman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356296\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/895/#p902\">\n    804 F.3d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902 (7th Cir. 2015). Apart from a general reference to \"all of the evidence challenging North Shore's claim that Exhibit 1 [to its answer] shows the authentic Land Contract,\" Larchmont does not develop this argument. Moreover, both sides agree that the land contract includes all of the signed documents listed above and contained in Exhibit 1; the only dispute is whether the unsigned draft Larchmont operating agreement also was incorporated into the agreement. Therefore, Larchmont has failed to meet its burden of showing that a genuine issue of authenticity exists that affects the outcome of this case. The copy is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Not so fast, argues Larchmont: it contends that there is more to the story because the contract included payment terms that were outlined in two draft operating agreements and North Shore intended to make these terms part of the land contract. Larchmont continues: for some reason, these payment terms were not included in the operating agreement actually executed by the members of Larchmont on December 20, but Larchmont later passed a resolution on December 22 indicating its intent to pay the installments on the land contract out of its frac sand proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Larchmont's arguments implicate the parol evidence rule, which the Wisconsin Supreme Court has summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   When the parties to a contract embody their agreement in writing and intend the writing to be the final expression of their agreement, the terms of the writing may not be varied or contradicted by evidence of any prior written or oral agreement in the absence of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Town Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005314\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/330/340/\">\n    2010 WI 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005314\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/330/340/\">\n    330 Wis.2d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005314\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/330/340/\">\n    793 N.W.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Dairyland Equip.

In the alternative, Larchmont argues that even if the contract was integrated, there is evidence that the parties' agreement about how the installments were to be paid was excluded from the land contract because of fraud on the part of North Shore, or a mutual mistake by the parties. Larchmont does not develop any argument in its response brief concerning the \"extrinsic evidence\" that it believes supports its position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In hopes of creating a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issue of integration, Larchmont cites only the numbers of a few of its additional proposed findings of fact (nos. 51, 60, and 63) and various responses to defendants' proposed findings of fact (nos. 130, 134-35, 137, 141-46, 158-59, 163, 173-74 and 181).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pltf.'s Br. in Resp., dkt. at 10-12.

Piecing together the evidence cited by Larchmont and briefly summarized by Larchmont in the introductory section of its brief (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pltf.'s Resp. Br., dkt. 91 at 2), I understand Larchmont to be relying on the following facts to support its position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   \u2022 Westrate sent Bethke the draft operating agreements on December 12 and 18, 2012 with a cover email that stated that \"this is the deal that I understand will meet everyone's approval.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   \u2022 Bethke communicated the terms in the draft operating agreements to his financial advisor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   \u2022 Vinopal testified in his deposition that he received and was aware of the December 12 and December 18 draft documents and believed that the terms reflected \"the deal\" between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   \u2022 When Larchmont requested a copy of the land contract from Vinopal in April 2013, Vinopal's office provided it with a copy of the unsigned, December 18 draft operating agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   None of these facts, either alone or in combination, creates a plausible inference that the parties intended their land contract to include one specific payment term from the introductory paragraph of an unsigned, draft operating agreement, especially in light of the undisputed fact that Bethke never signed or affirmatively agreed to such a term. Even if a jury could reasonably infer from Westrate's email and Bethke's discussions with his financial advisor that Bethke\n   <em>\n    considered\n   </em>\n   signing on to the operating agreement at one point,\n   <em>\n    he never did so.\n   </em>\n   The December\n   2012 drafts of the operating agreement, like the signed version, did not provide Bethke with an ownership interest in the LLC and there was no signature block for Bethke or North Shore. The fact that Vinopal's office included a copy of the unsigned draft operating agreement in the documents that it forwarded as the land contract says nothing about the intent of the parties themselves and does not mean that the unsigned draft operating agreement somehow became part of the land contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In addition, Vinopal's testimony is inconclusive and not helpful to Larchmont's position. Vinopal was questioned about the introductory language in the December 18, 2012 draft operating agreement concerning payments being made from frac sand profits. In response, he stated that he did not remember talking about that provision with Bethke specifically, but \"it was that they would hopefully be able to do that, to make that work, so they wouldn't have to put any of their, you know, outside money in\" and \"I mean, I think it was-that was the deal.\" Dkt. 65 at 55-56. When asked whether those were terms that he was going to put into the land contract, Vinopal stated that \"Well, sure. Yeah. Something that would be acceptable to them, yeah. But I think if this-if this was the deal, it seems like that was the intent. I mean, that's what the cover letter says.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56. However, Vinopal clarified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   [W]e don't draft a document and expect that that's the final draft. I mean, it's always, you know, 'Here it is, you know, what do you think, do you want any changes made.' So I don't know what happened in this case. But, you know, we would have tried to do it to the best of everybody's satisfaction to get the terms in there that people felt were relevant and certainly instruct them to look at it carefully and make sure they have what they want or they want something or want something out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   I can only tell you what the final version looks like, you know. I-I don't know. I would assume maybe there was a draft. I mean, we haven't seen it, so I don't know if there was a draft that had their terms in it. But it seems like when it came down to the point where, We're going to sign it, that what was in there, what everybody was available to look at, was agreeable to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-84.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   At most, Vinopal's testimony shows that some of the parties-and it is unclear who from the evidence adduced by Larchmont-may have contemplated including a provision concerning payments on the land contract being made from frac sand profits at some point. In the end, however, there was no such provision included in either the signed land contract or Larchmont's operating agreement, and neither of the signed agreements incorporates the unsigned, draft operating agreements. Pointing in the other direction, Larchmont's draft operating agreement references and incorporates the land contract, which indicates that the land contract is a discrete agreement that is distinct from the unsigned draft operating agreement. The members of Larchmont later passed a resolution stating that they would make every effort to pay the land contract installments out of frac sand profits, but that action was separate from and subsequent to the execution of the land contract itself. In no way can it or does it bind Bethke or North Shore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As North Shore points out, Larchmont's argument that installment payments were contingent on the generation of profits is undercut by other language immediately following the discussion of profits in the introductory paragraph of the draft operating agreement: \"in the event that the Company is unable, in spite of its best\n   efforts, to profitably market the frac sand on the land and the installment sales payments are not made, the Seller's recourse it to foreclose on the Company.\" Therefore, even if the members of Larchmont hoped that their frac sand profits would cover the installment payments, they recognized that this might not happen and their installment payments still would be due. Larchmont fails to explain its contention that the land contract includes only the draft operating agreement's reference to installment payments being made from the profits of the sand mine and not the remainder of the paragraph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Bank &amp; Trust v. Firstar Info. Servs., Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452102\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/317/#p322\">\n    276 F.3d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (7th Cir. 2001) (\"Words and phrases cannot be considered in isolation; rather, the court must consider the contract as a whole to provide each provision with the meaning intended by the parties.\");\n   <em>\n    Campion v.

App. 1992) (a contract must be construed as a whole). Concluding that Larchmont had no obligation to make any payments on the land contract until it turned a profit defies reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In sum, the only reasonable inference from the evidence of record is that the land contract and its exhibits, addendum and amendments governs the sale of the property and the operating agreement governs Larchmont and its members. Larchmont's vague references to the circulation of draft agreements with a particular payment provision relating to frac sand profits are insufficient by themselves to show that the provision was actually part of the land contract or that it was excluded as a result of fraud or mistake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Larchmont's Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Larchmont does not dispute the fact that it failed to make installment payments under the contract, which provides the remedy of strict foreclosure. Larchmont, however, alleges the affirmative defenses of laches, unclean hands, fraud, and equitable estoppel in its answer to defendants' amended counterclaim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 59 at 17-18, and it raises these defenses in its response to North Shore's motion for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   dkt. 91 at 12-18. North Shore discusses Larchmont's allegations of fraud as a basis for rescission in conjunction with their arguments concerning Larchmont's affirmative claims of fraudulent inducement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   North Shore, however, did not address the issues of laches, equitable estoppel, or unclean hands in their opening brief and North Shore only briefly mentions the weakness of these particular affirmative defenses in a footnote in its reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   dkt. 79 at 21 n. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Seventh Circuit repeatedly has held that arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived.\n   <em>\n    Mendez v.

Because North Shore did not move for summary judgment with respect to Larchmont's affirmative defenses, it has failed to show that it is entitled to strict foreclosure as a matter of law and its motion for summary judgment on that counterclaim will be denied. To hold otherwise would be to blind side Larchmont.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   This might turn out to be a bootless victory for Larchmont: based on the court's rulings earlier in this order, Larchmont may not base any of these defenses on its contentions that the land contract included the term that installment payments were to be made from frac sand profits, or that North Shore had acquiesced to this payment plan in some other way. The court has rejected these contentions, so they are out of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Further, Larchmont has failed to oppose North Shore's argument with respect to the remaining question-whether the economic loss doctrine bars Larchmont's tort claims against both defendants for compensatory and punitive damages-and merely relies on its unsuccessful argument that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the terms and scope of the land contract. Therefore, I am granting North Shore's motion for summary judgment as to Larchmont's fraudulent inducement claims seeking damages in tort on the ground that these claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine.

In support of this contention, North Shore points to the following undisputed facts: Larchmont knew that the property contained good quality sand from testing that it had commissioned in March and June of 2013; Larchmont's own application for rezoning the property for a frac mine was denied in August 2013, before it signed the December 2013 amendment to the land contract; and any beliefs that Larchmont had about North Shore not foreclosing or being willing to forego payments until a mine was operating were dispelled by the contract amendments that provided for foreclosure but did not provide that payments would come from frac sand profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   As it has done in its response to most of North Shore's arguments, Larchmont states generally that summary judgment is not appropriate because there are genuine issues of material fact affecting the question of waiver. However, Larchmont\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   addressed North Shore's argument with respect to two of the misrepresentations it has alleged: that payments would be made from frac sand profits and that North Shore would not foreclose on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   In a brief argument, Larchmont contends that even though the 2013 amendments adjusted the payment schedule of the contract, they did not change the parties' \"basic understanding\" that payments would be made from the profits of the sale of frac sand. However, as discussed at length above, Larchmont has failed to adduce sufficient evidence showing that North Shore had such an understanding or that the land contract included this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   This leaves the alleged misrepresentation that Bethke continued to promise not to foreclose on the property even though the contract and the amendments all contained a foreclosure provision. Larchmont correctly points out that the parties dispute whether Bethke made such representations both before and after they signed the land contract and 2013 amendments, and that North Shore in fact did not bring a foreclosure action until 2017. Because I agree that the facts are not clear on this one issue, I find that Larchmont has not waived its claim for rescission with respect to the alleged misrepresentation that North Shore would never foreclose on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Because Larchmont fails to address the issues of waiver and affirmance as they relate to any other alleged misrepresentation, including those concerning the quality of the frac sand, the property's suitability for a frac sand mine, and zoning and permitting, Larchmont has forfeited all such arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In any event, the courts in the cases cited by Larchmont agree that the dispositive question on summary judgment is whether one can conclude from \"all of the surrounding circumstances\" that there is a material factual dispute as to the reasonableness of Larchmont's reliance on Bethke's alleged misrepresentation that North Shore would not exercise its foreclosure right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of Sun Prairie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668332\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/155/724/#p732\">\n    155 Wis.2d at 732-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8668332\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wis-2d/155/724/#p732\">\n    456 N.W.2d 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (all facts and circumstances, \"including the intelligence and experience of the misled individual and the relationship between the parties,\" must be considered);\n   <em>\n    Am.

The only logical and reasonable response to oral representations that contradicted written provisions of the contract would have been to insist that the written contract reflect the oral representation. Larchmont could have-should have-demanded removal of the foreclosure provision or inclusion of an condition further specifying and limiting the conditions under which foreclosure could take place. Larchmont did neither. To the contrary, Larchmont passed an internal resolution after signing the land contract recognizing the fact that North Shore had the right to foreclose. Although Larchmont chose not to hire an attorney to review the contract before signing it, the facts show that its members are educated, experienced businessmen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As with North Shore's challenges to its fraudulent inducement claims, Larchmont's sole response is that the validity of its claims cannot be made on summary judgment because the parties dispute the terms and scope of the land contract. Larchmont makes the same vague argument with respect to its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, stating only that the claims \"directly arise from the Land Contract. Here, what the contract consists of is in dispute.\" Dkt. 91 at 46. Larchmont has abandoned all of these claims by failing to develop any argument about why the claims should survive in the event that the court determines that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the terms of the land contract. Accordingly, North Shore's motion for summary judgment as to Larchmont's claims for frustration of purpose, unjust enrichment, reformation, illusory contract, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   This order speaks for itself, so there is no need for any wind-up observations by the court.
