They bring this putative wage and hour class action against their former employer, franchisee New Boston Pie, Inc., and its owner-operator Charbel Rizkallah. Before the court is plaintiffs' motion for class certification (Docket # 19). For the following reasons, plaintiffs' motion is ALLOWED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p><p id=\"p-10\"><strong>I. Factual Background</strong></p><p id=\"p-11\">Between 2013 and 2016, plaintiffs received an hourly wage of $4.00-$5.00 plus tips, known as a \"tipped minimum wage.\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Compl. \u00b6 15, Docket #19, at 5 (Mot. for Class Cert.). Defendants imposed on customers a delivery charge of about $3.00, Compl. \u00b6 17, of which they paid drivers a flat amount ($1.25 as of May 2017) for gas mileage and retained the remainder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Docket # 19-4, at 33:11-34:21 (Rizkallah Deposition). Plaintiffs regularly worked more than 40 hours per week but did not receive overtime compensation. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.</p><p id=\"p-13\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"522\" href=\"#p522\" id=\"p522\">*522</a><em>Mooney v. Domino's Pizza, Inc.</em>, No. 14-13723, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204576996\">2016 WL 4576996</extracted-citation> (D. Mass. Sept. 1, 2016). In the instant action, plaintiffs allege three violations of the wage laws. First, they claim that defendants failed to pay overtime wages, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201</extracted-citation> <em>et seq.</em> , and the Massachusetts Wage Act, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20149%2C%20%C2%A7%20148\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 148</extracted-citation>. They next contend that defendants' practice of charging customers for delivery without remitting that entire charge to drivers constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts Tips Law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 152A. Finally, plaintiffs allege violations of state and federal minimum wage requirements because</p><p id=\"p-14\">defendants paid them tipped minimum wages even for non-tipped \"inside work\" such as folding pizza boxes in the store; failed to provide written notice of the Tips Law; and unlawfully retained some of the drivers' tips in the form of delivery charges, all in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 152A and its implementing regulations at 454 CMR \u00a7 27.03(2), and the FLSA.</p><p id=\"p-15\">The delivery charge and inside work claims have received thorough treatment in a recent decision of this court certifying a nearly identical class.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See</em> <em>Mooney</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204576996\">2016 WL 4576996</extracted-citation>. I fully adopt Judge Talwani's analysis and conclusions in that case and ALLOW plaintiff's motion to certify the driver class. Therefore, I examine here only the new claim for overtime wages.</p><p id=\"p-17\">It is undisputed that plaintiffs, as restaurant workers, are exempt from the state overtime law. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, \u00a7 1A(14) (defining the state overtime law and stating that \"[t]his section shall not be applicable to any employee who is employed ... as a restaurant worker\"). They nonetheless bring a state claim for overtime wages, but under the state Wage Act, which provides, <em>inter alia</em> , that:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">Every person having employees in his service shall pay weekly or bi-weekly each such employee the <em>wages earned</em> by him to within six days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned if employed for five or six days in a calendar week, or to within seven days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned if such employee is employed seven days in a calendar week ...</p><p id=\"p-19\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149 \u00a7 148 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs contend that defendants have violated this provision by failing to timely remit all \"wages earned,\" inclusive of payments required under <em>federal</em> overtime law, <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-20\">They rely for this proposition on another recent case of this court, <em>Carroca v. All Star Enterprises and Collision Center, Inc.</em>, No. 12-11202, <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203496537\">2013 WL 3496537</extracted-citation> (D. Mass. Jul. 10, 2013). In that case, the court allowed the individual plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on two counts of overtime violations. <em>Id.</em> at *2-3. The plaintiff, an auto body repairman, was, like the instant plaintiffs, exempt from state overtime protections. <em>See</em> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151A, \u00a7 1A(15). To vindicate his rights to federal overtime, he brought claims under both the FLSA and the Massachusetts Wage Act. Concluding that defendants had violated federal law, the court further reasoned that the \"garageman\" exemption</p><p id=\"p-21\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"523\" href=\"#p523\" id=\"p523\">*523</a>is not relevant where the plaintiffs are <em>not</em> alleging a violation of the <em>state</em> overtime wage law, Mass. Gen. L. c. 151 \u00a7 1A, but instead allege a violation under Mass. Gen. L. c. 149 \u00a7 148 [the Wage Act] governing the timing of wage payments of payments due here under <em>federal</em> overtime law. Accordingly, the Defendants are liable under Mass. Gen. L. c. 149 \u00a7 148, where they did not pay all of 'the wages earned by him' within the statutory pay period.</p><p id=\"p-22\"><em>Id.</em> at *3 (emphasis in original). Holding that plaintiff could recover under either the FLSA or Wage Act but not both, the court permitted recovery pursuant to the state statute's more generous provision of treble damages. <em>Id.</em> at *4.</p><p id=\"p-23\">I am not persuaded that the same logic extends to the class action context. It is well settled that federal overtime claims must be brought as collective actions under <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216</extracted-citation>(b) rather than as class actions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. <em>See</em> <em>Pike v. New Generation Donuts, LLC</em>, No. 12-12226, <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20707361\">2016 WL 707361</extracted-citation> at *1, n.1 (D. Mass.

Dec. 11, 2015). <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216</extracted-citation>(b) (\"No employee shall be a party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.\").

And this is not the case in which plaintiffs with independently valid state and federal claims seek class certification of both together. <em>See</em> <em>Trezvant v. Fid. Employer Servs. Corp.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3169859\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/434/40/#p57\">434 F.Supp.2d 40</extracted-citation>, 57-58 (D. Mass. 2006) (collecting cases granting Rule 23 class certification to state wage violations not contingent on FLSA violations, where plaintiffs also alleged FLSA violations). Instead, plaintiffs first cite federal overtime protections as a basis for state Wage Act recovery, but later disclaim the federal scheme governing those protections when it carries less advantageous procedural requirements. Thus, although plaintiffs assert a state law claim, what is at bottom an action to recover federally mandated overtime wages cannot circumvent the opt-in collective action procedures set forth in Section 216.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3169859\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/434/40/#p57\">id.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-25\">For the reasons set forth above and in the <em>Mooney</em> decision, Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (Docket # 19) is ALLOWED as to the \"Driver Class\" on the inside work and delivery charge claims (Counts I and II), and DENIED as to the \"Overtime Class\" (Count V).
