The Act provides specific procedures for adjusting grants to Head Start programs that suffer from chronic under-enrollment, as Navajo Head Start does. Grantees must self-report enrollment each month, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9836a(h)(2), and HHS must conduct a semiannual review to determine which grantees have been under-enrolled for four consecutive months,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209835\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9836a(h)(3).

Although HHS stated in early September that the Grant would not change for fiscal year 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19, the agency changed course a few weeks later. By letter on September 26, 2017, HHS informed the Nation that HHS had decided to reduce the Grant to $15,766,194 for fiscal year 2018, based on an enrollment level of 1,396 students in Navajo Head Start, not the previously funded enrollment of 2,068 Head Start students. Decl. Ex. E, Dkt. 11-2 at 14-15.

The motion was accompanied by an affidavit by the Acting Assistant Superintendent of Navajo Head Start,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 3-1, and the motion requested a decision before March 1, 2018, when fiscal year 2018 begins.

According to an affidavit submitted by the Acting Assistant Superintendent for Navajo Head Start, the funding adjustment would cause 672 children and families to lose access to Head Start services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Aff. \u00b6 3. The affidavit also states that the Nation will have to lay off at least 147 employees and reduce the hours of 40 other employees, which would \"necessitate the closure of a minimum of 34 Head Start facilities.\" Aff. \u00b6 3. According to the Assistant Superintendent's supplemental affidavit, these changes could begin on March 1, 2018: if the funding adjustment occurs on that date, she will begin identifying personnel to be laid off and facilities to be closed, and she \"anticipate[s] that layoffs would begin within a couple of weeks thereafter.\" Supp. Aff. of Dr. Elivra Bitsoi (\"Supp. Aff.\") \u00b6 5, Dkt. 12-1 at 2. Based on these assertions, the Navajo Nation argues that the \"Nation and the children currently served by the Navajo Head Start program will suffer irreparable harm starting on March 1, 2018 if HHS is allowed to reduce the Grant without affording the Nation the appeal rights to which it is entitled.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court disagrees. First, it appears unlikely that 672 students will lose access to Head Start services due to the HHS decision. The Navajo Nation puts forth 672 as the number of children who will lose access, which is the difference between the number of students for whom Head Start enrollment was previously funded by HHS (2,068) and the Head Start enrollment level on which HHS based its funding decision for fiscal year 2018 (1,396).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 20; Pl.'s Mem. at 6. HHS reduced the funded enrollment level by 672 because that number \"represent[s] the average number of vacant slots over a 12 month period\" during which HHS and the Nation sought to remediate under-enrollment. Decl. \u00b6 14. Indeed, according to Navajo Nation's self-reported enrollment figures, Head Start enrollment has never exceeded 1,577 in any month since March 2015. Decl. Ex. A, Dkt. 11-2 at 1. And during the months in which HHS decided to adjust funding for fiscal year 2018, reported enrollment was less than the enrollment that HHS ultimately funded: the Navajo Nation reported 1,187 Head Start students in September 2017, 1,280 in October 2017, 1,304 in November 2017, and 1,394 in December 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, funded enrollment appears consistent with reported enrollment, and it seems unlikely that there are 672 additional, actual students who would enroll but for HHS's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, although the Navajo Nation asserts that it will have to layoff employees and close facilities in the absence of preliminary relief, it is not clear that these alleged harms are sufficiently great, certain, or imminent to warrant injunctive relief. The Nation states that, if a loss of funding occurs on March 1, 2018, it will begin identifying personnel to be laid off and facilities that must be closed, and it \"anticipates that layoffs would begin within a couple weeks thereafter.\" Reply. at 7, Dkt. 12; Supp. Aff. \u00b6 5. These alleged harms, therefore, will not arise immediately on March 1 and they can be mitigated by resolving this case on the merits according to an expedited litigation schedule, which the government suggests and which the Court intends to set.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Notice, Dkt. 9 at 2; Def.'s Opp. at 1 n.1, Dkt. 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order, Dkt. 13.

The Nation regularly fails to spend millions of dollars of its Head Start funds in a budget year. Decl. \u00b6 6.

Ex. A, Dkt 11-2 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, even without preliminary relief, HHS will award the Nation $15.8 million for fiscal year 2018. Decl. \u00b6 29. The Nation replies that its 2018 grant application \"was denied in its entirety,\" so in fact \"the Navajo Nation has no approved Head Start funding whatsoever for Fiscal Year 2018.\" Supp. Aff. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 6. The Navajo Nation may have contributed to this issue by maintaining its request for $23.1 million in its application of January 12, 2018,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 2, despite extensive notice over the previous months that the Nation's enrollment did not justify that amount,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. Exs. E, F, I, J, &amp; K. Regardless, the Navajo Nation is incorrect because HHS clearly represents that $15.8 million will be awarded: \"On March 1, 2018, [HHS] plans to award the Navajo Nation $15,766,194. That entire amount will be available at that time for the Navajo Nation to spend on appropriate Head Start expenditures, subject to grant conditions.\" Decl. \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition to that sum, HHS has committed to restoring $2 million if the Navajo Nation meets certain conditions, the most stringent of which appear to be (1) maintaining enrollment levels of 1,396 Head Start students and (2) creating a wait list of children eligible to fill the approximately 180 to 200 additional seats funded by the restored funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. \u00b6 27; Decl. Ex. M, Dkt. 11-2 at 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, the Navajo Nation can request to carryover its unobligated Head Start funds from fiscal years 2016 and 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.309\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; HHS Grants Policy Statement at II-51 &amp; App. B-2 (Jan. 1, 2007). For fiscal year 2016, the Navajo Nation had approximately $6.3 million in unobligated Head Start funds. Of that amount, the Nation asserts that $5.1 million is unavailable for personnel expenses because HHS has approved its use for projects involving physical infrastructure for the Head Start program. Reply at 7; Supp. Aff. \u00b6 11; Supp. Aff. Exs. B &amp; C, Dkt. 12-1 at 11-20. Even so, that leaves at least $1.2 million that the Nation can carryover from fiscal year 2016. HHS \"is still waiting for information from the Navajo Nation to process the carryover of these funds, but once the Navajo Nation provides that information those carryover funds would be available to provide Head Start services.\" Decl. \u00b6 6.
