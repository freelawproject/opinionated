FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Boshra Alsaidi was born in the United States in 1977. (Compl. \u00b6 7.) At the time, her father was serving as Second Secretary of the Permanent Mission of the Yemen Arab Republic to the United Nations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Mot. Ex. A, ECF No. 12-1.) Alsaidi applied for and was first issued a U.S. passport on March 25, 2003. (Mot. Ex. B at 1, ECF No. 12-2.) She applied to renew her passport on January 4, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Ex. A.) The National Passport Center denied her passport renewal application on February 23, 2013, stating that because Alsaidi was born while her father held a position that granted him and his immediate family diplomatic immunity and privileges, Alsaidi was \"not born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\" and therefore could not \"benefit from the Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship provision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Mot.

The complaint contains two counts, each seeking the same remedy-an order requiring the State Department to renew plaintiff's passport and award attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 6, 7.) She brings both claims under the APA and the Mandamus Act (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4), arguing that the State Department and National Passport Center denied her passport renewal application on the inaccurate basis that she was not a citizen and pursuant to an informal policy of discrimination based on religion or national origin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 16, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first count alleges that the State Department adheres to a discriminatory \"double standard,\" which provides evidence of \"arbitrary and capricious conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Specifically, the complaint alleges that \"[a]fter 9/11 all U.S. federal agencies were instructed to be very careful when it came to renewing VISAS or passports or any other immigration documents pertaining to individuals like the Plaintiff who had lived in Yemen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, \"[t]his special instruction was particularly directed at individuals who came from countries that were largely Muslim\" and that \"is the identical conduct that President Trump is engaging in today.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, although the complaint makes no independent claim of discrimination, Alsaidi's legal theory is that, based on the instructions of \"unknown higher ups located in Washington D.C.,\" passport center employees \"searched the records of the Plaintiff to see if they could find a basis to reject her passport renewal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The complaint alleges that \"[t]hey seized on ...

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-4.) The second count alleges that \"the State Department procedures and policies prohibited State Department officials from engaging in any discriminatory conduct,\" that the passport center employees nevertheless engaged in an \"unlawful discriminatory practice,\" and that this was because they were \"directed that whenever a Muslim applicant presented a request to have a passport renewed or a request from an individual with ties to a predominately Muslim country, that they had to deny those requests, whether there was a good faith basis to do so or otherwise.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.3\">\n    \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The complaint then realleges that the State Department has an informal policy \"much like all federal agencies post 9/11 ... to prevent any Muslim from entering America,\" and that, as a result, State Department employees \"were directed to find some reason for denying Plaintiff's application to have her passport renewed, whether justified or not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although Alsaidi's complaint includes two counts, the factual underpinnings are exactly the same, the legal theories are the same, and the relief sought is identical, that is, an order requiring that defendants renew her passport. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-18.) Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, arguing that because plaintiff has an adequate alternative remedy available under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , she cannot bring her claims under the APA and the Mandamus Act.
