BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between 2009 and 2015, CN Capital raised money by selling unregistered three-year and five-year promissory notes to investors. ( [1] \u00b6 17). CN Capital allegedly promised investors a 9% to 11% fixed rate of return and claimed the promissory notes were \"100% asset backed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). CN Capital represented that it used the money it raised, in part, to purchase life insurance policies, which supposedly resulted in a profit whenever an insured's death benefit on the policy was greater than the total of the purchase price and premiums paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18). CN Capital also represented that the insurance policies involved life expectancies of three to four years and that it expected to receive a fifteen percent annual return on its portfolio of life insurance settlements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). CN Capital sold fractional interests in the policies to investors through its affiliate, Credit Nation Acceptance, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Plaintiff, CN Capital, however, was never profitable- \"[i]nstead, it was insolvent from [its] inception.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). CN Capital made a number of false representations to its investors, and failed to inform its investors that that the promissory notes they purchased were in fact unsecured and unsafe investments, that the insurance policies involved life expectancies\n   far longer than three to four years, that CN Capital was losing millions of dollars each year, and that the securities they were investing in should have been, but were not, registered with the SEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 27-28). Plaintiff states that \"[f]rom its inception, CN Capital was a Ponzi scheme,\" in which \"[i]nvestors could only receive 'returns' on their investments so long as new investment money could be brought in to pay interest payments to prior noteholders and pay insurance premiums.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). Plaintiff states that the \"vast majority of investors\"-most of which were \"elderly people on fixed incomes who have been defrauded out of their life savings\"-have lost millions of dollars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). Defendants-also investors-allegedly invested their money in the promissory notes and life insurance policies, but, unlike the others, received back the full amounts of their investments plus additional payments denominated as interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). Defendants thus allegedly profited by receiving money paid in by other investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 10, 2015, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief and damages against James A. Torchia (\"Torchia\") and the Receivership Companies. The case is currently pending in the Northern District of Georgia as Civil Action No. 1:15-cv-3904-WSD. The SEC alleges that Torchia directed, and the Receivership Companies participated in, fraudulent investment schemes such as the ones described above relating to CN Capital. On April 25, 2016, the Court entered an order granting a preliminary injunction freezing the assets of Torchia and the Receivership Companies and appointing the Receiver. (No. 1:15-cv-3904-WSD [66] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed his Complaint [1] in this action on behalf of the Receivership alleging that certain interest paid to Defendants on the investments they purchased from CN Capital constituted fraudulent transfers, unjust enrichment, and money had and received. Plaintiff is seeking to recover those interest payments and, with respect to Defendant Duscio only, a viatical insurance policy that, at the time the Complaint was filed, had not yet matured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). Plaintiff contends that, \"[i]n total, Duscio transferred $1.7 million to Synergy Motor Company and Credit Nation Auto Sales, and Torchia caused CN Capital to pay Duscio $2,051,365.62, which is $351,365.62 more than Duscio's investment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). Plaintiff alleges Jones \"invested $50,000 and received back $64,250, which is $14,250 more than he invested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53). Plaintiff further alleges \"Luck invested $75,639.32 and received back $99,110.34, which is $23,471.02 more than he invested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). Finally, Plaintiff contends that \"in total, Padon invested $70,000 and received back $89,950, which is $19,950 more than he invested.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 29, 2017, the Court granted Plaintiff Al B. Hill's and Defendant Joyce Wisdom's Joint Motion to Dismiss Claims Against Defendant Wisdom [30] and dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Wisdom with prejudice. ( [31] ). On April 14, 2017, the Court granted Defendants Beverly Leverton's and Lynn Leverton's and Plaintiff Al B. Hill's Joint Motion to Dismiss Claims Against the Leverton Defendants [33] and dismissed the claims against the Leverton's with prejudice. ( [37] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 12, 2017, Duscio filed his Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Duscio asserts that\n   (1) Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ; (2) the claims of fraud are not stated with particularity as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) ; (3) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction; and (4) Plaintiff lacks standing. Duscio specifically contends that the Complaint fails to specify the fraudulent transfers statute under which Plaintiff seeks to hold Duscio liable and otherwise fails to sufficiently plead the required elements to allege that Duscio transfers that were fraudulent. ( [34] at 5). Duscio also argues that Plaintiff has failed to plead unjust enrichment because an express contract exists between CN Capital and Duscio for the investments, and \"Georgia courts have consistently rejected claims for unjust enrichment where, as here, there is an enforceable contract that governs the rights and obligations of the parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Duscio employs the same reasoning to support why he argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for money had and received. He asserts: \"Like the unjust enrichment claim, the money had and received claim should be dismissed based on the existence of Duscio's contracts with Receivership [Companies] as the theory of money had and received 'applies only when there is no actual legal contract.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). On April 26, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Brief in Opposition to Defendant Duscio's Motion to Dismiss [38] (\"Response\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 10, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Default Judgment against Jones, Luck, and Padon. Plaintiff contends that \"[d]espite due and proper service, [Jones, Luck, and Padon] have failed to plead, defend, or otherwise respond to the Summons and Complaint served on them within the time prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, i.e., Neal Jones, by January 31, 2017; Terry Luck, by February 1, 2017; and Walter Padon, by January 30, 2017.\" ( [39.3] at 2). Plaintiff further alleges that, \"[b]y failing to plead or otherwise respond, the [d]efaulting Defendants have admitted each paragraph of Plaintiff's Complaint, specifically including those paragraphs and statements concerning the fraudulent transfers directed to the [d]efaulting Defendants in furtherance of the Ponzi scheme while CN[Capital] was insolvent, and also including their liability for unjust enrichment and money had and received. Additionally, the Defaulting Defendants admit those paragraphs setting forth the amounts claimed by Plaintiff, including interest.\" ( [39.3] at 4) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

( [34] at 5). The Complaint states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, the Georgia Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, and the fraudulent transfer laws of the states of residence of the defendants, the defendants are liable to CN Capital for the fraudulent transfers of funds that they received in excess of their principal investments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ( [1] \u00b6 83). This is the only instance in the Complaint in which Plaintiff discusses the statutory basis for his fraudulent transfer claim against Defendants. The Court finds that, while this statement lacks a certain degree of specificity, it is sufficient to allege that Plaintiff is asserting, at the very least, a claim against Duscio under the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"GUFTA\") and the Georgia Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (\"GUVTA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   GUVTA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (A) Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (B) Intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he or she would incur, debts beyond his or her ability to pay as they became due.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74(a). Under GUVTA, a \"creditor\" is a \"person who has a claim, regardless of when the person acquired the claim, together with any successors or assigns.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-71(4). A \"debtor\" is \"a person who is liable on a claim.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-71(6).

( [1] \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21-29, 30, 34-44). The Complaint further alleges that Duscio entered into a debtor-creditor relationship when he transacted business with CN Capital, that the money Duscio received came from other investors through the fraudulent sale of unregistered securities, and that Duscio received these payments while CN Capital was insolvent due to the control exerted by Torchia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 75-77).

Plaintiff asserts in the Complaint that Torchia caused CN Capital to transfer to Duscio, for no consideration, a policy issued by American General on the life of Cecil Lovell in the face amount of $1.2 million.

Plaintiff contends that he could not, as the claimant, have discovered the transfer until after his appointment on April 25, 2016. Considering that \"questions concerning a plaintiff's diligence in discovering an alleged fraud are generally questions for a trier of fact\" and that the record does not establish, as a matter of law, that the alleged fraudulent transfers dating back to 2008 are time barred, the Court does not grant Duscio's motion to dismiss on this ground.\n    <em>\n     RES-GA YPL\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462305\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/340/713/#p717\">\n     340 Ga.App. at 721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462305\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/340/713/#p717\">\n     798 S.E.2d 315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Complaint states that no promissory note was issued in connection with either of Duscio's investments.
