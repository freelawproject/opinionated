In 2013, he submitted a claim for $100,000 under an insurance program for members of the military who have suffered traumatic injuries, Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Traumatic Injury Protection (\"TSGLI\"). The Air Force denied Hensley's claim, concluding that Hensley had not shown that his injury qualified him for TSGLI benefits. Hensley sought review before the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (the \"AFBCMR\" or \"Board\"), which declined to grant his application. Hensley then brought this lawsuit against the United States (the \"Government\"), asserting that the AFBCMR's decision should be reversed on the ground that it was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hensley and the Government have cross-moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9 (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"); ECF No. 13 (\"Def.'s Cross-Mot.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 15 (\"Pl.'s Reply\"); ECF No. 17 (\"Def.'s Reply\").

Hensley's Injury and Medical Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 20, 2008, Hensley slipped on an icy ladder while inspecting an aircraft and fell head-first approximately 15 feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR 2 [2], 80 [49], 553 [80], 659 [87], 778 [92]. Hensley's most serious injuries were to his left shoulder: he suffered a fractured humerus, a torn labrum, and possible ligament damage. AR 2 [2], 80 [49], 778 [92]. He received prompt medical attention at a local hospital, where he was given a sling and advised to consult an orthopedist. AR 2 [2], 70 [42], 82 [51], AR 553 [80]. At that time, he was ordered to remain off work for a week and to do no lifting with his left arm. AR 82 [51]. On February 25, 2008, he saw the orthopedist, who provided him with a shoulder immobilizer, prescribed him painkillers, and concluded that he would likely have to remain off work for three months. AR 553-54 [80-81]. In March, Hensley began physical therapy three times per week. AR 545 [82]. It appears that Hensley ultimately returned to work on April 21, 2008, but only on \"light duty\" (with limitations on activities such as lifting and overhead work) as recommended by his orthopedist. AR 75 [44], 83 [52], 540 [78], 659 [87].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hensley's medical and physical-therapy records show that he continued to suffer pain and a limited range of motion in his left shoulder over the next six months. For example, on May 19, Hensley's therapist reported that his shoulder \"is still very weak &amp; pain in all planes of motion.\" AR 492 [74]. The next day, the orthopedist reported that Hensley's left shoulder \"show[ed] much better range of motion,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   and that Hensley was \"[s]till having pain, but overall doing okay.\" AR 83 [52]. On June 30, Hensley's therapist noted that he had \"numbness\" in his left hand. AR 498 [76]. Hensley also reported \"pain and weakness w/ overhead activities\" and \"difficulty w/ gripping items.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On August 19, Hensley said that \"numbness &amp; tingling in arm &amp; shoulder bother him,\" that he had pain when reaching overhead, and that he was \"unable to grip onto things.\" AR 76 [45]. Nonetheless, his orthopedist ordered him discharged from physical therapy at that point.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The records contain a few explicit references to Hensley's ability to perform ADLs. A note from his physical therapist, dated April 9, 2008, stated that he was \"still limited at home w/ self care and home care ADLs.\" AR 495 [75]. On November 18, 2008, Hensley underwent a \"functional capacity evaluation\" with a physical therapist at the request of his orthopedist, who wanted to determine whether Hensley could be released from light duty. AR 68 [40], 468 [56]. Hensley reported that he continued to avoid using his left arm due to pain. AR 476 [64]. In a written questionnaire, he checked \"no\" when asked if he needed \"regular assistance with dressing.\" AR 377 [55]. He added, \"well I use slip on shoes so I don't need help, but it is tuff to do my work boots.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The official report of the evaluation, dated December 11, 2008, recorded further comments from Hensley on dressing and bathing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I have some difficulty but I can do it. Getting in and out of the deep whirlpool tub which I use every day because it makes the pain better (no grab bars), getting work boots on because I have to tie them and tuck the strings in (up to mid-calf). My son will often help me get them off at the end of the day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   AR 472 [60]. Hensley also reported that he could not yet do many household chores such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The therapist recommended that Hensley remain on light duty due to his poor balance when using a ladder and his inability to reach overhead. AR 471 [59].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Hensley continued to experience pain after November 2008. In June 2009, he had surgery to repair the torn labrum in his shoulder. AR 764 [91].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In April 2013, Hensley applied for $100,000 in TSGLI benefits, claiming that his shoulder injury had left him unable to dress and bathe himself without assistance for at least 120 days, from February 20, 2008, to August 20, 2008. AR 2 [2], 37-39 [21-23]. His application included a signed certification of his claim by a physician, Dr. Hopkins. AR 32-39 [16-23]. Dr. Hopkins indicated that he had not personally observed Hensley's injuries, but had instead reached his conclusions based on a review of Hensley's medical records. AR 39 [23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On June 27, 2013, the insurance company that administers the TSGLI program notified Hensley by letter that his claim had been denied. AR 41 [24]. The letter explained that \"the medical documentation provided does not indicate that your loss met the standards for TSGLI,\" and that \"a claimant must have been unable to independently perform at least two activities of daily living (ADLs) for a period of 30 consecutive days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter further explained that an applicant is unable to perform an ADL \"independently\" if he requires either \"physical assistance,\" \"stand-by assistance,\" or \"verbal assistance\" to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter explained that Hensley could appeal the decision to \"AFPC/DPFCS.\" AR 41-42 [24-25].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hensley appealed, and received a letter from \"AFPC/DPFD\" denying his appeal on October 10, 2013. AR 44 [27]. The letter explained: \"We re-examined your claim and additional documents provided with your appeal package. Unfortunately, the medical documentation does not support that you were unable to perform at least two of the six activities of daily living (ADLs) for at least 30 consecutive days.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter further explained that Hensley could appeal again to the AFBCMR or file suit in federal court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Hensley then appealed to the AFBCMR. In March 2014, he filed a brief arguing that an error or injustice existed because (1) the denial of benefits was arbitrary in light of the medical evidence and the signed doctor's statement supporting Hensley's claim and (2) the Air Force had failed to adequately advise Hensley of the reason for the denial. AR 16-17 [10-11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The AFBCMR sought an advisory opinion from \"AFPC/DPFC\" (apparently the same office that had handled Hensley's initial appeal). AFPC/DPFC issued a memorandum from Stephen T. Rose dated May 15, 2014 (the \"Rose Memo\"). AR 778-81 [92-95]. The Rose Memo laid out the standard for awarding TSGLI benefits, and then relayed discussions with the doctors who had reviewed Hensley's initial application and earlier appeal. AR 778-80 [92-94]. Those doctors were not named in the Rose Memo.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The doctor who had reviewed the initial application opined that Hensley had shown loss of only one ADL (the ability to bathe himself) and only for 60 days. AR 779 [93]. The doctor noted that Hensley \"returned to work within one week after the accident and beginning 21 April could use his left (non-dominant) arm for minimal activities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He further reasoned that \"therapy notes mention limitations with self-care ADLs, but the ROM [range-of-motion] measurements and treatment (sling only with no mention of movement restrictions) suggest that he had the capacity to dress himself.\" AR 779-80 [93-94].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second doctor, who had reviewed Hensley's first appeal, reached a similar conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The SM's [service member's] legal representative ... contends that having one arm limited in function made it impossible for SM to dress himself without assistance. There is no direct evidence in the medical record that the SM could not dress himself due to functional limitations in his non-dominant left arm. [The legal representative] cites a note from physical therapy in April 2008 that stated \"patient is still limited at home with self care and ADLs.\" This is a non-specific comment and there is no evidence in the medical records provided that SM could not perform some or all ADLs without assistance. \"Still limited\" could just as easily mean that it took the SM longer to perform some or all ADLs. By the time this comment was made in the medical record, the SM had already been performing light duty at work for 2 months. [The legal representative] also insists the SM could not put on his shirt and pants due to lack of motion, limitations, weakness, and the inability to perform overhead activities with his left arm (such as SM pulling a shirt over his head.) All of that disregards the fact that the SM had a perfectly good right arm and the SM is right-handed. SM had persistent limitations in range of motion in the left shoulder as well as weakness of grip and these symptoms extended well past 20 August 2008 but\n   they did not create a medical necessity for assistance with dressing AND bathing for even 30 days, let alone the 120 days which SM claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   AR 780 [94]. The second doctor also addressed Dr. Hopkins' certification, noting that Dr. Hopkins \"indicated he DID NOT observe the SM's loss and I assume he had no more information about SM's case than what was in the medical records submitted for review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After summarizing these conversations, the Rose Memo provided the following analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On 21 Apr 2014, we received Staff Sergeant Hensley's AFBCMR application asking that his TSGLI claim be approved. The burden of proof is on Staff Sergeant Hensley to demonstrate he suffered a scheduled loss as a result of his traumatic event. After reviewing the original claim and appeal, our position remains firm that Staff Sergeant Hensley does not meet TSGLI criterion for ADL loss due OTI for any payable threshold. It is reasonable to believe that having an arm in a sling may make bathing and dressing more difficult; however, it is also reasonable to believe that Staff Sergeant Hensley would be able to use the uninjured arm to perform the basic functions albeit at a slower pace.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   AR 781 [95]. Based on that analysis, the Rose Memo recommended that the AFBCMR deny Hensley's appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In June 2014, Hensley filed a letter in response to the Rose Memo. AR 783-84 [97-98]. In the letter, Hensley interpreted the memo as concluding \"that the medical information was not clear enough that SSGT Hensley in fact did suffer significant ADL loss.\" AR 783 [97]. In order to \"clarify\" that issue, Hensley submitted an affidavit from his wife dated June 18, 2014. AR 783 [97], 785 [99]. In the affidavit, Hensley's wife stated that, \"[d]uring the time period after his injury, I provided John both stand by and physical assistance with bathing, washing hair, dressing, and undressing.\" AR 785 [99]. The affidavit stated that Hensley \"also needed assistance\" sitting up and using the bathroom.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The affidavit further stated that \"Dr. Hopkins [sic] conclusion that John needed assistance with ADLs from at least between February, 20, 2008 and August 20, 2009 [sic] is consistent with what I did for John, and witnessed as John's caretaker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His wife concluded by noting that, \"[t]o this day, John still needs my help in performing some tasks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hensley offered to make his wife available for testimony before the AFBCMR.

The Board's record of proceedings summarized Hensley's arguments, some of the key facts in the record, the Rose Memo, and Hensley's response. AR 2-6 [2-6]. The Board then concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Insufficient relevant evidence has been presented to demonstrate the existence of error or injustice. After a thorough review of the available evidence and the applicant's complete submission we are not persuaded the applicant's TSGLI application should be approved. We note the applicant's spouse provides a sworn affidavit stating the applicant loss [sic] 120 days of ADL and still requires assistance due to the ongoing nature of his injuries. However, in our opinion, substantial evidence has not been presented to successfully refute the assessment of his case by the Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). Therefore, we agree with the opinion and recommendation of the Air Force OPR [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Rose Memo] and adopt the rationale expressed as the basis for our decision that the applicant has failed to sustain his burden of proof of either an error or an injustice.

AR 6 [6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In June 2016, Hensley filed the instant lawsuit. He alleges that the AFBCMR's decision was arbitrary and capricious insofar as it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   did not provide justification as to why the greater weight of the evidence did not support [Hensley's] eligibility for TSGLI benefits; give any reasons why the certifying medical professional's certification was not credible; address the Affidavit of Ms. Hensley attesting to her observations and provision of assistance to [Hensley] during his recovery; or provide reasonable or substantial evidence or medical opinion contradicting [Hensley's] claim for TSGLI benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 35.

Hensley had the opportunity to raise both of these objections to the Rose Memo but did not do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 782-86 [96-100]. The AFBCMR's decision cannot be deemed arbitrary and capricious for failing to address arguments that Hensley never made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In any event, these two arguments do not appear to hold water. Hensley has cited no authority for the proposition that a board for correction of military records must identify its in-house medical experts by name in an advisory opinion summarizing their views. Nor does the argument regarding \"medical necessity\" have any merit. One of the doctors in the Rose Memo concluded that Hensley had not shown \"a medical necessity for assistance with dressing AND bathing for even 30 days.\" AR 780 [94]. Hensley argues that the doctor thereby imposed a new standard of \"medical necessity\" in the sense of \"something ordered by a medical doctor, like a prescription.\" Pl.'s Mot. at 11. The Court is not persuaded. Hensley does not dispute that an applicant must show that he \"required\" assistance with ADLs to receive TSGLI benefits; indeed, he sought to meet this standard before the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 20 [14]. It is only logical that a doctor reviewing Hensley's medical records would characterize a necessity arising from his injury as \"medical necessity.\" The statement thus merely represents one doctor's application of the appropriate standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Hensley further argues that the Rose Memo improperly disregarded the medical evidence in the record, as well as Dr. Hopkins' statement, and instead relied on \"speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 9-10. As an initial matter, Hensley nowhere suggests that the doctors who reviewed his earlier application did not have all of the relevant medical records he ultimately submitted to the AFBCMR for review. Moreover, the Rose Memo's conclusions-that the medical records do not directly show that Hensley required assistance to bathe and dress himself, and that he could have continued to do so using his uninjured right arm,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 781 [95]-appear to have at least some evidentiary support in the medical records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And as other courts have held in TSGLI cases, the AFBCMR was justified in attaching little or no weight to Dr. Hopkins' certification for the very reason stated by the unnamed doctors in the Rose Memo: that it was made years after the injury on the basis of\n   the medical records alone, not first-hand knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coker v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-cv-202 (JHM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207242727\">\n    2016 WL 7242727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (W.D.

Nothing in the AFBCMR's decision suggests that it found the affidavit to be fraudulent. The AFBCMR made no findings of fact about the affidavit's credibility; it merely summarized the affidavit's contents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5 [5].

The D.C. Circuit held that the board's reasoning defied logic: the entire purpose of the plaintiff's application was to correct the allegedly deficient medical records, yet the board had failed to explain why the evidence submitted was insufficient to warrant a correction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340978,4285603\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/990/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340978,4285603\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/990/\">\n    at 992-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But that conclusion was based in part on the doctors' reasoning that there was \"no direct evidence in the medical record that [Hensley] could not dress himself\" and that Dr. Hopkins' certification was unpersuasive because he lacked first-hand knowledge of Hensley's medical treatment. AR 780 [94]. As in\n   <em>\n    Haselwander\n   </em>\n   , the critical question before the Board was why the additional direct evidence provided-here, the affidavit of Hensley's wife-did not adequately fill the gap that the Board had identified in the medical records. The AFBCMR, like the board in\n   <em>\n    Haselwander\n   </em>\n   , provided a summary of the affidavit that made its significance clear: if true, it would entitle Hensley to the relief he sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5 [5]. Nonetheless, like the board in\n   <em>\n    Haselwander\n   </em>\n   , the AFBCMR failed to engage with that evidence in a meaningful way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Of course, there may well be a good reason for the Board to find that Hensley's wife was lying; or that her memory was unreliable six years after the fact; or that even if the affidavit was mostly true and Hensley's wife had in fact assisted him with bathing and dressing as she claimed, the medical records still compelled the conclusion that her assistance was not actually required because Hensley could have performed those tasks on his own, albeit more slowly. But instead of pausing to make any such finding, the AFBCMR-again, like the board in\n   <em>\n    Haselwander\n   </em>\n   -skipped ahead to conclude, in boilerplate language, that \"substantial evidence has not been presented to successfully refute the assessment of his case by the Air Force Office of Primary Responsibility.\" AR 5 [5].\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In short, the AFBCMR's decision \"omitted the critical step-connecting the facts to the conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Dickson v.

One of the unnamed doctors stated that Hensley \"had already been performing light duty at work for 2 months\" by April 9, 2008, when his physical therapist reported that he was \"still limited at home with self care and ADLs.\" AR 780 [94]. Similarly, the other doctor stated that Hensley had returned to work one week after the accident.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 779 [93].

It is possible that these statements reflect an incomplete review of the record: Hensley was initially ordered to stay off work for only a week but appears to have subsequently been ordered to stay off work for a longer period of time.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 82 [51], 540 [78], 553-54 [80-81]. Nonetheless, Hensley overlooked this potential error both before the agency and in his briefing on summary judgment.

Neither party has pointed the Court to any authority that describes the AFBCMR's standard of decision as requiring applicants to show \"substantial evidence ... to successfully refute\" the decision of the relevant Air Force office.
