Laurick [20], and the Assignment of Trust Deed attached as Exhibit 2 to the Laurick Declaration,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and are taken as true at this stage of the proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff obtained a line of credit from MetLife that was secured by a Deed of Trust on Plaintiff's real property. As part of their advertising for their reverse mortgage products, Plaintiff alleges MetLife represented to prospective borrowers that a borrower could \"stay in your home until you die.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 73. The Deed of Trust was recorded on June 22, 2009, and identified the \"maximum principal amount\" as $938,250.00. Paragraph 2 of the Deed of Trust requires Plaintiff to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   pay all property charges consisting of taxes, ground rents, flood and hazard\n   insurance premiums, and special assessments in a timely manner, and shall provide evidence of payment to Lender, unless Lender pays property charges by withholding funds from monthly payments due to the Borrower or by charging such payments to a line of credit as provided for in the Loan Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Laurick Decl.

As of July 20, 2017, MetLife and Nationstar had lent to Plaintiff $664,125.08 in principal with a total amount due of $742,784.87. Pl.'s Am. Compl. \u00b6 83.

In Claim Two Plaintiff brings a claim to quiet title in her property\n   <em>\n    vis-\u00e0-vis\n   </em>\n   MetLife and Nationstar. In Claim Three Plaintiff brings a claim for civil conspiracy against all Defendants on the basis that they conspired to conduct an unlawful foreclosure of Plaintiff's property. In Claim Four Plaintiff brings a claim for an equitable accounting of the loan. In Claim Five Plaintiff brings two counts against all Defendants under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1692p.

In Claim Eight Plaintiff brings two counts under Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7\u00a7 124.100, 124.110 against MetLife, Nationstar, and Fidelity for financial abuse of a protected person. Finally, in Claim Nine Plaintiff brings a claim for fraud against MetLife and Fidelity on the basis that MetLife made the loan and Fidelity insured the\n   loan with the intention and basis of foreclosing on Plaintiff's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the court must \"accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Knievel\n   </em>\n   , 393 F.3d at 1072.

Plaintiff appears to suggest in her First Amended Complaint that such payments should have been made because the $664,125.08 in loan principal remained below the $938,250.00 maximum principal amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MetLife and Nationstar contend Plaintiff's allegation that they had a duty to pay property taxes is contradicted by the terms of the Trust Deed and, therefore, should not be credited as true. MetLife and Nationstar argue Plaintiff's breach of contract claim should be dismissed because the Trust Deed provides Plaintiff-and not MetLife or Nationstar-was responsible for paying the property taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff alleges MetLife and Nationstar were obligated to pay property taxes in the event that Plaintiff did not do so. In support of that allegation Plaintiff references the following paragraph from the Trust Deed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   If Borrower fails to make these payments or the property charges required by Paragraph 2, or fails to perform any other covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument, or there is a legal proceeding that may significantly affect Lender's rights in the Property (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, for condemnation or to enforce laws or regulations), then Lender may do and pay whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and Lender's rights in the Property, including payment of taxes, hazard insurance and other items mentioned in Paragraph 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Laurick Decl. [20] Exh. 1, at 3. MetLife and Nationstar, on the other hand, contend that provision establishes they did not have any duty to pay property taxes, but instead merely had discretion to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Trust Deed, however, also provides Plaintiff must\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   pay all property charges consisting of taxes, ground rents, flood and hazard insurance premiums, and special assessments in a timely manner, and shall provide evidence of payment to Lender,\n   <em>\n    unless Lender pays property charges by withholding funds from monthly payments due to the Borrower or by charging such payments to a line of credit as provided for in the Loan Agreement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (emphasis added). It is unclear without reference to the Loan Agreement (which is not in the record on MetLife and Nationstar's Motion to Dismiss) whether there is any provision therein that requires MetLife or Nationstar to pay property taxes or whether the Trust Deed merely refers to the procedure set out in the Loan Agreement by which MetLife or Nationstar could pay the property taxes at their discretion. Because there is not any unequivocal contradiction of Plaintiff's allegation that the parties' agreement created a duty in MetLife and, later, Nationstar to pay property taxes if Plaintiff did not do so, the Court must view the allegation in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and accept it as true at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   So construed, Plaintiff's claim for breach of contract is straightforward: MetLife and Nationstar breached their duty to pay property taxes on Plaintiff's behalf and, as a result, Plaintiff defaulted on her reverse-mortgage\n   loan and incurred damages therefrom. Plaintiff, therefore, plausibly states a claim for breach of contract on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Claim Two-Quiet Title\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As noted, in Claim Two Plaintiff brings a claim against MetLife and Nationstar to quiet title in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In her Amended Complaint Plaintiff makes the following allegations regarding MetLife and/or Nationstar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   92.

Defendants are correct that Plaintiff has not specified any tort underlying Claim Three. Although Defendants understandably speculate that Plaintiff attempted to plead a claim for conspiracy to commit a wrongful foreclosure in Claim Three, this Court has repeatedly found Oregon law does not recognize the standalone tort of wrongful foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Parsley v.

Although Plaintiff alleges the assignment of the reverse mortgage\n   to Nationstar was invalid, those alleged defects in the assignment do not give rise to any plausible inference that Nationstar was, in fact, acting as a third-party debt collector.

Accordingly, on this record the Court agrees with MetLife and Nationstar that they are not \"debt collector[s]\" under the definition the Court addressed in\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The FDCPA, however, provides an alternative definition of \"debt collector\" that includes \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schlegel v.

The discovery rule in Oregon provides that a \"claim accrues when the plaintiff has discovered facts or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered facts that would alert a reasonable person to the existence\" of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Murphy v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221268\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/251/316/\">\n    251 Or.App. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221268\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/251/316/\">\n    284 P.3d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 528 (2012) (interpreting the discovery rule in the context of Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 12.110(1), which uses language materially identical to \u00a7 124.130 ) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court initially notes it is difficult to discern from Plaintiff's pleadings which action she identifies as the taking or appropriation of money or property, especially in light of the fact that the alleged foreclosure has not yet taken place (and has apparently been cancelled). Plaintiff must cure this deficiency in her next amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As noted, the Court agrees with MetLife that Plaintiff's claims that rely on alleged misrepresentation of the maximum principal amount of the loan as the actionable allegation accrued no later than June 2009 when the loan was finalized and the Trust Deed was recorded. Plaintiff initiated this action on July 23, 2017. To the extent that Plaintiff's Claim Eight is based on MetLife's alleged misrepresentations concerning the maximum principal amount of the loan, Plaintiff did not bring that claim within the applicable seven-year statute of limitations. Accordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Claim Eight to the extent it is based on alleged misrepresentations concerning the maximum principal amount of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff also lists other potential bases for liability in Count One of Claim Eight, including that Plaintiff was \"only eligible for no more than $417,000.00 because of her age\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 194), the unreasonableness of the terms of the loan (Am. Compl. \u00b6 197), and Plaintiff's ineligibility for the loan on the basis of zoning restrictions on the property (Am. Compl. \u00b6 199). The allegations related to these claims, however, are far too conclusory to support a claim for relief. Accordingly, the Court dismisses without prejudice Claim Eight to the extent it is based\n   on these allegations. The Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend as to these allegations so long as Plaintiff can plead in good faith sufficient nonconclusory facts to support such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IX.\n    <em>\n     Claim Nine-Fraud\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In Claim Nine Plaintiff brings a common-law fraud claim against MetLife and Fidelity on largely the same basis as Claim Eight. MetLife moves to dismiss Claim Nine as to it on the bases that it is inadequately pleaded and barred by the two-year statute of limitations contained in Oregon Revised Statute \u00a7 12.110(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As noted, a discovery rule applies to the two-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 12.110(1) whereby a \"claim accrues when the plaintiff has discovered facts or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered facts that would alert a reasonable person to the existence\" of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221268\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/251/316/\">\n    284 P.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the same reasons as Claim Eight, Plaintiff's Claim Nine is barred by the statute of limitations to the extent that it is based on the alleged misrepresentations concerning the maximum principal amount of the loan. Accordingly, the Court dismisses with prejudice Claim Nine to the extent it is based on such misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The other bases for Claim Nine set out in the Amended Complaint are identical to those that Plaintiff alleged with respect to Claim Eight. Accordingly, as with Claim Eight the Court finds those bases for relief in Claim Nine are inadequately pleaded and, therefore, must be dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend to the extent that Plaintiff can plead in good faith nonconclusory facts that would support such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For these reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part MetLife and Nationstar's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint [18]; GRANTS MetLife and Nationstar's Request for Judicial Notice [19]; GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Zieve Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [24]; and GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Surreply [29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In summary, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiff's Claim One; dismisses Claim Two without prejudice and with leave to amend; dismisses Claim Three without prejudice and with leave to amend; dismisses Claim Four with prejudice; dismisses Claim Five as to MetLife, Nationstar, and the Zieve Defendants without prejudice and with leave to amend; dismisses Claim Six without prejudice and with leave to amend; dismisses Claim Seven with prejudice; dismisses Claim Eight as to MetLife with prejudice to the extent that claim is based on alleged misrepresentations concerning the maximum principal amount of the loan, but without prejudice as to the other alleged bases for relief; and dismisses Claim Nine as to MetLife with prejudice to the extent that it is based on alleged misrepresentations concerning the maximum principal amount of the loan, but without prejudice as to the other alleged bases for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court advises Plaintiff that failure to address the pleading deficiencies outlined in this Opinion and Order in her next amended complaint may result in the Court finding that dismissal of such claims with prejudice is necessary because further leave to amend would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    CASE-MANAGEMENT ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   While the above Motions were pending, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Modify Initial Scheduling Order [33] and a Corrected Motion to Modify Initial Scheduling Order [34], and MetLife and Nationstar filed a Motion to Extend Discovery, Motion for Summary Judgment, and Pretrial Deadlines\n   [35]. In light of the broad scope of matters for Plaintiff to address in her next amended complaint as a result of this Opinion and Order, the Court finds proceeding with discovery at this point is not viable. Accordingly, the Court STRIKES all existing case-management and discovery deadlines, STAYS discovery, and DENIES as moot Plaintiff's Motions to Modify Initial Scheduling Order [33, 34] and the Motion to Extend [35] filed by MetLife and Nationstar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court directs Plaintiff to file any second amended complaint no later than February 26, 2018. Defendants' responsive pleading(s) will be due no later than March 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Court may \"consider 'documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which are not physically attached to the [plaintiff's] pleading.' \"\n    <em>\n     Dunn v.

In her First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff refers to and discusses the contents of the Trust Deed (\u00b6\u00b6 77-78) and the Assignment (\u00b6\u00b6 38-62). Accordingly, the Court may consider the Trust Deed and Assignment in resolving the Motions before the Court. The Request for Judicial Notice [19] filed by MetLife and Nationstar seeks only for the Court to consider the Trust Deed and Assignment. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS their Request on this basis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Although Plaintiff names only MetLife in this claim, it appears Claim One should apply to both entities because the loan was assigned to Champion (a subsidiary of Nationstar).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The Court has considered the Surreply [29-1] filed by Plaintiff in opposition to the Zieve Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [24]. The Court, therefore, GRANTS Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Surreply [29] and directs the Clerk to docket the Surreply as a standalone pleading.

The Court disagrees.

It is unclear how this allegation relates to the other allegations in Count Five, all of which refer to representations MetLife made concerning the amount of the loan and the available remedies for default.
