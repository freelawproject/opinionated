Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts [83]. Nelson filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on Counts II for breach of contract and III for defamation [85]. For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of defendants and denies plaintiff's summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. Plaintiff Joyce Nelson was employed by the Country Club Hills District 160 Board of Education pursuant to a one-year administrative employment contract to serve in the administrative position as the principal at Meadowview School for the academic period from August 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. (Dkt. 93 at 7; Dkt. 98 at 11). Defendant Sandra Thomas was the Superintendent of the Country Club Hills School District 160, during the material time period at issue here. (Dkt. 93 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 24, 2015, Thomas completed Nelson's professional evaluation, rating her \"excellent\" in three categories: \"Leading and Managing Systems\" (standard 2); \"Building and Maintaining Collaborative Relationships (standard 4); and \"Leading\n   with Integrity and Professionalism\" (standard 5). (Dkt. 93 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 17, 2015, Nelson called the Country Club Hills police because Dawn Harris, a parent of a Meadowview School student, became disruptive on school grounds. (Dkt. 98 at 12). During the incident, Nelson instructed teachers to escort their students into classrooms and lock the doors. (Dkt. 98 at 13). Nelson identified herself to Harris as the school principal. (Dkt. 98 at 14). Nelson and two other school employees (Steve Morton and Brenda Richardson) each gave a statement to the police. (Dkt. 98 at 15). Harris was charged with aggravated assault, disorderly conduct, and criminal trespass to state supported land. (Dkt. 98 at 19). On August 14, 2015, Harris pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and the Cook County State's Attorney dismissed the other charges. (Dkt. 98 at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 4, 2015, Thomas notified Harris by certified letter that the School District was considering formally prohibiting her from being present anywhere on any School District property and/or entering any school buildings. (Dkt. 100 at 11). Following the letter, Thomas and Harris had a one-on-one meeting on May 14, 2015. (Dkt. 100 at 12). Initially, Thomas proposed that Nelson attend the meeting with Thomas and Harris to discuss the School District's response to Harris' concerns about the bullying of her child. (Dkt. 100 at 17-19). Nelson contacted Attorney Brian Schwartz, General Counsel for the Illinois Principal Association, seeking guidance about the proposed meeting and her discomfort with being present. (Dkt. 100 at 16-17). Schwartz thought it would be a good idea to have a telephone conference or to have a police or district resource officer present. (Dkt. 100 at 17). Nelson refused to attend the meeting, which took place on May 28, 2015, with two other members of the Board present. (Dkt. 100 at 19). On June 5, 2015, Thomas sent Nelson a disciplinary letter for her refusal to participate in a parent conference with Harris. (Dkt. 100 at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On Tuesday June 9, 2015, the police responded to a report of a dispute erupted between Harris and Nelson at Meadowview School. (Dkt. 100 at 27). The police report described the incident as a \"communication mishap,\" and no charges were filed. (Dkt. 96-4, Ex. KK). Immediately following this incident, Nelson received medical attention from the School District medical staff for elevated blood pressure. (Dkt. 100 at 28; Dkt. 96-4, Ex. LL). Also on this date, Thomas sent Nelson a one-year administrative employment contract for the academic period August 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, with instructions for her to sign and return it the following day. (Dkt. 93 at 8; Dkt. 100 at 30). Having initially sent Nelson the incorrect contract, Thomas sent Nelson a corrected contract by email at 6:12 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 100 at 32). In the email Thomas admonished Nelson that the failure to return the signed contract by the end of the day on June 10, 2015, \"will result in a reevaluation of [her] continuing employment with the District.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nelson did not sign the employment contract to serve as a principal for Country Club Hills School District 160 for the 2015-2016 academic year. (Dkt. 98 at 29; Dkt. 86-1, Ex. C). Nelson did not inform Thomas of any reason for her failure to sign the contract, though she later stated there was a misstatement of the number of vacation days. (Dkt. 98 at 30). On June 15, 2015, Thomas emailed Nelson to advise her that \"As of 5:00 p.m. today, June 15, 2015, I have not received your signed employment contract. As a result, I will be evaluating your current position as Meadowview building principal. Please make an appointment\n   with my secretary to discuss your continued employment in District 160.\" (Dkt. 100 at 34). On June 16, 2015, Nelson responded, requesting a meeting on Thursday, June 18, 2015. (Dkt. 100 at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Board meeting agenda and minutes from June 16, 2015, document that the Board discussed administrative contracts for ten individuals, including Nelson. (Dkt. 98 at 35; Dkt. 84-13, Ex. M). The meeting agenda indicates that the Board anticipated approving Nelson's administrative contract. (Dkt. 86-3, Ex. G). The minutes reflect that Nelson's contract to serve as principal at Meadowview was withdrawn by the Board and the Board approved reassigning her to Southwood School as assistant principal. (Dkt. 98 at 36-37; Dkt. 84-13, Ex. M). The Board notified Nelson that they were reassigning her to the position of assistant principal for 2015-2016 school year. (Dkt. 98 at 31). Between June 9, 2015, and June 16, 2015, the Board anticipated renewing and approving the one-year administrative employment contract offered to Nelson for the 2015-2016 school year. (Dkt. 93 at 10). On or about June 16, 2015, the Board's attorneys advised the Board that it could withdraw Nelson's contract tendered on June 9, 2015, and reassign her to the position of assistant principal. (Dkt. 93 at 13). On June 17, 2015, Thomas provided Nelson with a letter informing her of the Board's decision to reassign her to the position of assistant principal at Southwood Middle School with the same salary, terms, and conditions of employment contained in her 2014-2015 administrative employment contract. (Dkt. 93 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Paragraph 6 of Nelson's 2014-2015 employment contract, requires each party to provide notice no later than April 1 of the contract year [2015] if the contract was not going to be renewed at the end of its term. (Dkt. 93 at 20). The director of human resources sent Nelson a letter dated July 25, 2015, to confirm Nelson's return and that her assignment was as Assistant Principal of Southwood Middle School beginning August 3, 2015. (Dkt. 98 at 32). The Board's official website was updated on or about August 1, 2015, to reflect that \"Dr. Joyce Nelson\" was the Assistant Principal of Southwood Middle School. (Dkt. 93 at 26). Nelson did not report to Southwood Middle School to begin her position as Assistant Principal for the 2015-2016 school year. (Dkt. 98 at 33). The August 11, 2015, Board meeting agenda and minutes indicate that the Board was to discuss in a closed session that Nelson had not signed her contract or reported to work. (Dkt. 98 at 38). Nelson has not received any salary or compensation or benefits from employment with the Board since June 30, 2015. (Dkt. 93 at 34). Nelson was seeking employment outside Country Club Hills School District 160 as of May 2015.

Count I: First Amendment Retaliation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on all three counts of the First Amended Complaint. In Count I, Nelson alleges unlawful retaliation in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for exercising her right of free speech as secured by the First Amendment. Nelson alleges that the Board and Thomas retaliated against her for reporting the actions of Meadowview parent, Dawn Harris, to the police by demanding that she meet with \"her attacker,\" reprimanding her for failing to meet with Harris, and rescinding the Board's offer to continue her employment as principal of Meadowview school. Defendants argue that Nelson made the police report, not as a private citizen, but as a public employee while doing her job. Thus, according to defendants, the police report is not protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a public school principal, Nelson was a public employee, and as such this Court must first determine whether the speech that allegedly motivated the employer's adverse action was protected by the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    McArdle v. Peoria Sch. Dist. No. 150\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659130\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/751/#p754\">\n    705 F.3d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (7th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    Chaklos v.

If the plaintiff is able to establish those first two requirements, then the defendant may still prevail if it would have taken the same action irrespective of the plaintiff's speech.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733777\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/480/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Whether the Constitution protects particular speech is a question of law appropriate for resolution by summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spiegla v.

The record demonstrates otherwise. The police report shows that Nelson was providing the report as a representative of Meadowview School. Dkt. 84-3 at pp. 69-70. The report states that Nelson, the school principal, informed the officer that a parent came to the school and caused a disturbance. The parent, Harris, confronted Nelson because she felt that the school was not taking seriously the bullying of Harris' child at the school.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046755\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/565/#p569\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the report is not made in the\n   ordinary execution of her job, maintaining order and safety on school property from an administrative standpoint would undoubtedly be within Nelson's purview as principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The misdemeanor complaints filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County against Harris stemming from the March 17, 2015, incident at the school also support the conclusion that Nelson was speaking in her capacity as principal of Meadowview and not as a private citizen. The complaint for disorderly conduct for which Harris ultimately pleaded guilty, states that Harris:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   knowingly entered on the property of Meadowview School District 160\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4701%20W.%20179\">\n    4701 W. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Street Country Club Hills, Ill. Cook County in that said defendant entered into the building and caused a disturbance by chasing a student in the hallway in which it caused alarm to school staff and the students in the building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dkt. 94-3, Ex. BB. It is signed by Nelson and provides the address of the school as the complainant's address.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4701%20W.%20179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, the complaint for criminal trespass to state supported land states that Harris:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   knowingly entered...Meadowview School...after receiving prior to such entry, notice from School Principal, Dr. Joyce Nelson a representative of the School, that such entry was forbidden, and thereby interfered with the Principal's lawful use of such building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dkt. 94-3, Ex. CC. The third complaint from the incident, for aggravated assault, likewise notes Nelson as principal of Meadowview. Dkt. 94-3, Ex. DD. Thus, this Court finds the record demonstrates that Nelson was not speaking as a private citizen when reporting the incident to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if Nelson were speaking as a private citizen, the content of the statement does not involve a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houskins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733777\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/480/#p489\">\n    549 F.3d at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he 'public concern' element must relate to a community concern and is not satisfied by 'merely a personal grievance of interest only to the employee.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733777\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/480/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733777\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/480/#p489\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v.

Clearly, Nelson was filing the police report not to raise an issue of public concern, but file a grievance for specific conduct directed at Nelson in her official capacity and at her students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The situation here is similar to that in Houskins, where the plaintiff filed a police report after being assaulted by a colleague.\n   <em>\n    Houskins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5733777\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/480/#p489\">\n    549 F.3d at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nelson asserts that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this count because the undisputed facts show that the Board rescinded the renewal of her contract in June and demoted her to assistant principal at Southwood Middle School in violation of the Illinois School Code, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-23.8b. The Board argues that it is entitled to judgment in its favor because Nelson\n   failed to sign her employment contract to remain principal within the time requested, and the Board was within its rights to reassign her to another open position at the same salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under Illinois law, the elements of a breach of contract cause of action are a valid and enforceable contract, breach by the defendant, resulting in damages to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ass'n Ben. Servs., Inc. v.

Here, neither party disputes that there was a valid and enforceable contract prior to June 2015. Thus, the only issues for this Court are whether the Board breached the contract and whether Nelson incurred damages from a breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nelson claims that the Board violated the following provision in her contract for the 2014-2015 school year:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In the event the Board or the Administrator decides not to renew this agreement at the end of its term, notice of such intention shall be given by no later than April 1, of the contract year. Unless terminated earlier under paragraph 14 below, this Agreement will terminate effective at the close of the day on June 30 of the contract year identified in paragraph 1 above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Board does not dispute that it did not provide Nelson with notice of its intent to terminate her contract prior to April 1, 2015. The Board argues, and Nelson does not contradict, that the Board provided her with an employment contract for the 2015-2016 school year and that Nelson did not sign the contract. The record demonstrates that it was only after Nelson refused to sign the contract that the Board chose instead to reassign her to the position of assistant principal at Southwood Middle School with the same compensation. When the Board sent her a contract for the assistant principal position Nelson also did not sign. Further, Nelson did not provide the Board with any notice of her intent not to continue her employment as an Administrator with the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Illinois School Code provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Upon non-renewal of a principal's or assistant principal's administrative contract, the principal or assistant principal shall be reclassified pursuant to this Section. No principal or assistant principal may be reclassified by demotion or reduction in rank from one position within a school district to another for which a lower salary is paid without written notice from the board of the proposed reclassification by April 1 of the year in which the contract expires...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   105 Ill.

Here, it is undisputed that the Board reassigned Nelson to an administrator position at the same salary and thus it complied with the School Code.

Despite Nelson's claim that the statement is false, this Court finds that based on the undisputed evidence Nelson failed to sign a new employment contract and did not report to work the statement is technically true. Her assertion that she never accepted the position of assistant principal does not render this statement false. She never notified the Board that she did not intend to sign a new contract. Lastly, Nelson appears to believe that simply being labeled \"assistant principal\" is by itself impugning her professional character. This Court disagrees with the assessment that on its face the title \"assistant principal\" is insulting. Accordingly, this Court finds no genuine issue of material fact on Nelson's defamation claim and Thomas is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on the foregoing discussion, this Court finds that the defendants, Country Club Hills District 160 School Board and Sandra Thomas, are entitled to judgment as a matter of law in their favor on all three counts of the First Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This Court grants defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment [83] and denies plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgment on Counts II and III [85].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The first contract sent was for a different employee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
