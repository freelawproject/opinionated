On January 12, 2016, Defendant again responded with a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim. ECF No. 22. Later, on March 8, 2016, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss for Forum Non Conveniens.

Two days later, on November 5, 2016, the Court denied Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim. ECF No. 71.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit found prejudice where the lower court referenced \"mounting attorneys fees\" rather than a particular dollar amount.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10551766\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/791/1156/#p1158\">\n    791 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1159 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unity Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20Fed.%20Appx.%20679\">\n    256 Fed.Appx. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\"[W]e hold that the district court did not clearly err when it found that the time and expense required to respond to Cingular's motion for summary judgment prejudiced Unity.\"). Therefore, the Court rejects Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate prejudice because she did not quantify her costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having concluded that the required showing of prejudice is reduced and that Plaintiff need not quantify her expenses, the Court proceeds to examine the actual delay, expense, and damage to Plaintiff's litigation position. First, while delay could be measured from the time Defendant conceded the validity of the arbitration clause-which would lead to a calculation of twelve months-Defendant unequivocally took the position that the parties' dispute was not subject to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 44 n.5 (\"Should this Court not dismiss this lawsuit, and should the arbitration tribunal incorrectly decide that any portion of [Plaintiff's] and [Defendant's] dispute is subject to arbitration ....\"). Also, as extensively discussed above, Defendant did not move to compel arbitration for an entire year once he conceded the arbitration clause's validity. Given those facts, the Court does not believe that Defendant would have moved to compel arbitration from the outset in the absence of a dispute concerning the arbitration clause's validity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant delayed for a period of nineteen months before moving to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Concerning expense, although Plaintiff does not provide a dollar amount, she points to the costs specifically related to responding to each of Defendant's motions. Those include a response to Defendant's (1) second Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim (2) Motion for Protection, to Abate Discovery, and for Scheduling Order (3) Motion to Dismiss for Forum Non Conveniens (4) first and second Motion to Exclude Plaintiff's Experts (5) Motion for Reconsideration and Alternative Request for Interlocutory Appeal and (6) Motion to Stay Discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31; ECF No. 36; ECF No. 51; ECF No. 62; ECF No. 63; ECF No. 80; ECF No. 95. In addition, as previously noted, Defendant sought leave to exceed the page limitation on both his Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and Failure to State a Claim and his Motion to Dismiss for Forum Non Conveniens. ECF No. 21; ECF No 40. He also included with those motions a 131 page appendix and an 850 page appendix, respectively. ECF No. 22; ECF No. 44. The time and expense of\n   reviewing and responding to such filings is obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, concerning prejudice to Plaintiff's legal position, the Court agrees with Defendant to the extent he argues that Plaintiff has not been prejudiced by discovery proceedings. A party may be prejudiced by damage to its legal position when the opposing party takes \"unfair advantage of discovery proceedings which would not have been available in arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Tenneco Resins, Inc. v.

For example, a party may suffer prejudice if it is forced to disclose items in discovery that would be undiscoverable in arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524901\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/575/#p576\">\n    938 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   579 n.3.

Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 44. The Court denied that motion, finding that this is indeed an appropriate forum. Order Denying Mot. to Dismiss, ECF. No. 78. Having lost on that point, Defendant again seeks to have this case dismissed to a different forum, albeit through a different mechanism, in order to litigate \"the arbitrability issue of whether [Plaintiff's] eight claims in this action ... fall within an arbitration agreement\" between the parties. Reply 1. In essence, then, granting the instant motion would force Plaintiff to again litigate, this time before the arbitral tribunal, the question of where her claims should be heard. The Court further observes that, given Defendant's previous position that the parties' dispute should be resolved in Mexico and that these claims are not subject to arbitration, it would be unsurprising if Defendant rekindled those or similar arguments in arbitration in another attempt to move Plaintiff's claims to Mexico. As noted above, the ICC Rules of Arbitration allow the arbitral tribunal to apply the law it deems appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICC Rules of Arbitration, art. 21 \u00a7 1. Consequently, it is readily imaginable that Defendant would raise these or similar arguments there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has been sufficiently prejudiced. Defendant did not make a timely demand for arbitration or even intimate a desire to resolve this dispute through arbitration should his challenges to the validity of the arbitration agreement be unfounded. Nor did Defendant take any action once he conceded the arbitration agreement's validity. Instead, Defendant forced Plaintiff to incur significant legal expenses by responding to his various, voluminous motions and delayed the resolution of this case for more than nineteen months. Additionally, if the case were sent to arbitration, Plaintiff would likely be prejudiced by having to re-litigate where her claims should be heard.

Without resolving what exactly Defendant prayed for, the Court considers his apparent move to have these claims dismissed with prejudice as further indicative of his desire to resolve this case through litigation rather than arbitration.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The parties' arbitration agreement requires arbitration in accordance with the Rule of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\").

The Court finds those cases easily distinguishable. For example, in\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    , the defendant moved to compel arbitration \"shortly after it\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    discovered that the dispute was arbitrable.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329659\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/656/\">\n     56 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    661 n.3 (emphasis in original). Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     Tristar\n    </em>\n    , the defendant \"was simply unaware of the [arbitration] agreement until it was produced in discovery.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Fed.%20Appx.%20462\">\n     97 Fed.Appx. at 465\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, Defendant was aware of the agreement but disputed its validity and argued that the parties' dispute was not subject to arbitration. Furthermore, once he conceded the agreement's validity, he delayed a year before moving to compel arbitration. Consequently, those cases are inapposite.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
