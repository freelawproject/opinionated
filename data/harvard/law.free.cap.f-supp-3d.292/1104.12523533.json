As Managing Director Morse is authorized to make decisions regarding the day-to-day management of the dispensary's operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From November 10, 2015, until March 2016 Plaintiff was employed by Blue Elephant as a part-time \"bud tender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 28, 2016, Ric Leonetti, the manager of the store where Plaintiff worked, held a staff meeting at which he distributed and discussed Blue Elephant's new Employee Handbook. Plaintiff signed an acknowledgment of receipt of the Employee Handbook on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early February 2016 Plaintiff complained to Morse and/or Leonetti about alleged black mold on a vent in the restroom. Plaintiff also sent an instant message to Morse regarding this issue, but Morse denies he received any instant message at that time. Morse asserts he later heard about Plaintiff's mold complaint from Leonetti.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also in February 2016 Plaintiff alleges she made approximately six oral complaints to Morse and/or Leonetti about internal doors being left unlocked or open, the door chime being deactivated, and the safe being left open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the afternoon of February 26, 2016, while Plaintiff and numerous other employees and customers were present, a customer walked behind the sales counter and attempted to open the door to the apothecary where most of the cannabis product is kept. While another employee helped the customer, Plaintiff went to Morse's office, told him that she did not feel safe, and asked Morse to handle the situation. Plaintiff also told Morse that she thought it would be nice if he hired an armed security guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 29, 2016, and March 1, 2016, Morse spoke with attorney Scott Snyder regarding Plaintiff's complaint that she did not feel safe after the customer walked behind the counter. Morse asked Snyder for legal advice regarding his options with respect to Plaintiff. Snyder advised Morse that Oregon is an at-will employment state and that the company could and should terminate Plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 4, 2016, at approximately 10:30 a.m. before the store opened where Plaintiff worked, a music video was streaming to a TV monitor in the dispensary showroom. Plaintiff and four other employees (Cody Brown, Nick Harris, Eliav Cohen, and J. Cody Robertson) were working in the showroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The video is a total of seven minutes and 34 seconds and consists of two parts. The first part depicts a party scene, and the second part is more sexually graphic. Shortly after the second half of the video began to play, Plaintiff objected to the video being played and demanded that her co-workers turn it off. The parties disagree as to the words used and the manner in which Plaintiff stated her objection. As soon as Plaintiff objected to the video, one of her co-workers rushed to the computer controls to turn it off. Blue Elephant's security camera footage shows the video was turned off in less than 30 seconds after Plaintiff complained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the video was turned off, Plaintiff continued yelling at Brown and used profanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Brown was considered the assistant manager of the store. Brown became upset, also yelled and used profanity, and told Plaintiff to leave work. Plaintiff did not leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Brown called Leonetti, who was not at work on the day of this incident, and told him what had happened. Leonetti asked to speak with Plaintiff. In graphic language Plaintiff told Leonetti that she was offended by the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At 10:45 a.m. that same day Leonetti sent a text message to Brown, Cohen, and Morse with the following instructions: \"ONLY THE MENU PLAYS ON THE TV SCREEN. IMMEDIATELY STOP PLAYING ANYTHING THE [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] COULD BE OFFENSIVE TO ANYONE.\" Emphasis in original.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff worked the remainder of her shift on March 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Later in the afternoon on March 4, 2016, Morse again called Snyder to inform him that Plaintiff had complained about sexual comments, conversations, music, and music videos being displayed in the dispensary. Morse told Snyder about the incident that had occurred with the video that morning, including Plaintiff's response and behavior during and after the incident. Morse asked Snyder for legal advice and reassurance as to what he should do with respect to Plaintiff. Snyder reiterated his advice to Morse to terminate Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 4, 2016, at 4:19 p.m. Morse sent the following text message to Leonetti: \"I have been advised by our attorney to terminate Cheryls [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] employment. If you care to discuss it please call me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff worked on March 5, 2016, but she was not scheduled to work on March 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 7, 2016, Plaintiff arrived at work at approximately 9:35 a.m., immediately handed an envelope to Leonetti, and told him that it was her \"incident report and formal sexual harassment complaint.\" The written complaint set out her safety concerns arising from the customer walking behind the dispensary counter on February 26, 2016, and alleged sexual harassment, a hostile work environment, and discriminatory conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Leonetti took the papers to his office and began to review them. After a few minutes Leonetti called Plaintiff into his office. There is a dispute as to the details of this conversation, but the parties agree Leonetti told Plaintiff to go home for the day. The parties also agree Leonetti was the sole decision-maker to send Plaintiff home from work on the morning of March 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 7, 2016, at 11:22 a.m. after Plaintiff had gone home, she sent an email titled \"Formal Sexual harassment &amp; Hostile Work Environment Complaint # 2\" to Leonetti and others, including Morse. Plaintiff reiterated her earlier complaints; stated Leonetti had retaliated against her by sending her home that morning after she submitted her written complaints; and asked that Leonetti, Brown, Harris, and Cohen immediately resign or be terminated. Plaintiff also asked for her email to be forwarded to Morse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Morse reviewed Plaintiff's written incident reports and complaints, he called Snyder to update him on the situation and again asked for his advice on how to proceed. Leonetti was present and heard at least part of the telephone call. Morse told Snyder about Plaintiff's written complaints and asked Snyder whether that changed Snyder's advice in any way. Snyder again told Morse that Oregon is an \"at-will employment state\" and advised Morse to terminate Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 7, 2016, at 12:47 p.m. Morse called Plaintiff and left her a voicemail asking to talk with her about her complaints and what had transpired that\n   morning. At 5:18 p.m. Plaintiff returned Morse's call and left him a voicemail. At 5:40 p.m. Morse returned Plaintiff's call. Plaintiff recorded the telephone call with Morse. During the conversation Morse terminated Plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Aside from Snyder providing legal advice and recommending termination, the parties agree Morse was the sole decision-maker and that he made the decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment on March 7, 2016. The parties also agree Morse was acting within the course and scope of his authority as an owner and Managing Director of Blue Elephant when he terminated Plaintiff's employment, and, as the Managing Director of Blue Elephant, Morse had the authority to make the decision to terminate Plaintiff without first consulting the Board of Directors or any other owner or manager of Blue Elephant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On March 8, 2016, at 2:59 p.m. after speaking with a different attorney, Morse sent an email to Plaintiff and rescinded her termination. Morse placed Plaintiff on paid administrative leave pending an investigation of her complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 8 and 9, 2016, Blue Elephant issued written disciplinary actions to Brown, Harris, Cohen, and Leonetti regarding the video incident and Plaintiff's complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 10, 2016, Plaintiff sent an email to Morse and attached copies of all of her written incident reports and complaints and provided a link to the song lyrics and a link to the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 18, 2016, Defendants' attorney sent an email to Plaintiff's attorney and notified him that the investigation was complete and that Plaintiff would be placed back on the work schedule for shifts beginning March 22, 2016, at 12:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff did not return to work on March 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On March 22, 2016, Defendants' attorney sent an email to Plaintiff's attorney and described the remedial efforts that Blue Elephant had taken in response to Plaintiff's complaints and notified him that Plaintiff was on unpaid administrative leave effective that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Morse sent Plaintiff her final paycheck in which she was paid for her actual hours worked during the week of March 1-5, 2016, and her average of 20 hours per week for the weeks of March 6-12 and March 13-19, 2016. Plaintiff did not return to work after March 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Throughout her employment with Blue Elephant Plaintiff earned $10 per hour and worked an average of 20 hours per week. The parties agree Plaintiff did not suffer any economic loss or damages between March 7, 2016, and March 22, 2016. Moreover, Plaintiff does not seek recovery of any economic damages other than lost wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The parties agree after Plaintiff's employment with Blue Elephant ended in March 2016, Plaintiff did not seek employment until May 31, 2016, and she applied for only eight jobs between that date and December 4, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On May 17, 2016, Plaintiff filed a charge of unlawful employment practices with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, Civil Rights Division (BOLI), and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On October 21, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court against Defendants. Plaintiff alleged claims for retaliation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) and Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 659A.030(1)(f) and 654.053(5) and claims for retaliation for whistleblowing pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 659A.199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On November 22, 2016, Defendants filed a Notice of Removal in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington Mut.

Morse also contends he is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims against him for aiding and abetting on the ground that such a claim cannot apply to him because he was the sole decision-maker.

On March 6, 2016, however, Plaintiff came to work at her scheduled time and presented Leonetti with her written complaints. Leonetti took Plaintiff's complaints to his office and began to review them. A few minutes later Leonetti called Plaintiff into his office. Although the parties disagree as to the details of the conversation between Plaintiff and Leonetti, the parties agree Leonetti told Plaintiff to go home for the day. Leonetti communicated Plaintiff's complaints to Morse. On March 7, 2016, Morse terminated Plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants contend their actions do not constitute an adverse employment action\n   because Leonetti did not suspend Plaintiff but instead sent her home \"because she was not in a good place to help the customers or the business,\" and \"if she, in fact, felt threatened, then the best place for her would to [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] not be there.\" Defendants further contend Plaintiff's termination on March 7, 2016, lasted less than 24 hours, and she was shortly placed on paid administrative leave pending further investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On this record the Court concludes the Plaintiff has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that Defendants' conduct after Plaintiff complained about sexual harassment and workplace safety constituted adverse employment actions that were reasonably likely to deter Plaintiff and other employees from complaining in the future about such conditions in the workplace. Accordingly, the Court concludes as a matter of law that the actions of Leonetti and Morse constitute adverse employment actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiff also contends Defendants have not shown reasonable reliance on advice of counsel, and, therefore, this is an issue for a jury in determining motivation for Defendants' actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Morse testified he first spoke to his attorney regarding Plaintiff on February 29, 2016, about Plaintiff's safety complaints arising from the customer incident on February 26, 2016. Morse next talked to his attorney on March 1, 2016, and told the attorney that he had not terminated Plaintiff's employment because Plaintiff's complaints were not \"egregious enough at that point to terminate her.\" According to Morse, the attorney referred to Plaintiff as \"a troublemaker\" and advised Morse to terminate her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Morse testified he had not made any decision to terminate Plaintiff's employment as of March 3, 2016. Morse also testified he would not have terminated Plaintiff on March 4, 2016, if she had not complained \"because other people would have complained about what transpired that day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Morse further testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q. Was it solely because of [the attorney]'s advice that you terminated [Plaintiff]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A. Well, yeah, it was solely based on his advice that I could do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q. And did you have a desire to terminate [Plaintiff] if you got his statement that you could do so?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. I don't think so. As I've stated here ... I didn't think it was fair to terminate her until I'd received her side of the story,\n   <em>\n    et cetera.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   You know, even getting her on the phone, I think I was hoping for her to be less, you know, curt, and maybe a little more-I don't think \"conciliatory\" is the right word, but to help find a way that we could work this out where she would feel that she has a safe work environment and something within reason that would be doable by me. But the tone and tenor of how the conversation began, and whatnot, kind of led me to believe that that's not-wasn't possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. If I understand you correctly, at the beginning of the conversation, you had not made the decision yet to terminate, but by the end of the conversation, you had?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. Well, I'd made the decision that it was possible for me to terminate her but would like to-would like to work something out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court notes there is not current binding precedent that establishes the advice of counsel is a complete defense to a retaliation claim. Instead the advice of counsel is merely one factor to consider when making a determination of a causal connection between the adverse action and the employer's motivation.

Here, it was entirely reasonable for an employer in the City's legal circumstances to follow the advice of counsel....\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Although there is some evidence in this case that Defendants believed they had the right to terminate Plaintiff's employment based on the advice of counsel, it is not clear that the decision to do so was based solely on that advice. Defendants assert other factors were taken into consideration such as Plaintiff's personal hygiene, her on-going note-taking, and her unreasonable demands regarding the video incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On this record the Court concludes there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the causation between the adverse employment action and Defendants' motivation.

Plaintiff alleges Morse is individually liable pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 659A.030(1)(g)\"as an aider and abettor\" because he \"acted to help, assist, or facilitate the commission of the unlawful employment practices alleged ..., promoted the accomplishment thereof, helped in advancing or bringing them about or in encouraging, counseling or inciting as to their commission.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The parties agree the following are the three specific retaliatory acts on which Plaintiff's claims are based: (1) Brown directed Plaintiff to leave work on March 4, 2016; (2) Leonetti sent Plaintiff home from work on the morning of March 7, 2016; and (3) Morse terminated Plaintiff's employment on March 7, 2016. The parties do not dispute Morse was the sole decision-maker who acted within the course and scope of his authority as an owner and as the Managing Director of Blue Elephant when he terminated Plaintiff's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

On June 9, 2017, the Court resolved Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Plaintiff requested an extension until June 30, 2017, to provide responses to Defendants' May 25, 2017, discovery requests. Defendants agreed to an extension to July 7, 2017, for Plaintiff to respond to Defendants' interrogatories and request for production, but they did not agree to an extension regarding the requests for admission. Also on June 29, 2017, Plaintiff served her Responses to Defendants' Request for Admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   On July 11, 2017, Plaintiff produced 2,057 documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   On July 12, 2017, Plaintiff served her Response to Defendants' Second Set of Interrogatories and Second Request for Production of Documents.

The Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(d) allows the Court to order sanctions when a party fails to respond to discovery requests. The sanctions the Court may order include prohibiting admission of evidence, striking pleadings, or dismissing an action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2). Only a finding of \"willfulness, bad faith, and fault\" will justify a sanction of terminating an action.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   The promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ushered in a new era of federal litigation, directed to the goal of securing \"the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. It would be reasonable to expect, in light of all the applicable rules and governing precedents, that experienced attorneys, especially those who have handled major litigation, would be able to proceed through the discovery and pretrial stages with a conciliatory attitude and a minimum of obstruction, and that, under the guiding hand of the district court, the path to ultimate disposition would be a relatively smooth one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <em>\n    Grider v. Keystone Health Plan Cent., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056109\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/580/119/#p123\">\n    580 F.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (3d Cir. 2009). This Court agrees with the Sixth Circuit's sentiments, which are applicable in this case to both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The record reflects Plaintiff has been dilatory in responding to requests for discovery. Plaintiff attempts to justify her conduct based on the \"scorched earth\" litigation tactics of the Defendants and Plaintiff's lack of support staff to meet Defendants' \"disproportional\" discovery demands. Plaintiff, however, has not sought an order from the Court to protect her from \"annoyance, ... oppression, or undue burden or expense\" pursuant to Rule 26(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Similarly, although the parties have tried to resolve some of their disputes without the Court's intervention, Defendants have not filed any motion to compel production by Plaintiff nor asked for a continuance of the discovery deadline or the deadline to file dispositive motions in order to complete and to review discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court set specific deadlines for the filing of discovery motions and encouraged the parties to contact the Court to resolve discovery disputes informally. In addition, the parties were aware of discovery deadlines and the necessity to complete discovery in a timely fashion. Thus, Defendants cannot now complain that Plaintiff has not complied with discovery deadlines when Defendants allowed extensions without taking any action when the extensions were not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In the exercise of its discretion, the Court concludes dismissal of this action is not warranted as a sanction. The Court also concludes other alternative sanctions requested by Defendants are unwarranted with the exception of the Defendants' request for the opportunity to depose Plaintiff further. The Court will allow Defendants to depose Plaintiff for an additional two hours regarding only those documents produced at the time or subsequent to her earlier deposition. The Court also directs the parties to complete Plaintiff's continued deposition\n   <strong>\n    no later than November 30, 2017\n   </strong>\n   . The Court will not entertain any further fact-discovery disputes between the parties, and all deadlines previously set by the Court remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   For these reasons the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, and, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Second, Third, and Fourth Claims against Defendant Donald Morse. In addition, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Discovery Sanctions except as noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
