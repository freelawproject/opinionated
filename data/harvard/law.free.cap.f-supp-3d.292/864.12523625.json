No. 50) for judgment on the pleadings on Count III (Mark Dilution) by defendant TruNorth Warranty Plans of North America, LLC (TN Warranty). Plaintiffs TrueNorth Companies, L.C., and TrueNorth Principals, L.C. (collectively TrueNorth), have filed a resistance (Doc. No. 51) and TN Warranty has filed a reply (Doc. No. 54). I find that oral argument is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TrueNorth filed its original complaint (Doc. No. 2) on March 28, 2017, alleging two counts of trademark infringement, one count of mark dilution, one count of false designation of origin and one count of mark infringement under Iowa law based on the parties' respective design logos:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs':\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 8, 2017, defendants (at that time consisting of TN Warranty and its sole member, William Eskridge) filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 20. I granted the motion as to\n   defendant Eskridge and denied it as to TN Warranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 3, 2017, TrueNorth filed a motion (Doc. No. 42) to amend its complaint. Chief United States Magistrate Judge C.J. Williams granted the motion on November 27, 2017, and the amended complaint was filed that same day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 43 and 44. The amended complaint alleges two new counts: Count VI for false advertising under the Lanham Act and Count VII for unfair competition under the Lanham Act and common law. The parties then submitted a joint motion (Doc. No. 47) for revised deadlines, which Judge Williams granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 47, 48. TN Warranty filed its answer (Doc. No. 49) to the amended complaint and the instant motion (Doc. No. 50) on December 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following allegations from TrueNorth's amended complaint (Doc. No. 44) are relevant to Count III and TN Warranty's motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   13. TrueNorth has consistently used the word \"TrueNorth\" and two specific logo designs in commerce in connection with its business since its inception in 2000. Specifically, TrueNorth's first use in commerce of the trade word \"TrueNorth\" and its logo with the \"TrueNorth\" name and compass design was on September 1, 2000. TrueNorth's first use in commerce of an \"N\" with a compass design was on November 1, 2000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   14. TrueNorth has spent considerable resources developing and utilizing its TrueNorth mark and the two logo designs. Since establishing the brand in 2001, TrueNorth has invested well over $30 million in marketing efforts to strengthen the TrueNorth brand, both locally and nationally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   15. The TrueNorth national brand is well-known and recognized in the transportation industry as a leader in insurance and financial strategies, as evidenced by TrueNorth's partnerships with some of the nation's leading motor carriers, as well as TrueNorth's work with transportation associations such as the American Trucking Association (ATA) &amp; Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   16. By virtue of extensive advertising and sales of its services thereunder, TrueNorth's marks have become well and favorably known to the public and have become valuable symbols of TrueNorth's business and goodwill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   17. The services provided under TrueNorth's Trademarks include, among others, the offering of insurance coverages and other specialized products and services to commercial transportation companies as well as individual drivers, most of which are related to risk reduction. Certain coverages provide protection against damage to property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Doc. No. 44 at 3-4. TrueNorth also alleges it has three marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. TRUENORTH'S PROCEDURAL OBJECTIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties disagree about whether the motion may be decided under either Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), or whether it is procedurally barred by Rule 12(g)(2). The motion is titled as a motion \"for judgment on the pleadings on Count III.\" Doc. No. 50. A motion for judgment on the pleadings is governed by Rule 12(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). However, TN Warranty's\n   motion and brief both invoke Rule 12(b)(6), which addresses a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In its reply, TN Warranty argues that I can grant its motion under either Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   TrueNorth argues that the motion is procedurally improper for several reasons. First, because TN Warranty previously moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2), TrueNorth argues that the present motion is precluded under Rule 12(g)(2). That rule requires parties to bring all Rule 12(b) motions together to avoid piecemeal pre-answer motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2) (\"Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\"). Second, TrueNorth argues that I cannot enter judgment on the pleadings because the pleadings are not closed. It points out that TN Warranty did not answer the allegations pertaining to Count III but instead stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   TNWarranty is moving to dismiss Count III for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) such that no answer is required at this time. To the extent any of the allegations in Paragraphs 88 to 103 contain allegations of fact relevant to other counts, TNWarranty denies the allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Doc. No. 49 at 21. Finally, TrueNorth argues that TN Warranty's motion is untimely because the amended complaint did not reset the time for bringing Rule 12(b) motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I agree that this motion is not ripe under Rule 12(c) for judgment on the pleadings, as TN Warranty expressly declined to answer the allegations set forth in Count III. Rule 12(c) states that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but early enough not to delay trial a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). As to Count III, the pleadings are not closed. Therefore, I must determine whether the motion may be considered under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   TN Warranty has already filed a motion under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction. The amended complaint makes no changes with regard to Count III. Rule 12(g)(2) states that \"[e]xcept as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under [ Rule 12 ] must not make another motion under [ Rule 12 ] raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\" Rules 12(h)(2) and 12(h)(3) provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    When to Raise Others.\n   </em>\n   Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (B) by a motion under Rule 12(c) ; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (C) at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3)\n   <em>\n    Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction.\n   </em>\n   If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h). TN Warranty's motion does not fall under either exception to successive motions under Rule 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While TN Warranty's motion is procedurally improper under Rule 12(c) (due to the lack of an answer to Count III) and Rule 12(b)(6) (due to the prohibition of successive motions as described in Rule 12(g)(2) ), I find it would be inconsistent with the spirit of Rule 1 to deny the motion on these grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 (stating the rules \"should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy,\n   and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding.\"). District courts in other jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion when faced with these circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Rule 12(g) is designed to avoid repetitive motion practice, delay, and ambush tactics. If the Court were to evade the merits of Defendants'... defenses here, Defendants would be required to file answers within 14 days of this Order. They would presumably assert [the same defenses] in those answers. Defendants would then file Rule 12(c) motions, the parties would repeat the briefing they have already undertaken, and the Court would have to address the same questions in several months. That is not the intended effect of Rule 12(g), and the result would be a contradiction of Rule 1's mandate[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Countrywide Fin.

More detailed factual allegations are necessary to establish that its mark is plausibly famous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The second factor to consider is the \"amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(ii). TrueNorth alleges that it has offices in six states, provides financial and insurance services to a wide variety of client types across the United States and services clients around the country. Doc.

It provides no further details regarding the \"amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under [its] mark.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(ii).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231472\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/75/848/#p857\">\n    75 F.Supp.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding plausible trademark dilution claim where plaintiff alleged it had over half a million members and the nation's largest towing fleet);\n   <em>\n    VISA Int'l Servs. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3180946\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/590/1306/#p1315\">\n    590 F.Supp.2d at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alleging that in 2006, VISA brand cards were used in $1.3 trillion of U.S. sales and were accepted at more than 6.3 million locations in the United States);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parts.com, LLC v.

Cal. 2013) (fact that plaintiff was the source of 20 million automotive replacement parts was insufficient to establish fame as allegations did not specify how many parts it sells per year, what its annual sales revenue is or where the sales are made). Again, TrueNorth's allegations are vague and do not establish the plausibility that its mark is famous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The third factor is the extent of the actual recognition of the mark.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(iii). TrueNorth alleges its brand is well-known and recognized in the transportation industry, as evidenced by its partnerships with some of the nation's leading motor carriers and transportation associations. Doc. No. 44 at 3. Besides being conclusory, this allegation is insufficient because a mark's fame must go beyond a niche market, such as the transportation industry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parts.com, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928553\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/996/933/#p940\">\n    996 F.Supp.2d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating \"[a]lthough a household name brand like Coca-Cola likely could simply allege that it is 'famous and well-known,' Parts.com does not have this kind of consumer cachet\" and requires more detailed factual allegations regarding actual recognition). This factor also fails to establish that the TrueNorth mark is plausibly famous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The fourth factor considers whether the mark is registered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(iv). While TrueNorth alleges it has three registered trademarks with the USPTO, this factor alone is insufficient to establish plausibility as to TrueNorth's fame for purposes of its trademark dilution claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coach Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048644\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1356/#p1371\">\n    668 F.3d at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[o]ne cannot logically infer fame from the fact that a mark is one of the millions on the Federal Register.\"). In sum, TrueNorth's allegations, if true, would support the mark's fame only with regard to a niche market and not the \"general consuming public.\" Therefore, I find that dismissal is appropriate with regard to Count III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI.
