BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Yung-Kai Lu, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. In 2015, Lu was the lucky winner of the \"visa lottery\" for lawful admission to the United States. Yet his victory proved hollow, as he was never granted a visa. Lu then brought this suit alleging that this 2015 visa deprivation was based on unreasonable delays on the part of the State Department, as well as on other unconnected events. As relief, Plaintiff asked this Court to compel Defendant Secretary of State to extend the time for a visa interview for his 2015 application. In now moving to dismiss, the Government asserts that it can do no such thing. According to Defendant, once the 2015 fiscal year expired, so too did the statutory authority for the issuance of Lu's Diversity Visa. State argues both that Plaintiff's claims are thus moot, thereby depriving this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, and that his statutory causes of action fail to adequately state a claim for relief. As the case is indeed moot, the Court will dismiss it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Complaint, which the Court must credit at this stage, Plaintiff entered the Department of State's Diversity Visa (DV) program for fiscal year 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Fiscal year 2015 ran from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 1. Lu had previously resided in the United States and had applied (to no avail) for a Diversity Visa since 2002. His 2015 application, however, proved auspicious. Although there is an apparent inconsistency between the Complaint and the record evidence as to when Lu was notified that his application had been chosen,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 20 (stating that Lu was notified in \"early October 2015\" that he was selected);\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2, Exh. 1 (Notification Letter) (letter notifying Lu of selection dated May 1, 2014), there is no dispute that he was in fact an FY 2015 selectee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In any event, the State Department notification letter informed Plaintiff that he had been selected out of the FY 2015 applicant pool for \"further processing,\" but cautioned that \"selection [did] not guarantee that [he would] receive a visa.\" Notification Letter. The letter went on to provide a series of instructions for Lu to follow \"to increase [his] chances of possible visa issuance,\" which included registering with the online DS-260 Immigrant Visa and Registration Application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Department informed Lu that his case would \"not be scheduled for an interview appointment until a visa number is available,\" and that, were an interview to be scheduled, Lu would receive notification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lu submitted his DS-260, but never received notification of an interview. (The Court notes that, although both Plaintiff and Defendant state that Lu submitted the DS-260 visa application form in October\n   <em>\n    2015\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 20; MTD at 3, the record suggests that it was in fact submitted on October 30,\n   <em>\n    2014\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2 (DS-290 Application).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A year later, between the fall of 2015 and June 2016, Lu wrote to the U.S. Attorney General and the State Department alleging that he had been unfairly treated and unlawfully deprived of his 2015 visa. Specifically, he claimed that he had been denied a Diversity Visa for the 2015 fiscal year because of \"technical\" issues and \"computer system glitches.\" Compl., \u00b6 22. In response to his inquiries, Lu received a July 2016 letter from the State Department stating that the \"DV program for fiscal year 2015 is closed, and winning entries from that year are no longer eligible for processing.\" ECF No. 1-2, Exh. 2 (State Dept. Letter).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 24, 2017, Lu filed suit in this Court, alleging that he had \"suffered the loss of his permanent visa interview to obtain [a] green card\" because Defendant \"did not appropriately and lawfully take [its] mandatory duties to execute and process applications under the 2015 Diversity Immigration Visa Program.\" Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. His Complaint attributes the 2015 delay to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"cyber terrorist attacks or other computer glitches,\" \"the earthquake in Nepal in 2014,\" and the State Department's \"new computing systems to operate [the] visa lottery interview.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2, Exh. 3 (assortment of news articles discussing 2015 technical issues with State Department visa processing). Construing Lu's Complaint liberally, as it must, the Court can discern three possible statutory bases for his claims. It appears that Plaintiff is alleging that, in failing to promptly process his application and grant an interview, the Government violated the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8, 29, 37.

A visa granted under the system enables the recipient to move to the United States as a lawful permanent resident, and thus to live and work legally in this county.

According to Defendant, \"[T]he\n   period of Plaintiff's eligibility for the DV lapsed as of September 30, 2015,\" and there is \"no legal authority for the [Government] to issue a [Diversity Visa] after the end of the relevant fiscal year.\" MTD at 3. In other words, as there is no viable route to the relief Lu seeks, the Court must dismiss his claims as moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172056\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/404/244/#p246\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lu responds that his suit is alive and well. He relies, in large part, on his general contention that the \"Department of State\n   <em>\n    could\"\n   </em>\n   have \"finish[ed] all interviews\" for the 2015 fiscal year, and that the delays in visa processing were the result of internal technical difficulties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., \u00b6 28 (emphasis added).

He additionally cites to the Court's jurisdiction under the APA to review \"final\" agency actions, asserting that because \"Department of State admitted their action of process[ing] [the] DV lottery is final,\" the Court has jurisdiction to review its delay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45. Finally, Lu cites to a number of cases addressing federal courts' jurisdiction over the Government's failure to timely adjudicate an application for \"adjustment of status\"-an immigration process distinct from the granting of a Diversity Visa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Unfortunately for Lu, the Government's position is correct. No matter the merits of Plaintiff's application or the existence of an underlying duty to timely adjudicate it, this Court cannot act if the remedy he seeks is illusory. Examining the immigration laws governing the Diversity Visa program, the Court concludes that it has no authority to order relief for Lu's claims arising from his 2015 DV application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The INA provides that applicants who are selected under the lottery system \"shall remain eligible to receive [a DV] visa only through the end of the specific fiscal year for which they were selected.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(I)(ii)(II).

Plainly stated, the mandamus and declaratory relief sought by Lu-the\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   processing of his Diversity Visa application after\n   the relevant fiscal year-is statutorily barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   That conclusion is not altered, moreover, by the fact that Lu had completed certain steps toward fulfilling his requirements for selection.

In that case, conversely, the plaintiff had made it significantly further through the process than Lu: he had been interviewed by U.S. consular officers, had submitted additional documentation, had completed a follow-up interview, and had even been informed that \"there [were] no reasons to deny [his] visa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715455\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/571/127/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715455\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/571/127/\">\n    at 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The September 30th deadline passed, however, and no visa was issued. The plaintiff then brought suit, alleging that the State Department had unreasonably delayed processing his Diversity Visa application and had thus deprived him of his chance for legal residency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As in the instant case, the Government cried mootness. The court agreed, finding that the plain language of the INA meant \"that as of 12:00 a.m. on October 1, 2007, [plaintiff] was no longer eligible to receive a diversity visa.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715455\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/571/127/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715455\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/571/127/\">\n    at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
