THOMAS MARTEN, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company (\"Brotherhood\") seeks a determination of its liability under insurance policies it issued to Community Christian Church of Independence, Kansas (hereinafter \"Community Christian\" or \"the church\"). In two related lawsuits filed in state court, minors M.M. and J.J. claimed they were sexually abused by Steven Butler, a pastor at Community Christian, and they sought damages from Butler, the church, and, in J.J.'s case, from a group of individuals identified as church elders. Brotherhood contends its coverage for these claims is capped by a $300,000 limit in a Sexual Acts Endorsement, and that its duty to defend the church and the elders terminated upon Brotherhood's payment of $300,000. The defendants, on the other hand, contend Brotherhood's coverage is subject to a $1,000,000 limit, and that Brotherhood's duty to defend is ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matter is now before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment. The court also has before it Brotherhood's motion for default judgment against Steven Butler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although oral argument was requested in this case, the issues presented are questions of law concerning construction of an insurance contract and the court concludes that oral argument would not assist in deciding the issues presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Uncontroverted Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Community Christian Church hired Steven Butler as a pastor in 2004. In 2012, defendant M.M., a minor, alleged in a state-court lawsuit that Butler sexually abused him from 2006 to 2010 while Butler was a pastor at Community Christian. M.M. asserted claims against Butler and against Community Christian, including: Count I-battery against Butler; Count II-intentional infliction of emotional distress against Butler; Count III-negligent infliction of emotional distress against Community Christian (including allegations\n   that the church, through its elders, authorized or ratified Butler's conduct and knew or should have known he was engaging in inappropriate conduct with minors); Count IV-negligent supervision against the church; and Count V-negligent hiring and retention against the church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant J.J., a minor, and his mother A.K., filed a similar suit in state court in 2016 against Butler, Community Christian, and a group of individuals identified as church elders. J.J. alleged sexual abuse by Butler from approximately 2006 to 2010. The claims in that suit included: Count I-battery/sexual abuse against Butler; Count II-defamation against Butler, the church, and the elders, based on allegations that after J.J.'s mother reported the abuse to the church, Butler spoke from the pulpit to the congregation and claimed that J.J. and his mother were \"liars\" and were trying to obtain financial gain; Count III-negligent supervision against the church and the elders for failing to supervise Butler; Count IV-negligent supervision against the church and elders for failing to supervise minor parishioners; Count V-negligent infliction of emotional distress; Count VI-negligent false detention or imprisonment, based upon allegations that during one incident Butler locked a door and would not allow J.J. to leave or J.J.'s mother to enter. The last incidents of sexual abuse alleged by J.J. and M.M. occurred in 2009 or early 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Butler was criminally charged with sexually molesting M.M. and J.J. in\n   <em>\n    State v. Butler\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-CR-1961, in Montgomery County, Kansas. A jury convicted Butler of aggravated criminal sodomy of J.J., but acquitted him of criminal charges with respect to M.M. Butler received a life sentence without the possibility of parole until after 25 years. The Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed Butler's conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The $300,000 has been distributed to M.M., J.J., and A.K., pursuant to an order of the Crawford County District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brotherhood issued two policies to Community Christian. The first policy was effective from December 24, 2004, to December 24, 2007. The second policy was effective from December 24, 2007, to December 24, 2010. Both policies were numbered 15M5A0289744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Each policy provides commercial liability coverage under form GL-100, for a General Occurrence Limit of $1,000,000, and a General Aggregate Limit of $6,000,000. The policies also provide additional coverage under BGL-63, BGL-81, and BGL-65 for Counseling Acts, Directors &amp; Officers coverage, and Religious Communication, in the same amounts as the commercial liability. The policies also provide additional coverage through a Sexual Acts Endorsement under form BGL-61, which is subject to a $300,000 coverage limit, and a $300,000 coverage aggregate limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The declarations page states that the coverages listed are subject to the terms of the designated coverage forms. It states that only one liability coverage and one medical coverage will apply to an occurrence and any related loss. It states that any limit which is specifically stated within a coverage form or endorsement is the most that Brotherhood will pay for the coverage to which such limits applies, and\n   it refers to BGL-11 for application of limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Form GL-100 Commercial Liability Coverage Form\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The policies include form GL-100, which sets forth terms and conditions for general liability coverage. Under \"Principal Coverage L-Bodily Injury/Property Damage,\" Brotherhood promised to pay all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages due to bodily injury to which the insurance applies. The bodily injury must have resulted from an occurrence, which according to the policy means an accident and includes repeated exposure to similar conditions. The policy defined bodily injury to mean bodily harm, sickness or disease sustained by a person, but not mental or emotional injury, suffering, or distress that does not result from a physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The policy defined\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   (in part) to mean \"you and all of your executive officers and directors, but only while acting within the scope of their duties....\" The term also included \"\n   <strong>\n    your employees\n   </strong>\n   , for acts within the scope of their employment by\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Form GL-100 provides, under a Section titled \"How Much We Pay,\" that the \"\n   <strong>\n    limits\n   </strong>\n   , shown on the\n   <strong>\n    declarations\n   </strong>\n   ... are the most\n   <strong>\n    we\n   </strong>\n   pay regardless of the number of: a.\n   <strong>\n    Insureds\n   </strong>\n   under the Commercial Liability Coverage; b. persons ... who sustain injury or damage; or c. claims made or suits brought.\" It provides that the \"Each Occurrence Limit\" is the most Brotherhood will pay for the total of damages under Coverages L, N, and O, and medical expenses under Coverage M, due to bodily injury arising out of a single occurrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Form GL-100 contains a condition entitled \"Separate Insureds,\" which states that coverage under Commercial Liability Coverage applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is made, and that this does not affect the limits stated in the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Form GL-100 includes the following concerning Brotherhood's duty to provide a defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DEFENSE COVERAGE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Payments under this coverage are in addition to the limits for the Commercial Liability Coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    We\n   </strong>\n   have the right and duty to defend a suit seeking\n   <strong>\n    damages\n   </strong>\n   which may be covered under the Commercial Liability Coverage.\n   <strong>\n    We\n   </strong>\n   may make investigations and settle claims or suits we decide are appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    We\n   </strong>\n   do not have to provide defense after we have paid an amount equal to the\n   <strong>\n    limit\n   </strong>\n   as the result of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   a. a judgment; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   b. a written settlement agreed to by\n   <strong>\n    us\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Liability and Medical Coverage Form (BGL-11)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The policies include form BGL-11, which is captioned \"Liability and Medical Coverage Form,\" and which provides additional definitions, terms, and exclusions.

The same is true with respect to claims that the sexual abuse was caused by the church's or elders' failure to supervise children in their care. All of these claims assert that sexual acts caused M.M. or J.J. to suffer loss and that unreasonable omissions or acts by the church and elders caused or contributed to the loss. Such claims are clearly and unambiguously excluded from coverage by the language of the exclusion.

The Brotherhood exclusion refers not only to loss arising directly or indirectly out of a sexual act, or in connection with a sexual act, but also makes clear the exclusion\n   applies notwithstanding \"other\n   <em>\n    causes\n   </em>\n   or events that contribute to or aggravate the loss\"(emphasis added), whether such causes occur before, during, or after the sexual act. The exclusion thus rules out coverage for claims that other causes produced or contributed to the loss from a sexual act. See Dkt. 32-3 at 120 (\"We do not pay for\n   <strong>\n    loss\n   </strong>\n   of any kind if one or more of the following excluded causes or events apply to the\n   <strong>\n    loss\n   </strong>\n   , regardless of other causes or events that contribute to ... the\n   <strong>\n    loss\n   </strong>\n   , whether such causes or events act to produce the\n   <strong>\n    loss\n   </strong>\n   before, at the same time as, or after the excluded cause or event.\"). These terms would clearly indicate to a reasonable insured that a claim that the church caused or produced loss from a sexual act by negligently hiring or supervising an employee falls within the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Where the policy itself limits coverage by reference to the\n   <em>\n    cause\n   </em>\n   of the loss, the court cannot rewrite the policy by invoking a rule of law that \"Kansas does not look to the underlying cause of the injury\" to determine coverage. The cardinal rule of interpretation is that \"if the policy language is clear and unambiguous, it must be construed in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense and according to the sense and meaning of the terms used.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner v.

These claims are barred by the sexual acts exclusion, as they are arise out of sexual acts as defined by the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32-1 at 4 (alleging Butler acted \"with intent to make physical contact ... for purposes of his own sexual gratification\" and that he engaged in \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual abuse\"). Coverage for these claims, insofar as Butler is concerned, is also excluded by the intentional/willful act exclusion of the policy. Count III alleges that the church and its elders negligently inflicted emotional distress upon M.M. through various actions, including by failing to supervise Butler and failing to safeguard minors in the church's care. Count IV makes similar allegations in support of a claim against the church for negligent supervision. Count V alleges negligent hiring and retention by the church, which allegedly \"caused [M.M.] to suffer injuries as set forth\"-i.e., injuries resulting from sexual acts. All of these claims \"arise out of or in connection with\" sexual acts, as Butler's alleged sexual abuse is alleged to have been a product of the church's and elders' negligence. The same conclusion applies with respect to similar claims by J.J., including Count I (sexual abuse and battery), Count III (negligent supervision of pastor), Count IV (negligent supervision of children), Count V (negligent infliction of emotional distress); and Count VI (negligent false detention or imprisonment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The court finds that J.J.'s and A.K.'s claim for defamation in Count II stands on a different footing.

The injury from Butler's alleged sexual acts was complete and actionable by the time Butler decided to address defendants' credibility and motives in a sermon. Like the tortious interference claim in\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas. Co., supra\n   </em>\n   , this claim is reasonably regarded as being independent of the underlying excluded event.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201788422\">\n    2009 Wl 1788422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (\"Each claim has its own, distinct elements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Barring a claim for personal injury that \"arises out of\" or \"in connection with\" a sexual act suggests that there must be some causal connection between the two, but the exclusion does not explain what that connection must be. The terms can reasonably be construed as allowing coverage for an act of defamation if it causes a loss that is separate and distinct from the claimed loss from a sexual act. The fact that the subject of the defamatory statements in this case included the reported sexual acts, meaning the claimants might have to prove Butler's statements about the sexual acts were false, does not necessarily make this claim one for loss \"arising out of\" or \"in connection with\" a sexual act. The loss from the alleged sexual acts is logically and legally distinct from loss caused by Butler by defaming the defendants in a sermon. The alleged loss from the defamation occurred separately, independently and remotely from the alleged sexual acts, and allegedly caused harm to defendants' reputation and standing that was not caused by the sexual acts. If Brotherhood intended to exclude such an apparently independent claim from coverage, it was obligated to do so more clearly than by ambiguously excluding claims \"arising out of\" or \"in connection with\" a sexual act. The court concludes this claim is not unambiguously excluded by the sexual acts exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court also concludes J.J. and A.K. have met their burden to show that the defamation claim is covered under the Personal Injury liability component of the Church Organization additional coverage. This coverage provides in part that Brotherhood will pay all sums that the church, its leaders, or its employees \"become legally obligated to pay as\n   <strong>\n    damages\n   </strong>\n   due to\n   <strong>\n    personal injury\n   </strong>\n   to which this coverage applies.\" To be covered, the events causing injury \"must arise out of the religious ... operations\" of the church. The policy defines \"personal injury\" to mean injury arising out of \"oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person ... or that violates a person's right of privacy,\" but it does not include \"injury arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with any sexual act.\" Dkt. 32-4 at 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Brotherhood again argues the sexual acts exclusion in BGL-11 (including the above definition of personal injury) bars the claim. Dkt. 32 at 46-47. For the reasons indicated above, however, the court finds the exclusion does not bar this claim in clear and unambiguous terms. Brotherhood also argues the claim is not covered because the policy states that personal injury \"does not include 'bodily injury,' 'property damage,' 'emotional injury,' or 'financial damage' of any kind.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. But Brotherhood does not explain what \"personal injury\" does cover, and the coverage for injury from a libel presumably covers something-such as injury to reputation. In sum, the court finds J.J.'s and A.K.'s claim for defamation against the church and/or the elders may be covered by the policy's Personal Injury Liability Additional Coverage for Church Organizations,\n   and is subject to a $1,000,000 coverage limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Duty to Defend.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Brotherhood argues its duty to defend ended with its payment of $300,000 under the policy's Sexual Acts Coverage, because Brotherhood \"has exhausted all available coverage available for the claims in the Underlying Lawsuits.\" Dkt. 32 at 54. The court rejects that argument with respect to the claims by J.J. and A.K., as the court has now determined that the defamation claim by these defendants is subject to coverage under the Church Organization coverage for personal injury liability, and is subject to a $1,000,000 coverage limit. Moreover, for the reasons set forth below, the court rejects Brotherhood's argument that its duty to defend has terminated with respect to M.M.'s claims against the church and elders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Under Kansas law, an insurer generally has a duty to defend whenever there is a potential of liability under the policy.\n   <em>\n    MGM, Inc. v.

In this instance, Brotherhood affirmatively promised to defend any suit seeking damage which may be covered under the commercial liability policy. Dkt. 32-4 at 85. In BGL-11 it promised to provide the same defense coverage with respect to additional liability coverages. The GL-100 provision stated that Brotherhood does not have to provide a defense \"after\n   <strong>\n    we\n   </strong>\n   have paid an amount equal to the\n   <strong>\n    limit\n   </strong>\n   as the result of: a. a judgment; or b. a written settlement agreed to by\n   <strong>\n    us\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41163\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/212/681/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The court agrees with defendants that a reasonable construction of the latter two clauses is that Brotherhood is only relieved of its duty to defend when the payment of the applicable limit results from resolution of claims either through judgment or settlement. Otherwise, the latter half of the clause would be superfluous. It specifies that the duty to defend ends when the limit is paid\n   <em>\n    as a result of a judgment or settlement.\n   </em>\n   Brotherhood has not paid its limit as a result of a judgment or settlement of the underlying litigation, and its duty to defend is therefore ongoing.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conway v.
