THRASH, JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an employment discrimination action. It is before the Court on the Report and Recommendation [Doc. 42] of the Magistrate Judge recommending granting the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 23] and denying the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 26]. For the reasons set forth in the Defendant's Response to the Plaintiff's Objections, the Magistrate Judge correctly recommended granting summary judgment on all of the Plaintiff's claims after he determined that it was undisputed that the Defendant offered the Plaintiff a reasonable accommodation for the exercise of her religious beliefs. The Plaintiff has now abandoned her reasonable accommodation claim. Accordingly, the Court approves and adopts the Report and Recommendation as the judgment of the Court. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 23] is GRANTED. The Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. 26] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SO ORDERED, this 13 day of November, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER AND FINAL REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   WALTER E. JOHNSON, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The perception that customers have of a business is critical to its success. In an effort to shape that perception in a positive way, some companies impose appearance policies on employees who interact with their customers. Defendant, Epps Air Service, Inc. (\"Epps\"), is one of those companies. Epps has a policy requiring its employees to present a neat, professional appearance, and as part of that policy, requires\n   its customer service representatives (\"CSR\") to wear uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff, Aissatou Camara, who formerly worked for Epps as a CSR and adheres to the Muslim faith, sought permission to wear a hijab at work. Epps denied her request because its owner believed that allowing a CSR to wear religious garb was inconsistent with the policy, did not project the image he sought for his company, and could hurt its business, given some that some customers might have negative reactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   However, to accommodate plaintiff's request to wear a hijab, Epps offered Ms. Camara a transfer to a non-frontline accounting position where she would not be required to wear a uniform and where she would receive the same pay, work hours, and benefits that she had received as a CSR. However, plaintiff rejected this transfer offer and insisted upon remaining a CSR. Epps then terminated Ms. Camara's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Camara subsequently filed this action against Epps under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\"), alleging both religious discrimination and retaliatory discharge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [1] Counts I-IV.) This matter is before the Court on three motions: (1) Plaintiff's Motion for [Partial] Summary Judgment on Her Discharge (Count II) and Retaliation (Count IV) Claims [23]; (2) Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [26] on all of plaintiff's claims; and (3) Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Paragraph 4 of Kelley Griffith's Affidavit [35]. For the reasons detailed below, the undersigned\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDS\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion [23] be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and that Defendant's Motion [26] be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Further, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Paragraph 4 of Kelley Griffith's Affidavit [35] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To assist with framing the undisputed material facts, Local Rule 56.1 requires the filing of certain documents along with a summary judgment motion. Plaintiff Camara as movant on her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment filed a Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"PSUMF\") [23-2]. Epps submitted a response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"DR-PSUMF\") [27].) As allowed by the Local Rules, Epps submitted a Statement of Additional Undisputed Material Facts (\"DSAF\") [28], to which plaintiff filed a response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Statement of Add'l Undisputed Facts (\"PR-DSAF\") [32-1].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has used the parties' proposals as the basis for the statement of facts under the following conventions. When a party admits a proposed fact (in whole or in part), the Court accepts that fact (or the part admitted) as undisputed for the purposes of this R &amp; R and cites only to the proposed fact. When a party denies a proposed fact (in whole or in part), the Court reviews the record cited and determines whether that denial is supported, and if it is, whether any fact dispute is material. The Court sometimes modifies a proposed fact per the opposing party's response or per the record cited to reflect the fact more accurately. The Court also includes some facts drawn from its review of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3), excludes immaterial proposed facts, and excludes proposed facts that are stated as issues or legal conclusions. The parties sometimes propose facts which are nearly identical. To avoid repetition, when the Court incorporates such facts, it cites to one proposed fact and employs a \"\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \" signal to the other(s). The Court views all proposed facts in light of the standards for summary judgment set out\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part III. Finally, the Court rules on objections to proposed facts. Although the Court prefers\n   to explain its rulings, given the need for brevity, the Court sometimes sustains an objection for the reasons stated by the objecting party when it deems those reasons sufficient. The Court's inclusion of a proposed fact to which an objection has been asserted implicitly overrules that objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Epps Hires Plaintiff as a CSR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When plaintiff originally interviewed for a position at Epps in 2003, she was made aware that the company had a dress code policy applicable to employees holding the CSR position. (DSAF \u00b6 18.) In other words, plaintiff knew that she would be required to wear a uniform at the front desk as a CSR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Epps hired plaintiff as a CSR on September 30, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSUMF \u00b6 3.) As a CSR, plaintiff's job duties required her to have significant contact with defendant's customers, employees, vendors, and the public. (PSUMF \u00b6 5.) With respect to whether interacting with defendant's customers was one of plaintiff's \"material responsibilities,\" Patrick Epps, Sr. (defendant's owner) explained: \"Dealing with customers, certainly. They are usually the first person that the customer comes-after the line [in contact with] ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The CSR's job description states that: \"the CSR is the face of Epps Aviation. This person will welcome pilots, passengers, and guests\" to the Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) The CSR's job description also makes numerous references to \"customer interaction\" as a primary function of the CSR position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Shane Dale, plaintiff's manager from 2009-2105 (DSAF \u00b6 52), confirmed that customer interaction was a \"material responsibility\" and an \"essential part\" of the CSR's job duties. (PSUMF \u00b6 9.) Mr. Dale further confirmed that plaintiff was a \"valuable asset\" to defendant's team; that she was well-liked by defendant's customers; and that she was \"one of his best employees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Dress Policy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Company's Dress Policy is found in two places: the Employee Handbook and in a one-page document provided to new employees. (Griffith Dep. [33-6] 64-67.) Because the policies are slightly different, the Court quotes both of their provisions below. The \"Dress Code\" in the Epps Aviation Policy Manual and Employee Handbook provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Business attire should be conducive to a professional business environment and enable the wearer to interact with customers, clients and fellow employees in a professional manner. Therefore, Epps employees are expected to present a neat, professional appearance at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Occasionally, casual days will be observed and announced in advance. Appropriate dress for casual days should also be neat and professional in appearance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Some departments supply employees with uniforms that are to be worn when at work. See your supervisor with any questions regarding the dress code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Pl.'s Ex. 7 [33-7], at 5.) The one page \"Dress Policy\" given to new hires provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Employees are expected to maintain the highest standards of personal hygiene and present a neat, professional appearance at all times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Our client's satisfaction represents the most important and challenging aspect of our business. Whether or not your job responsibilities place you in direct client contact, you represent the Company with your appearance as well as your actions. The properly attired employee helps to create a favorable image for the Company, to the public and fellow employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Because it would be impossible to define every example of what is permitted\n   and not permitted, it is the responsibility of employees and administrators to exercise good judgment when choosing clothing for office activities. If you have to think twice about what you have on, it is probably not appropriate for work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Pl.'s Ex. 2 [23-7], at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As referenced above, some departments at Epps require the employees who work in them to wear uniforms. CSRs were required to wear uniforms. There was a schedule for CSRs in 2015 wherein they had a specific uniform for each day of the week on a rotating schedule per season. (DSAF \u00b6 48.) A typical weekly uniform schedule for CSRs is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-33\"><strong>DAY</strong> Mon. Tues. Wed. Thurs. Fri. Sat. Sun. <strong>UNIFORM</strong> BLACK BLUE GREY PURPLE BLUE VEST W/ VEST W/ <strong>COLOR</strong> BUTTON STRIPE POLKA STRIPE EPPS BLACK WHITE DOWN SHIRT DOTS</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Pl.'s Ex. 6 [33-7], at 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's February 2015 Request to Wear a Hijab\n     <footnotemark>\n      3\n     </footnotemark>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Epps was aware that plaintiff is of the Muslim faith. (PSUMF \u00b6 17, as modified by DR-PSUMF \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSUMF \u00b6 1, DSAF \u00b6 44.) The parties do not dispute that, women who practice the Muslim faith are required to wear a head scarf, or hijab, when in public. (PSUMF \u00b6 2, as modified per DR-PSUMF \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In February 2015, plaintiff spoke to her manager (Mr. Dale) about her need to wear a hijab while at work as part of her religious practices and beliefs. (PSUMF \u00b6 31.) Mr. Dale responded by indicating, among other things, that he would present plaintiff's request to the owner, Mr. Epps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Mr. Dale and Kelly Griffith, defendant's Human Resources Director, instructed plaintiff to take a picture with her hijab on so that Mr. Epps \"could see what she looked like with a Hijab.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few days later, Mr. Dale informed plaintiff that Mr. Epps would not allow her to wear a hijab while working as a CSR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Epps testified that he was the one who made the decision that plaintiff could not wear a hijab in the CSR position. (Epps Dep. [33-8] 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PSUMF \u00b6 22.) According to Mr. Epps, Epps Aviation has required certain employees to wear uniforms since the founding of the business in 1965. (Epps Dep. [33-8] 17.) He believes that the wearing of a hijab was \"not consistent with the image [he] want[s] at [his] business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) In other words, it was \"not within the dress code that we have established.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21; Epps Dep. [33-9] 47.) An employee with an appearance that is different from what is seen among employees at other airport terminals would be, in Mr. Epps's view, unprofessional. (Epps Dep. [33-8] 20.) Customers might have a problem seeing a CSR in a hijab because employees at airport terminals do not wear religious garb. (Epps Dep. [33-9] 38.) Thus, allowing plaintiff to wear a hijab could impact the business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.) Mr. Epps summarized his decision-making like this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Primarily, I did not want to upset my uniform dress, my dress code. I have a dress code for the line, for the front counter, for the maintenance. There is a dress code. Everybody adheres to it, and it's what I want.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.) The Company could have lost business by plaintiff wearing a hijab at the front counter when no one else in the industry allowed it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49.) Mr. Epps conceded that negative stereotypes and perceptions about Muslims was a factor in his decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Mr. Dale and Ms. Griffith agreed that wearing a hijab at the front desk violated the dress code applicable to CSRs. (DSAF \u00b6 53.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Interest in an Accounting Department Job\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On February 10, 2015, plaintiff learned that the accounts receivable employee in the accounting department at Epps had resigned. (DSAF \u00b6 25.) Plaintiff asked Ms. Griffith in Human Resources if she would consider her for the accounts receivable position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The same day that Ms. Griffith let plaintiff know that she was collecting resumes for the accounts receivable position, plaintiff either sent her resume to Ms. Griffith or asked Ms. Griffith to consider her resume on file for the position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff Contacts CAIR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After plaintiff was denied permission to wear a hijab, she contacted the Council on\n   American-Islamic Relations (CAIR\"). (PSUMF \u00b6 37, as modified per DR-PSUMF \u00b6 37.) CAIR Georgia's President subsequently mailed two letters to Epps.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first letter, dated March 3, 2015, provides in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Our office was recently contacted by an employee of Epps Aviation, Ms. Aissatou Camara [sic], about a religious accommodation issue. She explained that she has been denied her right to wear a religiously mandated head cover or hijab at work due to conflicts with the uniform policy. We would like to inform you that employers are required to accommodate religious practices per the Civil Rights act. We have included an employer's guide for Islamic religious practices that provides more information that may help. I hope you can reconsider this matter and allow Ms. Camara [sic] to wear her hijab at work. She is a long term employee with Epps Aviation and really enjoys her job and the people she works with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Pl.'s Ex. 7 [23-11], at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Epps Offers Plaintiff a Job in Accounting\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Human Resources Director Griffith testified that she talked with Mr. Epps about transferring plaintiff to the accounting department, and that she could wear a hijab in that department because those employees do not wear uniforms; Mr. Epps replied that he had no problem with her wearing a hijab in accounting. (DSAF \u00b6 49.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, on March 17, 2015, Epps offered plaintiff the position of accounting assistant in the accounting department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff was told at the time that she would receive the same salary, have the same hours, and receive the same benefits in the accounting assistant position that she was receiving in the CSR position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff testified that she did not like that she would be \"helping\" the accounts payable employee in the accounting department because plaintiff had more seniority than her and more education in aviation related matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) When plaintiff inquired as to the status of the accounts receivable position, she was told that it required a full 40 hours per week rather than the 32 hours that she was currently working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff did not tell Ms. Griffith that she was willing to work more hours or change her days in the accounts receivable position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Griffith told plaintiff that she could wear a hijab as an accounting department employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Plaintiff believed that the accounts receivable position would have been a promotion, but that the accounting assistant position where she would be helping an employee with less seniority than her was \"unfair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     CAIR's Second Letter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On April 1, 2015, CAIR Georgia's President sent a second letter to Epps which provides in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I am following up on my letter of March 5 [sic].

(PSUMF \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DSAF \u00b6 35.) Plaintiff asked Mr. Dale to inform Mr. Epps of her intention to wear a hijab.

In the course of counseling a CDC employee, plaintiff disclosed that she\n   had a bona fide religious belief which prevented her from providing relationship counseling to same-sex couples. Because the CDC perceived that Ms. Walden had reacted negatively to an employee's request for same-sex relationship counseling, the CDC demanded that CSC remove Ms. Walden from working under the CDC/CSC contract. CSC complied, and subsequently laid off Ms. Walden because it had no counseling positions available in the Atlanta area. The court held that CSC had reasonably accommodated Ms. Walden when it laid her off, encouraged her to obtain new employment with the company, and offered her assistance to do so. Because of Ms. Walden's laid-off status, she would have retained her tenure had CSC rehired her within a year.

Given these cases, Epps's offer to transfer plaintiff to a job with the same pay, hours, and benefits that she currently enjoyed constitutes a reasonable accommodation. Although the duties assigned were of a different nature, the job was reasonably comparable. Once Epps offered plaintiff the accounting position where she could wear a hijab and end any conflict between her religious beliefs and defendant's uniform policy, Epps met its reasonable accommodation obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At this point, Ms. Camara had a duty to accept Epps's offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beadle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1840564\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/29/589/#p592\">\n    29 F.3d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While we recognize an employer's duty to reasonably accommodate the religious practices of its employee, we likewise recognize an employee's duty to make a good faith attempt to accommodate [her] religious needs through means offered by the employer.\"). Ms. Camara's main disagreement with the transfer appeared to be her perception that the accounting assistant position was \"beneath\" her and that it would not give her any customer engagement. As already discussed, it is undisputed that plaintiff would have had customer engagement in the accounting assistant position, although not as much as she had as a CSR. It is also undisputed that plaintiff had sought the accounts receivable position, which also had less customer engagement than the CSR position. Thus, customer engagement was obviously not that important to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff's apparent preference for a job that was more in line with what she perceived her status to be is immaterial. If she wanted to wear a hijab at work, plaintiff had a duty to accept the transfer offer, but she did not. Despite Epps's best efforts, accommodation was impossible where the employee unreasonably refused to accept the alternative opportunity provided. The Sixth Circuit's analysis of this issue is helpful here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   An employee cannot shirk his duties to try to accommodate himself or to cooperate with his employer in reaching an accommodation by a mere recalcitrant citation of religious precepts. Nor can he thereby shift all responsibility for accommodation to his employer.

However, plaintiff refused a transfer to a reasonably comparable position. By unreasonably refusing the transfer, plaintiff left Epps no choice but to terminate her employment. Based upon these undisputed facts, because Epps met its obligations under Title VII, defendant is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim (Count I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As discussed above, once Epps offered a reasonable accommodation, the analysis ends and there is no need to address undue hardship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Philbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210673\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/60/#p68\">\n    479 U.S. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6210673\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/60/#p68\">\n    107 S.Ct. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

Defendant has provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged employment action-plaintiff refused the reasonable accommodation transfer offered to her, leaving Epps no choice but to terminate her employment. Plaintiff has submitted no probative evidence showing that this reason is pretextual and that her religion was the reason for the discharge. It is true that Epps did not want plaintiff wearing religious garb as a CSR, but that is not evidence that Epps fired her because of her religion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undisputed evidence is that Epps fired her because she refused to accept the reasonable accommodation offered, and Epps could legitimately insist that she not wear a hijab as a CSR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For all the reasons stated above, the undersigned reports that plaintiff was not treated differently because of her religion.

Nevertheless, because the undersigned does not wish to send meritless claims to trial, the Court addresses it now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   There is no evidence that Epps sought to segregate plaintiff on the basis of her religion. But, even assuming that Epps's transfer offer was an attempt to do so, plaintiff rejected it. The undersigned's research has uncovered no case where a court has held that an\n   <em>\n    unsuccessful\n   </em>\n   attempt to segregate an employee on the basis of her religion is actionable under Title VII.

As quoted\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the notice states: \"Terminated: Disruptive to workplace by refusing a lateral transfer to accommodate her religious beliefs. Unwillingness to accept supervisor's decisions.\" (Pl.'s Ex. 5 [33-7], at 9.) The Court is unwilling to find that an employee's rejection of her employer's attempt to accommodate her religious beliefs is evidence of intentional discrimination. Moreover, while the use of the word \"disruptive\" in the DOL separation notice was perhaps ill-advised (because Ms. Camara acted professionally at all times), use of that one word does not show that defendant has failed to articulate consistently the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for plaintiff's discharge. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Reply Br. [32] 11.) In fact, the reasons offered in the DOL separation notice are consistent with what Epps has argued here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Plaintiff argues that Epps disparately applied its dress code because it granted exceptions for non-religious purposes but refused exceptions for religious purposes. (Pl.'s Resp. Br. [34] 13-14.) Ms. Camara testified that she sometimes wore a long-sleeve blouse that was the same color as the short-sleeve uniform shirt required for the day. (Camara Dep. [30-2] 110.) Mr. Dale testified that the only exception to the dress code of which he was aware was that Epps allowed CSRs to wear something over the uniform to keep them warm in cold weather. (Dale Dep. [33-1] 34-35.) However, because plaintiff did not propose facts about any exceptions to the dress code in PSUMF, the Court cannot consider them. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    N.D. Ga. Civ. R. 56.1 B.(1)(d), quoted\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ). But, even if these claimed exceptions could be considered, the Court fails to see how they show disparate application of the policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Plaintiff raises for the first time in response to defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment a \"constructive discharge\" claim, arguing that Epps forced her to resign. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp. [34] 18-21.) No such claim was alleged in the Complaint [1], and a plaintiff cannot amend in response to a motion for summary judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gilmour v.
