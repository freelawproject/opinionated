Said business of said corporation consisted in dealing in dairy products and making butter, and said company owned, and operated and conducted a creamery establishment duly equipped with the necessary machinery hereinafter mentioned, at what is known as \u2018Berlin Corners,\u2019 in the town of Berlin, and State of Vermont. The personal property of the said company consisted of, and is, the same property described in the plaintiff\u2019s writ of replevin, and is the same property involved in this suit. The aforesaid company, in April, 1903, was petitioned into bankruptcy, and was thereupon duly adjudged bankrupt, and a receiver appointed and qualified to take charge of all the business and propertj' of the said company^ and settle the estate of the said company in accordance with the requirements of the bankruptcy law applicable thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\">On the 3rd day of February, 1902, F. R. Whitlaw, then a resident of Berlin, but now of Randolph, this State, brought his suit against the said Hobart Farm Company, and on the same day the writ was duly served, and all of the property of the said Hobart Farm Company, in said Berlin, consisting of both real and personal property, was then and there attached, said personal property being all and the same property replevied in this action. Said writ was returnable into the City Court of Montpelier, at which time the case was continued until March 19, 1902, when judgment in said cause was rendered for the plaintiff, and the defendant in said cause (the Hobart Farm Company) thereupon took an appeal and said case passed to the Washington County Court, where it remained until the March term of said court, 1905, when judgment was rendered for the plaintiff to recover the sum of $226.49 damages, and $45.25 costs, amounting in all to $271.74. Also, that on the 12th day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of February, 1902, L. Chatfield, of said Berlin, brought suit against the said Hobart Farm Company by virtue of his writ of attachment prayed out of said court of the said city of Montpelier, which writ was served on the said Hobart Farm Company on the 13th day of February, 1902, and thereupon attached all of the property of the said bankrupt company, being the same property that was attached by the said Whitlaw as aforesaid. Said writ was returnable to the said City Court of said city of Montpelier on the 23rd day of April, 1902, at which time judgment was entered against, the said Hobart Farm Company, and thereupon the said company appealed.the said cause, and accordingly the same passed to the Washington County Court and was then continued from time to time until the March term of said County Court, 1905, when judgment was rendered for the plaintiff to recover $236.29 damages and $40.81 costs, amounting in all to $277.10. In each of the above mentioned causes, execution was issued on the first day of June, 1905, and both of said executions were placed in the hands of the defendant, Hiram B.

Under section 67f of the Bankrupt Law of 1898, these liens were not invalidated by the adjudication. The case of <em>Thompson, Trustee, </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>75 Vt. 361, 56 Atl. 11, is decisive of this question. There a chattel mortgage of more than four months\u2019 standing at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and good at common law between the parties, was involved. To perfect his lien on the property, the mortgagee took possession thereof under his mortgage within four months prior to the filing of the petition. . It was held that the mortgage lien was not invalidated by the adjudication, and that it was paramount to the rights of the trustee under the bankrupt law. The decision of this Court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States, \u2014 196 U. S. 516, 49 L. ed. 577, \u2014 where it was further held that under the present bankrupt act the trustee takes the property of the bankrupt, in cases unaffected by fraud, in the same plight and condition as the bankrupt himself held it, and subject to all the equities impressed upon it in the hands of the bankrupt,' except where there has been a conveyance or encumbrance of the property, which is void as against the trustee by some positive provision of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">It is further argued by the plaintiff that the question is also raised whether the attachments created liens good against an innocent purchaser of the property for value at a public sale by the-receiver of'the bankrupt company appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States and selling under a special order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>from that court. But the case does not present that question. The record states that before and at the time of the sale notice was given to the plaintiff of the attachments, and that the receiver sold only \u201cthe right and title and interest\u201d of the bankrupt in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
