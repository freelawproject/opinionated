At the close of all the evidence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict in his favor for that there was no evidence tending to show unskillful driving on his part; that there was no evidence tending to show negligence on his part; and that, on the evidence, plaintiff, as matter of\u2019 law, was guilty of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tributory negligence.

This was evidence tending to show that the defendant did not take the care that a prudent man would have taken' in- driving such a horse in such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">There was also evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s position with his back to teams coming from one direction was required by his work; that he could not be working and watching for teams from the rear at the same time, but that once in a while he would look around; that others working with him did the same, and that some of these saw the defendant\u2019s team and warned him; that he started towards the gutter, but did not have time to escape from the team, which passed the car in the manner before described. In view of this evidence, it could not be said as matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. So the defendant was not entitled to have a verdict directed on either branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The defendant excepted to the failure to charge the jury \u201cthat it was the duty of the plaintiff to be on the alert and look out for approaching teams, taking all the conditions into consideration.\u201d The court, in addition to proper general in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>structions regarding the plaintiff\u2019s duty; called attention to the fact that the plaintiff must have known that there were liable to be more teams than usual on the street that day, and to the fact that he had been cautioned by his superior to look out for teams when at work, and put the inquiry whether in the circumstances surrounding him he was guilty of negligence in not knowing that the team was coming. .This-was all the defendant was entitled to in the line indicated by the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
