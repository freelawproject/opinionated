The hound was'duly licensed, registered and collared. The defendant is a resident of Marshfield, and was on said December 26, 1905. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Both plaintiff and defendant are citizens. On said 26th day of December the defendant heard the barking of dogs near the house, and going to the front of the house saw several dogs worrying a deer. The deer was standing in a brook with its fore feet on the bank of the brook. The defendant drove the dogs away and returned to the house, but the dogs renewed their attack on the deer, and he procured his rifle and shot at and killed the plaintiff\u2019s dog. The defendant killed the dog in order to protect the deer, and it was necessary to do so to save the deer\u2019s life. All of this took place within the enclosed lands of the defendant. The defendant did not know who owned the dog, and that the dog wore a collar upon which the name of the owner was marked. The plaintiff did not know that his dog would pursue deer, and used the dog only for rabbit hunting, and while out hunting rabbits at divers times previously with the said dog,. came across fresh deer tracks, and that the dog took no notice thereof. On the day in question the plaintiff\u2019s dog had left him and attacked the deer without the knowledge of the plaintiff. The value of the plaintiff\u2019s dog was fifty dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-5\"><em>Elwin Scott </em>and <em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjTm\">The defendant, an inhabitant of the State, in the close season, shot and'killed the plaintiff\u2019s duly licensed, registered, and collared dog while, with other dogs, it was worrying and attacking a wild deer on the defendant\u2019s enclosed land, and thereby saved the life of the deer. The defendant says that as he was an inhabitant of the State at the time, he had such a qualified property in the deer that he had a right to kill the dog in order to protect it. But that is not so. The wild game in the State belongs to the people of the State in their collective and sovereign capacity, and not in their individual and private capacity, except so far as private ownership may be acquired therein'under the Constitution, subject to such proper regulations as the Legislature may make, the Constitution providing that the inhabitants of the State \u201cshall have liberty in seasonable times to hunt and fowl on the lands they hold, and on other lands not inclosed,\u201d under proper regulations to be thereafter made and- provided hy the General Assembly. It is by virtue of this \u201cliberty,\u201d and not otherwise, that private ownership is acquired in wild game by an inhabitant of the State on whose inclosed lands it is found; and it is thus acquired because the right to hunt thereon is exclusive in the inhabitant who holds them. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Sheets, </em>75 Vt. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">But as the defendant had no right to hunt wild deer on his inclosed land in the close season, a proper regulation of his \u201cliberty,\u201d he had no property in the deer that entitled him to kill the dog to protect it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and as the val\u00fae of the dog is agreed upon at fifty dollars, judgment for that sum is rendered for the plaintiff with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
