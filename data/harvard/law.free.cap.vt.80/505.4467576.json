S. 342.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\">This replication, although in an indirect way\u2019 it attempts tO' deny the fact of delivery by advancing new matter \u2014 showing a state of facts contradictory to and inconsistent with delivery\u2014 has no semblance to a direct traverse and the framing of an issue. It contains no direct denial; but indirectly, if at all, and inferentially, by advancing new and numerous facts, denies by implication the fact of delivery to the defendant. And further, another fatal defect, it concludes with a verification and not to the country as a traverse should. Stevens on Pleadings, (9 Am. Ed.) 481; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Railroad Go., </em>55 Yt. 95; <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>13 Yt. 416; 18 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng.

B. 528.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-8\">But if it is held that this replication by setting up another state of facts inferentially and argumentatively, not directly, denies the delivery of the release to- the' defendant, and so amounts to a general denial or issue, such a process is not allowable under the well established rules of pleading and may be reached by special demurrer. It is not a general issue as known in pleading but only \u201camounts to the general issue,\u201d arid \u201cto allow it would lead to innovation and confusion and tends to destroy settled distinctions, and to the introduction of new pleas unknown to the law.\u201d <em>Hayselder </em>v. <em>Staff, </em>5 A. &amp; E. 153.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-9\">Nor is the replication in confession and avoidance of the plea, for it sets up facts wholly inconsistent with the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of the release relied on in the plea. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>44 Yt. 561; <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>10 Yt. 211; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Choate, </em>47 Yt. 53; <em>Gillette </em>v. <em>Ballon,, </em>29 Yt. 296; <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>14 Yt. 457; <em>R.

The only ground in law that can be set up to defeat a sealed instrument duly delivered is fraud in its procurement.

The demurrer reaches all the pleadings, but has the force of a general demurrer only, as applied to pleadings prior to the one demurred to. So it reaches only substantial defects in the plea, and if a delivery of the release is argumentatively alleged the plea is sufficient, for argumentativeness and duplicity are but defects of form. We think a delivery of the deed of release is argumentatively alleged. The allegation is not that the plaintiff made a deed releasing the defendant, but that by her deed she released him, which implies a delivery. So the plea is sufficient, and if the replication stands it must be upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The plaintiff argues that the replication is a proper plea of confession and avoidance; that the matters set up in avoidance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>were not coincident with the execution of the release, but occurred after its execution, and so constitute no impeachment of its original validity, that the release became inoperative by reason of these subsequent occurrences, and that matters of avoidance thus arising may be specially pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It should be noticed at the outset that the matters set up as occurring subsequently to the execution of the release are not matters that arose independently of -the contract as the replication alleges it to have been made.' These subsequent occurrences, as alleged, were merely breaches of an agreement under which the deed of release was made and deposited. The replication alleges a delivery to a third person to be held for delivery to the defendant when certain conditions were complied with, and a possession wrongfully obtained, without such compliance, and avers in conclusion that such supposed deed of release is not the plaintiff\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">A plea of confession and avoidance must at least give color to the matter to which it is applied; that is, it must so far conf\u00e9ss the matter adversely alleged as to give the opposite party an apparent right \u2014 it must contain at. least an implied admission that the allegations to be avoided are true. <em>Dunklee </em>v. <em>Goodenough, </em>65 Vt. 257; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>75 Vt. 88. It follows that a plea of confession and avoidance which in effect denies the existence of the claim it opposes is defective. The plea rests upon the confession, for if there is no such adverse claim there is nothing requiring new matter in avoidance. Connected with this rule, and largely depending upon it, is the doctrine that a special .plea amounting to the general issue is bad. 1 Chitty 526. A plea which sets up in reply a different contract from the one alleged is bad for this reason. It is an argumentative denial of what the adverse pleader must prove to sustain his claim. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>55 Vt. 95; <em>Hayselden </em>v. <em>Staff, </em>5 A. <em>&amp; </em>E. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The allegation of the replication that the plaintiff made the supposed deed of release pleaded by the defendant is not sufficient to give color. The plaintiff\u2019s brief proceeds upon the theory that the deed of release went into effect and was made inoperative by subsequent occurrences, but the allegations of the replication show that the deed never became operative. The replication sets forth a contract which led to the preparation of a deed of release,. but the contract as set forth is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>inconsistent with the existence of the release .as the defendant claims it. When a deed is deposited with a third person to be delivered to the grantee only upon the performance of some condition precedent, and the depositary delivers it without the performance of the condition, there is no delivery in law, and the deed is without effect. <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>16 Vt. 563. We hold the replication insufficient on both the grounds considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; demurrer overruled as to the plea and plea adjudged sufficient; demurrer sustained as to the replication and that adjudged insufficient; and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
