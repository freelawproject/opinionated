Plea, the general issue. Trial by jury at the March Term, 1907, Franklin County, <em>Haselton, 3., </em>presiding. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant excepted. At the close of all the evidence the defendant moved the court to direct a verdict in his favor \u201cbecause on the undisputed evidence in the case the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, claiming that the plaintiff had failed to establish the material allegations in the declaration that the plaintiff did not comprehend or understand the dangers incident to his employment; that in the absence of proof of this fact, it must be said that the plaintiff assumed the risk incident to the employment. Also claiming that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the instructions as given the plaintiff were not proper and sufficient and not comprehended and understood by him.\u201d This motion was denied, to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">This is ease for negligence, to recover for personal injuries to the plaintiff, a lad between nine and ten, while working for the defendant cutting corn with an ensilage-cutter and filling a silo. His work was, to stand between the power and the cutter, and poke the corn with a stick from the cutter to the carrier. The knives, and the eog-w'heels on the side of the cutter, were covered with an iron cap or hood. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that during the third day of his work, a nut that held a cap came off, and that they stopped the machine to find it, but started it up without putting the nut back; that the defendant, who was feeding the machine, directed him t'o hold the cap in place with one hand near the cog-wheels, and poke the corn with the other hand, telling him to be careful and not get hurt; that he did as directed, by crossing his hands, putting his left hand on the cap and poking corn with the other, and worked so about twenty minutes in full view of the defendant, when the mitten on his left hand caught in the wheels and drew his hand into the cogs, when his thumb was broken and bruised, and his hand otherwise so injured that he lost part of it and two fingers. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence further tended to show that he never had any experience in such work before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to holding down the cap, and to show that the plaintiff had done the same kind of work for him the year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>before, not as a hired servant, bnt had spelled his boys to the extent of poking away several loads of corn; that during the fall of 1905, he used this cutter in filling three silos, and that the plaintiff was around two-thirds of the time, and had opportunity to see and observe the cutter in operation; and that at the time he employed the plaintiff, he gave him a stick to use, and told him to keep his hands away from the machinery in question, to prevent injury. No witness was introduced on either side to show that the plaintiff was not able to do the work, He was in court during the entire trial,, and testified on the stand.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\"><em>Emmet McEeeters </em>and <em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amc\">The risk of holding the cap in place with his hand was not an ordinary risk-incident to the work the plaintiff was hired to do, for the cap was not made to be held in place by the hand, but by a nut on a bolt; and when the-defendant set the plaintiff to holding the cap with his hand, he subjected him -to an extraordinary risk, and one that the plaintiff did not assume, unless he knew and comprehended it and how to avoid it, or it was so plainly observable that he will be taken to have known and comprehended it and how to avoid it; and the burden was on the plaintiff to show non-assumption, we will say for present purposes. But whether he was to be taken to have assumed that risk, was an open question, depending upon whether he understood the danger from which his injury resulted; and if yes, whether he had sufficient mental and physical capacity to regulate his conduct in a manner adapted to secure his safety as effectually as the circumstances admitted. The defendant says there was no evidence tending to show want of understanding and capacity in these respects, and that therefore his motion for a verdict should have been sustained. But, by all the authorities, the plaintiff\u2019s tender age and consequent lack of experience tended to show such want, and made it a question for the jury; and in determining it, the jury had a right to consider the appearance of the plaintiff in court and on the stand. <em>Disotell </em>v. <em>The Henry Luther Co., </em>90 Wis. 635, a ease of this kind in which the plaintiff was eighteen years old. Hence, defendant\u2019s motion for a verdict was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s mother was allowed to testify that he had \u201cgrown a good deal\u201d since the accident, which was a year, and a half before. It is objected that this was error, because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>question was made by either party but that the plaintiff was physically able to perform the work; because the testimony could not enlighten the jury, and would lead them to speculate on the plaintiff\u2019s size; because it was susceptible of different conclusions by different persons; and because the fact that he was small, did not bear on his capacity to understand and comprehend the danger. But, as the plaintiff\u2019s tender age and consequent lack of experience tended to show his physical inability, he thereby questioned that he had such ability; and the fact that he was small, as the last objection phrases it, bore upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">As to the testimony not enlightening the jury and leading them to conjecture, it is true that evidence should afford a basis for belief and not merely for conjecture; but this testimony afforded a basis for belief that the plaintiff was smaller at the time of the accident than at the time of the trial, though it did not' show with any certainty how much smaller; and it was not necessary that it should in order to be admissible; it was admissible for what it was worth. That different conclusions could be drawn from it by different persons goes only to its probative quality. The question of its admissibility lies back of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">There was no evidence that the defendant knew the exact age of the plaintiff at the time of his employment; but he had known him since he was a small boy, and had seen him around a good deal since he was old enough to be around with other boys.'</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In his opening argument to the jury, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said he claimed that the defendant was negligent in putting the boy to work where he did, and that the defendant had notice of his incapacity when he hired him. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected that there was no evidence to support the claim. But the plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued to argue that the defendant had such notice, and that the boy himself was that notice, and that he claimed no other. The defendant\u2019s counsel kept objecting, and was allowed an exception. The court then elicited from the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that as there was no dispute about the boy\u2019s age, and he had been around there enough so that the defendant must have known substantially what his age was, he argued that an inference could be drawn as to the capacity of the boy, and that the age and size of the boy were notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to the defendant that he was not of mature years, and not, as measured by boys in general, of sufficient capacity. The court then said: \u201cYour argument is, that the apparent age and size of the boy as the defendant knew him, was notice to the defendant that he had not the capacity of a mature man?\u201d Counsel said that was his argument, and that that was the only thing he claimed. The court thereupon said to the jury that they were instructed, and that the court held, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel might argue that the apparent age and size of the boy were notice to the defendant that he had not the capacity of a mature person, and that anything further than that they were not to regard. Thereupon plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI withdraw anything I have said inconsistent with the statement of the court; that is all I claim. \u2019 \u2019 This action on the part of the court, taken in such good time, and the complete withdrawal and disclaimer of counsel, were, we think, effective to blot out from the minds of the jury any wrong impression they might have got from the argument, unless we say that the court erred in allowing counsel to argue as it finally did. But this cannot be said, for it is undoubted law that the age and size of the boy were notice to the defendant that he had not the capacity of a mature person for the work in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">There was no evidence that the plaintiff suffered pain, except what the injury itself afforded. In his closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, for the first time, claimed damage for pain and suffering. To this the defendant objected that there was no evidence of pain and suffering, and that the claim should have been made in the opening. But the court held that there was evidence warranting the claim, and allowed the argument to proceed, telling the defendant that he might reply. But he did not reply, nor ask leave to meet the claim in any other way. He now insists that this was error, for that the injury itself was no evidence of pain, but that there should have been some word of testimony to show it; and <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Rochester etc. R. R. Co. </em>18 N. Y. 534, is relied upon as in point. But it is not in point. This question was not involved in it. We think the ruling well within the doctrine of judicial notice, which is based upon the maxim that what is known need not be proved, and it would seem that nothing can be better and more commonly known than that a bodily injury of this character and severity causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>pain. But it is argued that however it might have been formerly, yet now, under the modern treatment of such cases, it is well known that the patient cannot recall a moment of pain or suffering in a large number of eases; that aseptic surgery, the use of anesthetics, and the great strides of modern science in the treatment of such injuries, have practically eliminated bodily pain and suffering, so that it would be practically impossible to draw a correct inference that pain and suffering ensued merely from the fact of injury; and certainly that it would be impossible, in these days, to say--how much or how long the injured person suffered, if at all. But however this may be, there is nothing in the ease to slmw that the plaintiff received any such treatment. All that appears is, that he \u201cwas taken to a surgeon, who dressed the wound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">The defendant further says that if there had been any testimony offered to show that the plaintiff suffered pain, he could have successfully contradicted it; but that no such opportunity was given him, and that he was thereby deprived of a right, for which there should be a reversal. But it was discretionary with the court to allow the claim to be made in the close though not made in the opening, and no right of the defendant\u2019s was thereby infringed, for he had no right at that stage of the case to meet the claim with testimony. He could do that only.by leave, and that he did not ask for.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
