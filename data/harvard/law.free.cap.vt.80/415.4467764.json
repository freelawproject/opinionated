The test of whether a conviction is conclusive, if it ever is conclusive in the trial of criminal cases, is this: There must be a legal identity of the two offences. Could the respondent upon any evidence that might have been produced on the first trial have been convicted on that trial of the offence charged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>second? Com. v. <em>Bakeman, </em>105 Mass. 55. Though both indictments refer to the same transaction, this is not decisive of the legal identity of the two offences. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Saines, </em>11 Gray 308; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Bubser, </em>12 Gray 89; 2 Freeman on Judg. \u00a7 256 and cases cited. Here the two cases are entirely different. One was for poisoning colts, the other for perjury. The testimony in the first case to prove the poisoning was admissible in the case for perjury. But evidence in the first case that was admissible could not alone convict in the second. <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>State, </em>7 Tes. 78; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>85 Ind. 553; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>76 Iowa 687; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 Ohio 423; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Trimmer, </em>84 Pa. 65. The issue in the former trial was collateral to the real issue in this trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-3\">The former judgment should have been pleaded in order to be conclusive. <em>Isaacs </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>12\"Vt. 693; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>19 Yt. 145; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Cramer, </em>39 Atl. 671; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>People, </em>55 N.

Y.) 284.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-4\">In order to convict the respondent in the perjury case it was necessary to establish the fact of the materiality of his testimony in the former case, and also to show its falsity, by competent evidence. That it was mat\u00e9rial there can be no question. He testified he did not poison the colts. The State must show he did. It did show it in the poisoning case, we must assume, by evidence competent so far as that case was concerned. But we cannot assume that it showed it by evidence sufficient to establish the fact in case of perjury. The rule that requires more than one witness to convict of perjury is founded on the principle that every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty; and until discredited the oath of a respondent must be considered as that of \u00e1 creditable witness and have that effect. With but the testimony of one witness against his testimony the scales just balance, and enough evidence must be thrown into the side of the State, either by another witness or by material and independent circumstances, to weigh down the testimony of the respondent before he can be convicted. As before stated, it does not appear that more than one witness testified to material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>facts on the part of the State in the poisoning ease, or if it did appear, or it were to be assumed that more than one did testify, that does not signify. The jury may or may not have believed but one witness in the trial of that cause. In a trial for perjury the respondent has a right to have the court instruct the jury that one witness is not sufficient to convict, and that his testimony must be corroborated by witnesses that the jury believe, or by material facts or circumstances; and he had the further right to have the jury instructed as to what such corroborating testimony and circumstances were. Of this right he was wholly deprived under the ruling of the court excluding any evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the respondent in the poisoning case; and its denial of the right on the part of the respondent to introduce testimony showing that he did not poison the colts, was error. <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Com., 21 </em>Am.

All the essential facts, all of the ingredients of which the offence is composed, must be accurately and clearly expressed. The indictment does not set forth with sufficient certainty and clearness facts necessary to inform the accused of the crime charged against him. It does not meet the requirements of section 5083 of Vermont Statutes, or the requirements of the Constitution, nor the rules laid down by this Court. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>95 U.

In that case the Court said: \u201cThat the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction directly upon a principal point, is, as between the parties, conclusive in relation to such point, though the purpose and subject matter of the .two suits be different.\u201d There is no difference in principle .between that case and the one at the bar. There, however, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>was invoked in favor of the respondent. For other cases holding the same doctrine see, <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Com.j </em>45 L. R.

The respondent demurred' to the indictment, showing for cause of demurrer that in neither of the counts is it set forth by what court, magistrate or person the oath to the respondent was administered on the occasion when the crime is alleged to have been committed. The indictment follows the statutory form, and the statutory form is sufficient in this particular. <em>State </em>v. <em>Camley, </em>67 Vt. 322. This being the only point made in support of the demurrer in the court below, the other matters now suggested will not be considered. <em>State v. Schoolcraft, </em>72 Vt. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">It is claimed that the court erred in permitting the jury to base a conviction upon certain statements made to the grand jury, inasmuch as it did not appear that the respondent knew , what person or matter was being investigated, and so could not understand what statements had bearing or weight. We are referred to no authority, and have seen none, that treats knowledge of the materiality as an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">It is objected that the court erred in instructing the jury that certain statements were material to the issue. It is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>all of them were statements that might properly have influenced the jury in reaching its conclusion, and this was sufficient. 2 Bish. Cr. Law, 3rd Ed. \u00a7 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">It is charged that the respondent committed perjury in testifying on his trial for poisoning the colts that he did not poison them. The court held that the record of his conviction in that case was conclusive proof against him in this case that he did poison them. The respondent insists that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">It has been repeatedly held that the determination of an issue of fact in a criminal case is conclusive thereof in a subsequent criminal proceeding between the same parties. 24 A. &amp; E. Ency. Law, 2d Ed. 831; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>140 Ala. 118, 103 Am. St. 17 and note. The rule is commonly stated without recognizing any exception, but is to be tahen with some limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The few cases bearing upon the precise question before us are reviewed by Mr. Freeman in the note above cited. It has been held that a prior acquittal of an offence is a conclusive adjudication in the respondent\u2019s favor upon a subsequent trial for perjury committed in swearing to his innocence. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>38 Fed. 498; <em>Petit </em>v. <em>Com. </em>22 Ky. Law. 262; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Com., </em>106 Ky. 909; 90 Am. St. 275. There was a dissenting opinion in the ease last cited, and there seems to be substantial ground for questioning these decisions. The reasoning amounts to this: The respondent procures an acquittal by his own perjury, and that acquittal is conclusive evidence that he did not commit perjury. But if the adjudication is not to be held conclusive in the respondent\u2019s favor, the ordinary rule of mutuality would require that it be not held conclusive against him. This may not follow, however, when the holding is placed upon the ground that the acquittal was procured by the respondent\u2019s fraud. It has been held in other cases that an acquittal is not an adjudication that the respondent did not commit perjury in denying his guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Caywood, </em>96 Iowa 367; <em>Hutcherson </em>v. <em>State, </em>33 Tex. Cr. 67. It is said in the case last cited, but without stating the grounds of the conclusion, that such evidence is not admissible to show either the guilt or the innocence of a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">-The rule under consideration does not apply unless the measure of proof required in the adjudged case was as great as that required in the ease on trial. <em>Riker </em>v. <em>Hooper, </em>35 Vt. 457. This alone will ordinarily prevent the application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>rule when one case is civil and the other criminal. Freeman on Judg. \u00a7 <em>319 </em>a. Nor does the doctrine apply when the rules which determine the instruments of proof are different. 1 Green. Ev. \u00a7 537. The fact that a conviction may have been obtained by the testimony of the plaintiff is one of the reasons given for excluding proof of it in a civil action where the plaintiff cannot testify. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>16 Vt. 426; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>22 Vt. 35; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cazeaux, </em>8 Mart. 3\u00cd8: 13 Am. Dec. 288. A difference of requirement regarding the instruments of proof is equally controlling where both cases are civil. Steph. Dig. Ev., Art. 41, (d.) We see no reason why this distinction should not be recognized when both cases are criminal. Whatever the amount of evidence ordinarily adduced, there is no rule that requires more than the evidence of a single witness in criminal cases generally. There can be no conviction of perjury on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness. An application of the rule in cases like this might result in convictions upon less evidence than the law requires. This serves to distinguish cases of perjury from criminal cases generally, and renders the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained, judgment and sentence reversed, and \u2022cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
