In such case, being personally responsible for his prisoner, he may confine him in any safe and suitable place which is most convenient. Ordinarily he ought to take him to the county jail, and the keeper of the'jail is bound to receive him, even in cases of arrest without warrant for a breach of the peace in the presence of the officer.\u201d Hawley\u2019s The Law of Arrest, 54.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-7\"><em>George W.

The warrants commanded the officer serving the same to apprehend the plaintiff and have him forthwith before the subscribing justice at Barre. The plaintiff was arrested on the warrants by the defendant, a legally qualified deputy sheriff, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Groton about nine o\u2019clock in the evening of October 8, 1899, and taken to Barre, arriving there between the hours of five and six the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">After a short stop in Barre, and without taking the plaintiff before the justice of the peace who issued the warrants, and without communicating with the state\u2019s attorney 'then at his home in Barre, the defendant took the plaintiff to Montpelier, and when there placed him in jail for/safe keeping. Later in the forenoon warrants were\u2019 issued against the plaintiff from the county court, then in session, on informations filed therein for the same offences. These warrants were put into the defendant\u2019s hands by the state\u2019s attorney at Montpelier, near ten o\u2019clock, with directions to notify the plaintiff that the proceedings before the justice were dropped, and then to arrest him on the new warrants. Thereupon the defendant let the.plaintiff out of jail, notified him as directed by the state\u2019s attorney, and arrested him on the warrants issued by the county, court. This was ten o\u2019clock or a little after, the plaintiff having been in jail not far from three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The special question submitted to.the jury, \u201cWas it a reasonable and proper thing in point of fact for the defendant to do in the circumstances, to take the plaintiff to Montpelier and keep him there instead of keeping him at Barre?\u201d was answered in the affirmative. This finding, however, is immaterial, since the record shows that the plaintiff was not taken to Montpelier for safe keeping until he could be taken by the defendant before the subscribing magistrate, as commanded in the warrants, but in fact was taken there so the defendant could confer with the state\u2019s attorney as to what further to do with the plaintiff. Whether the defendant had authority so to do is not a question of fact, but one of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On making the arrest it was the duty of the defendant to take the plaintiff before the subscribing justice of the peace as commanded in the warrants. 2 Hale, P. C. 112. In <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>54 Vt. 437, it was held that an officer could not justify under a returnable process, unless he show its return; for he is commanded to return the_writ, and he shall not be protected by it without showing that he has paid due and full obedience to its commands. To the same effect is <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>78 Vt. 110. True, in each of these cases the arrest was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>on civil process. Yet the same doctrine applies in case of a warrant in criminal process. This was expressly held in <em>Tubbs </em>v. <em>Tukey, </em>3 Cush. 438, 50 Am. Dec. 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\">The taking of the plaintiff to Montpelier for the purpose shown was such an abuse of process as made the defendant a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>Consequently the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent discharge, there, from that arrest was by the direction of the state\u2019s attorney, does not relieve the defendant from liability in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
