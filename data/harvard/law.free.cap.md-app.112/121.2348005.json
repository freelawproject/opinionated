Tuer, both individually and as the personal representative of the estate of her husband, Eugene E. Tuer, appeals from an order by the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that entered judgment for Garth R. McDonald, M.D., Robert K. Brawley, M.D., and Brawley, McDonald <em>&amp; </em>Lincoln, M.D., P.A. (appellees). Mrs. Tuer filed a four count complaint against appellees in the circuit court following the death of her husband. After the jury found for appellees, the circuit court denied Mrs. Tuer\u2019s motion for a new trial, without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Mrs. Tuer presents three questions for our review, which we have reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">I. Did the circuit court err by excluding evidence that appellees, subsequent to Mr. Tuer\u2019s death, changed their procedure for administering the drug Heparin to patients awaiting cardiac surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">II. Did the circuit court err by excluding for the purposes of impeaching Dr. McDonald the medical records of another cardiac patient seen at St. Joseph Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">III. Did the circuit court err by refusing to allow Mrs. Tuer to introduce a rebuttal witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In September 1992, Mr. Tuer\u2019s angina, which was first diagnosed in 1976, became unstable. After conducting a stress test, Mr. Tuer\u2019s cardiologist, Dr. Louis Grenzer, recommended that Mr. Tuer have cardiac surgery. Dr. Grenzer referred Mr. Tuer to appellees, who scheduled the surgery for November 9,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On October 30, 1992, Mr. Tuer began to experience chest pain and, after calling Dr. Grenzer, was admitted to St. Joseph Hospital. While in St. Joseph Hospital, Mr. Tuer continued to have chest pain, so Dr. Grenzer prescribed Heparin, an anticoagulant intended to prevent Mr. Tuer from having a heart attack. Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery was then rescheduled for November 2,1992. Appellees resumed responsibility for Mr. Tuer on November 1,1992 and continued his Heparin dosage.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Appellees\u2019 and St. Joseph Hospital\u2019s standard practice at this time was to discontinue Heparin three to four hours prior to the surgery. One of the major risks associated with bypass heart surgery is inadvertent carotid artery punctures. Discontinuing the Heparin returns the blood\u2019s level of coagulation to normal standards, thereby reducing the risk of excessive bleeding associated with carotid artery punctures.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery was scheduled specifically for 9:00 a.m. on November 2,1992. Dr. McDonald discontinued Mr. Tuer\u2019s Heparin at 5:30 a.m. that same day. Just prior to the start of Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery, an emergency concerning another patient forced Dr. McDonald to postpone Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery for three to four hours. Dr. McDonald chose not to restart the Heparin, even though he knew that its protective effects would wear off between 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">At 1:02 p.m., Dr. McDonald was called to the post-surgical intensive surgery unit. When Dr. McDonald arrived, Mr. Tuer was in cardiac arrest. Dr. McDonald moved Mr. Tuer into an operating room and placed him on a heart-lung machine. Dr. McDonald then operated on Mr. Tuer in an effort to correct Mr. Tuer\u2019s cardiac condition. Mr. Tuer survived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>the surgery, but because of his deteriorated heart condition, he died the next day of a myocardial infarction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Following the death of her husband, Mrs. Tuer, both individually and as the personal representative of her husband\u2019s estate, filed a negligence claim with the Health Claims Arbitration Office against appellees and St. Joseph Hospital, Inc. Mrs. Tuer claimed that appellees\u2019 and St. Joseph Hospital\u2019s negligence caused the death of Mr. Tuer. On August 24,1994, all the parties agreed to waive the arbitration claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On August 26, 1994, Mrs. Tuer filed a four count complaint in the circuit court. The circuit court dismissed St. Joseph Hospital, Inc. as a defendant. On September 13,1995, after a trial on the merits, the jury found for appellees. Mrs. Tuer filed a motion for a new trial, which the circuit court denied without a hearing. After the circuit court denied her motion for a new trial, Mrs. Tuer filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Mrs. Tuer argues that the circuit court erred by not admitting evidence that, subsequent to Mr. Tuer\u2019s death, appellees changed their surgical procedures and halted their practice of discontinuing the drug Heparin to patients with Mr. Tuer\u2019s clinical condition prior to surgery. Specifically, Mrs. Tuer insists that appellees\u2019 change in procedure, which qualifies as a subsequent remedial measure under Maryland Rule 5-407, was admissible (l).to prove the feasibility of restarting Heparin; and (2) as evidence to impeach Dr. McDonald\u2019s credibility. Appellees counter that the circuit court correctly excluded the subsequent remedial measure because feasibility was not contested, and it did not constitute impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">This case, like several cases that have come before this Court since the Court of Appeals adopted the New Maryland Rules of Evidence in 1994, requires this Court to interpret a rule of evidence that closely resembles a federal rule analogue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-407, which discusses the admission of subsequent remedial measures, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">(a) In General. \u2014 When, after an event, measures are taken which, if in effect at the time of the event, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measure is not admissible to prove negligent or culpable conduct in connection with the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">(b) Admissibility for Other Purposes. This Rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Maryland Rule 5-407 follows the Federal Rule 407<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with only minor stylistic changes. Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence </em>at 13 (1994); <em>see also </em>Alan D. Hornstein, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence </em>51 Md.L.Rev. 1032, 1051 (1995) (stating that Rule 5-407 is substantively the same as Federal Rule 407). Additionally, Rule 5-407, by not including that subsequent remedial evidence is admissible to prove the standard of care, overruled <em>Wilson v. Morris, </em>317 Md. 284, 563 A.2d 392 (1989) and existing Maryland law, which previously held that subsequent remedial evidence was admissible to prove the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The rule against admitting evidence of subsequent remedial measures, as articulated by Federal Rule 407 and Maryland Rule 5-407, is based on several policy considerations. Primarily, the rule for excluding subsequent remedial measures is based on safety concerns. As Judge Richard Posner explained, \u201cA major purpose of Rule 407 is to promote safety by removing the disincentive to make repairs (or take other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>safety measures) after an accident that would exist if the accident victim could use those measures as evidence of the defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Flaminio v. Honda Motor Co., </em>733 F.2d 463, 467 (7th Cir.1984); <em>accord Rimkus v. Northwest Colorado Ski Corp., </em>706 F.2d 1060, 1064 (10th Cir.1983); <em>Werner v. Upjohn, Co., </em>628 F.2d 848, 857 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 862, 66 L.Ed.2d 804 (1981); McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.407.5, at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Professor McLain describes additional policy considerations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">(1) The evidence has <em>low probative value </em>with regard to negligence or fault....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(3) To the extent that evidence of subsequent remedial measures is not probative of fault \u2014 and to the extent that the evidence may suggest that defendant believes that it had earlier not met the standard of due care\u2014 there is also the likelihood of <em>confusion of the jury </em>and <em>unfair prejudice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">McClain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.407.5, at 110 (emphasis in original). The rule excluding subsequent remedial evidence rejects the old saw that \u201cbecause the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it was foolish before,\u201d <em>Hart v. Lanceshire &amp; Yorkshire Ry. Co., </em>21 L.T.R.N.S. 261, 263 (1869).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The wording of Rule 5-407, coupled with the policies underlying the exclusion of subsequent remedial measures, evince an exclusionary approach that rejects the standard articulated by <em>Wilson. </em>Under this exclusionary approach, courts may only admit evidence of subsequent remedial measures to establish feasibility or to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. The exclusionary approach serves as a beacon, which warns courts that they \u201cmust exercise caution so as to avoid allowing the subsequent repair evidence when the offering party is essentially manufacturing an issue to waft the subsequent repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>evidence before the jury.\u201d David P. Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore, A Treatise on Evidence </em>\u00a7 2.8.1, at 2.116 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Both this Court and the Court of Appeals have in the past used federal case law to interpret Maryland Rules of Evidence that closely resemble their federal counterparts. Accordingly, in this case we shall follow suit and use federal cases that discuss Federal Rule 407 to aid us in our interpretive mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">A. Feasibility</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Appellant argues that appellees\u2019 change in procedure in administering Heparin was admissible under Rule 5-407\u2019s feasibility exception. Appellees insist that the feasibility in administering Heparin was never contested during the trial. Before this Court can determine whether feasibility was contested, however, we need to determine what the term feasibility means within the context of Rule 5-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Defining feasibility within the context of Rule 5-407 requires that we adopt one of two divergent approaches. The first option is the narrow approach that follows the plain meaning of feasibility. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>831 (1976) defines the term feasible as \u201ccapable of being done, executed, or effected: possible of realization.\u201d <em>Accord American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, </em>452 U.S. 490, 508-509, 101 S.Ct. 2478, 2490-2491, 69 L.Ed.2d 185 (1981) (adopting the <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition of feasible within the context of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b)(5)). Thus, under the narrow approach, the key question to ask is whether the subsequent remedial measure <em>could have been instituted. See, e.g., </em>Leonard, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.8.3, at 2:123-127; <em>see also Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 634, 637-638, <em>modified, </em>805 F.2d 337 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Cir.1986); <em>Flaminio, </em>733 F.2d at 468; <em>Werner v. Upjohn Co., Inc., </em>628 F.2d 848 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1080, 101 S.Ct. 862, 66 L.Ed.2d 804 (1981) (discussing feasibility in terms of economic and technological possibilities).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The other option defines feasibility more broadly. Under the broad approach, feasibility not only means \u201cpossible,\u201d but also means \u201ccapable of being utilized or dealt with successfully.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Malloy, </em>700 F.2d 1208, 1213 (8th Cir., 1983) (quoting the second definition listed in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>831 (1976)). The broad approach allows more subsequent remedial evidence to be admitted, and has only been adopted by one federal circuit. <em>Anderson, </em>700 F.2d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">This Court must interpret a rule or statute in accordance with its goals and purposes. <em>Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 359, 643 A.2d 906 (1994). Of the contrasting approaches presented to this Court, the narrow approach is more consistent with the policy underlying the exclusion of subsequent remedial evidence. Rule 5-407 operates to keep subsequent remedial evidence away from the jury except when parties contest that a certain remedial measure could not have been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The broad approach, on the other hand, is fatally, flawed. First, it blurs the line between the offer of subsequent remedial evidence to prove negligence and culpability, which is never allowed, and subsequent remedial evidence that establishes feasibility, which is only allowed when it is contested. The criteria used to determine whether something is feasible under the broad approach and whether a party is culpable are similar. This similarity causes problems differentiating between feasibility and culpability. The danger inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>blurring the distinction between feasibility and culpability is expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">Still, the distinction is extremely subtle, and because the subsequent repair evidence tends to prove the same element of the claim that it would be used to prove if offered for its forbidden purpose [culpability], there is significant danger that the party against whom it is offered will be prejudiced by its admission.... [W]hen offered to prove feasibility of precautionary measures, subsequent repair evidence more closely approaches the forbidden purpose. Jurors can be expected to have significant difficulty distinguishing between the permissible and impermissible uses of subsequent repair evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Leonard, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.8.3, at 2:124-125.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The broad approach\u2019s second deadly flaw is its inconsistency with basic tenets of statutory construction. The rules of construction are not literary tools intended to create subtle or forced definitions that run contrary to a statute\u2019s or rule\u2019s purpose. <em>See Ayres v. Townsend, </em>324 Md. 666, 672, 598 A.2d 470 (1991); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988); <em>see also State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation v. Belcher, </em>315 Md. 111, 119, 553 A.2d 691 (1989) (stating that the rules of construction should not be used to frustrate a legislative objective). In this case, the broad approach stretches the definition of feasibility beyond its ordinary meaning and establishes a definition that works against the exclusionary function of Rule 5-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The practical effect of the broad approach is to circumvent the exclusionary policy, breathe life into the overturned standard articulated in <em>Wilson v. Morris, </em>317 Md. 284, 563 A.2d 392 (1989), and allow prejudicial subsequent remedial evidence before the jury. We refuse to manipulate the canons of construction in a way that would operate as an end run on Rule 5-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Mrs. Tuer predicated her claim on proving that appellees\u2019 standard of care as of November 2, 1992 was negligent. Introducing evidence that, after Mr. Tuer died, appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>changed their procedure for administering Heparin to prove that it could have been administered to Mr. Tuer successfully would help establish appellees\u2019 negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no evidence that, at trial, appellees contested whether Heparin could have been restarted. In her brief, Mrs. Tuer admits that no defense witness testified that Heparin could not have been restarted. The testimony at trial supports Mrs. Tuer\u2019s concession and reveals that appellees and defense witnesses recognized that Heparin could have been restarted, but that Dr. McDonald did not restart Heparin because he believed the risks outweighed the benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Specifically, Dr. McDonald testified that, even though it was possible to restart Heparin, he rejected the idea. During cross-examination, Dr. McDonald testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Q. I am also correct, Doctor, you did not consider starting heparin at the time you postponed Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">A. No, sir. You are not correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">Q. You did consider it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">A. I am sure I would have considered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">Q. And?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">A. Heparin is a very important drug for a heart surgeon. We have used it every single day in every single patient and I am very familiar with the facts. The oversight in placing a patient on cardiopulmonary bypass would be a catastrophe. So I am sure I considered heparin and elected not to restart and there is a very sound reason for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">Q. So, in essence, what we \u2014 you do again when you are making this election to restart Heparin is to balance the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">A. The \u2014 that\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">Q. \u2014the benefits of restarting Heparin against the risk of an inadvertent carotid artery puncture, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>A. That is precisely what we did, and attempt to do with respect to this problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Additionally, defense witnesses Dr. Stuart, Dr. Nyhan, and Dr. Fortuin all testified about the medical risks of restarting Heparin. Their testimony presumed that Heparin could have been started, but that, based on their medical opinions, its risks outweighed its benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Mrs. Tuer insists that \u201cfeasibility was controverted by virtue of \u2018inferences\u2019 drawn from the defense\u2019s testimony.\u201d Arguing that a party chose not to perform a certain action because of the risk involved, however, is different than arguing that a party did not perform a task because it was physically unable to actually accomplish the task. As discussed <em>supra, </em>\u201cWhere a defendant argues about the trade-off involved in precautionary measures, it is not placing feasibility in issue.\u201d <em>Gauthier v. AMF, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 634, 638 (9th Cir.1986); <em>accord Flaminio v. Honda Motor Co., </em>733 F.2d at 468.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">B. Impeachment</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Mrs. Tuer argues that the change of procedure after Mr. Tuer\u2019s operation undermines Dr. McDonald\u2019s credibility with respect to his testimony that \u201cit would have been unsafe to restart Mr. Tuer\u2019s heparin\u201d after Mr. Tuer\u2019s surgery was postponed. Appellees counter that the subsequent change in procedure was not appropriate impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Generally, impeachment evidence is used to attack the credibility of a witness by questioning a witness\u2019s personal veracity or the reliability of his testimony. <em>See Smallwood v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990). Parties, however, are not allowed to use impeachment evidence as a ruse to get substantive evidence before the jury that the rules of evidence otherwise prohibit. <em>See Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 600, 636 A.2d 999 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In the context of subsequent remedial measures, mere contradictory testimony is not enough to warrant the admission of subsequent remedial measures for impeachment purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cIf \u2018impeachment\u2019 means simple contradiction, then the impeachment exceptions to Rule 407 would threaten to swallow the Rule itself.\u201d 1 Stephen A. Saltzburg et. al., <em>Federal Rules of Evidence Manual </em>p. 487 (6th ed. 1994, 1996 Cum.Supp.). Thus, in order to avoid having the impeachment exception swallow Rule 407 like the great fish swallowed Jonah, courts have required more than mere contradiction in order to allow subsequent remedial measures to be used for impeaching a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See, e.g., Wood v. Morbark Indus., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 1201, 1207-1208 (11th Cir.1995); <em>Harrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>981 F.2d 25, 31-32 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Kelly v. Crown Equipment Co., </em>970 F.2d 1273 (3rd Cir.1992); <em>Flaminio, </em>733 F.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Parties may use subsequent measures to affect the credibility of a witness by showing \u201cthat the witness is wrong or spoke dishonestly with respect to the particular fact (here, that the condition was safe or had not been changed).\u201d Leonard, <em>supra, </em>at 2:130.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, when a defendant testifies in a superlative nature, <em>e.g., </em>that \u201cthis is the safest practice known to medicine,\u201d subsequent remedial evidence provides more than mere contradiction and can, thereby, be used for im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>peaehment purposes. Saltzburg, <em>supra, </em>at 487; <em>see also Wood, </em>70 F.3d at 1207-1208; <em>Muzyka v. Remington Arms Co., </em>774 F.2d 1309, 1313 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">In this case, the change in administering Heparin prior to surgery had no bearing on Dr. McDonald\u2019s credibility as a witness. In order to impeach Dr. McDonald\u2019s statement, Mrs. Tuer had to demonstrate that Dr. McDonald thought that it was safe to restart Heparin. Instead, Dr. McDonald\u2019s statement evinces a doctor and a hospital that, as of November 2, 1992 and based on the scientific data and their professional opinion, believed that the risks of restarting Heparin outweighed the benefits. Additionally, Dr. McDonald\u2019s statement lacks the superlative tone that would otherwise warrant admitting subsequent remedial evidence for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">During the cross examination of Dr. McDonald the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">Q. Doctor, prior to November 2nd, 1992, in your practice of cardio thoracic surgery at Saint Joseph Hospital, were there any circumstances under which a patient with Mr. Tuer\u2019s clinical profile, and that being unstable angina, stabilized in the hospital for a period of time with heparin therapy, awaiting coronary artery bypass surgery, would not have had the heparin discontinued three to four hours prior to the surgery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">A. I don\u2019t believe so, because that was our policy at that time. It would have been a departure, and sitting here this morning I just can\u2019t think of a reason off hand why that could be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Mrs. Tuer argues that the circuit court erred by not allowing her to introduce the medical records of Kenneth Glauber to impeach Dr. McDonald about the above referenced answer. Appellees counter that the circuit court correctly excluded the medical records because the records were not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Evidence is only admissible if it is relevant. Md. Rule 5-402. Impeachment evidence is relevant if it affects a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990) (stating that impeachment evidence is used to attack a witness\u2019s credibility). Additionally, a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence based on lack of relevancy should not be disturbed unless the finding was an abuse of discretion. <em>Holt v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 578, 581, 438 A.2d 1386 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In this case, in order for Mr. Glauber\u2019s medical records to be relevant to impeach Dr. McDonald\u2019s statement, the clinical profiles of Mr. Tuer and Mr. Glauber needed to be similar. Mrs. Tuer, however, never established that Mr. Glauber and Mr. Tuer had the same clinical profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In fact, the record reveals that Mr. Glauber\u2019s clinical profile was significantly different from Mr. Tuer\u2019s clinical profile. Mr. Glauber was admitted to St. Joseph Hospital -with a left main stenosis. He arrived via an ambulance and was already on Heparin. His condition was so severe that he required surgery within twenty-four hours of being admitted. Thus, because the two patients had significantly different clinical profiles, Mr. Glauber\u2019s medical records were neither relevant nor proper for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Mrs. Tuer insists that the circuit court erred by preventing her from introducing a rebuttal witness. Specifically, Mrs. Tuer wanted to introduce Dr. Schwartz to discuss the risks associated with carotid artery punctures. Appellee maintains that Mrs. Tuer was not entitled to introduce rebuttal evidence on the puncture issue because she raised the issue first in her case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The Court of Appeals articulated the standard for determining what constitutes rebuttal evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAy\">When the defendant has concluded his testimony, the plaintiff, in those eases where the burden of proof rests on him and where in chief he has accordingly gone into his whole case, is entitled to introduce what is called rebuttal evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>dence-that is to say, evidence in regard to such new points and questions as were first opened by defendant\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A12\"><em>Jones v. State, </em>132 Md. 142, 148, 103 A. 459 (1918); <em>accord Fairfax Savings v. Ellerin, </em>94 Md.App. 685, 688, 619 A.2d 141 (1993), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>337 Md. 216, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995); <em>see also State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 270, 368 A.2d 445 (1977) (stating that rebuttal evidence is \u201cany competent evidence which explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, any new matter that has been brought into the case by the defense\u201d). The determination of what constitutes rebuttal evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Id.; Ellerin, </em>94 Md.App. at 698, 619 A.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">In this case, the issue of carotid artery punctures was first raised by Mrs. Tuer, not appellees. Mrs. Tuer\u2019s whole case was based on establishing that the risks of restarting Heparin were less than the risks of puncturing the carotid artery. Testimony in Mrs. Tuer\u2019s case-in-chief discussed the balance between restarting and not restarting Heparin. Accordingly, there is nothing in the record that supports a finding that the circuit court abused its discretion by not allowing Dr. Schwartz to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. Federal Rule 407 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">When, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-9\">. Mrs. Tuer argues that the public policy foundations that underlie Rule 5-407 are not applicable in this case. To support this argument, Mrs. Tuer points out that the events of this case occurred before the July 1, 1994 adoption of the new Maryland Rules of Evidence. It is enough to say that Rule 5-407 is applicable because this case was tried after it became effective. Thus, because Rule 5^407 is applicable, the policies underlying the exclusion of subsequent remedial measures are equally at play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. Professor McLain includes the following hypothetical to illustrate when feasibility is contested: \u201c[E]vidence that the defendant has built a fence would not be excluded by Rule 5-407 if the defendant contended that a fence could not be built, <em>i.e., </em>controverted feasibility.\u201d Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence </em>\u00a7 2.407.5, at 112 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\">. In her reply brief, Mrs. Tuer points out that Appellees' counsel objected both times that a direct question was put to a defense witness. Mrs. Tuer goes on to pose the question, \u201cIf feasibility wasn't controverted, then what harm could there have been in answering a question concerning feasibility?!\u2019 The harm is self evident; an answer would have undermined appellees\u2019 case by introducing subsequent remedial evidence to the jury where none was warranted. The question itself is based on the mistaken view that subsequent remedial evidence is not unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">.
