On November 2, 1995, his motion to suppress was denied and he proceeded to trial, pleading not guilty to an agreed statement of facts before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Friedman, J.). Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to four months incarceration. He noted a timely appeal and presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased slightly: Did the suppression hearing judge err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress? We conclude that she did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">On August 19, 1995, at approximately 7:50 p.m., Officer Reginald McNeil and Sergeant James Sharp of the Baltimore City Police Department responded to 1411 Mosander Way for a call of an assault. At the scene, Officer McNeil met with the victim, Keith Stancill, who informed the officer that he had been approached by appellant and his companion in the 1400 block of Mosander Way and that they had argued over money. A fight ensued and appellant and his companion struck the victim with their fists. The victim suffered no apparent injuries. Following the assault, appellant and his companion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>fled in a light-colored Dodge bearing Maryland license plate number CNP606.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim declined to file a report and Officer McNeil left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Shortly thereafter, at approximately 8:45 p.m., Officer McNeil returned to 1411 Mosander Way in response to a second call of an assault. The victim informed Officer McNeil that appellant and his companion had returned. According to the officer, Staneill was scared that he was \u201cgoing to get hurt\u201d and wanted to \u201cmake a report.\u201d A witness, Ms. Bullock, who resided at 1411 Mosander Way, where the victim was staying, told Officer McNeil that she called 911 because the men banged on her door and attempted to gain admittance to her house, looking for the victim. Ms. Bullock also reported that the men were carrying guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Officer McNeil described Staneill as frightened. The officer testified that the victim confirmed \u201cthat the guys were banging on the door looking for him.\u201d Officer McNeil also stated that, when appellant and his companion appeared at Ms. Bullock\u2019s residence, Staneill \u201cwas yelling in the background [to Ms. Bullock] not to let them know that he was there, not to open up the door.\u201d When the men did not gain entry to Ms. Bullock\u2019s residence, they left.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">While Officer McNeil was taking a report, a man identified as Riv arrived on the scene in an automobile. Riv stated that appellant and his companion were still in the area driving the Dodge previously identified by the victim. Officer McNeil broadcasted a description of the vehicle and the information regarding the weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Within minutes, Sergeant Sharp spotted the vehicle only two blocks from the Mosander Way address. He stopped the vehicle and removed appellant and his companion from it. He executed a \u201cfelony car stop\u201d, referring to a \u201chigh-risk car stop\u201d, because he thought the men were armed. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>men were patted down for weapons and the vehicle was checked, no weapons were recovered. The victim was brought to the scene and identified both men as the individuals who had assaulted him. Officer McNeil then arrested both men. In a search incident to appellant\u2019s arrest, four black-topped vials containing a white rock-like substance were recovered from appellant\u2019s person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">At the hearing, Officer McNeil explained that appellant was not charged with aggravated assault because no weapons were recovered. He said, \u201cI mean, for aggravated assault you need a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel argued, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">The arrest must be lawful or the search incident thereto is no good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">H: H5 sk H* H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">Art. 27, Section 594(B). It spells out to us ... what they can and cannot do in terms of arresting. This case simply does not fall within anything in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">sfc H* H* H* ^ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">This is not a felony. The charge is common law assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">sfs H\u00ed * H\u00ab *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">It did not happen in their presence. The officers, both of them on the witness stand, on cross-examination and direct, I did not see the assault happen, nor did I even ever see the victim, the so-called victim and the so-called defendants, together. Therefore, it is simply not within their presence. I don\u2019t know how he can really even argue that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">The only possible link that he even comes even close to, but not close enough, is, is this the common law crime of assault when committed with the intent to do great bodily harm. Again, you heard the case. The first assault, if it even occurred, was a \u201cfight,\u201d whatever that means, with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>injury, no injury visible to the officers, no injury reported by the victim, no weapons, no nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">A fight may not even be an assault, but assuming for the sake of argument that it is, it certainly is not an assault committed with an intent to do great bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">The second so-called possible assault would be when allegedly they came back to the house with supposedly weapons and banged on the door, without more. That\u2019s it. They never got in the house, they never go through the door,, they never shot at the door, they never shot at the person, they never threatened to shoot at anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">Assuming, again, for the sake of argument, that that all did occur, that\u2019s not an assault with the intent to do great bodily harm either, as evidenced, really, by the fact of what the officers ended up charging him with. They investigated it thoroughly, they charged, if anything, if my experience tells me, more than what they can prove. They err on the side of caution by lodging every charge they can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">What they charged was very simply assault, without more. They admitted, no, this was not an aggravated assault. That would be if there\u2019s a weapon involved, which they discovered apparently was not because the car went right from the scene, right around the corner, was caught, was searched, and they were searched and there were no weapons, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t have a handgun violation, so he can\u2019t hang it on that either because there are no guns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">So the bottom line, really, is that the only possible thing it could fall under, it doesn\u2019t fall under, it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not a misdemeanor committed in their presence. So it has to be an assault when committed with the intent to do great bodily harm, and that [sic] not the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-_\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">So the arrest here was the arrest for common law assault, when there was finally an ID. That\u2019s the arrest. That\u2019s not an arrest that they legally could do the way they did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Again, not to prohibit prosecution for the assault. They just can\u2019t use the evidence they got, and that\u2019s the bottom line.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The judge disagreed. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The Court finds that this was a search incidental to a valid arrest. The test is not whether the Defendant was charged with the crime of assault when committed with intent to do great bodily harm. The question is whether the police officer, when the police officer made the arrest without a warrant, had probable cause to believe that the crime of assault, when committed with intent to do great bodily harm, has been committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">I find that the police officers did have probable cause at that time to believe that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we consider only the record of the suppression hearing and not of the trial itself. <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749 (1987) (citing <em>Jackson v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 327, 332 n. 5, 449 A.2d 438, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 652 (1982)); <em>Aiken v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 557, 563, 647 A.2d 1229 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 89, 651 A.2d 854 (1995). We also extend great deference to the first-level fact finding of the suppression hearing judge and accept the facts as found, unless clearly erroneous. <em>Rid-dick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346-47, 574 A.2d 356 (1990). <em>See also Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Moreover, we must give due regard to the suppression hearing judge\u2019s \u201copportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 282, 600 A.2d 430 (1992). <em>See also Jones v. State, </em>111 Md.App. 456, 466, 681 A.2d 1190 (1996) (\u201c[A]n appellate court shall extend great deference to the suppression hearing judge\u2019s findings of first-level facts and assessments of credibility, unless those determinations are clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d) In addition, we review the evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d 1239; <em>Cherry v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 234, 237, 586 A.2d 70 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Nevertheless, as to the ultimate, conclusory fact of whether the arrest and subsequent search were valid, this Court must undertake its own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of this case. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d 1239; <em>Perkins, </em>83 Md.App. at 346, 574 A.2d 356. We do not consider whether the arresting officer had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Rather, this Court \u201cmust make its own <em>de novo </em>determination of whether probable cause existed in light of the not clearly erroneous first-level findings of fact and assessments of credibility.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>111 Md.App. at 466, 681 A.2d 1190. <em>See also Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1657.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Appellant contends that his warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor assault offense was illegal because the assault did not occur in the officer\u2019s presence. He claims that even if the police had probable cause to believe that appellant had assaulted the victim, they did not have probable cause to believe that the assault was committed with the intent to do great bodily harm. Appellant argues that such intent was lacking, as there was only a fistfight between the men, the victim sustained no apparent injuries, appellant and his companion did not assault the victim when they had returned to the residence on the second occasion, and no weapons were ever recovered, even though the vehicle was located within minutes after the police broadcasted the description of the vehicle. Therefore, he argues that the search was not incidental to a valid arrest and, accordingly, the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>S.Ct. 1684, 1691-92, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), guarantees, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d \u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not proscribe all state-initiated searches and seizures; it merely proscribes those which are unreasonable.\u201d <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 250, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1803, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991). \u201c[Sjearches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are <em>per se </em>unreasonable ... subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (footnotes omitted). A warrantless search incident to an individual\u2019s lawful arrest is one of these exceptions. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 476-77, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); <em>Ricks v. State, </em>322 Md. 183, 188-89, 586 A.2d 740 (1991). In <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer\u2019s safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A09\"><em>Id. </em>at 762-63, 89 S.Ct. at 2040.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Appellant, as we have noted, argues that the arrest was illegal and thus the search incident to it was unlawful. \u201cThe legality of the arrest and, therefore, of the reasonableness of the search and seizure incident to the arrest, turns on the law of the State in which the arrest was made, absent a controlling federal statute.\u201d <em>Stanley v. State, </em>230 Md. 188, 191, 186 A.2d 478 (1962) (citing <em>United States v. Di Re, </em>332 U.S. 581, 589, 68 S.Ct. 222, 226, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948); <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 15-16, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369-70, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948); <em>United States v. Rabinowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 60, 70 S.Ct. 430, 432-33, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950)). In Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>warrantless arrests are controlled by Md.Code (1957, 1992 RepLVol., 1995 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 594B, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u00a7 594B.

State, </em>111 Md.App. at 464, 681 A.2d 1190. In this case, it is undisputed that appellant did not commit a felony; assault is a common law misdemeanor. <em>Cain v. State, </em>34 Md.App. 446, 453, 367 A.2d 47 (1977); Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Criminal Law </em>692-94 (2d ed. 1986). Nor did the alleged assault occur in the presence of a police officer. Therefore, a lawful arrest could only be made if the alleged offense fell within the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 594B(e) and 594B(f)(viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">Art. 27 \u00a7 594 B(e) sets forth several criteria that must be supported by probable cause in order to validate a warrantless arrest for the offense of assault with intent to do great bodily harm, set forth in \u00a7 594 B(f)(viii). The statute requires that the officer must have probable cause to believe not only that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the offense was committed, but also that it was committed by the arrestee. In addition, the officer must have probable cause with respect to at least one of the three disjunctive factors listed in \u00a7 594 B(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In this case, the trial judge expressly found that the officer had probable cause to believe that the offense of assault with intent to harm had been committed. While she did not articulate a specific finding for each factor listed in \u00a7 594B(e), \u201c[jjudges are presumed to know the law. Absent an indication to the contrary, we must assume that judges apply the law correctly to the case before them.\u201d <em>Hebb v.

Moreover, based on her ultimate determination, the court \u201cobviously found the police officers\u2019 testimony during the ... hearing to be credible....\u201d <em>Jones, </em>111 Md.App. at 466, 681 A.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">On review, our task is to decide, <em>de novo, </em>whether probable cause existed to support the warrantless arrest of appellant. <em>Jones, </em>111 Md.App. at 466, 681 A.2d at 1195. Based on our independent review, we are satisfied that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u201cThe rule of probable cause is a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction but more evidence than that which would arouse a mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 403, 545 A.2d 1281 (1988). <em>See also Collins v. State, </em>322 Md. 675, 680, 589 A.2d 479 (1991); <em>Malcolm v.

Moreover, it is based on the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable people act and is assessed by considering the totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>circumstances in a given situation. <em>Doering, </em>313 Md. at 403, 545 A.2d 1281; <em>Collins, </em>322 Md. at 680, 589 A.2d 479 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Officer McNeil testified that, upon first encountering the victim, he learned that appellant and a companion had accosted the victim, beaten him with their fists, and then fled. A short time later, appellant and his companion returned to the scene seeking the victim. They knocked on the door of the house in which appellant was staying and attempted to gain admittance. According to Ms. Bullock, who resided in the house, they carried handguns. The victim was quite frightened, and feared he would be shot. Indeed, although he declined to file a report after the first incident, he was willing to make a report after the second occurrence. Having been advised that the men had guns, and considering that this was the second incident within a short period of time, coupled with the victim\u2019s expressed fear that he would be shot, the police reasonably concluded that, \u201cunless ... immediately arrested\u201d, the \u201cperson may cause injury\u201d to another. \u00a7 594 B(e)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Based on this evidence, the trial court concluded that the police arrested appellant based on probable cause to believe that he committed an assault with intent to do great bodily harm. We agree that the evidence adduced established probable cause to believe that the offense had been committed, that appellant had committed the offense, and that, unless appellant was immediately arrested, he might cause injury to the victim. Although no weapons were recovered from appellant or the vehicle in which he was travelling, an independent witness testified the men had guns. The weapons could have been left somewhere after appellant departed the scene. It is also of no moment that the victim was not injured when appellant returned to the scene carrying the handgun. An assault does not require that the victim sustain an injury. <em>See Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. 447, 457, 488 A.2d 962 (1985) (quoting R.
