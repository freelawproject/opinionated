The three principal issues are whether the Circuit Court for Washington County, in a suit by appellant Elizabeth Farah against the estate of John M. Sanderson, Jr., erred in declining to admit (1) Elizabeth\u2019s testimony concerning her reasons for performing services for Mr. Sanderson and his wife, (2) testimony of Elizabeth\u2019s husband, J. Ramsay Farah, concerning conversations he had with Mr. Sanderson and Elizabeth, and (3) testimony of three non-party witnesses concerning statements made by Mr. Sanderson of his intention to give money to Elizabeth and Ramsay. Items (1) and (2) require us to determine whether the trial court properly.prohibited Elizabeth and Ramsay from testifying under Md.Code Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. art., \u00a7 9-116, commonly referred to as the dead man\u2019s statute. The third item presents a hearsay question.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. On July 23, 1993, Elizabeth filed two claims against Mr. Sanderson\u2019s estate in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Washington County. The dispute arose over an alleged contract by Mr. Sanderson to make a bequest of $110,000 to Ramsay and Elizabeth in exchange for Elizabeth\u2019s agreement to care for Mrs. Sander-son. After Mr. Sanderson died on February 25, 1993, the Farahs learned that he had failed to make the promised bequest in his will. The first claim for $100,000, filed jointly by Elizabeth and Ramsay, was based on Mr. Sanderson\u2019s oral promise to leave Elizabeth and Ramsay $100,000 upon his death as payment for services Elizabeth had rendered to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Sanderson and his wife. The second claim for $10,000, filed by Elizabeth individually, was based on Mr. Sanderson\u2019s oral promise to reimburse Elizabeth for items she had purchased for the Sandersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The evidence at trial showed that the Farahs and Sander-sons developed a close friendship after they met at a church function in 1985. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Sanderson\u2019s health began to decline, and the Sandersons employed several home care agencies, which, for various reasons, proved unsatisfactory. Around 1989, Elizabeth assumed daily responsibility for Mrs. Sanderson\u2019s care and for all the Sandersons\u2019 household chores, including laundry, meal preparation, and cleaning. The Farahs maintain that Elizabeth undertook those responsibilities in return for Mr. Sanderson\u2019s promise to make a bequest of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">On May 16, 1995, the Orphans\u2019 Court transmitted the following two questions to the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c1. Did the decedent herein, John M. Sanderson, Jr. make a valid, enforceable contract during his lifetime to bequeath to the claimant, Elizabeth Farah, the sum of $10,000.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkL\">2. Did the decedent herein, John M. Sanderson, Jr. make a valid, enforceable contract during his lifetime to bequeath to the claimants, Elizabeth Farah and J. Ramsay Farah, the sum of $100,000.00?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Prior to trial, Ramsay and Elizabeth Farah assigned and transferred their joint interest in the $100,000 claim to Elizabeth individually, thereby making her the only plaintiff/claimant in the circuit court proceeding. Despite the assignment of interest to and substitution of Elizabeth in the $100,000 claim, the circuit court ruled <em>in limine </em>that Ramsay was still a \u201cparty\u201d under Maryland\u2019s dead man\u2019s statute and barred him from testifying at the trial about any statements made by or transactions with Mr. Sanderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">At trial, Elizabeth testified on direct examination that for approximately two and a half years \u201cshe cared for and performed numerous household chores on a daily basis\u201d for Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Sanderson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was then asked \u201cwhy did you do, at the Sanderson home, all the things that you said you\u2019ve done on a daily basis, and weekends and sometimes at night?\u201d After defense counsel objected, plaintiffs counsel proffered that Elizabeth would testify that she did those things \u201cbecause she understood she was going to be compensated.\u201d The court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Ramsay\u2019s testimony at trial was also riddled with objections from defense counsel. In addition to prohibiting Ramsay from testifying about conversations he had with Mr. Sanderson regarding compensation for his wife, the court sustained appellee\u2019s objections to questions about a conversation Ramsay had with Elizabeth regarding her decision to care for Mrs. Sanderson.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">\u201cQ. [0]n what basis did you ask your wife if she would do the job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">[Objection sustained.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Q. Without any reference to Mr. Sanderson, what did you tell your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">[Objection sustained.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">Q. As a result of your discussion with your wife, what did she do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">A. She accepted the work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">Q. What work are you referring to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">A. To take care of Mrs. Sanderson and Mr. Sanderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">[Objection and motion to strike.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">THE COURT: Sustained, jury will disregard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The court also prohibited Ramsay from testifying about whether he ever talked with Elizabeth about compensation for caring for Mrs. Sanderson. At the conclusion of direct examination of Ramsay, appellant\u2019s counsel proffered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">\u201c[I]f asked, Dr. Farah would testify that he had a conversation with Jack Sanderson at the time home care services were, uh, having a problem with those, that Jack Sanderson asked him if Elizabeth would care for Delores on a daily basis as needed and if she would agree to do so for compensation. And that he, Ramsay, Dr. Farah would testify, uh, agreed that there would be a payment of a hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for their services, for the rest of Delores\u2019 life, and, uh, further that Dr. Farah told Jack Sanderson that he preferred not to have the payment during Jack Sanderson\u2019s life but at his death, uh, for tax reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The court sustained objections to admission of that testimony based on the dead man\u2019s statute. The court also excluded as hearsay the testimony of three other witnesses who would have testified that Mr. Sanderson told them that he was going to give the Farahs $110,000.00 in return for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In response to appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of appellant\u2019s case, the circuit court filed an opinion and order on November 16, 1995 that answered in the negative the two questions posited by the Orphans\u2019 Court and granted appellee\u2019s motion for judgment. In the opinion, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">\u201c[T]he Plaintiff, Elizabeth Farah, as well as Elizabeth Farah and J. Ramsay Farah, together, have failed to establish the existence of a contract between them and John M. Sander-son, Jr. for either ... $10,000.00 ... or for ... $100,000.00. The Plaintiffs in this case have simply been unable to adduce testimony of the existence of a valid, enforceable contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">From this order appellant appealed to this Court. We now affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Elizabeth Farah\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The Maryland dead man\u2019s statute, codified in Md.Code Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. art., \u00a7 9-116, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>party to a proceeding by or against a personal representative, heir, devisee, distributee, or legatee as such, in which a judgment or decree may be rendered for or against them, or by or against an incompetent person, may not testify concerning any transaction with or statement made by the dead or incompetent person, personally or through an agent since dead, unless called to testify by the opposite party, or unless the testimony of the dead or incompetent person has been given already in evidence in the same proceeding concerning the same transaction or statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The purpose of the dead man\u2019s statute is to seal the lips of a party in a proceeding \u201cby or against\u201d a personal representative about facts that could be disputed only by the deceased. <em>Reddy v. Mody, </em>39 Md.App. 675, 679, 388 A.2d 555, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 736 (1978). In <em>Reddy, </em>we recognized that the statute can create an \u201cinjustice to the survivor\u201d and, therefore, must be construed strictly in order \u201cto disclose as much evidence as the rule will allow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681-82, 388 A.2d 555. We are, nevertheless, mindful of the statute\u2019s underlying purpose: \u201cpreventing self-interested perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 388 A.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">Obviously, the dead man\u2019s statute barred Elizabeth from testifying that she had an agreement or contract with Mr. Sanderson. Based upon the statute, the trial court also excluded the proffered testimony of Elizabeth that she had performed services for Delores because she understood that she was going to be compensated. The distinction between the clearly prohibited statement \u2014 \u201cMr. Sanderson contracted with me\u201d \u2014 and the proffered one \u2014 \u201cI cared for Mrs. Sander-son because I expected to be paid\u201d \u2014 is not discemable for purposes of the dead man\u2019s statute when the only basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>expectation of payment was an agreement by Mr. Sanderson to make the payment. Absent that inferred basis, the testimony would have been irrelevant. We find, therefore, that Elizabeth\u2019s testimony that she \u201cunderstood she was going to be compensated\u201d as a direct result of an agreement with Mr. Sanderson was properly barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Exclusion of Ramsay Farah\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Prior to trial, the circuit court ruled that, despite the fact that Ramsay and Elizabeth assigned and transferred their interest in the $100,000 claim to Elizabeth individually, Ramsay was still a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of the dead man\u2019s statute, and, therefore, he was barred from testifying about a conversation he had with Mr. Sanderson regarding compensation to be paid to Elizabeth. Elizabeth also challenges the court\u2019s exclusion of Ramsay\u2019s testimony regarding conversations he had with Elizabeth about her decision to care for Mrs. Sander-son. The gist of each of those conversations was that, in return for caring for the Sandersons, Elizabeth would receive payment on Mr. Sanderson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Elizabeth argues that the court erred in excluding Ramsay\u2019s testimony about his conversation with Mr. Sander-son because, after the assignment of his interest in the $100,-000 claim and his withdrawal from the case, Ramsay was no longer a party and his testimony was not subject to the restrictions of the dead man\u2019s statute. We do not dispute Elizabeth\u2019s claim that, by its express terms, the statute applies only to the \u201ctestimony of a party to a cause.\u201d <em>Montgomery Co. v. Herlihy, </em>83 Md.App. 502, 512, 575 A.2d 784, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990). We previously explained that, \u201c[t]he persons excluded from testifying [by the dead man\u2019s statute] are not those with an interest of any sort, but rather traditional real parties in interest and their representatives.\u201d <em>Trupp v. Wolff, </em>24 Md.App. 588, 602, 335 A.2d 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 757 (1975). The spouse or child of a party has been permitted to testify in his or her spouse\u2019s or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>parent\u2019s favor, for example, even though the witness possibly stood to benefit in the proceedings. <em>E.g., Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>187 Md. 635, 51 A.2d 264 (1947) (husband permitted to testify as to promises decedent made to wife); <em>Marx v. Marx, </em>127 Md. 373, 96 A. 544 (1916) (son permitted to testify regarding promises decedent made to mother); <em>Trupp v. Wolff, supra </em>(mother permitted to testify in daughter\u2019s claim against stepfather\u2019s estate). Consequently, any financial benefit Ramsay expected to receive as Elizabeth\u2019s husband from her recovery would not, in and of itself, disqualify him from testifying. Nevertheless, we believe that, in this case, the court did not err in barring Ramsay from testifying about conversations with either Elizabeth or Mr. Sanderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This is, essentially, a question of statutory construction and application. In construing a statute, our role is to \u201cascertain and carry out the true intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>C.S. v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>343 Md. 14, 24, 680 A.2d 470 (1996). To discern the legislative intent, we \u201cconsider the general purpose, aim, or policy behind the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We have discovered only three cases on point. Two of them support appellant\u2019s view that the statute applies only to persons who are actual, technical parties to the action and that, if the witness, whose testimony would otherwise be excluded, has assigned his or her claim to another, the witness is no longer a party and may testify. <em>See Witte v. Koeppen, </em>11 S.D. 598, 79 N.W. 831 (1899); <em>Evans v. Mason, </em>82 Ariz. 40, 308 P.2d 245 (1957). In <em>General Bonding &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. McCurdy, </em>183 S.W. 796 (Tex.Civ.App.1916), the Texas Court took a different view and precluded the assignor witness from testifying. At 799, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cIf every person who claims to have a contract with a deceased person can, by assigning his claim, free himself of the inhibition of the statute against testifying to transactions with the deceased, the statute for all practical purposes, would be rendered nugatory, and might as well be abolished. It may well be doubted whether the statute is a good one, but, as long as it remains the law, the courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>while not extending it, will give it the practical purpose thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Our application of the dead man\u2019s statute to Ramsay\u2019s testimony is guided by the prior pronouncements of the Court of Appeals and of this Court. The Court of Appeals has explained that the general purpose of the dead man\u2019s statute is to impose silence upon interested parties as to transactions with or statements by the decedent. <em>Snyder v. Crabbs, </em>263 Md. 28, 29, 282 A.2d 6 (1971). In <em>Reddy v. Mody, </em>we underscored the fact that, although the language of the statute has been amended, its \u201cmeaning and purpose have remained the same.\u201d 39 Md.App. at 683, 388 A.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Appellant concedes that, if Ramsay had remained a party to the proceeding, the dead man\u2019s statute would have excluded testimony from both him and his wife relating to the alleged agreement they had with Mr. Sanderson. That agreement, as noted, was with both Elizabeth and Ramsay. We agree with the Texas Court that it would frustrate the entire purpose of the statute if a claimant, who was in fact in concert with the decedent, were permitted to circumvent the dead man\u2019s statute simply by assigning his claim to a third party, and then assert the status of a non-party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Although Ramsay was no longer a <em>named party </em>in the legal proceeding, we simply cannot ignore the fact that he was both a party to the contract with Mr. Sanderson and a party in the original complaint. Furthermore, as Ramsay never presented any evidence regarding the terms of his assignment, we are unsure as to what interest he may have retained in the contract claim. Although ordinarily the term \u201cparty\u201d is used to designate the opposing litigant in a judicial proceeding, in <em>Reddy, </em>we explained that for purposes of the dead man\u2019s statute \u201ca party is one who has an interest in the property sought <em>or a person having a direct pecuniary and proprietary interest in the outcome of the case.\u201d </em>39 Md.App. at 682, 388 A.2d 555 (emphasis added). Therefore, regardless of whether Ramsay remained a <em>named plaintiff, </em>in considering the underlying purpose of the dead man\u2019s statute, he continued to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>real party in interest </em>and was not competent to testify as to agreements with Mr. Sanderson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We also find that the trial court correctly excluded Ramsay\u2019s testimony concerning discussions that he had with Elizabeth about her decision to work for the Sandersons. Appellant\u2019s questions on this matter were simply veiled attempts to admit testimony that Elizabeth was working for the Sandersons because of Mr. Sanderson\u2019s promise to make a bequest in his will. As the Court of Appeals explained: \u201cIt should be obvious that if she could not testify to these matters herself, she could not render them admissible by the simple expedient of telling them to\u201d her husband. <em>Jones v. Selvaggi, </em>216 Md. 1, 10, 139 A.2d 246 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">IIL,</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Three Non-Party Witnesses\u2019 Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Appellant complains that the circuit court erred in excluding the testimony of three non-party witnesses as to Mr. Sanderson\u2019s intention, upon his death, to pay $110,000 to Elizabeth and Ramsay. Undoubtedly, that evidence was offered to prove the truth of an out-of-court statement and therefore constituted hearsay. The issue is whether it is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Appellant argues that the witnesses\u2019 statements fall within three recognized exceptions \u2014 state of mind, admission of predecessor in interest, and declaration against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>First, appellant argues that the testimony should have been admitted under Md. Rule 5-803(b)(3), commonly referred to as the \u201cstate of mind\u201d or \u201cstatement of intent\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. Under this exception, certain forward-looking statements of intent are admissible to prove that the declarant subsequently took a later action in accordance with his stated intent. <em>See Ebert v. Ritchey, </em>54 Md.App. 388, 398, 458 A.2d 891, <em>cert. denied, </em>296 Md. 414 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1210, 104 S.Ct. 2399, 81 L.Ed.2d 356 (1984). In <em>Ebert, </em>we affirmed the admission of hearsay statements under the state of mind exception to explain why the decedent placed his brother\u2019s name on five bank accounts. In the present case, however, no <em>action </em>is alleged. Instead, appellant is challenging Mr. Sanderson\u2019s <em>inaction </em>\u2014 his failure to include the Farahs in his will. Even if Mr. Sanderson intended to make a gift to the Farahs and mentioned that intention to others, the fact of the matter is that ultimately no such bequest was ever made. Because the witnesses\u2019 statements were not offered to explain Mr. Sanderson\u2019s future conduct, the state of mind exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Elizabeth next maintains that the statements are admissions of appellee\u2019s predecessor in interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Mannix v. Baumgardner, </em>184 Md. 600, 42 A.2d 124 (1945), she claims that Mr. Sanderson\u2019s statements demonstrated the existence of his contract with the Farahs. <em>Mannix </em>involved a dispute over the decedent\u2019s oral contract to devise to his stepdaughter all his real estate if she moved into his house and cared for him. After that agreement, the decedent executed a will in his stepdaughter\u2019s favor. Several months later he executed a second will in favor of his sister. On appeal, the estate challenged the trial court\u2019s admission of the first will into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Although the underlying facts of <em>Mannix </em>are analogous to Elizabeth\u2019s claim, we find the two cases distinguishable. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>believe the <em>Mannix </em>Court upheld the admission by the decedent \u2014 in the form of the first will \u2014 because there was \u201cdirect testimony ... that a contract was made, and this [was] corroborated by a number of circumstances\u201d including the will. <em>Id. </em>at 605, 42 A.2d 124. In upholding the admission of the will, the Court of Appeals wrote that \u201c[t]he execution of the will was a fact of a <em>corroboratory </em>character bearing upon the question of the existence of the contract, though not sufficient, standing alone, to establish it.\u201d <em>Mannix, supra </em>at 607, 42 A.2d 124 (emphasis added). The evidence in <em>Mannix </em>contrasts sharply with the instant case, which contains no \u201cdirect\u201d evidence of a contract between the Farahs and Mr. Sanderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Finally, Elizabeth claims the declaration against interest exception applies as set forth in Md. Rule 5-804(b)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cA statement which was at the time of its making so contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, so tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or so tended to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that \u00e1 reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Specifically, Elizabeth argues that Mr. Sanderson\u2019s statement that he \u201cwas going to give $110,000 for all they had done for him,\u201d amounts to an acknowledgment of indebtedness or a declaration against pecuniary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The declaration against interest exception is based on the notion that statements acknowledging indebtedness are presumptively reliable, since a reasonable person would not acknowledge indebtedness unless it were true. 6 L. McLain, Maryland Practice, \u00a7 804(3).1 (1987). For such evidence to be admissible, however, the trial judge must be satisfied that the statement was, in fact, against the declarant\u2019s interest and that the declarant understood that his statement could cause him a loss of money (or property or liberty). <em>See State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 12, 526 A.2d 955 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Applying these principles to the proffered testimony, we do not believe that Mr. Sanderson\u2019s statements come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>within the declaration against interest exception. We have explained that \u201cdeclarations against interest ... include acknowledgment of facts which would give rise to a liability for tort or ... breach of contract.\u201d <em>Houck v. DeBonis, </em>88 Md.App. 85, 93, 379 A.2d 765, <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 733 (1977). In the present case, however, there is no acknowledgement of indebtedness which would give rise to a tort or contract claim. Rather, Mr. Sanderson\u2019s statements to the three witnesses indicate a wish to make a gift to the Farahs at some future date. A gift with reference to a future time \u201cis only a promise without consideration, and cannot be enforced in law or equity.\u201d <em>Rudo v. Karp, </em>80 Md.App. 424, 430, 564 A.2d 100 (1989) <em>(quoting Berman v. Leckner, </em>193 Md. 177, 182, 66 A.2d 392 (1949)). Consequently, Mr. Sanderson could revoke the gift at any time. Because the statements do not acknowledge an obligation enforceable in court, the declarations are not admissible under the statement against interest exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the trial court properly excluded the testimony of the three non-party witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-16\">. Prior to Mrs. Sanderson\u2019s death in 1992, Elizabeth claimed that she was responsible for \"house cleaning, laundry, shopping, meal preparation, and personal hygiene services.\u201d After Mrs. Sanderson died, Elizabeth said that she continued to provide \"house cleaning and housing services\u201d to Mr. Sanderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\">. We do not believe this decision contradicts any prior applications of the statute permitting testimony from children or spouses who, undeniably, stood to gain simply by virtue of their relationship with a party. <em>See, e.g., Marx v.
