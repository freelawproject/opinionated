Consalvi and Edward C. Kelley, were arrested in the Commonwealth pursuant to formal demands by the Governor of Kansas for their rendition. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 11-20R. Accompanying these demands were papers including a complaint, subscribed by two Kansas law enforcement officers and sworn to before a Kansas magistrate, and an arrest warrant issued by the same magistrate, which recited his finding of probable cause to believe that the petitioners committed the offenses charged. Each petitioner filed for habeas corpus in accordance with G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 19. A judge of the Superior Court denied the relief sought. After review by the Appeals Court, <em>Consalvi, petitioner, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 729 (1977), we granted an application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The petitioners do not maintain that the papers submitted by the Governor of Kansas have been improperly authenticated or that they fail to comply on their face with the requirements of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 14. <em>Murphy, petitioner, </em>321 Mass. 206, 211-214 (1947). Nor is it argued that the petitioners are not the persons sought by Kansas. See <em>Maldonado, petitioner, </em>364 Mass. 359, 362 (1973). Rather, the petitioners\u2019 single contention on appeal is that the Fourth Amendment mandates an independent judicial finding of probable cause in advance of rendition \u2014 a determination they insist is absent in their cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Because we agree with the petitioners that rendition must be preceded by a judicial determination of probable cause, and for the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the petitioners should be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The threshold question we face is whether the Fourth Amendment right to a judicial probable cause determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>tian precedent to postarrest detention, <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103 (1975), is applicable to rendition arrests. We hold that it is. \"[T]he Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\u201d <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, supra </em>at 114. It seems manifestly clear that the restraint of liberty incident to interstate rendition is no less substantial than the detention occasioned by the execution of a prosecutor\u2019s information, the procedure assailed in <em>Gerstein. </em>\"At best, [rendition] means an extended period of detention, involving custody pending administrative arrangements in two states as well as forced travel in between. At worst it means separation from a familiar jurisdiction and effective denial of the support of family, friends and familiar advisors.\u201d <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>528 F.2d 929, 930 (1st Cir. 1976). See <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>385 F.2d 670, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1967). Accordingly, we think the procedural protection of a prior judicial finding of probable cause is constitutionally required in order to prevent wrongful rendition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>In holding that a judicial finding of probable cause must precede interstate rendition, however, we do not believe that the Commonwealth, as the asylum State, must always make an independent judgment that probable cause exists. The Fourth Amendment does not stretch that far.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the documents submitted by the demanding State demonstrate that \"a judicial officer or tribunal there had found probable cause, Massachusetts would not need to find probable cause anew, nor would it need to review the adequacy of the [demanding State\u2019s] determination.\u201d <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, supra </em>at 931.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, where an indictment or an arrest warrant accompanies a demand for interstate rendition we will presume that the demanding State has conducted an independent judicial determination of probable cause in accordance with constitutional principles, see <em>Puopolo, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 868 (1977), and will carry our inquiry no further. However, where a petitioner can show that a demanding State\u2019s arrest warrant or indictment procedure does not guarantee the requisite judicial finding of probable cause, see <em>Moore, petitioner, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 399 (1974), we will require the demanding State to provide sufficient documentation or other evidence to demonstrate that a constitutionally valid determination of probable cause had been made in the demanding State. If such information is not forthcoming within a reasonable period of time, rendition should be denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>In light of these principles, we consider the petitioners\u2019 claim. We note at the outset that the papers accompanying the rendition demands include an arrest warrant, signed by a Kansas magistrate, which recites a finding of probable cause. A document of this kind presumptively establishes the existence of a probable cause finding and provides a sufficient basis for interstate rendition.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, a rendition court\u2019s Fourth Amendment inquiry ordinarily will be satisfied by the presence of an arrest warrant from the demanding State. Only where the petitioner can demonstrate that the demanding State\u2019s arrest procedure is constitutionally suspect do we require the rendition court to look beyond the warrant. Here, however, we are obliged to conclude that further inquiry is justified because the issuance in Kansas of an arrest warrant, though stated to be on a finding of probable cause, does not require a demonstration that would satisfy the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-2302 (Weeks 1974), provides: \"If the magistrate finds from the complaint, or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint or from other evidence, that there is probable cause to believe both that a crime has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue.\u201d It is instructive to observe, however, that, according to the governing case law in existence at the time the instant warrant was issued, a properly verified complaint was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>considered sufficient authority from which a finding of probable cause could be made and under which a warrant could be issued. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>216 Kan. 14, 17 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, 214 </em>Kan. 739, 741 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Addington, </em>205 Kan. 640, 644 (1970). Indeed, \"[n]ormally, the warrant [was] issued solely on the basis of a complaint filed with the magistrate.\u201d Meyer, Arrest under the New Kansas Criminal Code, 20 U. Kan. L. Rev. 685, 693 (1972). Importantly, the complaint need do no more than set out a crime in the words of the statute, without furnishing a basis for determining that the allegations made therein are based on personal knowledge of the complainants or on reliable information imparted to them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Taken together, these procedures create a substantial probability that the arrest warrant for the petitioners could have issued solely on the constitutionally improper basis of an informant\u2019s conclusions unsupported by personal knowledge or reliable information. See <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 480, 481,486-487 (1958); <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 112-114 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Our belief that the uncertainty attendant to such procedures is constitutionally unacceptable is underscored by a similar finding of the Supreme Court of Kansas. Passing on a habeas corpus petition identical to the ones offered here, the Kansas court held that it would not permit rendition in the absence of an independent probable cause determination in that State\u2019s courts. <em>Wilbanks </em>v. <em>State, 224 </em>Kan. 66 (1978). In so holding, the court expressly \"disapproved\u201d its previous <em>cases </em>\u2014 Giddings, <em>Woods, Addington </em>\u2014 which had permitted the issuance of an arrest warrant on the mere authority of a verified complaint. <em>Wilbanks </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 75. Keeping in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>mind that the Kansas arrest warrant in the instant cases was issued before the date of the <em>Wilbanks </em>opinion, we are compelled by our own examination of Kansas practice to conclude that Kansas\u2019s procedure for the issuance of an arrest warrant has failed to provide the \"reliable determination of probable cause\u201d that the Fourth Amendment demands. <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 124-125 (1975). In these circumstances, we cannot fully credit the Kansas arrest warrant or the Kansas magistrate\u2019s recital of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Thus, since we cannot assume that the instant Kansas arrest warrant represents a judicial finding of probable cause that the petitioners committed the crimes charged, we must examine more fully the papers accompanying the Kansas extradition demands. The single relevant document is a lengthy and detailed complaint alleging that the petitioners were involved in the unlawful importation of marihuana with intent to sell. However, the complaint, treated as an affidavit, is incapable of supporting a finding of probable cause because it fails to state if these allegations are based on either the personal knowledge of the two officers or on information supplied by reliable informers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>362 Mass. 24, 26-28 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boswell, </em>374 Mass. 263, 268-269 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>374 Mass. 142, 148 (1977). Although the Kansas magistrate might well have taken oral testimony from the officers supplying this necessary information, no evidence of such colloquies exists in the papers accompanying the rendition demands. Thus, on the basis of the present record, we are unable to permit rendition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Because we find no basis for interstate rendition, the appropriate result in these cases is the immediate discharge of the petitioners. If they wish, Kansas authorities may, of course, bring new rendition proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Despite the result here, we do not intend to say that every failure of documentary presentation by a demanding State must necessarily result in discharge of the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tioner. A reasonably brief continuance in proceedings, while the demanding State moves with expedition to supplement its documentary array, might well permit continued custody of the accused. See <em>Pippin </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>188 Colo. 385, 391 (1975). We shall decide that case when and if it arises. In the cases before us, however, the rendition proceedings were commenced in this Commonwealth over two years ago, and we discern no effort by the Kansas authorities to provide supplementary documentation. It seems fair to conclude that the Kansas authorities are content to test here the acceptability of their <em>pre-Wilbanks </em>proceedings. As we have said, these are not sufficiently protective of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Therefore, the petitioners are to be discharged forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\"> The petitioners have been released on personal recognizance pending final disposition.
