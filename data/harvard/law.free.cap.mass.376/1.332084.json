She received concurrent life sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, from the judgments of conviction; consolidated herewith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>is an appeal from the denial of her postconviction motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">The defendant contends that her convictions should be reversed and a new trial ordered because of the unsatisfactory character and thinness of the case made against her and because of the illegal withholding by the prosecution of exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">We conclude that these two related weaknesses put the convictions so far in question that we are obliged to set aside the verdicts with leave to the Commonwealth to retry the case. It becomes necessary to examine the facts or alleged facts in considerable detail, and in particular to examine the shifting statements given from time to time by the two participants in the crime on whose testimony the defendant\u2019s conviction actually depended. As the accounts of the two men are set forth, starting with their arrests, it should be observed that the jury in the present case were not made aware of the entire content of this material, and only after the defendant\u2019s conviction did defense counsel secure full access to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">1. <em>Undisputed facts of the crime. </em>About noon of November 30,1973, three young black residents of the Columbia Point housing project in Dorchester entered the street level premises of Suffolk Jewelers, Inc., a pawnshop on Washington Street in Roxbury. These were Nathaniel Williams, aged twenty, Anthony Irving, seventeen, and Terrell Walker (evidently of comparable age). All were armed. They ordered employees to produce money and jewelry and open the safe, and then began collecting trays of jewelry and the like. A scuffle broke out with John Schroeder, a Boston police officer in civilian clothes who happened to be present, in the course of which Walker shot him dead.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The three robbers fled with about $900 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>and some 250 rings and watches, and perhaps other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-5\">The three (whether the defendant was a fourth is in question) went from the robbery to the apartment of Darlene Freeman (the fianc\u00e9e of Walker\u2019s brother, Arnold) at Columbia Point in Dorchester. Terrell Walker, and Irving, at least, had been at that apartment in the morning. During the afternoon the proceeds of the crime were divided up. Williams received Schroeder\u2019s .38 caliber police revolver. Williams and Irving used some of their share of the money to buy heroin which they took by intravenous injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">In the late afternoon these two decided to flee to Atlanta and boarded a southbound bus leaving at 6 p.m. Walker preferred to remain in Boston. Boston police, having obtained descriptions of Schroeder\u2019s assailant from eyewitnesses, and knowing of two outstanding warrants for Walker\u2019s arrest, proceeded in the late afternoon to Darlene Freeman\u2019s apartment in quest of Walker. Freeman in response to police demand managed to release a door bolt and the police entered and arrested Terrell Walker. From Freeman the police learned that Williams and Irving were Walker\u2019s partners in the crime. An alert went out to police forces along the bus route to pick up the two men.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">Sometime next day, December 1, police in Danville, Virginia, boarded the bus and arrested Williams and Irving. In their possession were found heroin, weapons (Williams had Officer Schroeder\u2019s gun), and jewelry taken from the pawnshop,</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">2. <em>Statements at Danville. </em>The men were questioned separately by the Danville police within a few hours of arrest. Each gave a signed statement. The import of the statements was that Williams at his apartment received a telephone call from Walker on the morning of November 30. Walker proposed that they rob the Suffolk pawn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>shop. Williams agreed, and later Walker and Irving came by in a stolen white car \u2014 according to Irving, a Mercury stolen by himself and Walker the day before, November 29. Williams said Walker gave him a gun when they met. The three robbed the store around noon, the policeman being killed. They drove off. Neither statement made mention of the defendant or any fourth participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">Next day, December 2, Boston police officers who had come to Danville interviewed the two men there. The conversations were taped. Irving\u2019s account was essentially unchanged, but he added that the white car had a dark top and now stated that only three men engaged in the holdup and no one stayed in the car. Williams, however, put a black girl in the picture \u2014 she was previously unknown to him, looked to be eighteen, and was \u201clighter-skinned\u201d or \u201cmedium.\u201d Williams reiterated that the group picked him up, then they drove to the pawnshop in a stolen white car (he was not sure of the make). The girl, according to Williams, drove the car, waited in it while the robbery took place, returned to Freeman\u2019s with the three, and was given some money and rings there. He and Irving took a taxi to a bus station later in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">3. <em>Plea bargains of Williams and Irving. </em>The two were confined at the Charles Street jail in Boston, where they shared a cell for some months. They were indicted for murder in the first degree and armed robbery on December 13. Around the new year, appointed counsel interviewed their respective clients. About February, 1974, counsel each spoke with the prosecutor to see whether a plea bargain was possible despite the great strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case against them stemming from the confessions, apprehension with the jewelry, and other impressive evidence. According to Irving\u2019s attorney, he told his client that negotiations could succeed only if the whole story was told including the identity of the girl driver Williams had introduced. As appears from counsel\u2019s testimony at the new-trial hearing later described, Irving at first resisted. By April, agreements had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>reached with the prosecutor that both Irving and Williams would be allowed to plead guilty to murder in the second degree in exchange for their cooperation, including testimony against Walker.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">In early May, after talking to counsel, Officer Robert Hudson of the Boston police interviewed Williams and Irving separately. Both confessed their involvement, and now stated that a woman named \"Sue,\u201d known to them from the Columbia Point project, drove them to and from the robbery. They described her car. There is no dispute that the Sue mentioned was the present defendant. She was arrested in May in Rochester, New York, where she had moved with her children, and was indicted on the murder and armed robbery charges on May 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">4. <em>Testimony of Williams and Irving at the Walker trial. </em>Williams and Irving both testified for the Commonwealth at the July, 1974, trial of Terrell Walker, and repeated what they had told Officer Hudson. These new stories of the men departed from the Virginia accounts (though not wholly agreeing with each other) as to how Williams met the others; how guns were distributed; the identity of the driver and of the automobile; how the loot was shared; and how they went to the bus station. The two men were now in accord on a central theme: that the present defendant drove them to and from the pawnshop in her own car.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">Williams testified that Walker, telephoning him on November 30, said he was calling from the defendant\u2019s apartment on Monticello Road at Columbia Point. Williams agreed to join in the suggested robbery, and walked over to the defendant\u2019s apartment \u2014 he was not picked up \u2014 arriving between 9:30 and 10 a.m. There he saw Walker, Irving, and the defendant, and there guns were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>handed out. The four proceeded directly to the pawnshop in the defendant\u2019s car with the defendant driving; there was only a stop to buy cigarettes. After the robbery they drove to Freeman\u2019s apartment. At that place they divided four ways a cash take Williams put at $300, after which the defendant left. The three men went into the bathroom to divide the jewelry. Toward the end of the day, Williams and Irving paid a man (not a taxi) to drive them to the bus station. On cross-examination Williams said he first found out about the prosecutor\u2019s promise to recommend acceptance of a plea the day before he took the stand, and that the promise had never been discussed with him previously. The prosecutor then stated for the record that the plea bargain had been agreed in April.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Irving testified that he and Walker together had formed the robbery plan. They had stolen a car but did not want to use it because it was \"hot.\u201d They went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and she agreed to drive them for some unspecified part of the take. Irving (not Walker) telephoned Williams, who agreed to join. The three left, and with the defendant driving picked up Williams en route. Irving now repeated a detail he had told Officer Hudson which differed from Williams\u2019s account, that the group stopped at Darlene Freeman\u2019s and secured guns there. Thence the four drove to the pawnshop in the defendant\u2019s four-door Ford LTD or Galaxie 500 automobile with the defendant still driving. After the robbery the defendant drove the men back to Freeman\u2019s. In the kitchen they divided the money, the men getting about $300 each; the defendant was given about $45 and a watch (absent from Williams\u2019s current story). She left. In the bathroom the rings were parcelled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">5. <em>Pretrial motions in the present case. </em>On October 3, 1974, a hearing was held to consider the defendant\u2019s pretrial motions. One was a motion for Commonwealth\u2019s disclosure of exculpatory evidence. The defendant\u2019s attorney said: \"I would assume that it included any evidence or statements in the hands of the Commonwealth tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to show the witnesses of whatever nature stated that or did not state that Mrs. Ellison was present at the events and transactions in the indictment.\u201d The prosecutor responded that he had \"no objection,\u201d and the judge (not the judge who ultimately presided at trial) allowed the motion. Next considered was the defendant\u2019s motion to inspect and copy statements made to agents of the Commonwealth by potential prosecution witnesses or others in connection with the Walker case or . the present case, and particularly statements of Irving, Williams, Walker, Darlene Freeman, and Anthony Dobson (Dobson\u2019s connection will appear). The judge asked whether these persons had testified at the Walker trial and whether a transcript would be made available (the precise relevance of these questions is not apparent); on receiving affirmative answers, the judge denied the motion, and the defense excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The prosecutor did not deliver any of the written or taped Virginia statements to the defense following the October 3 hearing. On November 15, three days before the commencement of trial, the defendant was heard on her renewed motion for exculpatory evidence, asking in particular for any reports \"relating to the identity of a motor vehicle\u201d used in the robbery; she also renewed her motion (previously denied) for witness statements. Defense counsel told the judge (who was to preside at trial) that exculpatory evidence was believed to exist; that police reports involving any type of car other than the defendant\u2019s should be regarded as exculpatory; and that early statements of Williams or Irving omitting mention of the defendant or her car likewise would be exculpatory. The prosecutor said he had no exculpatory evidence and suggested that he would not consider exculpatory the mere omission of mention of the defendant from a witness statement about the crime. The judge said he agreed that witness silence would be \"non-evidence\u201d rather than exculpatory evidence, and suggested that the defense could inquire of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses at trial whether their early statements mentioned the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>6. <em>The trial, </em>(a) <em>Motion for exculpatory evidence. </em>At the start of trial on November 18, before the jury were empanelled, the defense applied again for a chance to examine any statements by Williams or Irving that were silent as to the defendant, counsel referring specifically to the statements of December 1, 1973, to the Danville police which had been mentioned at the Walker trial. The application was denied and exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">(b) <em>Persons present at or after robbery. </em>Eight persons\u2014 customers or employees present during the robbery or police officers who reached the scene \u2014 were called by the prosecution, but none had any testimony to give as to the robbers\u2019 method of arrival or departure, of any car used, or of any possible fourth participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">(c) <em>Freeman. </em>She related that Terrell Walker and his girl friend, together with his companion Anthony Dobson and Dobson\u2019s girl friend, slept at her apartment the night before the robbery. About 9 or 9:30 a.m., Irving arrived, Freeman awakened Walker, and the two men left. According to Freeman, present at the apartment then and throughout the day, besides herself and her young children, were her boy friend Arnold Walker, and Dobson. (A couple of other women were there at least part of the time.) Freeman took a nap from perhaps 11 a.m. until 1 p.m. or as late as 2:30 p.m. She was not aware of anyone entering the apartment during that time. About 3 p.m. Terrell Walker knocked at the door, and Freeman let him come in along with his friend Wilbert Anderson. Between 4 and 4:30 p.m. Williams and Irving arrived. Williams, Irving, Terrell Walker, and Anderson rushed into the bathroom and she heard some loud dealings \u2014 she heard the words \"thirty-eight\u201d and a voice saying, \"Why should you get it when I did it?\u201d At no point during the day, Freeman testified, did she see the defendant, whom she knew from the neighborhood.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(d) <em>Dobson. </em>His testimony paralleled Freeman\u2019s in describing the arrival and activities of the three robbers, but his assessments of time were different. He said he slept at Freeman\u2019s apartment the night of November 29 and awoke between 12:30 and 1 p.m. Terrell Walker arrived within five or ten minutes, followed shortly by Anderson. Ten minutes later Williams and Irving showed up, and the three with Anderson proceeded to the bathroom. Like Freeman, Dobson heard jingling noises and something of an argument. He heard a voice say, \u201cI did this. This is mine.\u201d Shortly Williams and Irving left. Soon the police arrived. Dobson did not testify to having seen the defendant, with whom he was acquainted, at any time that day \u2014 in fact he testified he did not see her at,the Columbia Point project (where all lived) at any time that November.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">(e) <em>Williams. </em>The direct testimony of this witness was that Walker telephoned him at 9 or 10 a.m. on November 30. He then left for the defendant\u2019s apartment where he found her along with Terrell Walker and Irving. Here the robbery was planned and guns distributed. The defendant drove the men directly to the pawnshop in her automobile, waited for them, and then drove them to Freeman\u2019s apartment. Williams testified that all four entered the apartment; he saw Freeman and Dobson, both awake. All four went into the kitchen and gave the defendant some cash and a watch (now conforming in the particular of the watch to Irving\u2019s testimony at the Walker trial). The defendant left. The men next went into the bathroom and divided the cash and counted the rings. After about twenty minutes this witness and Irving left to buy and use some heroin. Later that afternoon, Williams said, he and Irving returned to Freeman\u2019s. Back to the bathroom they went to divide the rings with Terrell Walker. It was at this time that an argument broke out over possession of the police revolver. Williams and Irving left and \u201cfound someone\u201d to take them to the bus terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>The cross-examination of Williams led back to the question of the statements he gave after his arrest in Virginia. Defense counsel requested all Williams\u2019s early statements in the possession of the Commonwealth. The judge responded that if the defense persisted in its demand for these materials he would require the Commonwealth to furnish them, but in that case the prosecution would be permitted to introduce any portions it pleased under the rule of <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>315 Mass. 580 (1944). On those terms, the defense abandoned its demand while excepting and insisting that the <em>Leonard </em>rule was inapplicable and that it was entitled to see the materials without such strings attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">On resumed cross-examination, Williams admitted he had not referred to the defendant in his statements to the Danville or Boston police in Virginia, but it did not emerge that in his first statement he had not mentioned any fourth participant at all. Williams also acknowledged that he told police officers of both forces in Danville that a stolen car was used; he went on to testify that twenty-four hours before the robbery he had seen Irving driving a stolen car. He added that it was not until May, 1974, that he told the police anything other than that a stolen car was used. The witness was also asked about his plea bargain, and repeatedly claimed it was July before he found out he would get the benefit of a recommendation in return for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">At this point the prosecutor offered to let in the tape of Williams\u2019s statement given to the Boston police in Virginia (that tapes existed came out in the cross-examinatian). Defense counsel listened to the tape and claimed a mistrial on the ground that the Commonwealth had withheld exculpatory evidence. The prosecutor at first consented to a mistrial, then changed his mind, and the judge finally denied the motion, with exception taken. The tape was then played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">(f) <em>Irving. </em>This witness testified that he and Walker decided on the morning of November 30 to commit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>robbery. They paused to inject heroin. Then, at the defendant\u2019s apartment, they asked the defendant to drive them because they figured the available stolen car was too \"hot.\u201d She consented and they called Williams. Irving\u2019s story now veered from his testimony at the Walker trial and began to conform to Williams\u2019s testimony at the current trial. Thus Williams was not picked up but came by himself to join the others at the defendant\u2019s apartment. Thence the defendant drove the group in her car not to Freeman\u2019s apartment to obtain guns (which according to this account they already had), but straight to the pawnshop. All went to Freeman\u2019s after the robbery. In the kitchen the defendant was given about $40 and a watch, and then left. The three went into the bathroom and split up the jewelry. During this appearance at Freeman\u2019s apartment, Irving saw neither Freeman nor Dob-son. Like Williams, Irving testified that he and Williams left and later returned to Freeman\u2019s and that it was then that an argument occurred over the police revolver. He and Williams soon after found a man to drive them to the bus terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">On cross-examination it was brought out that Irving and Williams had been placed in the same cell the previous day when Williams was returned to jail after testifying against the defendant. When pressed on the differences between his current testimony and what he had sworn at Walker\u2019s trial, Irving responded that he had been \"mistaken\u201d in relating that he, Walker, and the defendant had picked up Williams on the morning and mistaken in saying that they then went to Freeman\u2019s to provide themselves with guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">At a bench conference out of the hearing of the jury the prosecutor now put on the record for the first time that this witness had not mentioned any girl in either of the Virginia statements. During a break in the midst of Irving\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor allowed defense counsel to hear \u2014 for the first time \u2014 Irving\u2019s December 2 statement to the Boston police. Counsel chose not to run that tape for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>On further cross-examination, Irving differed from Freeman\u2019s testimony that he had come to her apartment once on the morning and then left with Walker. Irving put it that he came first between 9:30 and 10 a.m. and Freeman let him in. After talking with Walker he left to buy heroin. Then he returned to Freeman\u2019s apartment where someone (\u201cit could have been\u201d Freeman) let him in again. He and Walker injected heroin and planned the robbery. At the end of the day \u201csome man\u201d \u2014 not a taxi\u2014 took Williams and himself to the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">(g) <em>McConkey. </em>The only other testimony besides that of Williams and Irving that could be perceived as incriminating the defendant was provided by Officer Lewis G. McConkey of the Boston police who spoke with the defendant in Rochester in May, 1974. She denied she now owned an automobile, but when McConkey pointed to a parked car she admitted it was hers and added that it was not registered. Officer McConkey gave her Miranda warnings and asked her about the pawnshop robbery. She denied involvement. As the police were leaving, McConkey said, the defendant asked how the police got her name. McConkey said, \u201cYou\u2019re no dope. What do you think?\u201d She said, \u201cIt could only come from the three people involved in the hold-up.\u201d On cross-examination it appeared that McConkey had made no reference to such a conversation in his report of the visit (as handwritten or typed).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">(h) <em>The defendant. </em>She testified in her own behalf. She was a twenty-seven year old black woman, mother of four. She is quite dark-skinned. From her home city of Rochester she came to Boston in April, 1973, with her children and \u201ccommon-law husband,\u201d one Pounds. She did domestic work part time. In September she bought a 1969 black and white Ford LTD with New York plates, unregistered. Pounds introduced her to Williams and Irving and a few times in the fall, with Pounds\u2019s permission, she gave the men rides in her car. She was also acquainted with Terrell Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>On the day of the crime, she had been shopping at a few places she named. She was on her way home about 2 p.m. when she heard that a policeman had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In February, 1974, Pounds was killed, and her parents, after some effort, persuaded her to return to Rochester. So in March her family came with a truck and moved the defendant and her children. The defendant\u2019s version of her conversation with Officer McConkey made no reference to the three men involved in the holdup.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">(i) <em>The defendant\u2019s father. </em>He was a self-employed construction contractor. He testified that he sent his daughter seventeen money orders between April, 1973, and February, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">After closing arguments the judge charged the jury (with exception taken only on a minor point) and the jury returned their verdicts after deliberating for three hours. No motion for a directed verdict was made after the prosecution\u2019s case or at the close.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">7. <em>The new-trial motion. </em>The defendant on May 22, 1975, moved for a new trial. This was heard in November, 1976, by a third judge; the trial judge had died. In the nature of the motion the judge was called on to review the trial record to see whether the verdicts now appeared vitiated by error or against the weight of the evidence; and new evidence was offered for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">The defendant pressed the constitutional error of suppression of exculpatory evidence, and in that connection the material in question, having now, after the conviction, been made fully available to the defendant, was tendered and received in evidence on the motion. Also, some testimony was taken from the attorney who represented the defendant at the trial about how he might have used the withheld material if it had been supplied before trial, and of his difficulty in deciding under pressure of time whether to put the Irving tape before the jury after they had heard Williams\u2019s somewhat different interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>In addition to claims as to the intrinsic weakness of the evidence of guilt presented at trial, the defense now offered affidavits of Williams and Irving (dated in May, 1976) recanting their trial testimony against the defendant. These witnesses also testified on the motion. They said there had been no fourth participant, and that Irving, in a stolen car with Walker aboard, had picked Williams up and driven the group to and from the robbery. The defendant had had no role in any part of the enterprise. Williams said he had invented a girl driver in his December 2,1973, statement in order to minimize his friend Irving\u2019s part in the crime. Both Williams and Irving said they had felt compelled to plea bargain and testify against the defendant out of fear of the death penalty. As Williams had now mentioned a girl, a name had to be supplied \u2014 otherwise no bargain. The defendant\u2019s name was used because she was not a close friend of either man and because she was known to have left town.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">This account was questioned in part by the lawyers who had represented the pair. The lawyers said they had respectively informed their clients that there could be no death sentence. Irving, according to his counsel, had mentioned a girl participant in January but evinced reluctance to involve her; in March he continued reluctant because she was the mother of three or four children. Counsel reiterated that a plea would be impossible unless Irving named and testified against the woman. Williams, said his counsel, had early decided to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The judge filed a memorandum of decision. With respect to the constitutional claim, he held that the prosecution\u2019s failure to turn over the statements made to the Danville police was not reason enough to grant a new trial. Through cross-examination and use of the tape recording, the defense had shown that Williams had not mentioned the defendant in either of his early statements and that he had consistently referred to the getaway car as a stolen vehicle. Failure to put the Irving tape before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the jury or to cross-examine Irving on the matter was the choice, if perhaps inexplicable, of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">As for the recantations, the judge did not believe them. References to a woman driver were repeated \u2014 by Williams on December 2, 1973; by Irving (as just noted) in January and March, 1974. The judge thought it unlikely that the robbery would be executed without someone remaining in the car. One might add to the judge\u2019s remarks that Williams\u2019s story, that he fabricated a girl driver thinking this would help Irving, does not go down easily. Also, there is difficulty in crediting the men\u2019s testimony that they feared a death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We note that the judge in his memorandum did not attempt to assay afresh the weight of the evidence. Rather he appeared to respond only to whether the suppression of exculpatory evidence or the witnesses\u2019 recantation was cause enough to upset verdicts which the jury \u2014 as he stressed \u2014 returned in a mere three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">8. <em>Observations on standards of review. </em>On the present review of the judgments of conviction and the denial of a new trial we have conceived for three reasons that we had to get well into the detail of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">First, as already suggested, the seriousness of the prejudice flowing from the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to make due and timely disclosure of exculpatory material can be fairly judged only in relation to the particulars of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Second, even if the judge who ruled on the new trial motion had attempted a full evaluation of the strength of all the evidence, we would be obliged to review it with special care because, with respect to the trial record, the judge had not the closeness to, and familiarity with, the facts that we properly attribute to the judge who actually heard the testimony. It is on the ground of that intimacy with the evidence that we leave largely to the discretion of the judge the question whether a new trial should be granted because the verdicts are not well supported by the proofs, or because of postverdict developments. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>this ground the trial judge is given broad authority by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29, as appearing in St. 1966, c. 301, to order a new trial \u201c[i]f it appears to [him] that justice may not have been done,\u201d even though a judge reading the cold record would not be justified in setting aside the verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>375 Mass. 409 (1978); <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 256-258 (1942). As the present defendant never had the benefit of the trial judge\u2019s consideration of her new-trial request, we are in a position to make, and are bound to make, the same scrutiny of the trial record as the judge made or should have made who passed on the new-trial motion, and we are to apply that more liberal standard or attitude which is considered appropriate when the illness or death of the trial judge has made it necessary for the motion to be passed on at second hand. \u201cThis court, in passing upon the questions presented for review, may consider the fact, that the judge who heard the motions had before him nothing but the stenographic report of the evidence at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gedzium, </em>261 Mass. 299, 304 (1927). Accord, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 348 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Third, we are charged by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, with inquiring on every \u201ccapital\u201d appeal whether a new trial (or mitigation of sentence) is called for in the light of \u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d (or \u201cany other reason that justice may require\u201d). See the discussion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 109 (1963). The exercise demands a review of the whole case in \u201ca large or nontechnical sense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>373 Mass. 760, 765 (1977). And a \u201cprofound doubt\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s guilt generated by the record surely counts as a compelling instance for a new trial under \u00a7 33E. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rutledge, </em>356 Mass. 499, 502 (1969). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra </em>at 352-353. Here the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial was a dubious one, and the doubt is deepened by the fact that the triers did not have before them some evidence which tends to undermine the stories they heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>9. <em>Evaluation of the evidence. </em>A combination of circumstances puts in question the value of the testimony of Williams and Irving.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Of several individuals present in Freeman\u2019s apartment when the defendant was alleged to have been there, none other than Williams and Irving testified to seeing the defendant. Although Williams said Freeman was on the scene and awake when he entered accompanied by the defendant, Freeman (an important witness in the Walker trial) in fact specifically testified she did not see the defendant that day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Such contradictions could more easily be passed over were it not for the. fact that Williams and Irving did not hold to any one version, and in their several narratives told stories that were changing in material part, conforming for the first time at the defendant\u2019s trial. Their first four statements, made in Virginia, were wholly consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. Three of the four utterances pointed to a three-man crime. All four statements asserted unambiguously that a stolen car had been used, and it is not disputed that Irving stole a car the day before the crime. Yet, after being confined over a lengthy period of time in the same prison cell, the men agreed at the Walker trial that the defendant\u2019s car was used and that she drove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">As the men departed from their early accounts, discrepancies appeared \u2014 unresolved until the defendant\u2019s trial. Thus the Virginia statements related that the gang came by to pick Williams up in the morning, and so Irving reiterated at the Walker trial. But at the defendant\u2019s trial Irving chalked up his earlier statements to mistake and agreed with Williams that the latter had come to the defendant\u2019s apartment on his own. Irving similarly ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>plained as an innocent mistake his story at the Walker trial of the group stopping by Freeman\u2019s apartment just before the robbery to secure weapons. Less basic earlier inconsistencies smoothed out at the defendant\u2019s trial related to how much cash she received as her share and whether she got anything besides cash. Quite striking is Williams\u2019s testimony at both trials that only in July (the month of the Walker trial, and after Williams had implicated the defendant) did he find out that he would be permitted to plead guilty to murder in the second degree \u2014a point which the prosecutor contradicted and about which Williams was unlikely to have been genuinely confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Williams and Irving emerge as very willing to lie under oath. Each has given at least three basically different accounts of the crime.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Their difficulties on the score of credibility could perhaps be played down if their later statements were more believable than the earlier ones, but the contrary would appear to be the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">(a) In the original statements given to the Danville police a short time after their arrest, they freely (and separately) admitted their own involvement and Walker\u2019s, yet omitted mention of the defendant or any fourth participant. To credit their later testimony, one would have to believe the men had the wit and generosity to fabricate quickly (and jointly) a story protecting the defendant, with such supporting details as the stolen automobile and Williams being picked up.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Williams and Irving returned in their recantations to their original, and more spontaneous utterances: again they spoke of a three-man crime with a stolen car and so forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">(b) It is not difficult to imagine why Williams and Irving might have implicated the defendant. Even discounting their claim about fearing the death penalty, the two did face first degree convictions, meaning life in prison without hope of parole. A plea in the second degree would offer a chance of parole after fifteen years \u2014 but the Commonwealth seemingly did not need the men\u2019s cooperation to convict them or Walker. As Irving was advised by counsel, only if a woman were involved might a deal be worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">(c) The motives Williams and Irving might have for recanting are less apparent. They were duly warned at the new-trial hearing that perjury in a murder case could be punished by life imprisonment. Even if such a prosecution did not follow, they might fear the effect on a parole board of knowledge that they had either attempted to sabotage a sound Commonwealth case or had earlier tried to get an innocent woman convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">All this is apart from the speculation whether a mother of four in her middle twenties, recently working part time, receiving money from her father, and unimpeached by any criminal record, would likely join a band of youthful heroin users in a poorly planned crime in exchange for a meager share of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">10. <em>Suppression of exculpatory evidence. </em>If the jury did not apprehend some of the doubts just expressed, it was perhaps because the prosecutor\u2019s failure to turn over exculpatory material, and errors of the judge therein, contributed to keeping from the jury evidence that lessened the credibility of the key witnesses. The jury knew noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ing of Irving\u2019s Virginia statements; for all they heard, Irving might never have said anything other than that the defendant drove her own car, and was a full partner in the crime. Neither defense counsel nor the jury saw Williams\u2019s signed confession, nor did they know that in the first statement no extra participant was named. Nor did counsel or the jury see Irving\u2019s statement to the Dan-ville police with his admission of having stolen an automobile the day before the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">On the face of things the Commonwealth, by its failure to produce the Virginia statements favorable to the defendant, violated the rule of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83,87 (1963), amplified in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976), that suppression by the prosecution of requested material evidence which is favorable to the accused is a denial of due process. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>372 Mass. 772, 779 n.3 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>371 Mass. 26, 34-35 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 952-954, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>366 Mass. 506,510-511 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, </em>360 Mass. 570, 578 n.5 (1971), vacated on other grounds sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mains, </em>374 Mass. 733, 738 (1978). The duty of course rested on the Commonwealth under the law even as it existed before we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewinski, </em>367 Mass. 889 (1975), that a defendant should have access to witness statements without having to show particularized need. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>362 Mass. 382, 387 (1972), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, supra, </em>antedating the <em>Lewinski </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">There was no escape from the duty on any pretense that the statements were not favorable to the defense. On the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case, the defendant drove the robbers to and from the pawnshop in her own car, yet from the men\u2019s first utterances it appeared that a stolen car was used, that there was not a fourth partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>pant, or (in one statement) that there was a girl driver much younger than the defendant and of lighter color. The trial judge\u2019s notion, supported by the prosecutor, that statements silent as to the defendant were for that reason exempt from disclosure, was surely erroneous. We observe here that material may be within <em>Brady </em>although it is not absolutely destructive of the Commonwealth\u2019s case or highly demonstrative of the defendant\u2019s innocence. The <em>Brady </em>obligation comprehends evidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant\u2019s case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant\u2019s story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\u2019s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The prosecution here first registered \"no objection\u201d to producing statements as to the defendant\u2019s absence from the criminal activities, and an order was entered. Such material was not produced. When the judge appeared later to depart from the requirement by his reference to \"silence,\u201d the result was simply to introduce an error of law, as indicated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The judge committed further error in invoking the rule of <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>315 Mass. 580 (1944), by which, it was suggested, the defendant could examine material the exact content of which she did not know in advance, only on pain of rendering all or any part of it admissible at the instance of the prosecution. Whatever may be the status of the <em>Leonard </em>rule today,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is totally inapplicable to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>discovery situation in a criminal case, as Justice Whittemore\u2019s opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>354 Mass. 713, 721 (1968), makes clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">11. <em>Materiality of the errors.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97 (1976), speaks of the circumstances in which nondisclosure of exculpatory matter should result in reversal of criminal convictions. The decision distinguishes between specific and general requests (or cases where no request is made). When there is merely a general demand, the Court\u2019s standard, designed to \"reflect our overriding conc\u00e9rn with the justice of the finding of guilt,\u201d would require nullifying a conviction \"if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist____This means that the omission must be evaluated in the context of the entire record. If there is no reasonable doubt about guilt whether or not the additional evidence is considered, there is no justification for a new trial. On the other hand, if the verdict is already of questionable validity, additional evidence of relatively minor importance might be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112-113. The precise meaning of this formulation has become a lively problem for the Federal courts, but we think few would find a fact like Williams\u2019s failure to mention a fourth participant in his first statement of such trivial importance in a close case that the suppression could be easily passed over.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mains, </em>374 Mass. 733 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Thus the verdicts might be vulnerable even if only a general request had been made for exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But here the prosecution was left in no doubt what was wanted, if it existed. The witnesses involved were pointed to, and the subject matter (identity of the vehicle and of the robbers) specified. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mackey, </em>571 F.2d 376 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCrane, </em>547 F.2d 204, 207-208 (3d Cir. 1976). \u201cWhen the prosecutor receives a specific and relevant request, the failure to make any response is seldom, if ever, excusable.\u201d <em>Agurs, supra </em>at 106. In such cases, <em>Agurs </em>commands that \u201cthe reviewing judge must set aside the verdict and judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>unless his 'conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. We suppose such assurance may exist where the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that the omission was obviously without effect, or the matter suppressed was in fact thoroughly explored (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>548 F.2d 198, 203 [7th Cir.], cert. denied, 430 U.S. 969 [1977]), or the defendant has somehow become aware at the trial of the contents of the undisclosed material and had full opportunity to examine on it (see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 F.2d 224, 227-228 [3d Cir. 1977]).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The present case does not fall into any of these categories. Enough has been said about the condition of the proofs. In our view there was not an inquiry at trial that could be held a satisfactory substitute for the material withheld. Nor should the defendant be considered delinquent in her pursuit of such an inquiry and therefore treated as if she had carried it out without result.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">As the trial progressed the prosecutor may have had second thoughts about the exculpatory evidence in his possession. In the cross-examination of Williams, and then of Irving, he did allow counsel to hear the tapes. However the written statements were not produced: although counsel was told in the midst of Irving\u2019s cross-examination that he had not mentioned a girl participant in the first confession, it was not disclosed that the same was true of Williams; and although Irving testified that he had a stolen car in his possession, the fact that he had stolen one the very day before.the pawnshop robbery was kept from defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s late, piecemeal, and incomplete disclosures forced on defense counsel the necessity of making difficult tactical decisions quickly in the heat of trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus it was only after the jury had heard Wil-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>liams\u2019s tape recorded reference to an eighteen-year old girl that counsel discovered that Irving mentioned no such driver.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Counsel had then to decide whether it was worthwhile pushing a cross-examination of Irving on the inconsistency, and the decision had to be made without knowledge of the full content of Irving\u2019s still unproduced statement to the Danville police. In retrospect, it may be thought that counsel did not use to maximum advantage those parts of the story he did finally secure out of the prosecutor\u2019s possession. But the defendant should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>held to a strict standard in order to patch over the prosecution\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b16-12\"> The judge\u2019s charge dealt mostly with felony-murder but also mentioned that, if the killing was found not to have occurred in the commission of the robbery, the defendant might still be found guilty of murder if she was found sufficiently implicated in the final homicide.

But defense counsel made no attempt to bring the discrepancy to the attention of the judge.

There were in evidence, however, seventeen receipts of money orders her father had sent her. We think the testimony, although perhaps not of great value, should have been permitted as tending to show the defendant had no motive for robbery. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass 368, 376 (1928), citing <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>4 F. &amp; F. 322 (Crown Ct. 1865); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 392, at 343 (3d ed. 1940) (\"the fact that a person was in possession of money tends to negative his desire to obtain it by crime ... and is always admissible\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>338 Mass. 130, 133-134 (1958) (evidence defendant had money should be admitted to rebut Commonwealth\u2019s case concerning motive).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
