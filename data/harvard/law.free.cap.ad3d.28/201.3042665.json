Uviller, J.), rendered August 13, 2004, convicting defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and sentencing him, as a second violent felony offender, to a term of six years, unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The court properly denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion. There is no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s credibility determinations, which are supported by the record (see <em>People v Prochilo, </em>41 NY2d 759, 761 [1977]). Defendant\u2019s conduct, viewed in totality, warranted the conclusion that he was adjusting an object in his waistband (see <em>People v Benjamin, </em>51 NY2d 267 [1980]), and that he had recognized, and was attempting to evade, the police. This justified the officers\u2019 common-law inquiry (see <em>People v Jenkins, </em>209 AD2d 164 [1994]; <em>see also People v Ward, </em>22 AD3d 368 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>6 NY3d 782 [2006]), which ultimately led to the lawful recovery of a revolver.
