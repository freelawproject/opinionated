Charles Sanchase White was indicted for the attempted murder of Deputy Sheriff Antonio Bostic. White was convicted for the lesser-included offense of attempted first-degree assault. See \u00a7\u00a7 13A-4-2 and 13A-6-20(a)(l), Ala. Code 1975. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. White appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"ASGg\">The evidence at trial tended to show that the following events took place on the late evening of November 25, 2013, and into the early morning of November 26, 2013. Acting on a tip that a burglary might take place at a particular location by a man armed with a pistol, Deputy Bostic parked his unmarked police . vehicle, a truck, in a driveway of an abandoned home near the location of the possibl\u00e9 burglary. Bostic testified that he was alone inside his truck and that his truck was \u201ccompletely blacked out so no one could see [him].\u201d (R. 210.) Bostic was wearing his \u201cclass' B\u201d uniform, which includes a blue vest with an embroidered badge and the word \u201cSheriff,\u201d and a name tag. Bostic testified that he was \u201cclearly identifiable\u201d as a law-enforcement officer. (R. 222.) White arrived near Bostic\u2019s location and began to walk toward Bostic\u2019s truck. At that time it was dark, cold, and raining. White was wearing a red \u201choodie\u201d and his hands were concealed inside the pockets of the hoodie. (R. 220.) White approached Bostic\u2019s truck, and as White \u201ccame around-to the left quarter panel\u201d of Bostic\u2019s truck, Bostic quickly got out of the truck with -bis pistol drawn, and, in a manner Bostic described as \u201cyelling,\u201d Bostic identified himself as a law-enforcement officer and commanded White to show his hands. (R. 260.) It was Bostic\u2019s testimony that. White\u2019s \u201cinitial reaction\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>was to retreat toward the front of Bostic\u2019s vehicle; however, Bostic testified, White \u201cstopped, he turned around\u201d toward Bostic, he \u201c[brought] up his arm,\u201d point[ed] a gun \u201cat [Bostic],\u201d and as Bostic \u201cducked for cover,\u201d White fired a gunshot toward Bostic, but missed Bostic. (R. 222, 223, 248-49, 261.)' Bostic testified that he saw the flash from the muzzle of White\u2019s pistol and that there was \u201cno doubt in [his] mind that a shot was fired at [him].\u201d (R. 262.) Bostic immediately rose from his crouched position and fired two gunshots toward White. Both gunshots missed White. White ran into the nearby woods where he discarded his pistol and continued to evade police for a brief period before being captured;</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">White was charged with attempted murder under \u00a7 13A-6-2(a)(l), Ala. Code 1975. He was convicted of the lesser included offense of attempted first-degree assault, as defined in \u00a7 13A-6-20(a)(l), Ala. Code 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">White contends on appeal, as he did at trial, that there was a reasonable theory from the evidence, if believed by the jury, to support a jury charge on the lesser offenses of attempted second-degree assault under \u00a7 13A-6-21(a)(2), Ala. Code 1975, and menacing, \u00a7 13A-6-23, Ala. Code 1975. Therefore, he contends that the trial court erred in refusing his requested jury instructions on those lesser offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">White contends that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on attempted second-degree assault.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">\u201c\u2018\u201cA trial court has broad discretion in formulating its jury instructions, providing they are an accurate reflection of the law and facts of the case.

When requested charges are either fairly and substantially covered by the trial judge\u2019s oral charge or are confusing, misleading, ungrammatical, not predicated on a consideration of the evidence, argumentative, abstract, or a misstatement of the law, the trial judge may properly refuse to give such charges.

However, \u2018[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.\u2019 \u00a7 13A-l-9(b), Ala. Code 1975. \u2018The basis of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>charge on a lesser-included offense must be derived from the evidence presented at trial and cannot be based on speculation or conjecture.\u2019 Broadnax v.

Code 1975. \u201cPhysical injury\u201d is defined as \u201c[impairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d \u00a7 13A-l-2(8), Ala. Code 1975. Attempted second-degree assault can be a lesser-included offense of attempted murder. Johnson v. State, 675 So.2d 85, 86-87 (Ala. Crim. App. 1995)(\u201c[A] defendant may be entitled to a 'charge on assault .in the second degree as a lesser included offense to attempted murder.\u201d); Sorrells v. State, 667 So.2d 142 (Ala. Crim. App. 1994).(appellant charged with attempted murder was found guilty of the lesser-included offense of attempted second-degree assault); and Reed v. State, 717 So.2d 862, 865 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997)(\u201cSecond-degree assault differs from first-degree assault only in that the injuries inflicted in first-degree assault are serious physical injuries.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The question of the type of harm White intended to inflict on Deputy Bostic was for the jury to resolve. \u201c \u2018Because the element of intent, being [a] state of mind or mental purpose, is usually incapable of direct proof, it may be inferred from the character of the assault, the use of a deadly weapon and other attendant circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Benton v. State, 536 So.2d 162, 164 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988)(quoting Johnson v. State, 390 So.2d 1160, 1167 (Ala. Crim. App. 1980)). \u201cThe question of a defendant\u2019s intent at the time of the commission of the crime is usually an issue for the jury to resolve.\u201d Rowell v. State, 570 So.2d 848, 850 (Ala. Crim. App. 1990), citing Crowe v. State, 435 So.2d 1371, 1379 (Ala. Crim. App. 1983). The jury rejected the greater offense, attempted murder, which required the jury to find- that White intentionally attempted to kill- Deputy Bostic. The only lesser offense presented to the jury-was attempted first-degree assault\u2014an offense requiring proof that White committed an overt act toward causing serious physical injury to Deputy Bostic by means of a deadly weapon. Attempted assault in the second degree*\u2014an overt act toward, causing physical injury by means of a deadly weapon\u2014differed from attempted murder and from attempted first-degree-assault only in regard to the level of intended physical injury. Reed v. State, 717 So.2d 862, 865 (Ala. Crim. App. 1997)(\u201cSecond-degree assault , differs from first-degree assault only in that the injuries inflicted in first-degree assault are serious physical injuries.\u201d). Thus, in this case, second-degree , assault was a lesser-included offense of attempted murder because it was established by proof of the same or fewer than all the facts required to establish the commission of that offense, and it differed from attempted murder only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person existed. Therefore, an instruction on second-degree assault should have been given to the jury, and the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury, on the lesser-included offense of second-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">II. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">White contends that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on what he contends was the lesser-included offense of menacing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Menacing, a Class B misdemeanor, is (jefined in \u00a7 13A-6-23, Ala. Code 1975, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzIC\">\u201c(a) A person commits the crime .of menacing \u00be by physical action, he inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>tionally places or attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">White was entitled to a jury instruction on menacing if there was a reasonable theory from the evidence indicating that White, \u201cby physical action ... intentionally place[d] or attempted] to place\u201d Deputy Bostic \u201cin fear of imminent serious physical injury,\u201d \u00a7 13A-6-23, Ala. Code 1975. As with second-degree assault, there was evidence to support a finding of menacing, if the jury determined that by discharging a gunshot at or toward Deputy Bostic it was White\u2019s intent to place or attempt to place Deputy Bostic in fear of imminent serious physical injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cThe offense of attempted murder is established by showing that, with intent to commit murder, the appellant did some overt act toward the commission of that offense. \u00a7 13A-4-2(a), Code of Alabama 1975. \u2018A person commits the crime of menacing if, by physical action, he intentionally places or attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.\u2019 Menacing encompasses the situation where \u2018 \u201cphysical injury\u201d is neither inflicted nor intended.\u2019 Commentary, \u00a7 13A-6-23, Code of Alabama 1975.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Nelson v. State, 595 So.2d 506, 510 (Ala. Crim. App.), rev\u2019d on other grounds, Ex parte Nelson, 595 So.2d 510 (Ala. 1991). See Walker v. State, 137 So.3d 943 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013)(defendant was convicted of menacing after discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury on menacing was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">\u201cThe failure to charge on a lesser-included offense may, in some circumstances, be harmless error.\u201d McNabb v. State, 887 So.2d 929, 977 (Ala. Crim. App. 2001), citing Baker v. State, 906 So.2d 210, 265 (Ala. Crim. App. 2001), rev\u2019d on other grounds, Ex parte Baker 906 So.2d 277 (Ala. 2004)(citing Baker, McNabb explains that, in Baker, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury on reckless murder and felony murder was, at most, harmless error, where the jury was charged on capital murder, intentional murder, reckless manslaughter and heat-of-passion manslaughter and the jury found the defendant guilty of capital murder.\u201d McNabb, 887 So.2d at 977.) However, the failure to charge the jury on a lesser-included offense is not always harmless error. In Crawford v. State, 886 So.2d 846 (Ala. Crim. App. 2003), Crawford was indicted for reckless murder. The jury rejected the greater offense, reckless murder and, instead, found Crawford guilty of the lesser offense of manslaughter. This Court agreed with Crawford\u2019s contention that the trial court erred when it refused his requested jury instruction on the lesser offense of vehicular homicide. This Court held that, under the facts, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s failure to give the charge was not harmless error because, had the jury been given the option, it might have found Crawford guilty of the lesser offense of vehicular homicide.\u201d Crawford, 886 So.2d at 849. Citing Culpepper v. State, 827 So.2d 883 (Ala. Crim. App. 2001), the Crawford Court stated, \u201c \u2018[n]othing in the jury\u2019s verdict supported] the contention that it could not have returned a verdict on the offense of vehicular homicide, had it been given that option.\u2019\u201d Crawford, 886 So.2d at 849 (quoting Culpepper, 827 So.2d at 886-87). The same is true in White\u2019s case. In addition to attempted first-degree assault, the evidence supported other viable lesser-included offenses; thus, the jury should have been given the option to decide the level of culpability it found based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">For the reasons set forth above, this Court cannot find the failure to charge the jury on attempted second-degree assault and menacing to be harmless error. Therefore, White\u2019s conviction for first-degree assault is reversed and this case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">APPLICATION GRANTED; UNPUBLISHED MEMORANDUM of AUGUST 5, 2016, WITHDRAWN; OPINION SUBSTITUTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-7\">Windom, P.J., and Burke and Joiner, JJ., concur.
