There wore other issues tried, and other assignments of error, but, in the view we take of this assignment, it is not necessary to notice them in arriving at a decision of this case, and they are considered and determined in <em>Liggett </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>51 Fed. Rep. 381, (decided at this term.) All the issues were found for the plaintiff by the court below, and judgment entered against the defendants for $10,489.86, to reverse which the defendants below sued out a writ of error in the case first above entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-29\">The plaintiff prayed the court to declare the law to he that he was entitled to interest on the calls for the unpaid subscriptions which were made by decrees of competent courts in Virginia in an action against the corporation based on a creditors\u2019 bill, from the respective dates of such decrees; but the court held he was entitled to interest from the commencement of the pending suit only, and to reverse this ruling ho sued out his writ of error. This question is not material to the decision of this case, and has been considered and determined in the case of <em>Liggett </em>v. <em>Glean, supra, </em>and will not be again noticed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-30\">\u201cTaussing, Livingston &amp; Go.\u201d is not <em>idem sonuus </em>with \u201cTaussig, Livingston &amp; Co.,\u201d and an entry in the stock ledger of a corporation of the former name is not competent evidence that the latter firm, or any of its members, were stockholders or subscribers to the stock of the corporation. <em>McClaskey </em>v. <em>Barr, </em>45 Fed.

The rule that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201c where the name of an individual appears on the stock book of a corporation as a stockholder, the <em>prima facie </em>presumption is that he is the owner of the stock, in a case where there is nothing to rebut that presumption;-and, in an action against him as a stockholder, the burden of proving that he is not a stockholder, or of rebutting that presumption, is cast upon the defendant.\u201d <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Payson, </em>95 U. S. 421, is an exception to two general rules of evidence, viz.: To the rule that a party to a contract may not, unless authorized so to do by statute, in the absence of and without the knowledge of his adversary, manufacture written evidence of the contract in controversy which can be admitted in evidence to prove the contract without the oath of the writer or the admission or ratification of the opposing party, and to the rule that the burden of proof is on him who alleges the existence of a contract that is denied to prove some act or admission of his adversary consenting to or ratifying it. The general observance of these rules is important to the protection of the property rights of every citizen,\u2014how important is perhaps well illustrated in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Here the representative of an insolvent corporation alleges that the firm of Taussig, Livingston &amp; Co., of which the testators \u00f3f defendants were members, subscribed to the stock of this corporation in 1866; and in support of this allegation no written subscription of theirs is produced, none is proved to have existed and to have been lost, no act or admission of any member of the old firm, which was dissolved nearly 2d years ago and whose members are dead, is proved or attempted to be proved, and the only evidence to support the allegation is this entry in the stock ledger of the corporation, and the fact that it is in the handwriting of one Allen, who was once the treasurer of thecorporation, and who is neither produced nor accounted for. The difficulty of rebutting the presumption arising from such an entry after the lapse of 25 years, and after the death of the. alleged subscribers, is obvious, and admonishes us that the rule adopted by the supreme court of the United States, holding such entries competent evidence against those whose individual names appear as stockholders on the stock book of the corporation, ought hot to be enlarged or extended beyond its terms. The great inconvenience of establishing, by production of the original subscription, contracts and assignments of stock, the relations of stockholders scattered throughout the nation'to large corporations, together with the fact that the original certificates of stock are presumptively in the possession of the stockholders, has undoubtedly had much influence in establishing this rule, and it should not be extended so far as to result, not only in greater inconvenience, but in injustice to those who are alleged to be stockholders. It should not be extended so far as to charge those as stockholders whose names do not appear on the stock book of the corporation, because other names that one might surmise were intended for, but are not, theirs, are found on the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The draft of August 10, 1866, did not tend to prove that the corporation referred to Taussig, Livingston &amp; Co., by the account against Tanssing, Livingston <em>&amp; </em>Co., because it did not correspond in date with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>any requisition entered in that account; moreover, there was no evidence that this draft was ever brought to the attention of Taussig, Livingston <em>&amp; </em>Co. in any way, so that it was without probative force against the defendants. The name of \u201cTanssing, Livingston &amp; Co.\u201d was not the name of the firm plaintiff sought to charge in this action; it was not <em>idem mums </em>with*that name; it was not spelled in the same way as was that name; and it was not in any way, by the evidence or testimony, identified or connected with that firm. Under these circumstances it was error to admit the entry upon the stock book under this name as evidence against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Moreover, when it was offered in evidence this entry in the stock book was not competent evidence under the pleadings. The plaintiffs allegation was that Taussig, Livingston &amp; Co. subscribed and agreed to pay for this stock, and thereby became stockholders. The defendants denied that that firm ever subscribed or agreed to pay for any such stock. The only issue here was whether or not Taussig, Livingston &amp; Co. ever subscribed for this stock. Manifestly the best evidence of this fact was the written subscription itself, and until this was produced, or its absence accounted for, the stock ledger was, at best, but secondary evidence of the subscription, and was incompetent. The plaintiff cannot escape from this rule of evidence after pleading, as he did, the contract of subscription as the basis of his action, by virtue of which alone he alleged this firm became a stockholder, by putting the stock, ledger in evidence on the trial to prove that the firm was once a stockholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This action was based on the written contract of subscription, and nothing else; hence a recovery must be had upon that instrument or not at all. Suit can not be brought upon one cause of action and recovery :had upon another. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Yeates, </em>69 Mo. 623; <em>Stix, </em>v.
