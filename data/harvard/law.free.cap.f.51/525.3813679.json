Customs Duties\u2014Classification\u2014Copper Rollers.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b541-8\">Under the tariS act of 1S83, rollers used in printing patterns, and composed wholly of copper, were dutiable at 35 per cent, <em>ad valorem </em>under the copper clause of the metal schedule, (C,) which clause includes \u201ccopperin rolled plates, * * * and all manufactures of copper, or of which copper shall he a component of chief value, \u201d and not at 45 per cent, under the residuary clause of that schedule, which provides for manufactured articles not specifically enumerated, composed wholly or in part of iron, steel, copper, lead, etc.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b541-9\">2. Same\u2014Construction of Statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b541-10\">As the act of 1883 reduced the duty on copper and copper articles, while it increased it on unenumerated metal articles, it would defeat the intent of congress to place the imports under the latter clause; and the rule applies that general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b541-11\">3. Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b541-12\">In such case the provision of the act declaring that if two or ritorc rates of duty are applicable to any imported article \u201c it shall be classified for duty under the highest of such rates, \u201d has no application, for the articles in question are clearly subject only to the duty of 85 per cent.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-13\">Error to the Circuit Court of tho United States for the Southern District of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-14\">Action by William King and Robert A. Lawrie against Daniel Ma-gone, as collector of the port of New York, to recover $370.31, alleged to be an excess of duty paid by them. The court directed a verdict for plaintiffs, and defendant brought this writ of error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AOu\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-15\">The imports in question were certain rollers composed wholly of copper, and used in printing patterns on oilcloth. The collector levied and collected a duty of 45 per cent, <em>ad valorem, </em>under the last paragraph of Schedule C, Tariff Act of March 3, 1883, (22 St. at Large, c. 12.1, p. 500; Heyl, 216.) Tho importers protested, claiming that the rollers were dutiable at 35 per cent, <em>ad valorem, </em>under the copper clause of said schedule, (Heyl, 186.) The importers appealed to the secretary of the treasury, who affirmed the collector\u2019s decision, and thereupon this action was brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-16\"><em>Edward Mitchell, </em>U.

The former reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">\u201cCopper, in rolled plates, called \u2018braziers\u2019 copper,\u2019 sheets, rods, pipes, and copper bottoms, and all manufactures of copper, or pf which copper shall be the component of chief value, not specially enumerated or provided for in this act, 35 per centum <em>ad valorem.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The residuary clause reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cManufactures, articles, or wares not specially enumerated or provided for in this act, composed wholly or in part of iron, steel, copper, lead, nickel, pewter, tin, zinc, gold, silver, platinum, or any other metal, and whether partly or wholly manufactured, 45 per centum <em>ad valorem.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the copper rollers were dutiable under the copper clause, instead of under the residuary clause of Schedule C. The copper clause is reproduced from the pre-existing tariff act, except that the rate of duty is reduced from 45 to 35 per centum <em>ad </em>valorem, while the residuary clause increases the duties imposed by the pre-existing act upon all unenumerated metal articles from 35 per cent, <em>ad valorem </em>ta 45 per cent. Thus it was manifestly the intention of congress, while increasing the duties on metal articles generally, to reduce those on manufactures of copper, or of which copper is the component of chief value. The intention to create an exception in favor of copper articles would be frustrated by treating the residuary clause as the operative one.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The settled rule of statutory construction is that general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, whether the provisions are found in the same statute or in different statutes; and general provisions must be interpreted so as to embrace only cases to which the special provisions are not applicable. <em>Churchill </em>v. <em>Crease, </em>5 Bing. 179; <em>State </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>25 N. J. Law, 54; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Culp, </em>14 Kan. 412; <em>Felt </em>v. <em>Felt, </em>19 Wis. 193; <em>State </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>38 N. J. Law, 64; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Little, </em>109 U. S. 504, 3 Sup. Ct. Rep. 357. Applying this rule of construction, the residuary clause, so taras it relates to copper articles, can be read so as to subject to the duty of 45 per cent, all metal articles not specially enumerated in which copper is not a component of chief value. It is a drag-net clause, framed to embrace all metal articles not elsewhere in Schedule C subjected to duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The provision of the act of 1883, declaring that, if two or more rates of duty are applicable to any imported article, \u201cit shall be classified for duty under the highest of such rates,\u201d has no application to the present case, because under the correct construction of the-two clauses the importations in suit are subject only to the duty of 35 per centum <em>ad valorem. </em>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
