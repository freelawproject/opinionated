J., to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>negligence of the Central Railroad of Now Jersey. The particular negligence alleged consisted in starting a train of coal cars without notice or warning to the plaintiff, who was at the time engaged in coupling. The usual course of business was that plaintiff, upon a signal from the engineer, should step in between two cars to couple, or uncouple them, and, having done so, should step back and indicate by a signal to the engineer that all was ready. Until such signal was given, the engineer was not to start the train. On this occasion it was claimed that the engineer started the train before the plaintiff gave such signal, and the plaintiff sustained severe injuries in consequence. The road was at the time in the hands of receivers. Plaintiff recovered a verdict in the court below, and a writ of error was duly allowed. The other facts, so far as they are material to the points decided, are sufficiently set forth in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b535-4\"><em>Robert W.

The second paragaph of the complaint alleged, in substance, that \u201con April 4, 1887, while plaintiff was employed at Bergen Point, New Jersey, by the Lehigh &amp; Wilkesbarre Coal Company, one of the trains of the defendant, at the point or place where plaintiff was so employed, was suddenly started by defendant or its agents, without notice or warning to the plaintiff, while the plaintiff was lawfully between two cars of said train,\u201d causing the injuries complained of. The averments of this paragraph are controverted by the general denial in the answer, and, if there were nothing else in the pleadings, would fairly presentan issue whether or not the railroad by whose operation the accident was alleged to be caused was in fact operated by the defendant at the time. But the whole pleadings are to be construed .together; and the complaint also averred in its first paragraph \u201cthat the defendant was at the time hereinafter mentioned * * * operating a railroad, among other places, at the point or place where the plaintiff was injured.\u201d This allegation defendant expressly admitted. It must therefore, for the purposes of the action, be taken as true, (Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 522; <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Cudlipp, </em>94 N. Y. 129;) and when it appeared, as it did in the proof, that only one railroad was being operated at the time and place of the accident, defendant cannot be permitted to contend that it was not operated by itself, but by some one else. Under these pleadings, plaintiff came into court to sustain by proof the affirmative of no such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">It is assigned as error that the trial judge refused to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant on the ground that \u201cthe negligence, if there be such, was the negligence of fellow servants.\u201d The accident happened upon the dock of the Wilkesbarre Iiehigh Coal Company at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Bergen Point, over which run the tracks of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The negligence which caused the accident was that of Paulman, the engineer. He was selected, appointed engineer, and placed in charge of this engine by the receivers of the plaintiff in error, and received his paj from them. The proof does not sustain the contention of the plaintiff in error that his service had at the time been transferred from the railroad to the coal company. The business he was engaged in was delivering coal from the main line of the railroad company to the coal company upon its dock by the operations of defendant\u2019s railroad. This was the business of the railroad company, and he remained its servant, although an agent of the coal company exclusively directed when and whereabouts on the dock the cars should be dumped, what cars should be brought in and taken out. As the defendant in error was exclusively in the employ of the coal company, the engineer was not his fellow servant. The case is to be distinguished from <em>Ewan </em>v. Lippincott, 47 N. J. Law, 192; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>118 Mass. 114; <em>Rourke </em>v. <em>White Moss Colliery Co., </em>46 Law J. C. P. 283\u2014by the circumstance that the proof does not show that the engineer was, under the power and direction of the coal company, engaged exclusively in doing its work, pr hired by it from his original employers, or \u201clent\u201d to it to perform its work. The question as to whether plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to the accident was properly left to the jury, and their finding is conclusive. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
