Two days after the execution of this instrument and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the delivery of the property to the trustee, the plaintiff in'error, Itainwater-Boogher Hat Company, brought suit by attachment in the United States court in the Indian Territory against John Malcolm; the grantor in said instrument, for $295.75, and caused the marshal to levy the writ of attachment on the personal property so conveyed by Malcolm to Waples. The latter intervened in the suit, and claimed the property as trustee under said instrument. The trial court held that the instrument on its face was a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage, and so instructed the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-4\">The court, at the request of the plaintiff in error, instructed the jury\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-5\">\u201cThat where an insolvent debtor executes one or more instruments, by whatsoever name or form, with the intent that they shall operate as a security to his creditor or creditors, thus giving time to enable him to raise funds to meet his debts, then such instrument or instruments constitute a mortgage; but if .the debtor executes one or more instruments, by whatsoever name or form, with the intention, expressed or implied, that the same shall operate as an absolute conveyance of the property to the grantee, to enable him to raise a fund to pay the debts of the grantor, then such instrument or instruments constitute an assignment. The test is this: If the debtor retains title to his property, and the same is delivered actually or conditionally to the grantee merely as a security for his debt pending a day to be fixed by the instrument, within which time the debtor may pay the debt and regain his property, then the instrument or instruments constitute a mortgage; but if the debtor transfers possession to the grantee with power to convert the property forthwith into cash to pay debts, then the instrument is an assignment, although the debtor may have reserved in the instrument the right to pay off the debts, and regain his property, before a final sale thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-6\">The court gave other instructions, and among them the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-7\">\u201cThe court instructs the jury the form of an instrument, or the name given to it by the parties, is not conclusive of the character of the instrument. A deed absolute in form may be conditional and defeasable in fact, while an instrument with formed defeasance may be intended to be and may operate as an absolute conveyance; the intention of the parties as gathered from the instrument, and all the facts and circumstances surrounding its execution, determines its character. The court instructs the jury that where an insolvent debtor recognizes the fact that he can no longer go on in business, and determines to yield the dominion of bis entire estate, and in execution of that purpose, or with the intent to evade the statutes, transfers all or substantially all of his property to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors, with the intent to part with the title as well as the control of such property, then such instrument or instruments by which such transfer is made will be held to operate as an assignment. The court instructs you that you are the sole judges of the evidence and its effect, and it is for you to say from all the evidence in this cause whether or not the instruments read in evidence were intended to operate as an assignment or mortgage; and in determining this you will take into consideration whether or not the grantor conveyed, all or a greater portion of his property to the grantee; whether or not the debtor included all of his creditors in said instrument; whether the debts thereby secured, or a material portion thereof, had matured; whether the defeasance in the instrument was <em>bona fide, </em>of whether it was a mere device to cover his real intention, together with all the other facts and circumstances connected with the transactions; and from all these facts and circumstances you will, under the law given you by the court, determine by your verdict whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>not the instrument read in evidence was intended to operate as a mortgage or as an assignment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b753-4\">There was a verdict and judgment for the intervener, and a verdict and judgment for the defendant Malcolm on the issue on the attachment, and the plaintiff sued out this writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-5\"><em>W.

If the former, it is valid; if the latter, it is void for noncompliance with the requirements of the statute in force in the Indian Territory regulating assignments for the benefit of creditors. The statute in question is an Arkansas statute put in force in the Indian Territory by the act of congress of May 2,1890, (26 St. pp. 81, 94, c. 182, \u00a7 31,) and the decisions of the supreme court of that state construing the statute, and determining when an instrument is a deed of assignment and when a mortgage, are followed by this court in cases coming from that territory. <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Flow, </em>4 U. S. App. 32, 1 C. C. A. 56, 48 Fed. Rep. 152; <em>Appolos </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>4 U. S. App. 209, 1 C. C. A. 299, 49 Fed. Rep. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">Construed in the light of the decisions of the supreme court of Arkansas, this instrument'on its face is a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage,\u2014the legal equivalent of a mortgage with a power of sale,\u2014and not a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors. <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Mississippi Mills, </em>52 Ark. 30, 11 S. W. Rep. 960; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupuy, </em>52 Ark. 48, 11 S. W. Rep. 964; <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>54 Ark. 229, 15 S. W. Rep. 456; <em>Penzel Co. </em>v. <em>Jett, </em>54 Ark. 428, 16 S. W. Rep. 120. Reviewing these decisions, Judge Shiras, in delivering the opinion of this court <em>m. Appolos </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>4 U. S. App. 209, 1 C. C. A. 299, 49 Fed. Rep. 403, said: \u201c These cases declare the test to be, has the party made an absolute appropriation of property as a means for raising a fund to pay debts, without reserving to himself in good faith an equity of redemption in the property conveyed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">There is in this deed what the learned counsel for plaintiff in error not inaptly characterizes as \u201can apparently iron-clad defeasance.\u201d There is nothing on the face of the deed to warrant the court in declaring this defeasance clause a nullity, or from which the court can say it was not inserted in the instrument in good faith. Whether the mortgagor entertained an honest hope or expectation of redeeming the property, or whether the defeasance clause was inserted as a mere device to evade the statute on the subject of assignments for the benefit of creditors, was a question of fact for the jury. For the purpose of showing that it was a mere device to avoid the statute on the subject of assignments, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>tiff in error called the maker of the instrument as a witness, and he testified that he desired and expected to pay the mortgage .debt and redeem the property inside of the 60 days. That he did not do so cannot affect the validity of the deed. A sufficient explanation of his failure to do so, if any is necessary, is found in the attachments sued out by the plaintiff in error and others two days after the execution of the mortgage. Attachments against merchants commonly upset their.business plans and destroy their commercial credit. But, as we have said, the question of good faith was one for the jury, and it was submitted to them under instructions certainly as favorable to the plaintiff in error as it had any right to ask. The deed is not obnoxious to the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The objection that it was not duly acknowledged, if well founded in fact, has no force, because the trustee took actual possession of the mortgaged property upon the execution of the deed, and continued in possession until it was taken from him under the attachment. Actual possession of mortgaged chattels by the mortgagee, before the rights of third parties have intervened, dispenses with the necessity of acknowledging the mortgage. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Weimar, </em>104 U. S. 786; <em>Hauselt </em>v. Harrison, 105 U. S. 401, 405; <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>26 Kan. 612; <em>Greeley </em>v. <em>Reading, </em>74 Mo. 309. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
