Pinkham, as assignee of Jacob P. Tirrell, the claim is for, \u201cin an electric-lighting gas-burner, a magnet for turning the gas cock by one electric impulse, combined with a fixed electrode, <em>a', </em>and a movable electrode, e', normally in contact, and mechanism connecting the armature with the movable electrode, to break the contact between <em>a' </em>and c\u2019 the instant after the gas is turned on, and create a spark for ignition, substantially as described. \u201d In the drawings, <em>a' </em>designated a platinum point on the fixed arm, and <em>t\u00ed </em>a small bent arm normally in contact with the fixed electrode. <em>Meld, </em>that the word \u201celectrode\u201d generally, and especially as used in the patent, means the platinum or other metal points constituting the poles of the circuit. 48 Fed.

The contending devices are for lighting and extinguishing gas by \u201cone impulse,\u201d through the agency of electricity. We think the defoudant\u2019s device is an infringing imitation of claimant\u2019s device. The substantial resemblances in structure and friction were clearly delineated by the learned judge who tried the ease in the circuit court, and we concur in his reasoning and conclusions. Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
