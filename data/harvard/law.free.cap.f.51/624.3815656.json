S. p. 826, \u00a7 11. In <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>11 How. 207, the supreme court, speaking by Chief Justice Taney, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">\u201cThe writ of error is not brought, in the legal meaning of the term, until it is filed in the court which rendered the judgment. It is the flling of the writ which removes the record from the inferior to the appellate court,'and the period of limitation must be calculated accordingly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">\u2019 And in <em>Scarborough </em>v. <em>Pargoud, </em>108 U. S. 567, 2 Sup. Ct. Rep. 877, that'court, expressly decided th\u00e9 very question presented in this case, and Held that where the\u201dwrit was allowed by the judge, but was not actually issued'by the clerk within the time limited for suing it out, the writ must be dismissed. <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>104 U. S. 419; <em>Mussina </em>v. <em>Cavazos, </em>6 Wall. 355, 360. It follows that the writ of error in this case was not brought within the time limited by law, and this court is without jurisdiction. For this reason the writ is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
