Some of the chests on delivery were, beyond doubt, oil-stained and defaced. All that the claimants can do to. exonerate the ship has doubtless been done; but, after all, the evidence shows nothing more than that they cannot explain how the stains and defacing occurred. It negatives certain causes that might, under some circumstances, have produced the damage; but this is not, I think, sufficient to release the ship from her legal obligation. The ship has possession and control of the goods from the time they are delivered into her custody. If the goods were received in good condition, as this bill of lading shows they were, she warrants their delivery in like condition, unless damaged through the act of God, public enemies, the dangers of the seas, or through some, other excepted cause. <em>Liverpool &amp; G. W. Steam Co. </em>v. <em>Phenix Ins. Co., </em>129 U. S. 397, 437, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 469. The burden of showing that the damage arose from such an excepted cause is upon the ship. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>1 Black, 156. As the Mascotte\u2019s evidence does not show this, but merely leaves the damage unexplained, I must therefore hold the ship liable for this item.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b622-5\"><em>Convers &amp; Kirlin, (J.

The burden of proof is on the steamship to overcome the effect of the acknowledgment in the bill of lading of the reception of the goods on board <em>\u201c </em>in good order and condition,\u201d and the evidence introduced on her behalf is not sufficient to overcome the effect of this recital. The decree is affirmed'.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
