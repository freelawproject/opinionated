The carrier later intervened or filed a lien claim in the employee\u2019s civil action against an alleged third party tortfeasor for the same injuries. In that action, the court or jury found that the employer\u2019s concurrent negligence was a proximate cause of the injuries. The employee recovered from the third party by judgment or by settlement made at or after trial. Then the employee sought an award of further workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Upon petition for reconsideration, respondent Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board (hereinafter, \u201cboard\u201d or \u201cWCAB\u201d) held that the employer\u2019s liability for further benefits should be credited with the amount of the employee\u2019s net recovery from the third party after deduction of the employee\u2019s expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees in the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Upon application by the four employees, writs of review were issued and the cases were consolidated for our determination whether it was proper for the board to allow the credits. We hold that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>In <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 57, 69 [17 Cal.Rptr. 369, 366 P.2d 641], the court pointed out that \u201cThere are three ways in which an employer who becomes obligated to pay compensation to an employee may recover the amount so expended against a negligent third party. He may bring an action directly against the third party (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3852), join as a party plaintiff or intervene in an action brought by the employee (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3853), or allow the employee to prosecute the action himself and subsequently apply for a first lien against the amount of the employee\u2019s judgment, less an allowance for litigation expenses and attorney\u2019s fees (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3856, subd. (b)).\u201d <em>Witt </em>held, however, that \u201cthe employer\u2019s right to recover against the third party tortfeasor is defeated when the employee\u2019s injuries are caused by the concurring negligence of the employer and that in such circumstances, whether the action is brought against him by the employer or the employee, the third party, upon establishing such concurrent negligence, is entitled to have the judgment against him reduced by the amount of compensation paid to the injured employee. <em>(Witt v. Jackson, supra, </em>pp. 71-73.)\u201d <em>(De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 217, 222-223 [70 Cal.Rptr. 550, 444 P.2d 342].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In the civil actions which preceded three of the cases at bench, the judgments against the third parties were arrived at by applying such reduction. In one of those three cases (Marglon v. WCAB), the civil judgment was followed by a settlement with the third party pending appeal. The fourth case at bench (Smith v. WCAB) was preceded by a civil action in which the third party defendant settled during trial. The employer\u2019s concurrent negligence was found in the latter action upon a separate trial of the compensation carrier\u2019s complaint in intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The third party\u2019s right to defeat the negligent employer\u2019s resort to the Labor Code reimbursement remedies was based in <em>Witt </em>on the policy that such employer should not be allowed to profit by his own wrong. <em>(De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 225; <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at pp. 72-73.) The rule announced in <em>Witt </em>is a rule of decisional law. Although <em>Witt </em>cited Code of Civil Procedure sections 875-880 (which abrogated the rule of noncontribution between joint tortfeasors), it did so merely to demonstrate that the rationale of prior decisions was no longer applicable. <em>(Chick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 201, 204 [25 Cal.Rptr. 725].) \u201cThe decision in <em>Witt </em>is in terms not made to depend upon these sections [875-880],' which have, in fact, no direct bearing on the question decided in the <em>Witt </em>case.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Witts </em>requirement that the employee\u2019s judgment against the third party must be reduced by the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation received from the negligent employer is founded on the concept that \u201cthe injured em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ployee may not be allowed double recovery. ...\u201d <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 73.) The Supreme Court has explained, however, that <em>Witt\u2019s </em>prohibition of double recovery \u201cis nothing more than a reference to the usual rule of law existing in negligence actions generally, that a partial satisfaction of the liability by a <em>joint or concurrent tortfeasor </em>will result in a <em>pro tanto </em>reduction of the liability of the other tortfeasors\u201d <em>(De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at pp. 225-226) (original italics), and the court has clearly indicated that the collateral source rule of damages is inapplicable when workmen\u2019s compensation payments are received from an employer whose causative negligence is concurrent with that of a third party tortfeasor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>pp. 223-227; compare, <em>Slayton </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 219, 232, fn. 1 [76 Cal.Rptr. 494] (dictum).)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Although an employer\u2019s right to recover against a negligent third party, or to lien the employee\u2019s judgment against that party, is a legislative recognition of the equitable doctrine of subrogation <em>(De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 222), those rights are wholly statutory. (See <em>Heaton </em>v. <em>Kerlan </em>(1946) 27 Cal.2d 716, 723 [166 P.2d 857]; <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1931) 212 Cal. 440, 446-448 [299 P. 66]; <em>Limited Mut. etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Billing </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 881 [169 P.2d 673].) Likewise, except in unusual circumstances not here present, the board\u2019s authority to allow employers a credit is derived solely from statute. (See <em>San Bernardino County </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 618, 625-628 [20 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In allowing credits to respondent employers in the present cases, the board purported to act under Labor Code sections 3858<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 3861.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The effect of these two sections \u201cis to vest in the commission and to continue in the commission, exclusive jurisdiction to determine compensation, even though the third party action is brought before the jurisdiction of the commission has been invoiced.\u201d <em>(Sanstad </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. (1959) 171 </em>Cal.App.2d 32, 39 [339 P.2d 943].)  Thus, where particular workmen\u2019s compensation benefits have not been awarded by the board by the time a third party tortfeasor satisfies the injured employee\u2019s judgment against him, but an award of such benefits is later sought, sections 3858 and 3861 permit the employer to achieve the same result (in terms of net compensation outlay) as would have been possible by the employer\u2019s joinder, intervention or lien if the payment of such benefits had been made before the third party suit. (See <em>Sanstad </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>pp. 39-40; Lab. Code, \u00a7 3857.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>San Bernardino County </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>217 Cal. at p. 628, in comparing the court\u2019s lien power in third party actions with the statutory predecessor (Stats. 1931, ch. 1119, pp. 2370-2371) of Labor Code sections 3858 and 3861 (under which the board allows credits), the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe amendment was designed to permit the Commission to do <em>what the court theretofore alone could </em>do\u2014prevent double recovery by crediting the employer with the employee\u2019s recovery against the third party.\u201d (Italics ours.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Witt </em>clearly indicates, however, and the rule has been applied, that \u201can employer, or his compensation carrier, seeking the recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation paid to the employee by the imposition of a lien under Labor Code, section 3856, cannot do so where it is found that the concurrent negligence of the employer contributed to the employee\u2019s injuries.\u201d <em>(Harness </em>v. <em>Pacific Curtainwall Co. </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 485, 490 [45 Cal.Rptr. 454]; see <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, 57 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 69-73; <em>LaBorde </em>v. <em>McKesson &amp; Robbins, Inc. </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 363, 367 [70 Cal.Rptr. 726]; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 238, 246-248 [28 Cal.Rptr. 548].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The Supreme Court has emphasized in <em>Witt </em>that \u201cthere is nothing in the Labor Code to suggest that the Legislature contemplated that a negligent employer could take advantage of the <em>reimbursement </em>remedies that those sections provide. In the absence of express terms to the contrary, these provisions must be deemed to be qualified by Civil Code section 3517 which provides that \u2018No one can take advantage of his own wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>supra, 57 </em>Cal.2d at p. 72.) (Italics ours.)  Such legislative abstention and Civil Code qualification cannot rationally be ignored in applying the Labor Code <em>credit </em>provisions (\u00a7\u00a7 3858, 3861) which are companion to the reimbursement remedies discussed in <em>Witt. </em>If the <em>court </em>cannot allow a lien where the employer was concurrently negligent, logic dictates that the <em>board </em>cannot allow a credit where the employer\u2019s negligence has been previously determined in the employee\u2019s third party action.  In a later workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding wherein the employee seeks benefits which no board award had theretofore obligated the employer to pay, the employee may therefore assert the employer\u2019s adjudicated negligence \u201cdefensively\u201d against the employer\u2019s claim of credit, and the employer is collaterally estopped by the determination made against him on that issue in the third party action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See <em>French </em>v. <em>Rishell </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 477 [254 P.2d 26]; <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 646 [56 Cal.Rptr. 1]; <em>Palm Springs Paint Co. </em>v. <em>Arenas </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 682, 688 [51 Cal.Rptr. 747]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Erich </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 233, 239 [31 Cal.Rptr. 628]; <em>McDougall </em>v. <em>Palo Alto etc. School Dist. </em>(1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 422, 428-431 [28 Cal.Rptr. 37].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">This result casts no new liability upon respondent employers. They pay no more than they would have had to pay if, <em>prior </em>to the third party actions, petitioners had received awards and payments for all permanent disability indemnity and other workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which they currently seek.  \u201cThe <em>Witt </em>doctrine \u2018. . . produces the overall result that in a case of compensable injury inflicted upon the employee by the concurrent negligence of a third party and the employer, the former will be liable for the excess damages over and above the compensation benefits, while the latter, or his compensation insurance carrier, will bear the <em>entire </em>compensation burden.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Trapp </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 929, 939 [58 Cal.Rptr. 229].) (Italics ours.) The fact that the employee first obtains judgment against the third party before seeking further workmen\u2019s compensation from the negligent employer undoubtedly denies the third party the smaller judgment ensuing if the employee were to obtain judgment after all possible com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>pensation had been paid. (See <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal. 2d at pp. 71-73.) But, since the employer\u2019s total compensation outlay would be the same in either event, any inequity inherent in the larger judgment is one which burdens only the third party.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Cf., <em>De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In each of the four proceedings here for review, to the extent respondent board\u2019s decision after reconsideration allows the employer or its workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier a credit under either section 3858 or section 3861 of the Labor Code, said decision is annulled and each cause is remanded to the board for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Friedman, Acting P. J., and Regan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On October 8, 1970, the opinion was modified to read as printed above. The petitions of the respondent board in all the cases and of respondent Transport Indemnity Co. in No. 12397 for a hearing by the Supreme Court were denied November 18, 1970.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The Supreme Court has not yet harmonized the views it expressed in <em>De Cruz, supra, </em>with the principle the same court earlier expressed that \u201cThe liability of an insured employer to an employee who is injured during the course of his employment is fundamentally different from that of a third person whose negligent conduct, jointly with that of the employer, resulted in the injury. The third person, of course, is liable under general rules of tort law, as applied by a court. An insured employer, however, is not liable for an industrial injury to his employees under general tort principles but only by virtue of the workmen\u2019s compensation provisions of the Labor Code. . . .\u201d <em>(Lamoreux </em>v. <em>San Diego etc. Ry.

Thereafter, the employer\u2019s concurrent negligence was found by the court on the third party\u2019s motion to have prior compensation benefits applied in partial satisfaction of the judgment. The court\u2019s memorandum opinion and written order granting the motion indicate that it was heard without appearance by the employer or his carrier. Since the employer and compensation carrier were in privity with the employee to the extent that compensation benefits had been paid, the employer and his carrier were bound by the court\u2019s finding of concurrent negligence. (See <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 72; <em>Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 345, 359-362 [57 Cal.Rptr. 394]; <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.2d at pp. 246-248; cf., <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec.

Nor can the third party obtain contribution from the concurrently negligent employer. <em>(De Cruz </em>v. <em>Reid, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d at p. 226, fn. 6.) The Supreme Court has not yet addressed itself to the questions passed upon in <em>Slayton </em>(hg. den.) and <em>Gastelum; </em>and no constitutional or legislative provision authorizes a single, plenary proceeding for adjudication of the ultimate tort and workmen\u2019s compensation liabilities of third party and employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
