We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 17 July 2001, the DOC posted a job opening for Superintendent IV for the Pamlico Correctional Institution. Petitioner Gwendolyn L. Gordon (\"Gordon\"), Robert Hines (\"Hines\"), and five other individuals applied for the position. The Eastern Region Director of the DOC, Joseph Lofton (\"Lofton\"), was the hiring manager for the position. Lofton and two other DOC employees conducted the interviews in July and August 2001. DOC Administrative Officers Wayne Harris and George Hedrick helped screen the applicants for those who were most qualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Gordon and Hines had attained twenty-plus years experience within the DOC. Some of Gordon's experience concentrated on the \"program side,\" which involved primarily delivering medical, dental, diagnostic, psychological, religious, and work training materials to the inmates. Gordon also had extensive experience in supervising inmates, making inmate housing assignments, opening jails, expanding facilities, and developing labor contracts and community work assignments. Gordon is certified as a Basic Correctional Officer. She earned a four-year degree in business administration in the late 1970s. Gordon had been an assistant superintendent for five years and eight months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hines's experience involved more operations and custodial matters than programs. He worked in several \"close custody\" facilities in the past and served as an assistant superintendent for nine years and nine months. He earned a two-year associate degree plus a number of credit hours in business administration in the late 1970s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 9 August 2001, Lofton recommended Hines for the position and DOC Secretary Theodis Beck (\"Secretary Beck\") promoted Hines on 13 September 2001. Hines began work on 1 October 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 18 January 2002, Gordon filed a petition for a contested case hearing with the Office of Administrative Hearings (the \"OAH\") to contest the DOC's decision to promote Hines over her. Gordon alleged the DOC's decision was based on race and gender discrimination. Following a hearing, the ALJ determined the DOC discriminated against Gordon because of her race and gender and ordered she receive back pay and benefits from the date of Hines's promotion forward until she received a comparable promotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ALJ's decision and record were sent to the Commission on 11 February 2003. The Commission issued a decision and order on 26 March 2003 reversing the ALJ's order. Gordon petitioned the trial court on 9 April 2003 for review of the Commission's order reversing the ALJ decision. After Gordon petitioned for judicial review and filed motions for sanctions against the DOC, the Commission withdrew its 26 March 2003 decision and order on 14 April 2003 on the grounds it did not have the complete record. The Commission failed to file a motion to extend the time to issue its decision and the parties did not stipulate to an extension. On 4 June 2003, the Commission issued a second order and decision reversing the ALJ. Gordon filed a second petition for judicial review by the trial court, re-filed her motion for sanctions against the DOC, and also moved the trial court for entry of the ALJ's order on the grounds that the Commission was late in filing its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on Gordon's motions on 19 April 2004 and issued an order on 2 June 2004:(1) reversing the Commission's decision as untimely and based on the merits; (2) adopting the ALJ's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final order; and (3) awarding Gordon damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. The DOC appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (1) determining the Commission's decision was null and void for its late entry; (2) determining Gordon established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of race and gender discrimination; and (3) ordering the DOC to pay attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    III. Late Entry of Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The DOC argues the trial court erred in concluding the Commission's order, which reversed the ALJ's decision, was null and void due to its late entry. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-44 (2003) provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Unreasonable delay on the part of\n   <em>\n    any agency\n   </em>\n   or administrative law judge in taking any required action shall be justification for any person whose rights, duties, or privileges are adversely affected by such delay to seek a court order compelling action by the agency or administrative law judge.... An agency that is subject to Article 3 of this Chapter and is a board or commission has 60 days from the day it receives the official record in a contested case from the Office of Administrative Hearings or\n   <em>\n    60 days\n   </em>\n   after its next regularly scheduled meeting, whichever is longer, to make a final decision in the case. This time limit may be extended by the parties or, for good cause shown, by the agency for an additional period of up to 60 days. If an agency subject to Article 3 of this Chapter has not made a final decision within these time limits, the agency is considered to have adopted the administrative law judge's decision as the agency's final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This Court considered this same issue in\n   <em>\n    Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation v.

This holding was based on two primary factors. First, we noted, \"[t]he plain language of G.S. \u00a7 150B-44 indicates the section is intended to guard those involved in the administrative process from the inconvenience and uncertainty of unreasonable delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 725,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20S.E.2d%20300\">\n    504 S.E.2d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, we considered whether the Department of Administration was estopped from asserting the extensions were based on it not having the complete record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20S.E.2d%20300\">\n    504 S.E.2d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On 11 February 2003, the Commission received the \"Official Record\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   from the OAH. Included with the Official Record was a \"Certification\" by the OAH that the attached comprised the \"Official Record.\" The certification also noted, \"Video Tape Deposition of Joseph Lofton (4 video tapes) could not be duplicated for inclusion in the Official Record. They are on file in the Clerk's office and are available for review upon advanced notice.\" Kim Hausen, Chief Clerk of the OAH, provided a sworn affidavit stating in pertinent part, \"no commission member contacted me at the Office of Administrative Hearings to view the tapes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite not requesting the videotapes, the Commission issued its original decision and order on 26 March 2003 reversing the ALJ's order. On 8 April 2003, Gordon petitioned the trial court for judicial review of the Commission's decision. That same day, Gordon also filed a motion to reopen the record and for sanctions against the DOC for withholding discovery. On 14 April 2003, the Commission withdrew its 26 March 2003 decision and order claiming it did not receive the \"whole\" record from the OAH. Based on the withdrawal, Gordon filed an objection on 17 April 2003 to any further action by the Commission due to untimeliness under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After receiving the \"complete\" record, the videotapes, on 16 April 2003, the Commission issued its second decision and order on 4 June 2003. Our review of both the Commission's original and second decisions and orders show they are virtually identical. Between withdrawal of the Commission's 26 March 2003 decision and order and passage of sixty days from 11 February 2003, the first date of receipt of the record, neither the Commission nor the parties filed a motion to extend the time for filing or stipulated to the extension. Based on this delay, Gordon filed a motion for entry of orders of the ALJ on 30 June 2003. Gordon also re-filed her motions to reopen the record and for sanctions against the DOC. Finally, Gordon petitioned the trial court for judicial review and entry of the ALJ's order. Following judicial review, the trial court reversed the Commission's decision and order and the ALJ's 24 October 2002 decision was deemed \"adopted\" by the Commission. The basis for the reversal was the late entry of the Commission's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the issue, we hold the trial court did not err in reversing the Commission's decision as untimely in violation of N.C.

Conflicting Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The DOC argues substantial evidence does not support the ALJ's and trial court's finding of fact eleven, which states in pertinent part, \"The testimonies of [Lofton] and [Hines] were contradictory, with [Lofton] asserting that he did not know [Hines] other than meeting him one time at Wayne and with [Hines] asserting that he had worked with [Lofton] in the past....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In response to questions about his relationship with Hines, Lofton testified in his deposition:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Lofton: It's rather difficult to say. I guess my actual recollection of professionally involvement with Mr. Hines, really, is when Ms. O'Konek had contacted me about some issues at Wayne Correctional Center, and I met with Mr. Hines and Ms. O'Konek at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Question: You say professionally. Did you know him on an individual basis prior to that time?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lofton: No. No, not really because, I mean, he lives in Goldsboro and I live in Goldsboro, but as far as interacting with each other, no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Question: Are you a member of any social organizations that Mr. Hines is a member of?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Lofton: ACA.

These are organizations that I belong to. I'm a fraternity member. He's not. As far as I know, he's not a member of the fraternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Hines testified that he met Lofton in 1978 when they worked together as correctional officers at Green Correctional Center, a small facility. Only ten to twelve officers worked at Green, in two to three officer shifts. Hines testified that he occasionally worked the same shift with Lofton. Hines also testified that he lived in the same town as Lofton and was a member of some of the same professional and social organizations as Lofton, like the North Carolina Correctional Association and Minority Pioneers. Hines testified both he and Lofton attended meetings and reunions for these clubs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We hold the ALJ and the trial court did not err in finding contradictions in their testimony. Based on the inconsistencies in testimony by Lofton and Hines, relevant evidence existed that \"a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [the] conclusion\" that their versions were contradictory.

This email tends to show that Respondent intended to hire an African American male over a white female regardless of qualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The ALJ determined this email supported Gordon's claim of discrimination. Other evidence found as fact by the trial court and unchallenged by the DOC was \"Oliver Washington, another candidate ..., was not as qualified as either Robert Hines or [Gordon].\" DOC asserts it never considered Washington for the position and the email was only a message by Secretary Beck to Lofton that \"he was content with the choice.\" However, the ALJ and the trial court both found Secretary Beck's explanation for the contents of the email to be \"unworthy of credence.\"\n   <em>\n    See Carroll,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987357\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/649/\">\n    358 N.C. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%20888\">\n    599 S.E.2d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"there is but one fact-finding hearing of record when witness demeanor may be directly observed.

The reviewing court shall\n   award court costs and a reasonable attorney's fee for representation in connection with the appeal to an employee who obtains a reversal or modification of the Commission's decision in an appeal under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6-19.1 (2003) provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In any civil action, other than an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate, or a disciplinary action by a licensing board, brought by the State or brought by a party who is contesting State action pursuant to G.S. 150B-43 or any other appropriate provisions of law, unless the prevailing party is the State, the court may, in its discretion, allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorney's fees, including attorney's fees applicable to the administrative review portion of the case, in contested cases arising under Article 3 of Chapter 150B, to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   (1) The court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (2) The court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorney's fees unjust. The party shall petition for the attorney's fees within 30 days following final disposition of the case. The petition shall be supported by an affidavit setting forth the basis for the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This Court considered each of the above statutes in addressing an award of attorney's fees and costs in\n   <em>\n    Morgan v. N.C. Dept. of Transportation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888999\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/124/180/\">\n    124 N.C.App. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20431\">\n    476 S.E.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). We held review of attorney's fees under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-41 was limited to those fees accrued\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20431\">\n    476 S.E.2d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6-19.1 does not apply to \"services rendered prior to judicial review.\"). The trial court must review the Commission's decree of attorney's fees under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-41.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=476%20S.E.2d%20431\">\n    476 S.E.2d at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    A. Pre-Judicial Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Here, the ALJ made extensive findings concerning attorneys' fees and costs during its review. Following its consideration of the matter, it substantially reduced the number of hours requested by Gordon to be paid from 315.85 to 233.35 hours. The trial court reviewed the ALJ's award and reviewed affidavits from counsel in support of and in opposition to Gordon's motion for attorneys' fees. In addition to those fees accrued prior to judicial review, the trial court awarded additional attorneys' fees for representation subsequent to the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Based on our review of both the ALJ's thorough consideration and decision concerning attorneys' fees and costs prior to judicial review and the trial court's subsequent adoption, we hold the trial court did not err in determining the ALJ's award was not \"unreasonable\" or \"inadequate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    B. Judicial Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   After reversing the Commission's decision, the trial court was required to award Gordon attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-41 (\"The reviewing court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   award court costs and a reasonable attorney's fee for representation in connection with the appeal to an employee who obtains a reversal or modification of the Commission's decision in an appeal under this section.\" (emphasis supplied)). The trial court properly awarded attorneys' fees and costs under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-41. Thus, we need not consider the application of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6-19.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    C. Opportunity to Respond\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The DOC also asserts it had no opportunity to respond to the award of attorneys' fees to Gordon. Gordon correctly notes and the record shows that on 28 April 2004, Judge J. Richard Parker sent letters to both parties notifying them of his intention to reverse the Commission's decision and adopt the decision of the ALJ. Included in the letter is the following provision: \"Prior to drafting an order reflecting my decision, I direct Ms. Bryant to submit an affidavit regarding attorney's fees and costs of Petitioner as directed by the Administrative Law Judge in his decision. If the Respondent so elects an affidavit may be filed in opposition to attorney's fees.\" The DOC's counsel responded\n   on 10 May 2004, asserting, \"I will be responding to Ms. Bryant's affidavit within one (1) week.\" On 12 May 2004, Judge Parker sent both parties a letter affirming the ALJ's award of attorneys' fees and costs and ordering additional attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   We are not persuaded that the DOC did not have an opportunity to respond. Two weeks passed between Judge Parker mailing the first letter and drafting the order for additional attorneys' fees. We hold the trial court provided sufficient notice and time for both parties to respond to its request for affidavits in support of or in opposition to attorneys' fees and costs. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The trial court properly reversed the Commission's decision due to delay in entry of its decision and, as a result, adopted the ALJ's recommended decision. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-44. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ's and the trial court's findings of fact. Our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the conclusions of law shows Gordon proffered evidence to prove a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination. The ALJ and trial court properly awarded Gordon attorneys' fees and costs for representation before the ALJ, the Commission, and the trial court. The trial court's adoption of the ALJ's decision and its subsequent order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and BRYANT concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
