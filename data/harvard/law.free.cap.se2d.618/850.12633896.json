Defendant argues on appeal that the trial court (1) erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge because there was insufficient evidence to support such a charge, (2) committed plain error by not properly instructing the jury on the charge of conspiracy to commit murder, and (3) erred by imposing an aggravated sentence based upon judicially-found aggravating factors. We hold that there was sufficient evidence to deny the motion to dismiss and that the court did not commit plain error in its instructions to the jury. With respect to defendant's sentence, however, we hold that under\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3796256\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/425/\">\n    359 N.C. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/\">\n    615 S.E.2d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), this case must be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following. In January 2003, Neko Hyatt was stabbed to death by George Boston after an altercation outside a nightclub in Asheville, North Carolina. Defendant was present at the nightclub on the night of the murder and witnessed the altercation between Hyatt and Boston. Boston was later arrested and charged with the murder of Neko Hyatt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In early May 2003, Boston was released on bond while the murder charge was pending. Those close to Neko Hyatt were upset, including Charles Hyatt (Neko Hyatt's brother) and defendant (Charles Hyatt's cousin). Boston's sister, Kimberly Boston, stated that her brother primarily stayed inside because there had been talk on the streets that something might happen to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 24 May 2003, George Boston was sitting outside of the Deaverview Apartments. Kimberly Boston, who was also outside, saw two men drive by two or three times in a PT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cruiser, but she could not identify the men. Later, Kimberly saw a tall man, wearing a white T-shirt and a baseball cap on his head, come from behind one of the buildings. A deliveryman testified that the man had a white shirt or towel draped over what looked like a gun. The man raised his arm and fired three or four shots at George Boston before running to the PT Cruiser, which was waiting with the passenger door open. Kimberly chased after the PT Cruiser and got a partial license tag number. George Boston died later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kimberly Boston testified at trial that she believed, based upon the person's build, that defendant was the man who shot George Boston. Kimberly knew defendant because he had dated her sister for a time, and she also knew that defendant had recently made threats against her brother. George's older brother, Marcellus Boston, also identified defendant as the shooter based upon his build and from seeing his face from the eyes down. Marcellus could not see the shooter's entire face because he had a white shirt draped on his head. Another witness, Nikki Griffin, testified that while she could not see the shooter's face, she thought it was defendant based upon the way he carried himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the shooting, the police radioed all officers to watch for a gold PT Cruiser with two black males in the area of Deaverview Apartments. Shortly thereafter, an officer spotted and subsequently stopped the PT Cruiser. The officer arrested the driver, Charles Hyatt. No one else was in the car at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Hyatt, who was charged with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder, was called to testify by the State at defendant's trial. He stated that, on 24 May 2003, defendant, who was driving a burgundy car, agreed to give Hyatt a ride to get something to eat. Later, defendant decided instead to go to Deaverview Apartments. Hyatt testified that he was \"all right with that.\" The two of them then borrowed a PT Cruiser from Carmell Harding. Harding had rented the car from Enterprise Rent-A-Car. After defendant dropped off the burgundy car, defendant drove the two men to the Deaverview Apartments in the PT Cruiser. Hyatt testified that at that point he \"had no clue\" why they were going to the apartment complex. When they spotted George Boston, defendant said to Hyatt, \"[t]here he goes\" and exclaimed \"[b]itch n____r.\" Hyatt acknowledged that George Boston was the only person they were looking for and that when defendant said \"there he goes,\" Hyatt knew whom he meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After saying \"[t]here he goes,\" defendant stopped the car down the road from the apartments and Hyatt moved to the driver's seat. Defendant got out of the car with a t-shirt balled up in his hand and headed into some trees across the street. Hyatt claimed that he did not see defendant take a gun. Hyatt then got in the driver's seat and drove around the complex for a few minutes by himself. Defendant called Hyatt on his cell phone and said, \"Let's roll.\" As Hyatt drove towards the apartment complex exit, he heard three or four gunshots, but did not see the shooting itself. Hyatt picked up defendant near the apartment complex exit and they drove away without saying a word.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At defendant's direction, Hyatt drove defendant to defendant's uncle's house near the French Broad River by a route through the countryside. Defendant never said anything about what had happened at the apartments. As Hyatt was driving the PT Cruiser back to Asheville to return it to Harding, he was stopped by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When interviewed by the police that afternoon, Hyatt initially falsely told them that he alone had borrowed the PT Cruiser and was by himself at Deaverview Apartments when defendant called to ask him for a ride. Hyatt claimed that he had simply picked defendant up and driven defendant to defendant's uncle's house. When the police asked Hyatt to call defendant on his cell phone, he refused to do so. Later, Hyatt gave statements consistent with his trial testimony. Hyatt also testified at trial that defendant had not discussed going to Deaverview Apartments to kill Boston and that there was no plan or agreement. According to Hyatt, it \"just happened.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant was subsequently indicted with first degree murder and conspiracy to commit\n   first degree murder. These charges were tried on 10 May 2004 before Judge E. Penn Dameron, Jr. in Buncombe County Superior Court. The jury found defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit first degree murder. It could not, however, reach a unanimous verdict on the first degree murder charge, and the judge declared a mistrial as to that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the sentencing phase, Judge Dameron found as aggravating factors that (1) the offense was committed to disrupt the lawful exercise of a governmental function or the enforcement of the laws, (2) defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person by means of a weapon or device, and (3) defendant committed the offense while on pre-trial release. The judge found as mitigating factors that (1) defendant had a support system in the community, and (2) defendant had a positive employment history. The judge concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced defendant in the aggravated range to a term of 276 to 341 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant gave oral notice of appeal from his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder following sentencing on 13 May 2004. Defendant later filed a motion for appropriate relief with this Court on 13 October 2004 based on\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant first assigns error to the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the charge of conspiracy to commit first degree murder. Defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence of an agreement between defendant and Charles Hyatt to support a finding of a conspiracy. When considering a motion to dismiss by a criminal defendant, the trial court must determine whether the State has presented substantial evidence of every essential element of the crime and that the defendant is the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    State v.

After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a charge of conspiracy to commit murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The evidence at trial indicated that both Hyatt and defendant were upset that Boston had been released on bond after killing Hyatt's brother. On the day of the murder, although Hyatt had requested a ride to get something to eat, defendant suggested instead that they go to Deaverview Apartments where they ultimately found Boston - a change with which Hyatt was \"all right.\" Rather than simply driving there in defendant's girlfriend's car, which defendant already was driving, the two men borrowed a rental car from another person - conduct that the jury could view as an attempt to avoid identification. After driving back and forth through the apartment complex, defendant announced \"[t]here he is,\" and Hyatt acknowledged that he understood defendant to be referring to Boston because that was the only person for whom they would be looking. Defendant immediately stopped the car and got out, while Hyatt drove around until he received a cell phone call from defendant, saying \"[l]et's roll.\" At that point, Hyatt drove to a particular spot, stopped the car, and opened the passenger door. Although Hyatt heard a series of gunshots, he did not say anything to defendant after defendant jumped in the car, but simply drove him through the countryside to defendant's uncle's house. When he was stopped by the police while heading back to return the car, he initially told a false story to cover up the fact that the two men had together borrowed the PT Cruiser and gone to the Deaverview Apartments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A reasonable juror could infer from this evidence an implicit agreement to work together to accomplish the goal of revenge for the murder of Hyatt's brother.

Additionally, because we find no error in the instructions, defendant's claim for ineffective assistance of counsel must also be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendant's final assignment of error asserts that he improperly received an aggravated sentence based upon judicially-found aggravating factors in violation of\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The State argues that this claim is procedurally barred because defendant failed to object at trial and that any error in not submitting the aggravating factors to the jury is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Supreme Court of this State addressed the impact of\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    State v. Allen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3796256\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/425/\">\n    359 N.C. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633238\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/615/256/\">\n    615 S.E.2d 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). In\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   the court held that \"\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   applies to North Carolina's Structured Sentencing Act\" and that the portions of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.16 (2003) that permit the imposition of an aggravated sentence based upon judicial findings of aggravating factors \"violate[] the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in\n   <em>\n    Blakely.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426-27, 615 S.E.2d at 258. The Court further held that the harmless-error rule does not apply to sentencing errors under\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   because such errors \"are structural and, therefore, reversible\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 444, 615 S.E.2d at 269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The holdings set forth in\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   apply to \"`cases that are now pending on direct review.'\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 427, 615 S.E.2d at 258 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Allen,\n   </em>\n   the trial court erred in this case by imposing an aggravated sentence based upon aggravating factors found by the trial judge and not by the jury. Because such errors are reversible\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   we remand this case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   No error in conviction; remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Judges TIMMONS-GOODSON and CALABRIA concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
