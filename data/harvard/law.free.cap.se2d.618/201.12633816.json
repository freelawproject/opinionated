On 14 May 2000 at approximately 12:30 a.m., plaintiff arrived at a crime scene shortly after the arrest of Owen Jackson Nichols on suspicion of driving while impaired. Plaintiff did not directly participate in or witness Nichols's apprehension or arrest, which was effectuated by SHP Troopers B.O. Johnson, P.A. Collins, and J.R. Edwards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While speaking with another trooper at the scene, plaintiff was approached by Trooper P.A. Collins. Plaintiff noticed that Trooper Collins was rubbing his hand and asked whether he had been injured. Trooper Collins replied that he had jammed his hand after hitting Owen Nichols and that Trooper Edwards had \"pulled it back in place.\" When plaintiff advised Trooper Collins to seek medical treatment, Trooper Collins responded that he \"wouldn't know what to tell the sergeant\" and added that he could tell the sergeant he broke his hand during a fall. After stating once again that Trooper Collins should seek medical attention, plaintiff departed the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that day, Andy Nichols, the father of Owen Nichols, filed a complaint with the Internal Affairs Section of the SHP, alleging that Troopers Johnson, Collins, and Edwards had used excessive force in the apprehension and arrest of his son. Nearly a month later, on 13 June 2000, plaintiff's supervisor, First Sergeant A.C. Combs, asked plaintiff if he had been involved in the apprehension and arrest of Owen Nichols or if he had witnessed anyone using force on Owen Nichols. Plaintiff responded that he arrived on the scene only after Nichols had been placed under arrest and that he did not witness anyone using force on Nichols. Plaintiff also reported that Trooper Collins had apparently injured his hand during the incident. At the conclusion of this conversation, First Sergeant Combs instructed plaintiff to \"write what he saw\" in a statement and to submit that statement before the end of plaintiff's shift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff became apprehensive about preparing the statement, fearing that \"breaking the code of silence\" and disclosing facts concerning a potential abuse of authority by another officer might subject him to retaliation by First Sergeant Combs and others within the Department and the SHP. Plaintiff therefore complied with First Sergeant Combs's request by preparing a statement, incorporated by reference in plaintiff's complaint, limited to what he literally \"saw\" on the night in question. Plaintiff wrote in his statement that Trooper Collins had apparently injured his hand, but did not include Trooper Collins's oral comments concerning\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   he had incurred that injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Despite having strictly followed First Sergeant Combs's instructions to write what he \"saw,\" plaintiff remained troubled about whether he should also have included Trooper Collins's admission that he had struck Owen Nichols, notwithstanding plaintiff's fear of retaliation and reprisal. Accordingly, plaintiff sought the counsel of another trooper with the SHP, Sergeant Montgomery, in whom plaintiff confided both his fear of retaliation and his desire to \"do the right thing.\" Shortly after soliciting and receiving Sergeant Montgomery's advice, plaintiff approached First Sergeant Combs on 20 June\n   2000 and told him there were \"things he didn't know\" about the events of 14 May 2000. First Sergeant Combs directed plaintiff to prepare an amended statement including everything he knew about the incident, and plaintiff prepared and submitted his amended statement later that day. In the amended report, which is incorporated by reference in plaintiff's complaint, plaintiff disclosed the details of his conversation with Trooper Collins at the crime scene, including Trooper Collins's alleged statements, \"I hit the subject and jammed my hand\" and \"It just happened, I should know better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On 15 September 2000, defendant Captain C.E. Moody, SHP Director of Internal Affairs, filed a personnel complaint against plaintiff based on information provided to him by First Sergeant Combs. The personnel complaint alleged that plaintiff had engaged in a \"Serious Personal Conduct Violation\" of the SHP Policy Manual's Directive No. H.1 Section VI, the so-called \"Truthfulness Directive.\" On 10 April 2001, plaintiff was terminated from his employment with the Department and the SHP, ostensibly based on his violation of the Truthfulness Directive. Although at least some of the troopers directly involved in Owen Nichols's detention and arrest were disciplined for misconduct following an investigation into the 14 May 2000 incident, plaintiff was the only trooper whose employment was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on the factual allegations summarized above, plaintiff asserted a claim for damages under the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-84 to -88. In stating his claim for relief, plaintiff expressly contended that defendants \"discharged [p]laintiff because [p]laintiff reported to his superiors, both verbally and in writing, information in the Amended Statement that supports a contention that the Troopers violated State or federal law, rule or regulation and exercised gross abuse of authority in the apprehension and arrest of Owen Nichols.\" Plaintiff further asserted that defendants \"discriminated against [p]laintiff for submitting the Amended Statement\" in that plaintiff's dismissal was \"grossly inequitable in comparison with the treatment and/or sanctions received by [the] other Troopers who were disciplined for the same and/or more severe misconduct but were not terminated.\" Plaintiff also contended that his termination \"was pretextual in the perceived need to protect the Department and Division from a potential civil law suit by Owen Nichols for the use of excessive force.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 1989, the General Assembly amended Chapter 126 of the North Carolina General Statutes, the State Personnel Act (SPA), by enacting Senate Bill 125, entitled \"An Act to Encourage Reporting of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse in State Government and Endangerment to the Public Health and Safety, and to Protect Informant State Employees from Retaliation,\" and popularly known as the \"Whistleblower Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Caudill v.

Now codified as Article 14 of Chapter 126, the Whistleblower Act declares that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [i]t is the policy of this State that State employees shall be encouraged to report verbally or in writing to their supervisor, department head, or other appropriate authority, evidence of activity by a State agency or State employee constituting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) A violation of State or federal law, rule or regulation;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) Fraud;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) Misappropriation of State resources;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) Substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (5) Gross mismanagement, a gross waste of monies, or gross abuse of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-84(a) (2003). The Whistleblower Act further provides, in pertinent part, that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [n]o head of any State department, agency or institution or other State employee exercising supervisory authority shall discharge, threaten or otherwise discriminate against a State employee regarding the State employee's compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because the State employee, or a\n   person acting on behalf of the employee, reports or is about to report, verbally or in writing, any activity described in G.S. 126-84, unless the State employee knows or has reason to believe that the report is inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-85(a) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This Court has not previously had occasion to review claims brought under the Whistleblower Act. Based on our careful reading of the statute, however, we hold that the Act requires plaintiffs to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following three essential elements: (1) that the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity, (2) that the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff in his or her employment, and (3) that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action taken against the plaintiff. This parsing of the statute is consistent with numerous state and federal court decisions identifying the essential elements of comparable whistleblower provisions in various state and federal statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Moon v.

Emphasizing plaintiff's omission of the details of his conversation with Trooper Collins in his initial report, defendants assert that \"[p]laintiff's lying and misleading inaccuracies were the reason he was disciplined.\" Defendants further contend that \"[l]ying to a supervisor is not [w]histle-blowing and is certainly not a `protected activity'\" under the Whistleblowing Act. Finally, defendants contend that \"[p]laintiff's [c]omplaint d[oes] not contain facts sufficient to show that his dismissal was for any reason other than his own untruthfulness\" in his initial report. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As an initial matter, even assuming plaintiff's initial report contained \"misleading inaccuracies,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   we do not agree with defendants' contention that any \"admission of untruthfulness\" on the part of the plaintiff\n   necessarily constitutes \"a complete bar to recovery\" under the Whistleblower Act. The Whistleblower Act prohibits employment retaliation against a state employee who files a report alleging certain categories of misconduct or mismanagement by other state employees or agencies \"unless the State employee knows or has reason to believe that the report is inaccurate.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-85(a). The plain meaning of this proviso is that the Act does not apply to employees who make allegations of mismanagement or wrongdoing which they know or should know to be false. In other words, the Act does not protect\n   <em>\n    false whistleblowing allegations,\n   </em>\n   unless the plaintiff had no reason to know of their falsehood.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Westman &amp; Modesitt,\n   <em>\n    Whistleblowing\n   </em>\n   Ch. 2 \u00a7 II.E.2, at 52 (noting that \"false [whistleblowing] allegations serve no public interest\"); Lois A.

Nothing in the language or legislative history of the Act suggests that the General Assembly intended to render the Act inapplicable when an employee's whistleblowing allegation appears in a supplemental or amended report, rather than an initial report. Indeed, such a construction would undermine the legislatively declared policy of this state that the reporting of various forms of governmental mismanagement and wrongdoing shall be \"encouraged.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-84(a). Moreover, as a simple matter of logic, the failure to make an allegation of wrongdoing in an\n   <em>\n    initial report\n   </em>\n   does not render an\n   <em>\n    amended or supplemental report\n   </em>\n   which contains such an allegation \"inaccurate\" under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-85(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   More importantly, defendants' assertion that the \"lying and misleading inaccuracies\" in plaintiff's initial report were the true reason for plaintiff's dismissal is merely a\n   <em>\n    factual allegation\n   </em>\n   - one that is directly contradicted by the factual allegations in plaintiff's complaint. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a trial court must \"take all allegations of fact in the complaint as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Cage v. Colonial Bldg.

Although plaintiff acknowledged in his complaint that the\n   <em>\n    professed\n   </em>\n   reason for his dismissal was his purported violation of the Truthfulness Directive, he also expressly alleged that the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   reason for his termination was his disclosure of a possible abuse of authority in his\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   statement. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that \"[d]efendants discharged [p]laintiff because [p]laintiff reported to his superiors, both verbally and in writing, information in the\n   <em>\n    Amended Statement\n   </em>\n   that supports a contention that the [t]roopers violated State or federal law, rule or regulation and exercised gross abuse of authority in the apprehension and arrest of Owen Nichols.\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, plaintiff has stated a claim for relief under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-84(a)(1) and (5), and the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of plaintiff's whistleblower claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, we address defendants' argument that dismissal was proper because plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) before filing his complaint in the trial court.

First, plaintiff indicated that he was \"discharge[d] without just cause.\" Second, plaintiff indicated that he was terminated due to \"discrimination and/or retaliation for opposition to alleged discrimination,\" and that \"the type of discrimination\" was \"[r]ace.\" In his only textual elaboration of the basis for his petition, plaintiff simply stated, \"I was dismissed as a Highway Patrolman without just cause based upon a complete misinterpretation of my actions and statements re: a case of excessive force.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nowhere in his petition did plaintiff reference the Whistleblower Act or allege that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his reporting a potential abuse of authority by other officers in the SHP. Although plaintiff's allegation that he was dismissed\n   \"without just cause based upon a complete misinterpretation of [his] actions and statements\" is not inconsistent with the factual allegations in his subsequently filed whistleblower claim, the language in his petition in no way states a claim under the Whistleblower Act. Indeed, of the eleven specific statutory grounds for filing a contested case under the SPA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-34.1 (2003), plaintiff's petition states only two: (1) that he was terminated without \"just cause\" in violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-35, and (2) that he was terminated because of his race in violation of Chapter 168A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(1), (2). Conspicuously absent from plaintiff's petition is any allegation that his dismissal constituted a \"retaliatory personnel action that violates [the Whistleblower Act],\" an entirely separate statutory ground for seeking an administrative hearing in the OAH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(7).

Taken in context, however, this statement in plaintiff's complaint strongly supports his assertion that he did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    allege a violation of the Whistleblower Act in his administrative action. Plaintiff stated that he \"did not exhaust his\n    <em>\n     potential\n    </em>\n    administrative remedies for his claim of retaliation in that the same would have been futile and inadequate\" because \"\n    <em>\n     [h]ad plaintiff filed a petition for Contested Case Hearing for retaliation,\n    </em>\n    \" he would have been (1) \"deprived of his right to a trial by jury,\" (2) \"deprived of his right to sue any defendant individually,\" and (3) \"deprived of his right to be awarded treble damages against individuals found to be in willful violation.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, plaintiff's complaint is entirely consistent with his contention on appeal that his petition for a contested case hearing did\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    state a claim of retaliation under the Whistleblower Act, in addition to explaining his reasons for not doing so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
