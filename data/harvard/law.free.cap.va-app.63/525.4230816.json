Appellant argues on appeal that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion when it failed to take the matter under advisement pursuant to <em>Starrs v. Commonwealth.\u201d </em>However, the stated purpose for taking the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>under advisement was irrelevant to appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charged offense. For the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">I. Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At appellant\u2019s November 26, 2012 bench trial, appellant through his defense counsel did not challenge the credibility or weight of any of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proving that appellant committed the felony \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 on April 24, 2012.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not move to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence or make any closing argument asserting that the Commonwealth failed to prove appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, defense counsel only requested that the trial court \u201ctake [the case] under advisement\u201d and \u201cnot make a formal finding of guilt\u201d under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Defense counsel first raised the issue of a deferred disposition before the Commonwealth had introduced any evidence during its case-in-chief \u2014 when defense counsel actually acknowledged that it was \u201clikely\u201d that the trial court would \u201cdetermine that the evidence is sufficient to find [appellant] guilty\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, defense counsel asked for \u201ca bond\u201d for appellant, claiming that \u201cthere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>is a possibility [appellant] may get his license reinstated\u201d by the DMV. Defense counsel asserted that the relief he requested was supported by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Starrs v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 39, 733 S.E.2d 142 (2012), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>287 Va. 1, 752 S.E.2d 812 (2014).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the prosecutor argued that the trial court lacked \u201cthe authority to defer the finding\u201d of guilt \u2014 and also asserted that, \u201cgiven the defendant\u2019s criminal history, it is not an appropriate case to defer [a] finding.\u201d The trial court initially found that defense counsel\u2019s request to take the matter under advisement was \u201cpremature,\u201d given that no evidence had even been introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">After the Commonwealth concluded its case-in-chief and the defense elected not to present any evidence, defense counsel renewed his request for the trial court to take the matter under advisement. Defense counsel claimed, \u201cThere is a chance, however remote it may be, that [appellant] can get his license reinstated.\u201d Defense counsel told the trial court that appellant had indicated to him that \u201ceverything\u201d related to the revocation of his driving privilege was related to \u201cthe failure to pay fines\u201d and that appellant assured him that appellant \u201chas no drug problems or alcohol or any of that.\u201d According to the record on appeal, however, appellant was actually convicted of driving while intoxicated in June 1993 and February 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">While requesting that the trial court take the matter under advisement at the November 26, 2012 bench trial, defense counsel did not introduce or proffer any evidence explaining the process by which appellant could get his driver\u2019s license reinstated by the DMV. Defense counsel did not give any indication of the likelihood that appellant actually could get his driver\u2019s license reinstated \u2014 other than characterizing the \u201cchance\u201d of doing so as \u201cremote.\u201d Moreover, defense counsel did not even explain <em>why </em>appellant\u2019s efforts to get his driver\u2019s license reinstated after the November 26, 2012 bench trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>could be relevant in determining whether appellant violated Code \u00a7 46.2-357 on the alleged offense date of April 24, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">During argument on defense counsel\u2019s request for the matter to be taken under advisement, the parties and the trial court addressed whether the trial court had the authority or power to grant that relief. Beyond conveying its understanding of what this Court had stated in <em>Starrs,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>however, the trial court never made any express findings related to the extent of its authority. At the conclusion of the argument, the trial court commented on some of the evidence relevant to the request to take the matter under advisement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">[Appellant\u2019s] driving occurred on April 24th, 2012. It is now November 26th, 2012, and it is suggested to me that [appellant] would like to pay off his fines to get his license restored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">It appears his first conviction was 2001. His second conviction was 2007. By my computation, he has been aware of his status. [Appellant] has had at least 11 years to undertake to try to get his fines paid off and have his license restored; and I believe, quite frankly \u2014 although I appreciate [defense counsel\u2019s] efforts on behalf of Mr. Harris, I believe his request comes far too late; and, therefore, I am going to deny your request that I take the matter under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>advisement, but I certainly will note your exception to the Court\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">After denying defense counsel\u2019s request, the trial court stated that it would then \u201cproceed to judgment.\u201d The trial court found appellant guilty of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant through defense counsel did not ask the trial court to reconsider its decision not to defer its disposition of the case before the trial court entered its written conviction order on January 2, 2013. At appellant\u2019s March 14, 2013 sentencing hearing in the trial court, appellant was sentenced for the present felony offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) \u2014 as well as for another Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) felony offense, to which appellant had pled guilty, which occurred while appellant was on bond for the present offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Appellant asserts in his assignment of error to this Court that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion when it failed to take the matter under advisement\u201d at the November 24, 2012 bench trial. The trial court instead proceeded to convict appellant under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant claims that the trial court found it \u201chad no authority\u201d to take the case under advisement. Appellant contends further that such a finding \u2014 assuming, of course, that the trial court actually made it \u2014 was erroneous. In his petition for appeal, appellant relied on language from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Starrs, </em>which in turn quoted the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 226, 707 S.E.2d 273, 275 (2011), accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">[Djuring the interval between the conclusion of the evidence and the entry of a written order adjudicating the defendant guilty, the circuit court ha[s] the inherent power, in the exercise of its discretion, to take the matter under advisement and to continue the case for future disposition, subject to such lawful conditions as the court might prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajk\"><em>Starrs, </em>61 Va.App. at 44, 733 S.E.2d at 144; <em>see also Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 71, 81, 717 S.E.2d 151, 156 (2011) (also released after <em>Hernandez </em>and also quoting the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>language). In addition, appellant now relies on the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Starrs, </em>which was released during the briefing stage of this appeal and also contains the same language that is quoted above. <em>See Starrs, </em>287 Va. at 7, 752 S.E.2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court here misconstrued this language from <em>Starrs </em>and found \u2014 prior to the actual adjudication of appellant\u2019s guilt \u2014 -that it lacked any authority to defer its finding of guilt and to continue the matter for a future disposition. The trial court clearly did not make that finding on the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The transcript of the November 26, 2012 bench trial establishes that, when the trial court ruled on appellant\u2019s request to take the matter under advisement, the trial court actually denied that request <em>on the merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As the trial court explained from the bench, appellant at the time of the November 26, 2012 bench trial had twice previously been convicted under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 for driving a motor vehicle after having been adjudicated a habitual offender. Appellant then committed the present offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 when he drove a motor vehicle on April 24, 2012. Seven months later, at appellant\u2019s bench trial, defense counsel all but acknowledged appellant\u2019s guilt for the present felony offense. Defense counsel stated, before any evidence was introduced, that a conviction was \u201clikely.\u201d However, he asked the trial court to delay pronouncing its judgment until a later date. Defense counsel claimed that there was \u201ca chance, however remote it may be,\u201d that appellant could get his driver\u2019s license reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The trial court obviously disagreed with defense counsel\u2019s contention that a continuance for that purpose was appropriate \u2014 especially given that defense counsel never actually explained <em>why </em>a \u201cremote\u201d hope of reinstating appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license after November 26, 2012 was in any way relevant in determining appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 <em>on April 2k, 2012. </em>It was in this context that the trial court told defense counsel, \u201c[AJlthough I appreciate your efforts on behalf of Mr. Harris, <em>I believe his request comes far too late; and, therefore, I am going to deny your request </em>that I take this matter under advisement\u201d for a future disposition. (Emphasis added). The full context of the trial court\u2019s ruling makes clear that appellant\u2019s request came \u201cfar too late\u201d because the trial court did not believe that the request <em>had any bearing on appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence </em>pertaining to the charged felony second or subsequent offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357 that occurred on April 24, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Accordingly, the record shows that the trial court exercised authority to consider \u2014 and deny \u2014 defense counsel\u2019s request to take the matter under advisement at the conclusion of the November 26, 2012 bench trial. However, this conclusion does not end our analysis of appellant\u2019s assignment of error. He contends in his assignment of error that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion when it <em>failed </em>to take the matter under advisement\u201d at the end of the bench trial. This is a broad claim that implicates not just the initial issue of the trial court\u2019s authority to consider a deferred disposition \u2014 but also the soundness of the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision finding that a deferred disposition was inappropriate. Moreover, at the conclusion of his opening brief, appellant also broadly seeks an order from this Court essentially directing the trial court <em>to grant </em>defense counsel\u2019s deferred disposition request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The scope of this appeal reaches the actual merits of a deferred disposition request \u2014 an issue the Supreme Court of Virginia has not squarely addressed in either <em>Hernandez </em>or <em>Starrs. </em>In those cases, two different trial judges denied requests for deferred dispositions on the ground that they <em>could not </em>consider (or grant) a deferred disposition because they lacked authority to grant the relief when the requests were made. On that specific issue, the Supreme Court found reversible error. <em>See Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 226, 707 S.E.2d at 275 (holding that \u201cinherent authority\u201d to defer disposition existed after the trial court found that the evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant); <em>see also Starrs, </em>287 Va. at 13, 752 S.E.2d at 819 (holding that \u201cinherent authority\u201d to defer disposition still existed after the defendant pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, which the trial court then accepted in a written order). <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Starrs </em>determine <em>how far </em>into the trial proceedings, according to the Supreme Court, a trial court\u2019s authority to defer a disposition extends. However, neither <em>Hernandez </em>nor <em>Starrs </em>discusses whether those defendants\u2019 deferred disposition requests had actual merit \u2014 a decision left to the trial judges on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Starrs </em>identify a narrow aspect of judicial authority prior to the entry of the conviction order that permits a trial court, \u201cin the exercise of its discretion,\u201d to defer the disposition of a criminal trial until a later date. But that discretion is not limitless. <em>See Sys. Fed\u2019n No. 91 Ry. Employees\u2019 Dep\u2019t v. Wright, </em>364 U.S. 642, 648, 81 S.Ct. 368, 371, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961) (explaining that a judge\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is never without limits\u201d). Judicial discretion is abused if a decision does not stay within the appropriate \u201crange of choice\u201d and is \u201cunsup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>portable\u201d under the law. <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 212-13, 738 S.E.2d 847, 861 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We do not and <em>cannot </em>read the holdings in <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Starrs </em>to alter the fundamental principle of judicial restraint or the constitutionally required separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government \u2014 a doctrine so important to our Commonwealth that it is enshrined twice in Virginia\u2019s Constitution. <em>See </em>Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 5; art. III, \u00a7 1; <em>see also Taylor v. Worrell Enters., Inc., </em>242 Va. 219, 221, 409 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1991) (explaining that the separation of powers doctrine \u201cprevents one branch from engaging in the functions of another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In fact, the Supreme Court of Virginia expressly identified the separation of powers doctrine in <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 661 S.E.2d 841 (2008), which preceded <em>Hernandez </em>and <em>Starrs. </em>There, the Supreme Court applied case law from the United States Supreme Court holding that \u201cthe federal constitution \u2018gives the Federal Judiciary the power, not merely to rule on cases, but to decide them\u2019 \u201d in a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 661 S.E.2d at 846 (quoting <em>Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, </em>514 U.S. 211, 218-19, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 1453, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995)). However, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Moreau, </em>the judiciary may not ignore the constitutional separation of powers and \u201c \u2018exercise the powers properly belonging to\u2019 \u201d another branch of government. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846 (quoting Va. Const, art. III, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The separation of powers doctrine that is so essential to our Commonwealth \u2014 and to our nation \u2014 simply does not permit a trial court to step outside the boundaries of the law and declare that \u201ca particular act made criminal by law ought not to be treated as criminal\u201d in a case where the defendant\u2019s guilt has been proven. <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 42, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916); <em>see also Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 450, 53 S.Ct. 210, 215, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932) (explaining that the judiciary lacks any power to refuse \u201cto perform a duty resting upon it\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>interfere with the constitutional \u201clegislative and executive authority\u201d by declining to adjudicate a criminal case \u201cbecause it desires to let the defendant go free\u201d); <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 809, 109 S.E. 460, 462 (1921) (stating that a trial court is not permitted to agree \u201cwith the prisoner to excuse him forever from the penalties of his crime\u201d). Trial courts lack any \u201cauthority to free guilty defendants\u201d following a lawful trial, <em>Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at 449, 53 S.Ct. at 215, because it is the executive branch that holds the constitutional power to extend clemency and issue pardons, <em>see </em>Va. Const. art. V, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia could not have intended in its <em>Moreau, Hernandez, </em>and <em>Starrs </em>decisions to hold that a trial court somehow possesses the power of <em>judicial clemency. See Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846; <em>see also Sorrells, </em>287 U.S. at 450, 53 S.Ct. at 216 (stating that \u201c[j]udicial nullification\u201d has \u201cno place in our system\u201d of justice). We also reached that conclusion in <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 435, 710 S.E.2d 518 (2011), <em>appeal refused, </em>Rec. No. 111413 (Va.S.Ct. Nov. 8, 2011), where we found there was no general power of judicial clemency after reviewing the Virginia Constitution, the common law, and the Code of Virginia. As we noted in <em>Taylor, </em>neither <em>Moreau </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>\u201caddresses what future disposition the court has authority to impose\u201d or mentions \u201cwhether the decision ultimately made by the trial court, after the discretionary continuance, could be one acquitting a criminal defendant whose guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449-50, 710 S.E.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Starrs, </em>which came after <em>Taylor, </em>does not lead to or compel any different conclusion. In <em>Starrs, </em>the Supreme Court held that a trial court may defer a disposition even after accepting a defendant\u2019s guilty plea (if it does so before entering a written conviction order) and also may take additional evidence. 287 Va. at 10-13, 752 S.E.2d at 818-20. Significantly, however, the Supreme Court qualified this holding when it stated that the <em>\u201cpurpose </em>of hearing [additional] evidence is to determine whether an accused <em>is guilty or not </em>and the measure of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 752 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>at 819 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added). Even if a discretionary continuance is an option for the trial court, it may not \u201cpermanently refuse\u201d to enter a lawful judgment, <em>id. </em>at 13, 752 S.E.2d at 819\u2014and that judgment must properly reflect <em>only </em>\u201cwhether an accused is guilty or not and the measure of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11, 752 S.E.2d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Here, the request to take the case under advisement and defer disposition represented nothing more than a guilty defendant\u2019s attempt to escape (or delay) an inevitable conviction through judicial clemency.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, any authority of a trial court to permit the \u201c \u2018mere postponement\u2019 in the entry\u201d of a conviction order cannot serve \u201cas a pretext for granting a criminal defendant \u2018a pardon for his crime\u2019 \u201d because that would be an improper exercise of clemency by the judiciary that would definitely exceed the judiciary\u2019s authority under the separation of powers doctrine. <em>Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 450, 710 S.E.2d at 525 (quoting <em>Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. at 46, 37 S.Ct. at 76). The Supreme Court clearly explained in <em>Moreau, </em>276 Va. at 136, 661 S.E.2d at 846, that Virginia\u2019s constitutional separation of powers doctrine does not permit the judiciary to \u201cassume a power of clemency or pardon which is a unique function of executive power.\u201d Likewise, as the United States Supreme Court said in <em>Sorrells, </em>\u201cJudicial nullification of statutes, [which are] admittedly valid and applicable, has, happily, no place in our system\u201d of justice. 287 U.S. at 450, 53 S.Ct. at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Accordingly, we hold that a trial court\u2019s narrow authority to defer a disposition does not in any way diminish its greater duty to render a timely and lawful judgment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>faithfully applies the relevant facts and the controlling law. In short, a trial court cannot simply acquit a defendant through an act of judicial clemency (or judicial nullification), where the evidence proves the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and where no statutory authority exists to allow the trial court to dismiss the charge. In this case, as explained <em>supra, </em>there is simply no purpose for defense counsel\u2019s request to take the matter under <em>advisement </em>\u2014 other than to delay an unavoidable guilty verdict or to persuade the trial court to acquit appellant of the felony \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d offense under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B) purely as an act of judicial clemency. The trial court certainly did not abuse its discretion when it found no proper purpose for defense counsel\u2019s request and denied it on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Therefore, contrary to the claim in appellant\u2019s assignment of error, the trial court did not err by failing to take the case under advisement. The trial court instead correctly found that it would be inappropriate to do so. Given the correctness of the trial court\u2019s ruling, appellant clearly is not entitled to an order from this Court directing the trial court \u201cto allow [appellant] the opportunity to reinstate his license,\u201d which is the specific remedy appellant seeks in his brief to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The narrow authority to take a matter under advisement or defer a disposition is neither a gateway nor a loophole for acquitting or refusing to convict a defendant whose guilt has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant\u2019s guilt of the charged felony offense here was exceedingly \u201clikely\u201d (as defense counsel candidly acknowledged) even prior to trial; his counsel offered no defense or argument against the charge; and defense counsel failed to state any proper purpose for the request to take the matter under advisement \u2014 i.e., a purpose relevant to determining guilt (or innocence) and the degree of guilt. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied that request, and, accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s felony conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. Under settled principles of appellate review, we view \"the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u201d in the trial court. <em>Riner v.

Defense counsel did not argue at trial that appellant was actually unaware of the determination by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in May 1996 that appellant is a habitual offender and that he is ineligible to operate a motor vehicle. <em>See Claytor v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 644, 652-54, 751 S.E.2d 686, 689-90 (2013). Furthermore, aside from a \"blanket objection for the record\u201d that appellant has not pursued on appeal, defense counsel did not challenge the introduction of prior conviction orders establishing that appellant was convicted in June 2001 and September 2007 of driving after being determined a habitual offender under Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Defense counsel also did not contest the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that appellant drove a motor vehicle on April 24, 2012 \u2014 despite appellant's known habitual offender status and these prior convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">. Appellant\u2019s bench trial occurred after this Court\u2019s 2012 decision in <em>Starrs </em>but before the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s 2014 decision in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Specifically, the trial court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">[A]s I see from the <em>Starrs </em>case, the Court of Appeals confirms that when there has been a finding of guilt and/or a finding that the evidence is sufficient to find the defendant guilty, then the court does not have the inherent authority on its own to vacate that judgment unless there is some evidentiary basis for that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Defense counsel responded, \"I think all [this Court's decision in <em>Starrs </em>] is saying is that until the court makes a formal finding of guilt, that it can take it under advisement for whatever reasons it deems fit, and that is why I asked you not to find him formally guilty but to take it under advisement.\u201d The prosecutor then asserted, \"Judge, the <em>Starrs </em>case, basically [holds], after a finding of guilt, the court has no inherent authority to defer a finding.\u201d The prosecutor added, \"[the] Commonwealth's position, Your Honor, is that the court has no inherent authority to defer a finding of guilt on a habitual offender charge. There is no statutory authority for it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">. At most, the trial transcript perhaps reflects some preliminary confusion or skepticism by the trial court concerning the scope of a trial court\u2019s authority to continue a case for a future disposition. However, \"an appellate court 'reviews judgments, not statements' \u201d made by a lower court. <em>Family Redirection Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 765, 773, 739 S.E.2d 916, 920-21 (2013) (quoting <em>California v. Rooney, </em>483 U.S. 307, 311, 107 S.Ct. 2852, 2854, 97 L.Ed.2d 258 (1987)); <em>see also Meidan, Inc. v.

The conclusion of appellant\u2019s opening brief includes the following prayer for relief: \"The [trial] court\u2019s sentencing order should be vacated and the case remanded <em>to allow defendant the opportunity to reinstate his license prior to sentencing.\" </em>(Emphasis added). Significantly, appellant does not ask this Court merely to direct the trial court to <em>reconsider </em>defense counsel's request. According to the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hernandez, </em>that would be the appropriate remedy on remand if the trial court had simply found that it was without authority to <em>consider </em>the request. <em>See Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 226, 707 S.E.2d at 275 (directing a remand \"to the circuit court for such consideration of the defendant\u2019s motion for deferred disposition as the circuit court in its discretion may deem appropriate\u201d). Therefore, this appeal implicates the very merits of the trial court's ruling not to take the matter under advisement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">. The request to take the case under advisement was not made to call into question any of the Commonwealth's overwhelming evidence that appellant drove a motor vehicle with a revoked license on April 24, 2012 after having been determined to be a habitual offender (and after having been previously convicted twice for that offense). The request to take the case under advisement also did not relate to any point of law about that offense or raise any issue that would require additional briefing for the trial court's review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
