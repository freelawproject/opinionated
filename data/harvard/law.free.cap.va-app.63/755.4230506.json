ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The State Health Commissioner issued a certificate of public need (COPN) to Inova Health Care Services authorizing it to relocate a medical radiation therapy service from Inova Fairfax Hospital to Inova Fair Oaks Hospital, both situated in Fairfax County. A competitor, Reston Hospital Center, LLC, objected to the relocation during the administrative process and on appeal to the circuit court. The circuit court held that the Commissioner acted within her authority when she issued the COPN. We agree and affirm the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">A. <em>The Administrative Regulatory System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">A comprehensive regulatory system governs nearly every aspect of medical care facilities in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>ele 1.1, Chapter 4 of Title 32.1 requires a \u201ccertificate of public need\u201d for various types of projects conducted by medical care facilities. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1. \u201cNo person shall commence any project without first obtaining a certificate issued by the Commissioner. No certificate may be issued unless the Commissioner has determined that a public need for the project has been demonstrated.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(A). The statute directs the Board of Health to establish \u201cregional health planning agencies,\u201d which manage the \u201chealth planning regions\u201d in the Commonwealth and assist the Board in a number of ways, including by \u201creviewing applications for certificates of public need and making recommendations to the Department.\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1-122.05. The Board of Health must also prepare a \u201cState Medical Facilities Plan\u201d to guide planning and forecasting efforts. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">B. <em>The Dispute over the Location of a Single Linear Accelerator</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Several hospitals are located in Health Planning Region II (HPR II), which encompasses the same area as Planning District 8 (PD 8) and includes Fairfax County. Multiple hospitals in HPR II utilize radiation therapy machines, called linear accelerators, to provide cancer treatment services. Inova Fairfax has four linear accelerators, and Reston has two. Although Inova Fair Oaks provides extensive cancer treatment services, it does not have a linear accelerator.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In 2008, Inova applied for a COPN to add a linear accelerator to Inova Fair Oaks. The Commissioner denied the application for a number of reasons, including because there was no demonstrable need for a new linear accelerator in that area of service. The Commissioner had previously authorized the operation of thirteen linear accelerators in HPR II, and she determined that there was no need for one more.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">A few months later, Inova submitted a new application \u2014 the one at issue in this case \u2014 for a COPN authorizing a \u201cproposed project ... to move one of four existing linear accelerators from the campus of Inova Fairfax Hospital to the campus of Fair Oaks Hospital.\u201d App. at 1441. The project would involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>the decommissioning of one of Inova Fairfax\u2019s older linear accelerators, thereby reducing the number of such machines at Inova Fairfax from four to three, and the relocation of that service (with the installation of a new linear accelerator) to Inova Fair Oaks. With its proposed change, Inova pointed out, HPR II would still have thirteen linear accelerators.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">During the administrative process, Reston intervened as a \u201cgood cause\u201d party. <em>Id. </em>at 635. Reston asserted various reasons why the Commissioner should not issue the COPN to Inova. The Commissioner rejected Reston\u2019s objections and issued the COPN on August 26, 2009, designating it COPN No. VA-04223. Reston appealed to the circuit court under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 through -4033. The circuit court held that Reston did not have standing and dismissed the appeal. On appeal to our Court, we reversed and remanded the case to the circuit court for a decision on the merits. <em>See Reston Hosp. Ctr., LLC v. Remley, </em>59 Va.App. 96, 717 S.E.2d 417 (2011). On remand, the circuit court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s decision to issue the COPN to Inova. Reston again appealed to us. Over Inova\u2019s objection, the circuit court extended Reston\u2019s time to file its notice of appeal pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">While the case has been on appeal, the Commissioner issued another certificate, designated COPN No. VA-04386 (issued April 19, 2013). It authorized the \u201c[rjelocation and replacement of the existing linear accelerator located in the satellite facility at 8503 Arlington Boulevard (in Fairfax County) to Inova Fair Oaks Hospital (also in Fairfax County).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. A at 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The certificate added that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u201crelocation of the Arlington Boulevard linear accelerator will be in place of the linear accelerator authorized for relocation from Inova Fairfax Hospital under COPN No. VA-04223.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">After oral argument in this appeal, the Commissioner issued a \u201ccorrected certificate\u201d on June 13, 2013, because \u201c[t]he original certificate issued on April 19, 2013 did not reflect the project as specified in the letter of intent and requested in the application.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. B at 1. The certif\u00edcate, still designated as COPN No. VA-04386, \u201cidentifie[d] the correct project site\u201d as \u201cInova Fairfax Hospital Main Campus,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and no longer included the original certificate\u2019s language referencing \u201creplacement\u201d of the accelerator previously authorized to Inova Fair Oaks. Instead, the corrected certificate phrased the approved action as a \u201c[rjelocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the existing linear accelerator authorization\u201d from the satellite facility to Inova Fairfax. <em>Id. </em>at 2; <em>compare </em>Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. A (COPN No. VA-04386 (issued Apr. 19, 2013)) <em>with </em>Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. B (Corrected COPN No. VA-04386 (issued June 13, 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">While retaining appellate jurisdiction, we remanded the case to the circuit court to address whether COPN No. VA-04386 mooted any need for our review of the original COPN No. VA-04223 and whether the June 13, 2013 corrections to COPN No. VA-04386 were valid. In June 2014, the circuit court held that the case was not moot and that the corrections to COPN No. VA-04386 were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">II. Extension of Time to File Notice of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">We first address Inova\u2019s assignment of cross-error claiming that the circuit court erroneously extended the time for Resten to file its notice of appeal pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-428(C). Inova contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the extension. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Rule 5A:6(a) requires an appellant to file a notice of appeal within thirty days after the entry of the final order in the circuit court. The General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 8.01-428(C) to provide a narrow exception to this thirty-day deadline when an appellant is \u201cnot notified by any means of the entry of a final order,\u201d and the circuit court finds that the lack of notice does not result from appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to exercise due diligence.\u201d The statute vests the discretion to grant the party leave to appeal in the circuit court, not the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">An abuse of discretion occurs \u201conly \u2018when reasonable jurists could not differ\u2019 \u201d as to the proper decision. <em>Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 641, 666 S.E.2d 532, 537 (2008) (quoting <em>Robbins v. Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. 466, 482, 632 S.E.2d 615, 623 (2006)). This highly deferential standard of review \u201cnecessarily implies that, for some decisions, conscientious jurists could reach different conclusions based on exactly the same facts \u2014 yet still remain entirely reasonable.\u201d <em>Hamad v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>Hamad, </em>61 Va.App. 593, 607, 739 S.E.2d 232, 239 (2013). The circuit court \u201chas a range of choice, and its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 212-13, 738 S.E.2d 847, 861 (2013) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">We apply this \u201cbell-shaped curve of reasonability\u201d based on our \u201cvenerable belief that the judge closest to the contest is the judge best able to discern where the equities lie.\u201d <em>Hamad, </em>61 Va.App. at 607, 739 S.E.2d at 239. Suffice it to say, \u201cif nothing else,\u201d the abuse-of-discretion standard \u201cmeans that the trial judge\u2019s ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005); <em>see also Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385, 484 S.E.2d 898, 906 (1997) (noting that, when applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, appellate judges do \u201cnot substitute [their] judgment for that of the trial court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Given the unique circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the extension. It appears that all of the circuit court\u2019s orders during this protracted <em>litigation </em>\u2014 except the final order that triggered the thirty-day deadline for filing the notice of appeal \u2014 had been mailed by the clerk of court to counsel of record as a matter of course. In addition, it took over a month for the draft final order to be submitted to the court, a designated judge from another circuit presided over the case pursuant to Code \u00a7 32.1-102.9, and two different clerk\u2019s offices handled the record. Though we may not have been as forgiving as the circuit court, reasonable jurists could reach different conclusions on the question whether Reston exercised due diligence under the uncommon conditions of this case. We thus defer to the circuit court\u2019s decision to extend the deadline for filing the notice of appeal under Code \u00a7 8.01-428(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>III. Mootness on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Prior to deciding the merits of this appeal, we must also determine whether this case has become moot because of the issuance of COPN No. VA-04386 (issued April 19, 2013 and corrected on June 13, 2013). We conclude that the case continues to present a live, justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">\u201cA case becomes moot \u2018when the issues presented are no longer \u201clive\u201d or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingram v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 14, 21, 741 S.E.2d 62, 66 (2013) (quoting <em>Chafin v. Chafin, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1017, 1019, 185 L.Ed.2d 1 (2013)). \u201c \u2018No matter how vehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the lawsuit, the case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs\u2019 particular legal rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 741 S.E.2d at 66 (quoting <em>Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 721, 727, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013)); <em>see also Daily Press, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 447, 452, 739 S.E.2d 636, 639 (2013) (noting that \u201ca case is moot and must be dismissed when the controversy that existed between litigants has ceased to exist\u201d). Mootness on appeal can occur for a variety of reasons, including settlement agreements<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or other intervening events that overtake litigable controversies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>While it is true that a case is moot when \u201cour resolution of an issue could not possibly have any practical effect on the outcome of the matter,\u201d <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. City of Alexandria, </em>608 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir.2010), the burden of establishing that we lack jurisdiction rests on \u201cthe party who alleges that a controversy before us has become moot,\u201d <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1042 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 3477 n. 8, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983) (quoting <em>Cnty. of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 645, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 1390, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979)). \u201cThat is, we presume in those circumstances that we have jurisdiction until some party establishes that we do not for reasons of mootness,\u201d <em>id., </em>unless, of course, we <em>sua sponte </em>rebut that presumption entirely on our own, <em>de Haan v. de Haan, </em>54 Va.App. 428, 436, 680 S.E.2d 297, 301 (2009) (\u201cThis Court may raise the [jurisdictional] issue <em>sua sponte.\u201d </em>(quoting <em>Earley v. Landsidle, </em>257 Va. 365, 371, 514 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999))).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Inova claims that this appeal is moot. Inova argues that COPN No. VA-04386 (issued April 19, 2013 and corrected on June 13, 2013) eliminated any need for us to decide whether the Commissioner properly issued the original COPN No. VA-04223 (issued August 26, 2009). After all, Inova contends, Reston never intervened in the administrative process for the 2013 COPN. According to this argument, even if we were to invalidate the 2009 COPN, the 2013 COPN would independently validate Inova\u2019s plan to move the linear accelerator to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Inova Fair Oaks. The circuit court rejected this argument, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The 2013 COPN presupposes the validity of the 2009 COPN. When issuing the 2013 COPN, the Commissioner undoubtedly relied in part on the existence of the 2009 COPN, which authorized the establishment of radiation therapy services at Inova Fair Oaks and the corresponding relocation of a linear accelerator from Inova Fairfax to Inova Fair Oaks. That authorization created the need for the relocation of a linear accelerator from a satellite facility to Inova Fairfax. The clearest indication that the 2013 COPN added to rather than replaced the 2009 COPN appears in the 2013 COPN as issued on April 19, 2013, which noted that \u201cthe total authorized capital cost ... for the relocation and replacement of a linear accelerator is included in COPN No. VA-04223.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The correction issued in June 2013 further clarified that understanding by simply stating that there was \u201cno capital cost associated with the project\u201d authorized by the 2013 COPN. Appellant\u2019s Supp\u2019l Br. Ex. B. Essentially, the 2009 COPN authorized the establishment of radiation therapy services at Inova Fair Oaks by the transfer of one linear accelerator from Inova Fairfax to Inova Fair Oaks and also authorized the capital cost of that project. The 2013 COPN, presuming the authorization for radiation therapy services at Inova Fair Oaks under the 2009 COPN, merely effectuates that transfer in a slightly different manner by authorizing Inova Fairfax to maintain its three current linear accelerators on the main campus and instead decommission the unit at the satellite facility. Perhaps this explains why Inova \u2014 quite understandably \u2014 has not affirmatively relinquished the 2009 COPN on the assumption that it can rely exclusively on the 2013 COPN, which Inova nevertheless claims stands incontestably on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In short, if we were to invalidate the 2009 COPN, the 2013 COPN could be subject to continuing litigation because the underlying basis for the relocation authorized by the 2013 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>COPN would be in question. We thus have no confidence that dismissing this appeal as moot would end the seemingly interminable litigation of the disputed location of this single piece of medical equipment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For these reasons, we decline to dismiss this appeal as moot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>IV. Reston\u2019s Challenge to the 2009 COPN</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">We now turn to the primary dispute: whether the circuit court erred in holding that the Commissioner did not violate the law by issuing COPN No. VA-04223 on August 26, 2009. Before addressing that issue, we must frame the nature of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A. <em>The VAPA Standards of Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cUnder the VAPA, the circuit court reviews [an] agency\u2019s action in a manner equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 707, 601 S.E.2d 667, 676 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>270 Va. 423, 621 S.E.2d 78 (2005). \u201c \u2018In this sense, the General Assembly has provided that a circuit court acts as an appellate tribunal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laurels of Bon Air, LLC v. Med. Facilities of Am. LIV Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>51 Va.App. 583, 591, 659 S.E.2d 561, 565 (2008) (quoting <em>Gordon v. Allen, </em>24 Va.App. 272, 277, 482 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The circuit court \u201chas no authority under [the] VAPA to reweigh the facts in the agency\u2019s evidentiary record.\u201d <em>Family Redirection Inst., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Med. Assistance Servs., </em>61 Va.App. 765, 771, 739 S.E.2d 916, 920 (2013). The \u201cVAPA authorizes the court to \u2018reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact only if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 706, 601 S.E.2d at 675). \u201cNor can the court substitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Boone v.

Reston correctly points out that, for several years prior to the issuance of the 2009 COPN, PD 8 performed less than an average of 8,000 procedures per linear accelerator. For this reason alone, Reston concludes, the Commissioner was without authority to authorize the new linear accelerator service at Inova Fair Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The flaw underlying Reston\u2019s argument is the assumption that the phrase \u201cnew radiation therapy service,\u201d as used in 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-230-290(A)(l), includes the mere <em>relocation </em>of an existing service from one hospital to another hospital, which is owned and operated by the same company and serves patients within the same planning district. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>ordinary understanding of the word \u201cnew\u201d does not naturally lend itself to this interpretation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Though the linear accelerator service was new to Inova Fair Oaks, it was not new to Inova. Inova merely relocated the service from one hospital to another. Nor was the service new to the planning district. PD 8 had thirteen linear accelerators before the relocation and thirteen after. We thus reject Reston\u2019s reading of \u201cnew radiation therapy service,\u201d 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-230-290(A)(1), to include the unique circumstances presented in COPN No. VA-04223.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>The banter over the textual meaning of the words in a statute or regulation must always be framed by the manifest legislative will underlying the law. One of the principal purposes of the Medical Care Facilities Certificate of Public Need Law, originally enacted in 1973, was \u201cto assist in promoting the highest quality of health care at the lowest possible cost.\u201d 1973 Va. Acts ch. 419; <em>see also </em>12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-230-30 (listing the \u201cgeneral principles\u201d behind the COPN program and including \u201ccost effectiveness and quality of medical services in Virginia\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The COPN requirement was meant to limit access to the competitive, free market only to the extent that it might endanger those legislative goals. <em>See generally FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health Sys., </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1003, 1015-16, 185 L.Ed.2d 43 (2013) (interpreting a similar regulatory scheme \u201cin light of our national policy favoring competition, ... to reflect more modest aims\u201d than expansive \u201canticompetitive conduct,\u201d even though the scheme \u201cdoes limit competition in the market for hospital services in some respects\u201d). Interpreted in light of these policy goals, the phrase \u201cnew radiation therapy service,\u201d as used in 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-230-290(A)(l), does not include the relocation of an existing service from one hospital to another hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>tal, which is owned and operated by the same company and serves patients within the same planning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">2. <em>Alleged Departure from Prior Case Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Reston also argues that the Commissioner acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing the COPN to Inova under circumstances that, according to Reston, have never been found previously by the Commissioner to be acceptable. The nine examples Reston gives as precedent, however, all apparently involve requests for COPNs for truly <em>new </em>services, not the relocation of <em>existing </em>services \u2014 at least no one has suggested to us otherwise. Reston acknowledges that \u201c[t]he only possible explanation is the fact that Inova\u2019s project purportedly involves the relocation of an existing linear accelerator,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22, but Reston rejects that explanation as a \u201cdistinction without a difference,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Reston\u2019s argument fails because it presupposes too much. As we explained earlier, a sensible distinction exists between issuing a COPN for a new service that expands existing capacity and a mere relocation of an existing service that does not. <em>See supra </em>Part IV.B.l. In our view, 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-230-290(A)(l) incorporates that distinction. This point more than answers Reston\u2019s inconsistency challenge because the 2009 COPN awarded to Inova cannot be compared fairly to prior COPNs involving wholly new services that increased the inventory of medical services or machines in the relevant planning district. Reston, therefore, has not shown that the Commissioner made a \u201c \u2018sudden and unexplained change\u2019 \u201d in administrative policy or \u201cfail[ed] to take into account \u2018legitimate reliance on prior interpretation.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19 (quoting <em>Boyd v. People, Inc., </em>43 Va.App. 82, 91, 596 S.E.2d 100, 105 (2004) (Kelsey, J., concurring)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>3. <em>Arbitrary &amp; Capricious Decisionmaking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Reston also contends that the Commissioner\u2019s decision to issue the 2009 COPN should be judicially vacated because physicians at Inova Fair Oaks who previously have treated cancer patients have had to refer them, out of necessity, to other hospitals like Reston. If Inova Fair Oaks gets a linear accelerator, Reston worries that patients at Inova Fair Oaks may not need to travel to another hospital for radiation therapy and that, to a certain extent, this would reduce the revenues that Reston receives for the use by these patients of its linear accelerator. Unmoved by this argument, the Commissioner concluded that Reston would likely be able \u201cto weather any competitive stresses that may stem from approval of the project proposed by Inova.\u201d App. at 612.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The question we must answer is not whether we agree or disagree with the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion on this issue, but whether she was faithful to her statutory duty to \u201cconsider\u201d the enumerated statutory criteria for the issuance of a COPN. Code \u00a7 32.1-102.3(B). One of those factors involves \u201cthe utilization and efficiency of existing services or facilities,\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1 \u2014 102.3(B)(5), while another emphasizes \u201c[t]he extent to which the proposed service or facility fosters institutional competition,\u201d Code \u00a7 32.1 \u2014 102.3(B)(4).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ties offer a battery of conflicting statistics in support of their differing views on these points. We see no need, however, to pick apart the data matrices in the administrative record to answer this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">As we have often said, \u201cwhen the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which \u2018the agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly,\u2019 we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 and thus a \u2018clear abuse of delegated discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (quoting <em>Vasaio v. Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>42 Va.App. 190, 196-97, 590 S.E.2d 596, 599 (2004)). \u201cThis standard recognizes the larger premise that, before any legal question can be answered, an <em>a priori </em>question must first be asked \u2014 who has the authority to decide. It is the one question that precedes all others.\u201d <em>Boone, </em>52 Va.App. at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The Commissioner conscientiously considered the effect Inova\u2019s relocated service would likely have on Reston\u2019s market share. And what we have said in analogous circumstances can be said here: \u201cWhile it appears the subject was not given dispositive weight, nothing in the statute requires that any specific factor be given any measurable weight, only that it be <em>considered </em>by the [agency] during the decisionmaking process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 660 S.E.2d at 710. Whatever \u201cweight that should be properly given to any specific factor\u201d is a discretionary decision for the agency, \u201cnot the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 660 S.E.2d at 710. It is enough to conclude, as we do, that nothing in the administrative record, taken as a whole, persuades us that \u201ca reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 660 S.E.2d at 708 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In sum, we find no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s decision to extend Reston\u2019s time to file its notice of appeal. Nor do we believe the case has been rendered moot by the issuance of COPN No. VA-04386 (issued April 19, 2013 and corrected on June 13, 2013). On the merits, we hold that the Commissioner lawfully issued COPN No. VA-04223 and that the circuit court correctly rejected Reston\u2019s challenge to the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-11\">. An application for a COPN must be reviewed by the local health planning agency and the Department of Health\u2019s Division of Certificate of Public Need (DCOPN). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 32.1-102.6; 12 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5-220-230. Each group submits a separate report and recommendation to the Commissioner. Upon a showing of good cause, a non-applicant party may become a party to the application proceedings. An adjudication officer for the Commissioner then holds an Informal Fact Finding Conference, during which he receives evidence and hears the parties\u2019 arguments. The adjudication officer provides a recommendation to the Commissioner, who makes the final agency decision on the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">. Although no party has raised this issue before this Court, it appears that the application for the 2013 COPN makes inconsistent statements regarding the number of linear accelerators present at Inova Fairfax. At one point, the application notes that \u201cInova Fairfax Hospital is currently approved for and operates four (4) linear accelerators.\u201d R. at 988 (Appellee Inova's Reply Br. in Supp. of Mootness on remand to the circuit court, Ex. A). This is consistent with the facts presented in the administrative record for the 2009 COPN, which referenced the four linear accelerators at Inova Fairfax and never mentioned the Arlington Boulevard satellite facility. However, the next line of the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>for the 2013 COPN distinguishes between the three linear accelerators \"located on the main hospital campus [of Inova Fairfax]\u201d and the one \u201clocated at a satellite campus location [on Arlington Boulevard].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, in the next paragraph, the application references the 2009 COPN and states that it \"would require Inova Fairfax Hospital to take one (1) of its three (3) units out of service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review of the administrative record for the 2009 COPN reveals only broad references to the four units at Inova Fairfax and does not mention whether the unit that is being relocated to Inova Fair Oaks must come from the main campus or the satellite facility. Nevertheless, for reasons that are not clear from the record, Inova appeared to interpret the 2009 COPN as authorizing the relocation of a unit from the main campus of Inova Fairfax rather than the satellite facility. In response to that perceived result, Inova applied for an additional COPN to allow the main campus of Inova Fairfax to \u201ccontinue to utilize the linear accelerator currently in place,\u201d and instead decommission and relocate the satellite facility's radiation therapy service to Inova Fair Oaks. <em>Id. </em>In any event, it is not clear why Inova distinguished between the main campus of Inova Fairfax and the satellite facility in their request for the 2013 COPN but not for the 2009 COPN.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">.

Although Inova argues that \"[t]he plain language of the 'corrected' June 13, 2013 COPN reflects the Commissioner\u2019s intent to effectively revoke the original April 19, 2013 COPN,\u201d Inova offers no substantive analysis to support its argument. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5. On the contrary, both the Commissioner and Reston contend that the original COPN No. VA-04386 issued on April 19, 2013, contained factual errors and did not accurately reflect Inova\u2019s letter of intent to apply for the COPN or the application filed in 2012. <em>See </em>Appellee Remley\u2019s Supp'l Br. at 2; Appellant\u2019s Supp'l Br. at 2-3. Inova\u2019s Letter of Intent, submitted in 2012, clearly stated that the requested COPN would be \"to transfer Radiation Therapy services (1 linear accelerator) from 8503 Arlington Boulevard, Fairfax, Virginia, to the Inova Fairfax Hospital Main Campus.\u201d R. at 937 (Appellee Remley\u2019s Br. in Response to Inova\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mootness on remand to the circuit court, Ex. 5). The application itself repeatedly characterized \"the proposed project\u201d as \"relocating] COPN authorization for an existing linear accelerator from an Inova Fairfax Hospital satellite location to the Inova Fairfax Hospital main campus.\u201d R. at 1001 (Appellee Inova's Reply Br. in Supp. of Mootness on remand to the circuit court, Ex. A); <em>see also id. </em>at 998-99. Thus, there was no indication in Inova's application for the 2013 COPN that it wished to invalidate the 2009 COPN and replace it entirely with the authorizations provided by the 2013 COPN. While the 2013 COPN effectively results in the transfer of the satellite facility\u2019s linear accelerator to Inova Fair Oaks (by decommissioning the old unit at the satellite facility and purchasing a new unit for Inova Fair Oaks), the letter of intent, the application, and the DCOPN staff report all reflect that the method of accomplishing that goal is by transferring an authorized service from the satellite facility to the main campus at Inova Fairfax. Regardless, because we find that this case is not moot under either the original or the corrected COPN No. VA-04386, we see no need to resolve the question of the validity of the corrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b817-5\">. If the case were truly moot, as Inova contends, one possible and perhaps advisable remedy would be to vacate the circuit court decision upholding COPN No. VA-04223 because Inova\u2019s argument that COPN No. VA-04386 independently validates the relocation approved by COPN No. VA-04223, if true, would render any holding on COPN No. VA-04223 an advisory opinion. <em>See U.S. Bancorp Mortg.

One of Reston's assignments of error challenges the circuit court's understanding of its standard of review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Reston was prudent to frame the assignment of error this way. <em>Compare Davis v.

Even so, it is unnecessary from any practical point of view. Our <em>de novo </em>review of the circuit court's decision under the VAPA is conceptually analogous to the circuit court\u2019s review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The circuit court conducted no factfinding to which we must defer. Nor were there any discretionary calls made during the course of the circuit court\u2019s proceedings.
