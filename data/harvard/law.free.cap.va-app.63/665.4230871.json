On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion objecting to venue in Chesterfield County. He argues that venue was appropriate in the City of Richmond under Code \u00a7 19.2-247,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the evidence did not establish the location of the offenses and the victim\u2019s body was found in the City of Richmond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding venue appropriate in Chesterfield County, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">On the morning of October 18, 2011, Richmond police officers discovered the body of a man who had been shot and killed. The victim\u2019s body was found in the City of Richmond but only 160 feet from the Chesterfield County border. The murder investigation was later transferred to the Chesterfield County Police Department, and appellant was indicted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Chesterfield County for murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth was unable to present evidence establishing the location of the murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant therefore raised a motion objecting to venue in Chesterfield County. Citing Code \u00a7 19.2-247, which establishes venue for homicide prosecutions in the county or city where \u201cthe body of the victim [was] found\u201d when it is otherwise \u201cunknown where such crime was committed,\u201d appellant argued that Chesterfield County was not the proper venue for trial. He asserted that Code \u00a7 19.2-247 mandated venue in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">While acknowledging that the victim\u2019s body was found in Richmond, the Commonwealth argued that venue was appropriate in Chesterfield County because Code \u00a7 19.2-250(B) extends Chesterfield County\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction ... in criminal cases involving offenses against the Commonwealth ... one mile beyond the limits of such county into the City of Richmond.\u201d Relying on the fact that the victim\u2019s body was found within Chesterfield County\u2019s extended jurisdiction, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court should construe Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-247 and 19.2-250(B) interdependently and determine that appellant was amenable to prosecution in Chesterfield County.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion objecting to venue. Appellant was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to seventeen years\u2019 imprisonment for the charge of second-degree murder and three years\u2019 imprisonment for the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-247 mandates venue in Richmond, as that is where the victim\u2019s body was located. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-247 provides a specialized venue rule for homicide prosecutions where \u201cit [is] unknown where such crime was committed.\u201d In those circumstances, appellant states, Code \u00a7 19.2-247 establishes venue in the city or county where the body was found. Because the evidence at trial did not prove where the victim was murdered, appellant contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-247 controls and venue was appropriate where the victim\u2019s body was located. This conclusion, appellant asserts, is dictated by the \u201cplain reading of the statute[],\u201d which \u201climitfs] prosecution to Richmond alone, and not Chesterfield [County].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Commonwealth, on the other hand, asks this Court to read Code \u00a7 19.2-247 \u201cin pari materia\u201d with Code \u00a7 19.2-250(B) and find venue appropriate in Chesterfield County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 19.2-250(B) states that in criminal cases \u201cthe jurisdiction of the authorities of Chesterfield County ... shall extend one mile beyond the limits of such county into the City of Richmond.\u201d Thus, notwithstanding that the victim\u2019s body was found within the City of Richmond, the Commonwealth contends that prosecution was appropriate in Chesterfield County because the victim\u2019s body was within the one-mile border addressed in Code \u00a7 19.2-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We review questions of statutory construction <em>de novo. See Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008) (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007)). Our review is guided by oft-stated rules of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018When statutory construction is required, we construe a statute to promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Neil v. O\u2019Neil, </em>60 Va.App. 156, 157-58, 724 S.E.2d 247, 248 (2012) (quoting <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533-34 (1994)). We determine the purpose of a statute by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>taking and comparing together \u201c \u2018the whole and every part of the statute ..., giving to every word and every part of the statute, if possible, its due effect and meaning[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 161, 187, 616 S.E.2d 67, 80 (2005) (quoting <em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>128 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918)), <em>rev\u2019d, on other grounds, </em>47 Va.App. 687, 626 S.E.2d 912 (2006) (en banc). And, when multiple \u201cstatutes concern\u00ed ] the same subject,\u201d we construe them together \u201cto avoid conflict between them and to permit each of them to have full operation according to their legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Eastlack v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 120, 125-26, 710 S.E.2d 723, 726 (2011) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Guided by these principles of statutory construction, we consider whether appellant\u2019s offense was amenable to prosecution in Chesterfield County. As a general rule, a crime must be tried where it occurred. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-244.Code \u00a7 19.2-247, however, provides an exception for homicide prosecutions to which this general rule is inapposite. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-247 (establishing venue for homicides where it is unknown where the crime occurred). But even so, Code \u00a7 19.2-247 underscores the general preference that crimes be tried where they were committed by treating homicides that occur \u201cunder circumstances which make it unknown where such crime was committed,\u201d <em>as if they were committed </em>in the city or county in which the victim\u2019s body was located. Code \u00a7 19.2-247 thereby creates an identifiable venue in which to try homicides committed \u201cunder circumstances\u201d similar to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-250(B) also is clear. It is a specific grant of territorial jurisdiction to the courts of Chesterfield County. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 351, 359, 693 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2010) (defining territorial jurisdiction as \u201c \u2018authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Ghameshlouy v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 379, 388-89, 689 S.E.2d 698, 703 (2010))). The statute extends the geographic boundary of Chesterfield County to one mile within the corporate limits of the City of Richmond and confers on the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>of Chesterfield County the power to enforce the law of the area in question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Breitbach v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 604, 607-08, 546 S.E.2d 764, 766 (2001) (stating that the purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-250(A) is to \u201cconfer on the ... courts ... power to enforce the ... law of the area involved\u201d). In effect, the statute grants Chesterfield County \u201cconcurrent criminal jurisdiction\u201d within the one-mile boundary. <em>See Garza v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 559, 566, 323 S.E.2d 127, 131 (1984) (interpreting Code \u00a7 17.1-126.2, which grants Roanoke County territorial jurisdiction \u2014 i.e., venue \u2014 over criminal offenses committed on property or buildings within the City of Salem that are owned or operated by Roanoke County, as conferring concurrent criminal jurisdiction on Roanoke County). Thus, offenses committed within the statutory boundary may be prosecuted within Chesterfield County. <em>See Breitbach, </em>35 Va.App. at 607-08, 546 S.E.2d at 766 (applying Code \u00a7 19.2-250(A) and stating that \u201c[t]he relevant question is whether the offense occurred within the ... [defined] jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Appellant concedes this general interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-250(A) but maintains that it does not follow that Ches<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>terfield County has authority to prosecute homicides that were not proven to have occurred in the statutory boundary simply because the victim\u2019s body was located there. Appellant asserts that Code \u00a7 19.2-250 refers only to crimes \u201ccommitted in the City of Richmond, but within [one] mile of the Chesterfield [County] Border,\u201d but not crimes committed \u201cat an unknown location.\u201d Appellant misconstrues Code \u00a7 19.2-247. Code \u00a7 19.2-247 does not simply establish venue in the city or county in which the body of the victim was located; <em>it treats the homicide as if it was committed there. </em>This consideration is critical to the resolution of the matter presented. It highlights where Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-247 and 19.2-250(B) converge and explains why the statutes must be read together. Because the parties concede that the victim\u2019s body was located in \u201cthe City of Richmond, but within [one] mile of the Chesterfield [County] Border,\u201d we must treat the homicide as if it occurred there. That conclusion renders this case straightforward. If Code \u00a7 19.2-250 permits prosecution in Chesterfield County for offenses committed in the City of Richmond but within the one-mile border (which appellant concedes), then it must also permit prosecution in Chesterfield County for those offenses that Code \u00a7 19.2-247 treats <em>as if they were committed </em>within the same area.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In either case, the relevant code sections make the offense amenable to prosecution in Chesterfield County. Thus, when we construe together Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-247 and 19.2-250(B), it is plain that Chesterfield County was the appropriate venue in which to prosecute appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Because we find that Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-247 and 19.2-250 when read together permit prosecution of appellant in Chesterfield County, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-247 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">Where evidence exists that a homicide has been committed either within or without this Commonwealth, under circumstances which make it unknown where such crime was committed, the offense shall be amenable to prosecution in the courts of the county or city where the body of the victim may be found ... as if the offense has been committed in such county or city.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">. For the first time on appeal, appellant contends that venue for the charge of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony was improper in Chesterfield County because Code \u00a7 19.2-247 is \"specific to the crime of homicide and does not, by its language, embrace other \u2022 attendant crimes.\u201d This argument was not raised before the trial court. Indeed, appellant argued just the opposite at trial, asserting that Code \u00a7 19.2-247 controlled his prosecution and mandated venue in the City of Richmond. <em>See Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 411-12, 517 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1999) (making one specific argument on an issue does not preserve a separate legal point on the same issue for review). Because this argument was not presented to the trial court, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18 (stating that \"[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling\u201d). Accordingly, we consider only appellant's claim that Code \u00a7 19.247 mandated venue in Richmond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\">. The Commonwealth concedes this point on brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. <em>In pari materia </em>\"is a canon of construction that statutes that [concern the same subject] may be construed together, so that inconsistencies in one statute may be resolved by looking at another statute on the same subject.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>911 (10th ed.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">. Appellant argues that the term jurisdiction, as it is used in Code \u00a7 19.2-250, refers to the circuit court's \u201cauthority ... to adjudicate concerning the subject matter of a given case,\u201d thus rendering Code \u00a7 19.2-250 a statute conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">We disagree. The jurisdiction referenced in Code \u00a7 19.2-250 is a grant of territorial jurisdiction. <em>See Smith, </em>56 Va.App. at 359, 693 S.E.2d at 769 (defining territorial jurisdiction as \"authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area\u201d). It is distinct from the subject matter jurisdiction conferred on circuit courts under Code \u00a7 17.1-513. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 17.1-513 (stating that the circuit courts shall have \u201coriginal jurisdiction of all indictments for felonies and of presentments, informations and indictments for misdemeanors\u201d). As the Supreme Court of Virginia has explained in response to a similar argument, \"if Code [\u00a7 19.2-250] dealt with subject matter jurisdiction, such a construction would render the Code \u00a7 17.1-513 grant of 'original jurisdiction of all ... felonies\u2019 to all circuit courts to be meaningless and superfluous. Such a construction is to be avoided.\u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 230, 661 S.E.2d 415, 427 (2008). Accordingly, we decline appellant\u2019s invitation to read Code \u00a7 19.2-250 as conferring subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\">. Appellant dismisses such reasoning, contending that construing together Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-247 and 19.2-250 enlarges the authority of Chesterfield County to prosecute criminal cases under Code \u00a7 19.2-250, in violation of the \"cardinal principle of law\u201d that penal statutes are to be strictly construed. Code \u00a7 19.2-250, however, is not penal in nature. <em>See Kitze v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 213, 216, 475 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1996) (\" \u2018If [a] statute imposes a disability for the purpose of punishment \u2014 that is, to reprimand the wrongdoer, to deter others, etc., it has been considered penal.' \u201d (quoting <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 96, 78 S.Ct. 590, 595-96, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (plurality opinion))). Rather, the statute simply prescribes Chesterfield County's jurisdiction involving criminal cases as extending one mile into the City of Richmond from its border with Chesterfield County. Thus, this \"cardinal principle of law\u201d is not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
