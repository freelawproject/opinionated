ALSTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On appeal from his convictions of two counts of credit card fraud, Michael Ryan Bruton (appellant) contends that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for a mistrial. Appellant asserts that a mistrial was warranted because the trial court improperly informed the jury, during the sentencing phase, that appellant would receive a credit against his sentence for the time he had been incarcerated while awaiting trial. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Appellant was tried by a jury on indictments charging one count of credit card theft, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-192(l)(a), two counts of credit card fraud, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-195(l)(a), and two counts of credit card forgery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-193. During a two-day bifurcated trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence during the guilt-determination phase proved beyond a reasonable doubt that on May 8, 2011, appellant used a credit card number belonging to the victim at two retail stores to purchase goods valued at approximately $1,000. The victim did not know appellant and did not authorize appellant to use her credit card information. Upon appellant\u2019s own testimony, the jury was also informed that appellant was arrested on July 13, 2011, and that he remained incarcerated while awaiting his trial on July 11-12, 2012. Based on the evidence presented, the jury convicted appellant of both counts of credit card fraud and acquitted appellant of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">After the jury returned its verdict, the sentencing phase of the trial commenced. The trial court instructed the jury, after which the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">[Juror]: He\u2019s already been in jail for a year. Does this add on to what he\u2019s already done, or is this \u2014 or is this from here on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-10\">[Trial Court]: He gets credit for any time he\u2019s been in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>[Juror]: So then if we said a year, then that means he could walk out tomorrow?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Counsel for appellant objected. Without objection, the trial court held an off-the-record sidebar-conference with counsel and then further admonished the jury to \u201c[t]ake it at what I said\u201d and \u201cbase everything on the instructions that you have.\u201d Thereafter, appellant\u2019s attorney made a motion for a mistrial, arguing that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the question of appellant receiving credit for time served. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury subsequently fixed appellant\u2019s sentence at two years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the two convictions of credit card fraud. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Relying on the statement in <em>Coward v. Commonwealth, </em>164 Va. 639, 646, 178 S.E. 797, 800 (1935), that a jury should \u201cimpose such sentence as seems just\u201d and not concern itself with what may afterwards happen, appellant contends that the trial court erred by informing the jury that appellant would receive a credit for the time he was incarcerated while awaiting trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The <em>Coward </em>rule, though longstanding, is not without exception. Indeed, in <em>Fishback v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 104, 532 S.E.2d 629 (2000), the Supreme Court reconsidered the policy underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule in light of statutory enactments that restricted the executive branch\u2019s discretion to modify the sentences imposed on defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The <em>Fishback </em>Court began its reconsideration with the acknowledgement that \u201c \u2018truth in sentencing\u2019 is a goal to be desired in the judicial process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 532 S.E.2d at 632. To that end, the Court noted that \u201c[a] jury should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>required to perform [the] critical and difficult responsibility\u201d of fixing a defendant\u2019s specific term of confinement \u201cwithout the benefit of all significant and appropriate information that would avoid the necessity that it speculate or act upon misconceptions concerning the effect of its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 532 S.E.2d at 633. With those principles in mind, the Court addressed whether a defendant convicted of a non-capital-offense felony was entitled to a jury instruction stating that parole had been abolished in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 532 S.E.2d at 633. The Court held that such an instruction was appropriate, particularly in view of the enactment of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, which abolished parole for felony offenses committed on or after January 1, 1995. <em>Id. </em>According to the Court, because Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1 applied to the offenses of which the defendant was found guilty, there remained no room for the jury to speculate \u201cas to what might occur\u201d during the administration of the defendant\u2019s sentence, at least concerning the issue of parole. <em>Id. </em>Critical to the Court\u2019s determination in <em>Fishback </em>was that with the enactment of Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, the executive branch no longer possessed the discretion to grant or deny parole; accordingly, adherence to the <em>Coward </em>rule was no longer necessary. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the Court concluded that, \u201cwhere applicable[,] juries should also be instructed on the possibility of geriatric release pursuant to [Code \u00a7 53.1\u2014 40.01],\u201d as it was in the nature of a parole statute. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 532 S.E.2d at 634. Like Code \u00a7 53.1-165.1, the geriatric release statute was clear, and as to those to whom it applied, not subject to speculation. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 532 S.E.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">However, the Court also addressed earned sentencing credits that a prisoner may obtain under Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2\u2014 202.4, which were earned based on the future conduct of the prisoner and \u201cthe subjective assessment of that conduct\u201d by the executive branch. <em>Id. </em>Contrasting Code \u00a7\u00a7 53.1-202.2\u2014 202.4 with the statutory enactments abolishing parole and providing for geriatric release, the Court \u201cobserved that a jury would be required to speculate in order to consider as part of its sentencing determination the possibility that a defendant could earn such future credits.\u201d <em>Booker v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>276 Va. 37, 42, 661 S.E.2d 461, 463 (2008) (citing <em>Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 115, 532 S.E.2d at 634). Because \u201c[t]he avoidance of such speculation underlies the <em>Coward </em>rule,\u201d the Court held that juries are not to be instructed about earned sentencing credits. <em>Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 115, 532 S.E.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The Court distilled the separate <em>Fishback </em>holdings in <em>Booker:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">These separate holdings in <em>Fishback </em>illustrate an important distinction between instructions that properly further the goal of \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d by removing the possibility that a jury will act upon misconceptions, and those instructions that have the improper effect of inviting the jury to speculate concerning the likelihood of future actions that may ultimately affect the length of a defendant\u2019s incarceration. <em>See Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 172, 207-08, 563 S.E.2d 695, 718 (2002). A jury instruction regarding a defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole is proper, because it serves to eliminate a common misconception that a defendant may only serve a small portion of a jury\u2019s sentence. <em>See Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 113, 532 S.E.2d at 633. In contrast, a jury instruction that a defendant may be eligible for earned sentencing credits once incarcerated is improper, because the jury cannot employ this information in its sentencing determination without resorting to speculation about the defendant\u2019s future behavior while incarcerated. <em>See Bell, </em>264 Va. at 206-07, 563 S.E.2d at 718; <em>Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 116, 532 S.E.2d at 634.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Booker, </em>276 Va. at 42, 661 S.E.2d at 463-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Having considered these principles and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find the trial court\u2019s instructions in this case akin to those in <em>Fishback </em>that \u201cremov[ed] the possibility that [the] jury w[ould] act upon misconceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 661 S.E.2d at 464. Appellant, without invitation from the Commonwealth, interjected into this case the issue of his incarceration while awaiting trial. We recognize that such information ordinarily is not presented to the jury. However, during his own defense, appellant testified that he was arrested and incarcer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ated on July 13, 2011, and that he remained incarcerated while awaiting his trial on July 11, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">While deliberating during the sentencing stage, the jury expressed confusion about what effect, if any, appellant\u2019s incarceration while awaiting trial would have on his sentence. The trial court responded, correctly in our view, that appellant would receive a credit for time he had been held in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">As was the case in <em>Fishback, </em>the statutory provision at issue here is clear. Code \u00a7 53.1-187 states, in relevant part, \u201c[a]ny person who is sentenced to a term of confinement in a correctional facility <em>shall </em>have deducted from any such term all time actually spent by the person ... in a state or local correctional facility awaiting trial.... \u201d This statutory provision applies to appellant as a \u201cperson who is sentenced to a term of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in view of appellant\u2019s own testimony regarding his arrest and incarceration prior to trial, the duration of appellant\u2019s pre-trial incarceration (i.e., the basis for his credit) is easily discernible. <em>Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 115, 532 S.E.2d at 634 (noting that the appellant\u2019s \u201celigibility for geriatric release [wa]s essentially a mathematical calculation\u201d). Thus, appellant\u2019s right to receive a credit for the time he served while awaiting trial is not speculative. Nor is it discretionary. <em>See Durkin v. Davis, </em>538 F.2d 1037, 1039-40 (4th Cir.1976) (\u201cThe right of credit for jail time awaiting trial on a bailable offense and pending appeal is not a matter of legislative grace but is a right constitutionally mandated, available to state prisoners as well as federal prisoners.\u201d); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-187 (stating that any defendant \u201csentenced to confinement ... in whose case the final order entered by the court in which he was convicted fails to provide for the credit authorized by this section, shall nevertheless receive credit for the time so spent in a state correctional facility\u201d). As was the case in <em>Fishback, </em>the trial court\u2019s instructions here did not implicate the policy considerations underlying the <em>Coward </em>rule. Accordingly, we only consider whether the jury in this case was in need of more particularized instruction on incarceration credits for time served. <em>See Fishback, </em>260 Va. at 117, 532 S.E.2d at 635 (\u201c \u2018[I]t belongs to the [trial] court to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the jury as to the law, whenever they require instruction, or either of the parties request it to be given.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Thornton v. Commonwealth, </em>65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 657, 662 (1874))).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We entrust juries with the significant task of \u201cdetermining] [the] specific term of confinement\u201d that is appropriate \u201cunder all of the circumstances revealed by the evidence in [a given] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 532 S.E.2d at 633. In recognition of this \u201ccritical and difficult responsibility,\u201d a jury is to be given \u201cthe benefit of all significant and appropriate information that would avoid the necessity that it speculate or act upon misconceptions concerning the effect of its decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury regarding appellant\u2019s right to a non-speculative statutory credit for time served awaiting trial complied with this imperative. If the trial court had responded as appellant suggests it should have \u2014 by instructing the jury only to impose such sentence as it deemed appropriate and not to consider what may occur afterward \u2014 the jury would have been without significant and appropriate information necessary to prevent potential misconceptions concerning the effect of its decision. The trial court\u2019s instruction resolved any misconception without creating any attendant risk of speculation. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">For these reasons, we find that the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that appellant would receive a credit for the time he was incarcerated while awaiting trial. Appellant\u2019s convictions are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\">. Because we find no error in the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury, we do not address appellant\u2019s request for a mistrial. Rather, we simply note that the remedy for an error occurring during the penalty phase of a bifurcated trial is typically to remand for a new sentencing event. <em>Hills v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 807, 811, 553 S.E.2d 722, 724 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
