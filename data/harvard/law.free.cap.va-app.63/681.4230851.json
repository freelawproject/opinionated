Oley (\u201cOley,\u201d \u201cfather,\u201d or \u201cplaintiff\u2019) appeals a child support order entered by the Goochland County Circuit Court (the \u201ccircuit court\u201d) on August 27, 2013 addressing Lisa S. Branch\u2019s (\u201cBranch,\u201d \u201cmother,\u201d or \u201cdefendant\u201d) monthly child support obligations. He asserts seven assignments of error in support of his appeal. His first, second, and third assignments of error all allege that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in determining that Branch\u2019s personal injury settlement annuity, Pell Grant, and \u201cfree house\u201d did not constitute income for the purpose of calculating child support. Oley\u2019s fourth assignment of error is that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in refusing to grant him credit for childcare expenses. His fifth and sixth assignments of error are that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to award him child support for the children\u2019s private school tuition and in declining to award him child support arrearages. Finally, in his seventh assignment of error, Oley asserts that he was denied due process because he did not receive a fan-hearing in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">Each of Oley\u2019s arguments are addressed in turn below. For the reasons that follow, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Pursuant to Oley\u2019s and Branch\u2019s custody agreement, Oley is the custodial parent of their three minor children \u2014 ages nine, eleven, and fourteen. Oley and Branch have a fourth child who turned eighteen several months before the circuit court\u2019s August 27, 2013 child support order that is the focus of this dispute. The issues before this Court relate solely to the circuit court\u2019s decisions regarding Branch\u2019s child support obligations, and therefore the facts below are relevant only to those disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>A. The Parties\u2019 Gross Monthly Incomes and Child Support Obligations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Branch was unemployed and enrolled in school to become a dental assistant at the time of the child support hearing. The circuit court found that the evidence allowed it to impute income to Branch based on her most recent employment. It concluded that Branch was \u201ccapable of earning at least the rate of $8.50 an hour based on her [former] employment at Chick-fil-A,\u201d \u2014 resulting in a monthly income of $1,462. Consequently, the circuit court fixed Branch\u2019s gross monthly income at $1,462.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Oley argued that Branch had other sources of \u201cincome\u201d that the circuit court was required to consider when calculating her gross income pursuant to the statutory guidelines. Branch receives annuity payments stemming from a personal injury settlement from a 1987 car accident she was in when she was sixteen years old. She was awarded lifetime monthly payments of $1,000 as well as four $100,000 lump sum payments that were made in 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. The circuit court found that Branch\u2019s personal injury settlement annuity was excluded from being considered part of her gross income. Relying on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Whitaker v. Colbert, </em>18 Va.App. 202, 442 S.E.2d 429 (1994), the circuit court reasoned that because the settlement itself was not apportioned as to loss of income or lost wages, an annuity stemming from that settlement was not intended to be included in the statutory definition of gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Branch also received a $5,500 Federal Pell Grant (\u201cPell Grant\u201d) to go back to school. Oley argued that the circuit court should include her Pell Grant as well as $1,200 in \u201cfree housing\u201d \u2014 the cost of the rent she paid before moving in with her mother \u2014 because it is a \u201cgift\u201d she receives by living with her mother free-of-charge. Without stating any reasons for doing so, the circuit court did not include either item in its computation of Branch\u2019s gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">With respect to Oley\u2019s monthly income, Oley owns a startup Internet business that he runs from his home. Prior to that, he owned a roofing and construction company that he \u201cshuttered\u201d in 2009 due to changes in the economic climate. The circuit court noted that Oley\u2019s bank account appeared to have large sums of money and he had recently purchased a $60,000 recreational vehicle using sums from those accounts. Oley attributed the money in his accounts to his past earnings and the proceeds from the sale of his home. The circuit court noted that it found Oley\u2019s \u201ctestimony regarding his income to be very suspicious.\u201d However, despite its reservations, the circuit court concluded that \u201c[i]t appears that the only evidence that we really have is that [Oley] made $500, essentially, over the first four months of this year.\u201d The circuit court fixed Oley\u2019s gross monthly income at $125.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The circuit court concluded that pursuant to the statutory schedule the presumptive support Branch should pay Oley each month for their three minor children was $1,711.20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the circuit court found that a deviation from the guidelines was warranted because \u201capplying the guidelines amounts would work at a substantial inequity in this case.\u201d Because Branch was only capable of earning $1,462 per month, the guideline amount of $1,711.20 would require \u201cher to pay something that she doesn\u2019t have.\u201d In considering a deviation from the guidelines, the circuit court additionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>noted that \u201cthe evidence establishes that the father appears to have plenty of money to meet the needs of his children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Based on its finding that a deviation from the guidelines was appropriate, the circuit court ordered Branch to pay Oley $453.75 per month from May 1, 2011 until March 1, 2013 in child support for their four children \u2014 ending the date of their fourth child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. After March 1, 2013, the circuit court ordered Branch to pay Oley $400 a month in child support for their remaining three minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">\n<em>B. Childcare Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Oley runs his startup Internet company mainly from his home, but occasionally he works from a \u201cvirtual office\u201d in Innsbrook. The three minor children attend school every weekday from 8:15 a.m. until 3:10 p.m. Oley testified that he requires childcare from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. His current nanny works those hours, and sometimes longer, for $400 per week. According to Oley, the nanny\u2019s responsibilities included \u201ccooking, cleaning, laundry, [and] a multifaceted amount of things.\u201d The children are home only approximately two hours out of the nanny\u2019s 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. workday.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The circuit court found that the evidence demonstrated that the nanny\u2019s presence was more akin to \u201ctaking a role of a mother\u201d rather than providing childcare that \u201csimply allow[s] [Oley] to work.\u201d Noting that it found Oley\u2019s testimony \u201cnot particularly] credible,\u201d the circuit court concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate that the nanny\u2019s responsibilities had \u201canything to do with work-related day care.\u201d Therefore, the circuit court denied Oley\u2019s request for childcare support because there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to find that [he] has legitimate <em>work related </em>child care expenses to be considered in accordance with the guidelines.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">\n<em>C. Private School Tuition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">Oley\u2019s and Branch\u2019s three minor children currently attend a private school named Salem Christian School. Their combined yearly tuitions total $15,000. The children have not always attended Salem Christian \u2014 they were home schooled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>for \u201ca couple of years\u201d and attended public school for \u201ca couple of years.\u201d The children re-entered Salem Christian after a period of home schooling. The parties\u2019 custody agreement was only that the children would not be home schooled; however, the agreement did not specifically mandate their attendance at Salem Christian. Branch does not object to the children attending Salem Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The circuit court denied Oley\u2019s motion to require Branch to pay for the children\u2019s private school tuition because it found that Oley\u2019s evidence failed to establish that \u201cthere is a need for the children to attend private school,\u201d \u201cthat the funds and needs otherwise cannot be met in public school,\u201d and \u201cthat the mother has the ability to pay for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\n<em>A. \u201cGross Income\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Statutory child support guidelines were designed \u201cto assure that both the child\u2019s needs and the parent\u2019s ability to pay are considered in determining the amount of support awards.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Richardson, </em>12 Va.App. 18, 20, 401 S.E.2d 894, 895 (1991). Code \u00a7 20-108.2(A) establishes a rebuttable presumption that an application of the schedule contained in the statute results in the correct amount of child support to be awarded under the circumstances. Only <em>after </em>determining the presumptive amount of support according to the schedule, may the circuit court adjust the support amount based on the factors found in Code \u00a7 20-108.1. <em>Howe v. Howe, </em>30 Va.App. 207, 214, 516 S.E.2d 240, 244 (1999). Any \u201c[deviations from the presumptive support obligation must be supported by written findings which state why the application of the guidelines in the particular case would be unjust or inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Thus, \u201cthe starting point for a trial court in determining the monthly child support obligation of a party is the amount as computed by the schedule found in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(B).\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>12 Va.App. at 21, 401 S.E.2d at 896. This amount \u201cvaries according to the combined gross income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>of the parties and the number of children involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 defines \u201cgross income\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\"><em>all income from all sources, and shall include, but not be limited to, </em>income from salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, capital gains, social security benefits except as listed below, workers\u2019 compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability insurance benefits, veterans\u2019 benefits, spousal support, rental income, gifts, prizes or awards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">(Emphasis added). Subsection (C) then enumerates specific sources of income that are categorically excluded from being considered part of a party\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C)(l)-(4). \u201cNo additions or subtractions from the gross income, as defined in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0, even if otherwise valid considerations, may be made <em>before </em>this figure is determined.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>12 Va.App. at 21, 401 S.E.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Oley asserts in his first, second, and third assignments of error that the circuit court erred as a matter of law by excluding certain sources of funds in its computation of Branch\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d Specifically, he argues the following items are \u201cincome\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C): (i) Branch\u2019s personal injury settlement annuity payments; (ii) the \u201cfree housing\u201d Branch receives as a \u201cgift\u201d from her mother; and (in) Branch\u2019s Pell Grant. Whether the circuit court correctly concluded that those items are not \u201cincome\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Navas v. Navas, </em>43 Va.App. 484, 487, 599 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">\n<em>i. Personal Injury Settlement Annuity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Oley first argues that the circuit court erred by failing to include Branch\u2019s annuity payments, originating from a 1987 personal injury settlement, in the computation of her \u201cgross income.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>This Court has previously considered whether personal injury settlements are \u201cincome\u201d within the scope of Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C). In <em>Whitaker, </em>this Court upheld a circuit court\u2019s refusal to treat a father\u2019s personal injury settlement as income. 18 Va.App. at 204, 442 S.E.2d at 431. This Court reasoned that because the definition of \u201cgross income\u201d includes \u201ccapital gains,\u201d and \u201ccapital gains are by their nature profits, not returns of capital,\u201d the General Assembly intended that Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C) only \u201capplies to income, <em>not capital recoupment.\u201d Id. </em>at 204-05, 442 S.E.2d at 431 (emphasis added). In the case of personal injury settlements, the evidence must prove that the settlement generates income or profit rather than merely makes the recipient whole from damages incurred. <em>Id. </em>Because the father\u2019s settlement was not apportioned as to pain and suffering, permanent injury or disability, lost wages, lost capacity, or future medical needs, \u201cit would be speculative at best as to how to attribute any part of that settlement to prior lost wages as opposed to the other elements of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 442 S.E.2d at 431. Consequently, the <em>Whitaker </em>Court held that in that particular case, the evidence did not prove that the settlement generated <em>income </em>for the father and was not mere capital recoupment and therefore the settlement could not be considered in awarding child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Oley argues that because Branch receives her personal injury settlement in the form of an annuity, Branch\u2019s payments are \u201cincome\u201d under subsection (C). The definition of \u201cgross income\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C) specifically includes \u201cincome from ... annuities.\u201d The plain language of the statute requires that in order to be considered when calculating child support obligations, annuities \u2014 or any of the other enumerated items in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 \u2014 must <em>generate income </em>to the recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Dispersing Branch\u2019s personal injury settlement in the form of an annuity does not change the underlying character of the source \u2014 a personal injury settlement. Consequently, the mere fact that Branch receives her personal injury settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ment in the <em>form </em>of an annuity does not render our holding in <em>Whitaker </em>inapplicable. This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Whitaker </em>does not stand for the proposition that personal injury settlements are categorically excluded from being considered income under subsection (C). Rather <em>Whitaker </em>explains under what circumstances a personal injury settlement may or may not be considered income. In order for a personal injury settlement to be considered income pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C), the evidence must prove that a defined portion of the settlement <em>generates income </em>to the recipient rather than merely compensates for a past injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In this case, like in <em>Whitaker, </em>Branch\u2019s settlement is not apportioned as to the nature of the damages that involve the settlement. There is nothing in the record that indicates that the settlement involved compensation for lost wages or lost income \u2014 particularly in light of the fact that Branch was a minor at the time of the accident. The circuit court concluded that Branch\u2019s settlement payments, even if paid out over many years in the form of an annuity, were capital <em>recoupments </em>intended to make \u201ca badly injured child whole.\u201d The record supports the circuit court\u2019s determination that the evidence did not prove that the annuity payments generated any income to Branch. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in excluding Branch\u2019s personal injury payments when computing her gross income pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C) simply because they took the form of an annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>ii. Free Housing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Oley next argues that the circuit court erred by failing to include the monetary value of Branch\u2019s \u201cfree housing\u201d when it calculated her gross income. He asserts that the \u201cfree housing\u201d is a \u201cgift\u201d from her mother, and is therefore \u201cincome\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Oley relies on <em>Carmon v. Department of Social Services, </em>21 Va.App. 749, 467 S.E.2d 815 (1996), to support his proposition that free room and board <em>must </em>constitute nonmonetary income. However, Oley fails to read the holding in <em>Carmon </em>within its factual context. In <em>Carmon, </em>this Court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>free room and board were considered \u201cincome\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 because Carmon received them in exchange for her services \u2014 collecting rent, cleaning vacated rooms, etc. 21 Va.App. at 754-55, 467 S.E.2d at 818. The Court found that the free lodging compensation she received in exchange for services was \u201cnonmonetary income\u201d that was within the scope of Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C). <em>Id. </em>Because the value of the room and board Carmon received as compensation for her services was $300, this Court affirmed the circuit court\u2019s finding that her income was $300. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the holding in <em>Carmon </em>is inapplicable because there is nothing in the record establishing that Branch received anything in exchange for her room at her mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Oley argues that Branch\u2019s \u201cfree housing\u201d is a gift from her mother. Although \u201cthe statute defines gifts as income,\u201d <em>Howe, </em>30 Va.App. at 214, 516 S.E.2d at 244, allowing someone to live with you is not a \u201cgift.\u201d \u201cA gift is property that is voluntarily transferred to another without compensation.\u201d <em>Goldhamer v. Cohen, </em>31 Va.App. 728, 736, 525 S.E.2d 599, 603 (2000) (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>696 (7th ed.1999)). Here there is no property being transferred. Moreover, there is nothing in the record to establish the value of Branch\u2019s room at her mother\u2019s house. Oley asserts that the value of the room is $1,200 per month because her previous monthly rent was $1,200 per month. In other words, Oley argues that the \u201cincome\u201d is the money Branch saves by living with her mother rather than living in her previous apartment. Branch\u2019s decision to live with her mother amounts only to a decrease in spending, and is not property voluntarily transferred to her by her mother, nor does it generate \u201cincome\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C). Therefore, the circuit court did not err in excluding Branch\u2019s housing arrangements when calculating her gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\n<em>in. Pell Grant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Oley next argues that the circuit court erred by failing to include Branch\u2019s $5,500 Pell Grant when it calculated her gross income. Whether federal educational grants are \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>come\u201d for the purposes of calculating child support is a matter of first impression in Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The Pell Grant Program provides financial assistance to students attending eligible intuitions of higher education to help subsidize their post-secondary education costs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Trustees of the Cal.

Riley, </em>74 F.3d 960, 962 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 690.1 (\u201cThe Federal Pell Grant Program awards grants to help financially needy students meet the cost of their postsecondary education.\u201d). Educational costs are not limited to tuition but may include other supplemental costs such as room and board, books, or ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>vices. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070a(e) (\u201cAny disbursement allowed to be made by crediting the student\u2019s account shall be limited to tuition and fees and, in the case of institutionally owned housing, room and board. The student may elect to have the institution provide other such goods and services by crediting the student\u2019s account.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">\u201cUnder Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0, gross income includes \u2018all income from all sources,\u2019 and <em>unless specifically excluded, any income from any source is subject to </em>inclusion.\u201d <em>Frazer v. Frazer, </em>28 Va.App. 358, 378, 477 S.E.2d 290, 299-300 (1996) (emphasis added) (quoting Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0) (holding that because Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 did not specifically exclude voluntary contributions to retirement plans from the definition of gross income, the contributions should be included in gross income for child support purposes). While Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C) does not specifically enumerate educational grants, such as the Pell Grant, under its definition of \u201cgross income,\u201d there is nothing contained in the language of the statute, nor in this Court\u2019s precedent, that explicitly or implicitly <em>excludes </em>federal educational grants from being considered income.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C)\u2019s definition of gross income specifically includes other governmental assistance programs, such as \u201csocial security benefits.\u201d However, subsection (C) explicitly provides that gross income \u201cshall <em>not </em>include\u201d \u201csupplemental security income benefits\u201d or \u201cpublic assistance and social services as defined in Code \u00a7 63.2-100.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C)(1) and (2) (emphasis added). A Pell Grant does not meet any of those enumerated exclusions. If the General Assembly intended to exclude additional government subsidies, such as educational grants, it would have specifically articulated those exclusions. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000) (\u201cThe maxim of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>... provides that where a statute speaks in specific terms, an implication arises that omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute.\u201d). Because the General Assembly specifically enumerated certain governmental assistance programs that \u201cshall not\u201d be considered \u201cgross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>income,\u201d non-enumerated programs, such as federal educational grants, are therefore subject to inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Therefore, because Code \u00a7 20-108.2(0 does not specifically exclude federal education grants, like the Pell Grant in this case, they are subject to inclusion. Consequently, the circuit court erred by not considering Branch\u2019s Pell Grant when it calculated her gross income. Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court to recalculate the parties\u2019 presumptive monthly support obligations in accordance with this opinion before it makes any deviations from the guidelines based on the factors found in Code \u00a7 20-108.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">\n<em>B. Childcare Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Oley next argues that the circuit court erred as a matter of law by failing to award him childcare expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Code \u00a7 20-108.2(F) provides that: \u201cAny child-care costs incurred on behalf of the child or children due to employment of the custodial parent shall be added to the basic child support obligation.\u201d While Oley is correct that this Court in <em>Prizzia v. Prizzia, </em>58 Va.App. 137, 707 S.E.2d 461 (2011), stated that the language in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(F) \u201cis mandatory,\u201d he ignores the final holding in that case. In <em>Prizzia, </em>this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude day care expenses from its support award because the custodial parent failed to offer sufficient evidence demonstrating the appropriate amount of day care expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 707 S.E.2d at 478. Specifically, there was insufficient proof that the amount requested was reasonable in comparison to alternative day care centers and that free day care provided by public schools was unavailable to the child. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 707 S.E.2d at 477-78. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Additionally, the custodial parent testified that she was paying the nanny a higher hourly rate than she was earning herself. <em>Id. </em>In affirming the trial court, this Court noted that \u201c[s]imply because a statute requires inclusion of certain expenses in a child support award, it does not follow that the party seeking the inclusion of those expenses does not have the burden to produce sufficient cr\u00e9dible evidence showing the appropriate amount of those expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 707 S.E.2d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In this case, the circuit court found that Oley failed to produce credible evidence that the childcare costs he was seeking were employment related. The nanny worked from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry while the children were in school 8:15 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and Oley was working from home. Code \u00a7 20-108.2(F) only requires that the custodial parent receive child support for childcare costs incurred \u201cdue to employment of the custodial parent.\u201d Here, the circuit court was free to conclude that Oley failed to prove that the nanny was necessary due to his employment or that he failed to demonstrate the requested amount of day care expenses was appropriate under the circumstances. Therefore, we find that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Oley\u2019s request for childcare costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\n<em>C. Private School Tuition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Oley next argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in declining to deviate from the statutory guidelines by including the children\u2019s private school tuition as part of Branch\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">\u201cImplicit in the statutory scheme is that educational expenses are included in the presumptive amount of child support as calculated under the Code.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>18 Va.App. 427, 435, 444 S.E.2d 269, 275 (1994). However, as explained <em>supra, </em>it is within the circuit court\u2019s discretion to deviate from the presumptive support guidelines based on the factors found in Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B) as they affect the obligation of each party, the ability of each party to provide child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>support, and the best interests of the child. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B). One of the factors providing grounds for deviating from the statutory presumption specifically includes direct payments ordered by the court for \u201ceducational expenses.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B)(6). The circuit court may order a parent \u201cto pay for private educational expenses, even though such expenses exceed the guidelines, when there is a demonstrated need for the child to attend private school <em>and </em>the parent has the ability to pay.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Ragsdale, </em>30 Va.App. 283, 295, 516 S.E.2d 698, 704 (1999) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Solomond v. Ball, </em>22 Va.App. 385, 391, 470 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">In determining whether there is a demonstrated need for the child to attend private school, \u201cthe trial court must consider \u2018factors such as the availability of satisfactory public schools, the child\u2019s attendance at private school prior to the separation and divorce, the child\u2019s special emotional or physical needs, religious training, and family tradition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joynes v. Payne, </em>36 Va.App. 401, 424, 551 S.E.2d 10, 21 (2001) (quoting <em>Solomond, 22 </em>Va.App. at 391, 470 S.E.2d at 160).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In this case the circuit court declined to require Branch to pay the children\u2019s private school tuition because, after having \u201creviewed the <em>Eisert </em>case,\u201d the court found that Oley\u2019s evidence failed to establish \u201cthere [wa]s a need for the children to attend private school and that the funds and needs otherwise cannot be met in public school.\u201d Additionally, the circuit court found that Oley failed to establish \u201cthat the mother has the ability to pay for it.\u201d In <em>Eisert v. Eisert, </em>No. 2990-06-4, 2008 WL 703719, at *7, 2008 Va.App. LEXIS 134, at *18-19 (Va.Ct.App. Mar. 18, 2008), an unpublished decision of this Court, we found that because the children\u2019s need to attend private school was not in dispute the circuit court \u201cwas only required to explain in writing why it was \u2018unjust or inappropriate\u2019 for wife to share in the cost of tuition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7, 2008 Va.App. LEXIS 134 at *19. This Court concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the husband to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>pay the full cost of tuition because there was a large disparity in the parties\u2019 disposable incomes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In this case, unlike <em>Eisert, </em>the parties did not affirmatively agree that private school attendance was <em>necessary. </em>Although Oley asserts that they agreed private school was in the best interest of the children, the record in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed in the court below reflects that Branch merely had no objection to the children attending Salem Christian School. The parties\u2019 agreement was only that the children would not be home schooled. The circuit court did not find any evidence in the record that demonstrated a need to attend private school or that the children\u2019s needs could not adequately be met in public school. The children had attended public school in the past and had also been home schooled. There was no evidence as to any special emotional or physical needs of the children that would require them to attend private school. Nor was there any evidence supporting the children\u2019s need to attend private school due to religious training.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Irrespective of a demonstrated need for private school attendance, the circuit court also found that the evidence did not establish that Branch had the ability to pay for private school tuition. In fact, the circuit court concluded that Branch did not even have the ability to pay the presumptive monthly support amount according to the child support schedule nor any excess amount for private school tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Here, the circuit court did not order Oley to pay for the children\u2019s tuition, but rather concluded that Branch did not have the ability to contribute to the cost nor was there a demonstrated need to order her to contribute. In other words, the circuit court merely concluded that Oley had failed to demonstrate a justification for deviating from the statutory guidelines by ordering Branch to pay the children\u2019s tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The determination of child support is a matter of discretion for the circuit court, and therefore we will not disturb its judgment on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Vissicchio v. Vissicchio, </em>27 Va.App. 240, 253, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>498 S.E.2d 425, 432 (1998). In reaching its decision, the circuit court properly considered both the children\u2019s need for private school and Branch\u2019s ability to pay tuition. Under these circumstances, we find that there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s decision to decline to deviate from the child support guidelines to include the cost of the children\u2019s private school tuition, and therefore we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>D. Child Support Arrearages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Oley next argues that the circuit court erred by failing to award him child support arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The circuit court found that there were no child support arrearages as of February 28, 2013. The juvenile and domestic relations district court had set Branch\u2019s monthly payments at $453.75 per month for the four children. The circuit court adopted that number for the four children but lowered her payments to $400 a month beginning March 1, 2013, the date of the fourth child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. Consequently the circuit court found that Branch had a credit for the payments made from March 1, 2013 to May 22, 2013 and there was an overage in the amount of $163.42 as of May 31, 2013. Because we are remanding this case to the circuit court to recalculate the presumptive guidelines before any deviations respecting the parties\u2019 monthly child support, and because the circuit court\u2019s determination regarding alleged arrearages was based upon the monthly support obligations it ordered, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\n<em>E. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Oley\u2019s final argument is that he did not receive a fair hearing because the circuit court was biased and he therefore should receive a new trial. Specifically he argues that the circuit court\u2019s deviations from the guidelines are \u201cso far removed\u201d from similar cases in Virginia, that there is a \u201cstrong appearance of bias.\u201d Further, he asserts that while he \u201cdoes not claim any knowledge of any pre-disposition by the [circuit] court,\u201d its</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>verbal utterances of apparent favoritism of mother, bias against father, viewed in tandem with the Final Order, one would be hard pressed not to see the appearance that the [circuit] court simply used judicial authority and statutorily granted powers of deviation to correct a personally perceived injustice not supported by the evidence or the facts, nor grounded in law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Oley cites no authority in support of his position that his due process rights were violated. \u201cRule 5A:20(e) provided, in part, that the opening brief shall include \u2018[t]he principles of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 2, 20, 698 S.E.2d 249, 258 (2010). \u201cThe Supreme Court concluded that \u2018when a party\u2019s \u2018failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e)\u2019 is significant, \u2018the Court of Appeals may ... treat a question presented as waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parks v. Parks, </em>52 Va.App. 663, 664, 666 S.E.2d 547, 548 (2008)). \u201cIf the parties believed that the circuit court erred, it was their duty to present that error to [the Court of Appeals] with legal authority to support their contention.\u201d <em>Fadness v. Fadness, 52 </em>Va.App. 833, 851, 667 S.E.2d 857, 866 (2008). Because Oley provides no legal argument or authority in his brief to support his position that he was denied due process of law and did not receive a fair hearing, his argument is waived under Rule 5A:20(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Moreover, Oley fails to demonstrate any reversible error. \u201cA litigant is denied due process if his or her case is heard before a judge who harbors \u2018such bias or prejudice as would deny [the litigant] a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piatt v. Piatt, </em>27 Va.App. 426, 435-36, 499 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1998) (quoting <em>Welsh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 300, 314, 416 S.E.2d 451, 459 (1992)). Oley concedes that he has no knowledge of any pre-existing bias of the circuit court, but rather asserts that the circuit court\u2019s rulings and remarks from the bench demonstrated partiality. This argument is without merit. As the factfinder, the circuit court\u2019s function is to make credibility determinations. In this capacity it found Branch credible and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Oley not credible. All of the circuit court\u2019s legal rulings demonstrated an appropriate application of reason and impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In sum, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment excluding Branch\u2019s Pell Grant from the computation of her gross income under Code \u00a7 20-108.2(C). We remand this case to the circuit court for recalculation of the child support schedule to include Branch\u2019s Pell Grant as part of her \u201cgross income\u201d before it considers any deviation pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B). The circuit court\u2019s judgment regarding all other issues before us is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. The $1,711.20 presumptive support amount was calculated according to the schedule contained in Code \u00a7 20-108.2(B) by considering the fact that the parties had three children, Branch\u2019s income was $1,462, Oley\u2019s income was $125, and Oley was paying $1,313 per month for the children\u2019s health insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-6\">. A select number of other jurisdictions have addressed whether educational grants are income for the purposes of calculating child support; however, those courts\u2019 determinations all turned on the language of each state's specific statutory language. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Syverson, </em>281 Mont. 1, 931 P.2d 691, 698 (1997) (concluding that money from the mother\u2019s Pell Grant that exceeded her tuition bill should be considered gross income because the statute defined gross income as \"grants, scholarships, third party contributions or other money <em>intended to subsidize the parent\u2019s living expenses </em>and which are not required to be repaid at some later date\" (quoting Mont. Admin. R. \u00a7 46.30.1513(2)(e))); <em>In re Marriage of Mellott, </em>32 Kan.App.2d 1031, 93 P.3d 1219, 1221-22 (2004) (concluding that tuition reimbursements from an employer not exceeding cost of tuition were not income for child support purposes because under the statutory guidelines income is only imputed to a noncustodial parent when \u201ca parent receives significant in kind payments <em>that reduce personal living expenses </em>as a result of employment, such as a company car, free housing, or reimbursed meals,\u201d and tuition reimbursement did not equate to living expenses reimbursement); <em>Thibadeau v. Thibadeau, </em>150 Wis.2d 109, 441 N.W.2d 281, 285 (1989) (concluding that the trial court erred by considering a federal educational grant as gross income because the state statute defined gross income as income from any source \"unless excluded by law,\u201d and the federal tax code excludes educational grants from gross income calculations); <em>McKyer v.
