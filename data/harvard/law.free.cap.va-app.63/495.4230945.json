FRANK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Douglas R. Linton, appellant, appeals the decision of the circuit court that ordered Debra A. Linton, appellee, to transfer her separately titled limited partnership interest to satisfy a monetary award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he contends Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) prohibits such a transfer. For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The facts are undisputed. The parties entered into a property settlement agreement which was filed in the Circuit Court of Fauquier County on October 23, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties agreed that appellee\u2019s separately titled 49% limited partnership interest in CRL Partnership, LP was marital property having a fair market value of $768,862.50. They also agreed appellant was entitled to a monetary award of $384,431.25. The agreement permitted the parties to later contest how appellee could satisfy that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">On October 23, 2013, the trial court conducted a hearing on the underlying divorce complaint and whether the trial court could order the transfer of appellee\u2019s limited partnership interest to satisfy the monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>After the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court issued an opinion letter dated October 28, 2013. The court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) prohibited the transfer of appellee\u2019s limited partnership interest and found Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">The Wife\u2019s ownership interest in CRL is marital, but separately titled in her name and is subject to a 50% equitable distribution award to the Husband by agreement. The Wife desires to convey one-half of her limited partnership interest to the Husband in satisfaction of this award. The Husband does not desire to receive her half interest in satisfaction of this award, even though the amount of her interest is equal to the stipulated award of $384,431.25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">Therefore, the court will direct the Wife to transfer and the Husband to accept the 24/6 percent interest of the Wife in CRL in full satisfaction of the award of his interest in her limited partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Appellant\u2019s entire argument relies on Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C). Appellee contends Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) controls. Thus, the narrow issue before us is which statute controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008) (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007) (citing <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2006))). \u201c[Cjourts apply the plain language of a statute unless the terms are ambiguous.\u201d <em>Boynton, </em>271 Va. at 227, 623 S.E.2d at 926 (citing <em>Tiller v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 418, 420, 69 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1952)); <em>see also Alliance to Save the Mattaponi v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 423, 439, 621 S.E.2d 78, 86-87 (2005) (\u201cCourts are bound by the plain meaning of statutory language.\u201d). \u201c \u2018[I]f the language is plain, certain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>unambiguous, so that no doubt arises from its own terms as to its meaning, then there is no room for interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boynton, </em>271 Va. at 228 n. 10, 623 S.E.2d at 926 n. 10 (quoting <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 1, 11, 155 S.E. 635, 638 (1930)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u201c[T]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Amerson, </em>281 Va. 414, 418, 706 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2011); <em>see also B.P. v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 735, 739, 568 S.E.2d 412, 413 (2002) (\u201cWe will not place a construction upon a statute which leads to an absurd result or one plainly contrary to the expressed intent of the General Assembly.\u201d). Legislative intent is ascertained \u201c \u2018by giving to all the words used their plain meaning and construing all statutes <em>in pari materia </em>in such manner as to reconcile, if possible, any discordant feature which may exist, and make the body of the laws harmonious and just in their operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 496, 500, 720 S.E.2d 157, 159-60 (2012) (quoting <em>Lucy v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 129-30, 516 S.E.2d 480, 485 (1999)). Further, this Court \u201cpresumed that the legislature chose, with care, the words it use[d]\u201d when it enacts a statute. <em>Rives v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 1, 3, 726 S.E.2d 248, 250 (2012) (quoting <em>Zinone v. Lee\u2019s Crossing Homeowners Ass\u2019n, </em>282 Va. 330, 337, 714 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In dealing with statutory construction, \u201cwe examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001). \u201c \u2018It is a cardinal rule of construction that statutes dealing with a specific subject must be construed together in order to arrive at the object sought to be accomplished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 759, 769, 652 S.E.2d 456, 462 (2007) (quoting <em>Prillaman v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 401, 406, 100 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1957) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The two statutes that we address are not in conflict. They simply address two separate components of the equitable distribution process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Under Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the court must determine legal title, ownership, and value of such property, whether that property is separate, marital, or part separate and part marital, as well as the amount of debt. Thereafter, the court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) may order the transfer or division, or both, of jointly owned marital property or jointly owned marital debt. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(0 specifically prohibits the court from dividing or transferring property which is <em>not </em>jointly owned. This is the section upon which appellant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">However, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) gives the court additional authority to grant a monetary award, which may be paid either in a lump sum or over a period of time in feed amounts. In this context, the statute provides, \u201cThe party against whom a monetary award is made may satisfy the award, in whole or in part, by the conveyance of property, subject to the approval of the court.\u201d <em>See also Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 185, 342 S.E.2d 646, 650-51 (1986). The only limitation is that the court must approve the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The trial court in this case correctly relied on <em>Payne v. Payne, 5 </em>Va.App. 359, 363 S.E.2d 428 (1987), and <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>56 Va.App. 511, 694 S.E.2d 797 (2010). Both cases addressed Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D). In <em>Payne, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">The obvious reason for this provision [of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D) ] is to enable the parties to make payment of a monetary award by adjustment of their property. The legislature gave the option of this method of payment to the \u201cparty against whom a monetary award is made.\u201d The statute makes no mention of consent, approval or acceptance by the party to whom the property is to be conveyed. However, it does make such a transfer subject to the court\u2019s approval. We believe this provision serves to prevent unilateral action by the party seeking to make payment by the transfer of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\"><em>Payne, </em>5 Va.App. at 366, 363 S.E.2d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\"><em>Johnson </em>subsequently cited <em>Payne </em>with approval. <em>See Johnson, </em>56 Va.App. at 516-17, 694 S.E.2d at 800-01. In both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Payne </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>the issue was whether the trial court abused its discretion regarding satisfying monetary awards. In <em>Payne, </em>we held the trial court abused its discretion in requiring wife to assume an existing lien obligation in satisfaction of the monetary award. In <em>Johnson, </em>we concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the transfer of property from husband to wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Appellant seeks to distinguish these two cases, contending that neither case creates an exception to the plain language of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C). He argues <em>Payne </em>did not involve Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C), because the property in question was still jointly owned. He is correct. <em>Payne </em>addresses only Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D), because Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Johnson </em>because it involved transfer of a retirement account, which is an exception under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C). While appellant correctly states that the property transferred in that case was a retirement account, the transfer was ordered to satisfy a monetary award under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D). In this case as well, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(C) applies only to the transfer or division of property without any reference to the satisfaction of a monetary award. A transfer or division of property to satisfy a monetary award would be controlled by Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D). These two statutes address completely different situations in the equitable distribution statutory scheme. The trial court correctly noted this distinction. As such, appellant\u2019s argument fails. We affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The trial court did not err in directing wife to transfer her separately titled limited partnership interest to satisfy a monetary award. Further, we find appellant\u2019s argument is merit-less, neither grounded in Code \u00a7 20-107.3, nor in the case law analyzing Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D). We therefore grant appellee\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 666 S.E.2d 532 (2008). We remand this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>appeal to the trial court for a determination of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by appellee in defending this appeal, including attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in the remand hearing. <em>See Fox v. Fox, </em>61 Va.App. 185, 208, 734 S.E.2d 662, 673 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. While appellant characterized the award as a \"cash award,\u201d it is actually a monetary award made pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-13\">. The agreement is not in the appendix but there appears to be no conflict as to the applicable provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
