PETTY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">William Lloyd Henry was convicted of two counts of forgery of a public record, two counts of uttering a forged public record, all in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-168, and two counts of perjury in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-161. On appeal, Henry argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to strike the forgery and uttering charges on the ground of insufficient evidence. For the following reasons, we agree with Henry and reverse the forgery and uttering convictions. Henry also argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to strike the perjury charges on the ground that the Commonwealth failed to prove that his real estate was readily convertible into cash pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-159. As discussed below, Code \u00a7 19.2-159 does not require that real estate be readily convertible into cash; thus, Henry\u2019s second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>assignment of error fails, and we affirm his convictions for misdemeanor perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">At the conclusion of a bench trial, Henry was convicted of two counts of forgery of a public record, two counts of uttering a forged public record, and two counts of perjury. The convictions stem from information Henry provided to a court clerk to determine his eligibility for indigent defense services. During two meetings with the clerk, Henry stood on one side of the window while the clerk stood on the other side of the window and asked the questions to fill out the financial statements of indigency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On a form dated May 6, 2011, the clerk recorded that Henry was receiving SNAP<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> assistance, that he was unemployed, and that he had no assets. Under the assets section of the form, the clerk placed a zero on the line for cash on hand, bank accounts, any other assets, real estate, motor vehicles, and other personal property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The clerk passed the completed form under the window, and Henry signed and dated it. Above the signature line, the form contained the following: \u201cThis statement is made under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>oath. Any false statement may constitute a violation of law under Virginia Code \u00a7 19.2-161 and be subject to criminal penalty, including incarceration. I hereby state that the above information is correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d In reference to the question regarding real estate, the clerk testified that she always asks someone \u201cif they own a home or are buying a home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On January 6, 2012, Henry, again seeking a court-appointed counsel, approached the same clerk that filled out the May 6, 2011 form. On the January 6, 2012 form, the clerk recorded that Henry was receiving SNAP assistance and that he was unemployed. The clerk recorded \u201crental property 500/mo\u201d on the \u201cother income sources\u201d line. Twenty dollars, listed as \u201ccash on hand,\u201d was the only entry other than zero in the assets section of the form, which, like the May 6, 2011 form, allowed entries for cash on hand, bank accounts, any other assets, real estate, motor vehicles, and other personal property. Henry once again signed the form under oath, after which the clerk signed as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">In spite of Henry\u2019s representation to the clerk that he owned no real estate, Henry was gifted a parcel of real estate on September 10, 1992 from his parents. The custodian for the land records in Louisa County testified that there was no record of this parcel having been transferred out of Henry\u2019s ownership prior to June 26, 2012, the date that Henry gifted the land to someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Henry notes two errors in the trial court\u2019s decision. First, Henry argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to strike charges of forgery and uttering because the alleged misrepresentation on the indigency form did not constitute a forgery. Second, Henry argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to strike the perjury charges on the ground that the Commonwealth failed to prove that his real estate was readily convertible into cash pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-159. For the following reasons, we reverse the forgery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>and uttering convictions and affirm the two perjury convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u201c \u2018When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, [this] Court will affirm the judgment unless the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayfield v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 839, 850, 722 S.E.2d 689, 695 (2012) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)). In our review, we have \u201ca duty to examine all the evidence that tends to support the conviction.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e \u2018must discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth and regard as true all credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences reasonably deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holcomb v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 339, 346, 709 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2011) (quoting <em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 303, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Moreover, \u201c[a]n appellate court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). \u201c \u2018This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 178, 185, 692 S.E.2d 271, 274 (2010) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A. Forgery</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Henry was charged with forging public records in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-168,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>If any person forge a public record, or certificate, return, or attestation, of any public officer or public employee, in relation to any matter wherein such certificate, return, or attestation may be received as legal proof, or utter, or attempt to employ as true, such forged record, certificate, return, or attestation, knowing the same to be forged, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u201cForgery is a common law crime in Virginia. It is defined as \u2018the false making or materially altering with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy, or the foundation of legal liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriquez v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 667, 671, 653 S.E.2d 296, 298 (2007) (quoting <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 171, 173-74, 313 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1984)). \u201cAt common law, to constitute a forgery, there must be a false making with the intent to defraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 653 S.E.2d at 299.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">However, \u201c[w]here the \u2018falsity lies in the representation of facts, not in the genuineness of execution,\u2019 it is not forgery.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 650, 658, 82 S.Ct. 1399, 1404, 8 L.Ed.2d 750 (1962) (quoting <em>Marteney v. United States, </em>216 F.2d 760, 763-64 (10th Cir.1954)). Furthermore, \u201c[florgery is a crime aimed primarily at safeguarding confidence in the genuineness of documents relied upon in commercial and business activity. Though a forgery, like false pretenses, requires a lie, it must be a lie about the document itself: the lie must relate to the genuineness of the document.\u201d 3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 19.7(j)(5) (2d ed.2003) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Falsifying the genuineness of a document is so critical to the offense of forgery that \u201cwhen a person writes a letter or completes a loan application or other instrument and signs it with his own name, he is not guilty of forgery because a false statement is contained therein, even if he knew it was false and acted with intent to defraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>Vizcarra-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 870, 875 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting 4 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 487 (15th ed.)). In fact, \u201c \u2018[i]n criminal cases the great weight of authority holds false statements in or fraudulent execution of otherwise valid instruments not to be forgery within its common law or unexplained meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>553 F.2d 351, 355 (4th Cir.1977) (quoting <em>First National Bank of South Carolina v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>304 F.2d 866, 870 n. 1 (4th Cir.1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Both Henry and the Commonwealth rely on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rodriquez </em>for the resolution of this case. In <em>Rodriquez, </em>a police officer initiated a traffic stop of Rodriquez\u2019s vehicle because it had expired plates. <em>Rodriquez, </em>50 Va.App. at 670, 653 S.E.2d at 298. Rodriquez did not have an operator\u2019s license in his possession. <em>Id. </em>In preparing two summonses, the officer asked Rodriquez for his identifying information and the defendant responded with that of his brother rather than himself. <em>Id. </em>Rodriquez then illegibly signed his own name on the summonses. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Rodriquez was convicted of two counts of forgery and two counts of uttering a forged public document, both under Code \u00a7 18.2-168. <em>Id. </em>at 669, 653 S.E.2d at 297. This Court upheld the convictions, reasoning that \u201c[although Rodriquez did not personally write the false information, he provided the information to [the officer] as he created the documents and, in doing so, Rodriquez engaged in the \u2018false making\u2019 of the two public documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672, 653 S.E.2d at 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Henry argues that the crux of the issue is that a document is not \u201cfalsely made\u201d merely because it contains misrepresentations of fact within it. Henry distinguishes this case from <em>Rodriquez </em>by noting that the summonses created in <em>Rodriquez </em>were entirely false documents. Henry points to <em>Brown </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 178, 188, 692 S.E.2d 271, 276 (2010) (reversing the conviction because \u201cnothing in the record suggests that the [documents] were anything other than what they purported to be\u201d), for the proposition that the gravamen of forgery is the want of genuineness or authenticity in a document. Henry also points to this Court\u2019s footnote in <em>Rodriquez </em>distinguishing the summonses in <em>Rodriquez </em>from \u201ctax rolls [that] contained false and fraudulent entries [where] this false information did not alter the authenticity of the tax rolls\u201d and noting that the summonses were \u201centirely fraudulent\u201d and \u201cthemselves were \u2018lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodriquez, </em>50 Va.App. at 672 n. 2, 653 S.E.2d at 299 n. 2. Thus, Henry contends that his actions were not forgery because the financial statements the clerk filled out and he signed were still financial statements, even if they were financial statements containing a lie. According to Henry, the document must purport to be something that it is not for a forgery conviction to be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201c[t]he true gravamen of \u00a7 18.2-168 ... is injecting fabricated or false information into the public record, where it may be acted upon.\u201d Thus, according to the Commonwealth, \u201cHenry\u2019s falsification was just that: a lie entered into the public record to obtain appointed counsel rather than having to use his own assets to hire counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">We agree with Henry that in order for Henry\u2019s forgery conviction to be upheld, the Commonwealth was required to prove that Henry\u2019s conduct with respect to the financial statements altered the genuineness and authenticity of those documents, making them <em>not in fact what they purported to be. </em>In <em>Rodriquez, </em>this Court held that the summonses were forged because the false identifying information that Rodriquez provided in their making transformed them into something other than what they purported to be\u2014 the documents purported to be summonses for Rodriquez but were forged to be summonses for Rodriquez\u2019s brother. <em>Rodriquez, </em>50 Va.App. at 670, 653 S.E.2d at 298. Indeed, \u201cRodriquez provided false and fraudulent information in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>create summonses that <em>were entirely fraudulent and not authentic. </em>The summonses themselves were \u2018lies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672 n. 2, 653 S.E.2d at 299 n. 2 (emphasis added). Based on this conclusion, we distinguished the holding in <em>Maryland v. Reese, </em>283 Md. 86, 388 A.2d 122, 127 (1978), where the Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that a false entry in a county tax roll did not constitute a forgery because \u201ca document is not considered false for purposes of the law of forgery merely because it contains a false statement of fact.\u201d The distinction we noted in <em>Rodriquez </em>is not applicable to the facts before us. Like the tax rolls in <em>Reese, </em>and unlike the summonses in <em>Rodriquez, </em>Henry\u2019s statement of indigency \u201cmerely ... contained] a false statement of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, this case is not controlled by our holding in <em>Rodriquez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Moreover, in <em>Brown, </em>we cited <em>Rodriquez </em>to support our conclusion that forgery was not present because nothing in the record suggested that the documents in that case were \u201canything other than what they purported to be.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>56 Va.App. at 188, 692 S.E.2d at 276. There, the documents in question were vouchers that were \u201cissued improperly because the underlying reservations were not paid for.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 692 S.E.2d at 273. Like the financial statements here, the vouchers in <em>Brown </em>were issued under the correct names and the material nature of the vouchers themselves was not altered. <em>Id. </em>at 188, 692 S.E.2d at 276.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Here, unlike the summonses in <em>Rodriquez, </em>the documents in question were in fact what they purported to be. The documents purported to be financial statements for William Lloyd Henry and remained financial statements for William Lloyd Henry despite Henry\u2019s alleged misrepresentations about his real estate assets. Although the financial statements ultimately contained \u201ca lie\u201d (because the full extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Henry\u2019s real estate assets was omitted), the material character of the documents themselves was not forged or altered; they remained authentic \u2014 the lie was not \u201cabout the document itself.\u201d <em>See </em>3 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19.7(j)(5). As we noted, \u201c[w]here the \u2018falsity lies in the representation of facts, not in the genuineness of execution,\u2019 it is not forgery.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>370 U.S. at 658, 82 S.Ct. at 1404 (quoting <em>Marteney, </em>216 F.2d at 763-64).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Therefore, because Henry\u2019s conduct did not amount to a false making of the financial statements sufficient to alter their material nature \u2014 making them something other than what they purported to be \u2014 we hold that the trial court erred in overruling Henry\u2019s motion to strike the forgery charges. Furthermore, because there can be no uttering when the document that is the basis of the charge was not a forgery, <em>Brown, </em>56 Va.App. at 189, 692 S.E.2d at 276-77, Henry\u2019s convictions for uttering must also be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">B. Perjury</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Henry appeals his convictions for perjury under Code \u00a7 19.2-161 based on the false statements in his financial statements to determine indigency. Code \u00a7 19.2-161 states, \u201cAny person charged with a misdemeanor punishable by confinement in jail who shall falsely swear or who shall execute the statement provided for in \u00a7 19.2-159 knowing such statement to be false shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In determining an accused\u2019s indigency, Code \u00a7 19.2-159 requires \u201ca thorough examination of the financial resources of the accused.\u201d Among other things, the court should give consideration to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">All assets of the accused which are convertible into cash within a reasonable period of time without causing substantial hardship or jeopardizing the ability of the accused to maintain home and employment. Assets shall include, all cash on hand as well as in checking and savings accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and tax refunds. All personal property owned by the accused which is readily convertible into cash shall be considered, except property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>exempt from attachment. Any real estate owned by the accused shall be considered in terms of the amounts which could be raised by a loan on the property....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Code \u00a7 19.2-159(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Henry contends that by failing to produce evidence of a clear title search, the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of proof that the real estate he owned, and omitted from his financial statements, was readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, Henry asserts that <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 606, 405 S.E.2d 626 (1991), merits reversal of his convictions for perjury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Although <em>Smith </em>concerned an appellant\u2019s conviction for perjury under Code \u00a7 19.2-161 based on his negative response in an indigency statement, the assets in question in that case were items of personal property, not real estate. <em>See id. </em>at 609, 405 S.E.2d at 628; <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1337 (9th ed.2009) (defining personal property as \u201c[a]ny movable or intangible thing that is subject to ownership and not classified as real property\u201d and real property as \u201cland and anything growing on, attached to, or erected on it\u201d). In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant was convicted of perjury for stating under oath on his financial statement to determine eligibility for indigent defense services that he did not own a motor vehicle. <em>Smith, </em>12 Va.App. at 607-08, 405 S.E.2d at 627. This Court reversed the conviction because the record established that Smith\u2019s car had been confiscated (and ultimately never released to him) at the time he signed the indigency statement and that he never held the title to a dirt bike. <em>Id. </em>at 608-09, 405 S.E.2d at 627-28. Thus, the items were not \u201creadily convertible to cash\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-159 at the time Smith signed the indigency statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Here, not only is the asset in question real estate, but the evidence in this case established that Henry held title to the property at the time he signed the financial statements asserting that he did not own real estate assets. Indeed, Henry received the property as a gift from his parents on September 10, 1992, and the custodian for the land records in Louisa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>County testified that there was no record of this parcel having been transferred out of Henry\u2019s ownership before he signed the financial statements in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Furthermore, Code \u00a7 19.2-159 makes clear that all assets readily convertible to cash must be considered on the financial statement but \u201creal estate owned by the accused shall be considered in terms of the amounts which could be raised by a loan on the property.\u201d Thus, a plain reading of the statute demonstrates, contrary to Henry\u2019s assertion, that there is no requirement that real estate listed on the financial statement (and considered by the court) be readily convertible to cash. <em>See Appalachian Power Co. v. State Corp. Comm\u2019n, </em>284 Va. 695, 706, 733 S.E.2d 250, 256 (2012) (\u201cWhen a statute is unambiguous, we must apply the plain meaning of that language.\u201d). Instead, the only requirement is that the real estate be \u201cconsidered in terms of the amounts which could be raised by a loan on the property.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Therefore, because Code \u00a7 19.2-159 does not require that real estate be readily convertible into cash, Henry\u2019s second assignment of error fails. Accordingly, we affirm Henry\u2019s convictions for perjury under Code \u00a7 19.2-159 because the record establishes that Henry owned real estate at the time that he signed under oath that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the forgery and uttering convictions and affirm the two perjury convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed and dismissed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">. Although the clerk did not recall Henry\u2019s answers specifically, the clerk testified as to the general procedure followed. Henry does not contest the accuracy of the responses recorded by the clerk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\">. SNAP stands for \"Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\">. Henry was indicted on nineteen counts stemming from six different financial statements. On defense motion, the court struck all the charges except for a forgery, an uttering, and a perjury charge for the May 6, 2011 and January 6, 2012 financial statements. The court concluded that the lack of specific information entered on the \"real estate\u201d line on the other financial statements raised a question as to whether Henry was specifically asked about the real estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. Henry was also convicted for two counts of uttering a forged public record in violation of the same code section. Because we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>his actions did not constitute a forgery, we must, of necessity, reverse Henry's convictions for uttering a forged record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">. We note that a prosecution for forgery under Code \u00a7 18.2-168 does not require proof of prejudice to another's rights. <em>See Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648 (1993) (holding that actual harm or prejudice to the rights of another was not an element of the crime of forgery of public records at English common law or in this Commonwealth).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. In a review of published decisions to date addressing the merits of a forgery charge under Code \u00a7 18.2-168, <em>Rodriquez </em>is the only decision in which a forgery conviction was upheld when the defendant actually signed his own name to the document in question, but, even then, we recognized that the signature was intentionally illegible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">. The Commonwealth entered into evidence at trial the Louisa County Assessor\u2019s Office field data sheet, which established that the home Henry owned had a total assessed value of $156,400. Further, there was testimony that there was no transfer of the property prior to the date of the offenses. Thus, it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that there was sufficient equity in the home to allow Henry to secure a loan against the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
