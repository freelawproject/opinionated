BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Tony Williams (appellant) was found guilty of one count of possession of a Schedule I or II substance with intent to distribute (third offense) in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C). Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that it had venue over the offense on the ground that the evidence did not establish a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the City of Norfolk, the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court. We hold that the trial court did not err when it found that it had venue over the offense, and, accordingly, for the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of a Schedule I or II substance with intent to distribute (third offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We consider the evidence on appeal \u201c \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as we must since it was the prevailing party\u2019 \u201d in the trial court. <em>Beasley v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 381, 391, 728 S.E.2d 499, 504 (2012) (quoting <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004)). In this case, Investigator Issoufou Boubacar of the Norfolk Police Department conducted an undercover drug transaction. When Investigator Boubacar approached appellant at the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street, which Boubacar testified is in the City of Norfolk, he told appellant that he was looking for \u201chard\u201d \u2014 which, according to the investigator\u2019s testimony, is a street name for crack cocaine. Appellant agreed to assist Investigator Boubacar in buying some \u201chard,\u201d and he indicated that the two of them would need to drive to the 800 block of Fremont Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Investigator Boubacar testified that the 800 block of Fremont Street was \u201cover there,\u201d relative to the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street in Norfolk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When appellant and Investigator Boubacar arrived at the 800 block of Fremont Street, appellant asked Investigator Boubacar what quantity of crack cocaine he wanted to buy. Investigator Boubacar told appellant that he was seeking $20 worth of crack cocaine. Investigator Boubacar gave appellant $20, appellant contacted another unnamed individual, and appellant returned to the vehicle and handed Investigator Boubacar two plastic bags of what turned out to be crack cocaine. After appellant handed the crack cocaine to Investigator Boubacar, appellant instructed Investigator Boubacar to drive back to the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street. Upon arriving at the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street, appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, appellant made a motion to strike on two grounds. First, appellant moved to strike on the ground that the City of Norfolk was an improper venue for the trial, arguing that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence never established where the 800 block of Fremont Street is located.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, appellant moved to strike on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to establish a proper chain of custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the venue argument, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court should take judicial notice of the location of the 800 block of Fremont Street, stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable for the Court to take judicial notice that they were still within the City of Norfolk\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>when the drug transaction took place. The trial court overruled both of appellant\u2019s motions at the conclusion of the parties\u2019 arguments, stating, \u201cI overrule the motions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by law, the prosecution of a criminal case shall be had in the county or city in which the offense was committed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-244. \u201cProof of venue \u2018is not a part of the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 459, 469, 658 S.E.2d 708, 712 (2008) (quoting <em>Randall v. Commonwealth, </em>183 Va. 182, 187, 31 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1944)); <em>see also Gheorghiu v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 678, 689, 701 S.E.2d 407, 414 (2010) (explaining that venue, \u201cwhile important to the orderly conduct of litigation, is not a matter affecting the merits of the trial\u201d and that determining the proper venue \u201cis not an element of the crime that must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction\u201d). In order to establish a proper venue, \u201cit is enough that the evidence, direct or circumstantial, raises a \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that the crime occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>51 Va.App. at 469, 658 S.E.2d at 713 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see Pollard v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 723, 725, 261 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1980) (quoting <em>Keesee v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 174, 175, 217 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cJudicial notice permits a court to determine the existence of a fact without formal evidence tending to support that fact.\u201d <em>Scafetta v. Arlington County, </em>13 Va.App. 646, 648, 414 S.E.2d 438, 439 (citations omitted), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g, </em>14 Va.App. 834, 425 S.E.2d 807 (1992); <em>see Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 280, 291, 56 S.E.2d 537, 542 (1949) (describing judicial notice as \u201ca rule of necessity and public policy in the expedition of trials\u201d that avoids \u201cthe formal introduction of evidence in certain cases where there is no need for such evidence\u201d). A trial court may take judicial notice of facts that are either (1) so \u201cgenerally known\u201d within the jurisdiction or (2) so \u201ceasily ascertainable\u201d by reference to reliable sources that reasonably informed people in the community would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>regard them as reasonably subject to dispute. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 1, 7-8, 502 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1998) (citing <em>Ryan v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 445, 247 S.E.2d 698, 703 (1978)). \u201c \u2018The fact of judicial notice must appear from the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 502 S.E.2d at 116 (quoting <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 378, 383, 368 S.E.2d 295, 298 (1988)). It is not necessary, however, that the trial court use the words \u201cjudicial notice.\u201d <em>See id.; see also Dillard v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 340, 347, 504 S.E.2d 411, 414 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Under settled principles of appellate review, this Court must \u201calso accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence\u201d because the Commonwealth prevailed at trial. <em>Riner, </em>268 Va. at 303, 601 S.E.2d at 558. In this case, the record supports the inference that the trial court took judicial notice of the fact that the 800 block of Fremont Street is located within the City of Norfolk. The issue of judicial notice was specifically before the trial court, and, given the nature of the arguments below, the record supports the conclusion that the trial court must have denied appellant\u2019s venue motion on the specific basis of judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s argument in response to appellant\u2019s motion attacking proof of venue was <em>centered </em>on the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that the trial court could take proper judicial notice that the 800 block of Fremont Street referenced by Investigator Boubacar is in the City of Norfolk. The prosecutor supported this argument in part by asserting, based on Investigator Boubacar\u2019s testimony, that the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street is \u201ca relatively short drive\u201d from the 800 block of Fremont Street. Thus, the claim of a tight geographical nexus between the 800 block of Fremont Street and the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street in Norfolk was raised by the Commonwealth to the trial judge, who, of course, presides over cases arising in the City of Norfolk. Appellant\u2019s counsel never objected to this line of argument by the prosecutor and never argued that Fremont Street extended into jurisdictions other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>than Norfolk \u2014 and based on the trial court\u2019s ruling, we may infer on appeal that the trial court accepted it and accorded it significant weight. <em>See Bolden v. Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008) (holding that an appellate court\u2019s examination of the evidence \u201cis not limited\u201d to the evidence or circumstances mentioned \u201cby the trial court in its ruling\u201d); <em>see also West v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 747, 750, 99 S.E. 654, 654-55 (1919) (\u201cThe failure clearly to prove venue is usually due to inadvertence, flowing naturally from the familiarity of court, counsel, witnesses and jurors with the locality of the crime, and appellate courts will generally and properly lay hold of and accept as sufficient any evidence in the case, direct or otherwise, from which the fact may be inferred.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Thus, the circumstances in this case are readily distinguishable from those in <em>Keesee, </em>216 Va. at 174, 217 S.E.2d at 808, another case involving proof of venue and judicial notice. In <em>Keesee, </em>the record proved that the offense occurred on the property of \u201cHill\u2019s Department Store\u201d but did not establish where the department store was located or \u201creveal even the street on which the store is located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 217 S.E.2d at 810; <em>see also Sutherland, </em>6 Va.App. at 380, 368 S.E.2d at 296 (where the victim did not specify in which city or county her residence was located, the victim testified only that she called \u201cthe police,\u201d and police officers from two different counties investigated the charged offense). By contrast, the record here establishes that the offense occurred in the 800 block of Fremont Street and supports the inference that this location was close to the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street \u2014 which no one disputes is in the City of Norfolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Based on the nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument and the trial court\u2019s ruling, the only logical conclusion is that the trial court, in response to the venue challenge, actually took judicial notice that the 800 block of Fremont Street is in Norfolk. This Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 2199-05-2, 2006 WL 3068474, 2006 Va.App. LEXIS 493 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 31, 2006), although contained in an unpublished decision, is instructive here. In <em>Harris, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred in finding the evidence was sufficient to establish venue in Henri-co County. <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2006 Va.App. LEXIS 493 at *1-2. In reversing the trial court\u2019s determination that venue in Henrico County was proper, this Court noted, \u201cNothing in the instant record indicates the trial judge took judicial notice of the location of the [store at issue]. <em>The Commonwealth did not ask the trial judge to take judicial notice, </em>and in resolving the issue of venue, the trial judge merely stated, \u2018I think there\u2019s enough.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2, 2006 Va.App. LEXIS 493 at *7 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In this case, however, the Commonwealth clearly <em>did </em>ask the trial court to take judicial notice of the location of the 800 block of Fremont Street as being in the City of Norfolk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>addition, when overruling appellant\u2019s dual motion to strike, the trial court indicated that it was overruling the motions\u2014 including the motion to strike as to venue, against which the Commonwealth had asked the trial court to take judicial notice of the proper venue. Thus, the trial court considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 appellant\u2019s chain of custody argument <em>and </em>appellant\u2019s venue argument, and it can be safely inferred from the record that the trial court took judicial notice of the location of the 800 block of Fremont Street as being in Norfolk when it overruled the motion challenging venue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In this case the trial court implicitly took judicial notice of the fact that the 800 block of Fremont Street is located within the City of Norfolk, as the Commonwealth had requested it to do in response to appellant\u2019s motion claiming that Norfolk was not the proper venue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the required strong presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tion that the offense occurred in Norfolk has been established. The trial court did not err in convicting appellant of possession of a Schedule I or II substance with intent to distribute, and, accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-5\">. During his testimony, Investigator Boubacar indicated that the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street was \u201cin the City of Norfolk.\u201d Investigator Boubacar did not indicate \u2014 and the Commonwealth did not attempt to elicit \u2014 where the 800 block of Fremont Street was located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\">. The issue of venue is properly raised by a motion to dismiss the indictment, rather than a motion to strike the evidence. <em>Kelso v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 30, 36 n. 4, 698 S.E.2d 263, 266 n. 4 (2010). Nonetheless, the Commonwealth has not argued on appeal that appellant was required to challenge venue with a motion to dismiss the indictment rather than a motion to strike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">. The chain of custody argument is not before this Court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. Here, the prosecutor <em>specifically </em>asked the trial court \"to take judicial notice that they [appellant and Investigator Boubacar] were still within the City of Norfolk\u201d when the charged offense was committed. Given the specific nature of the prosecutor\u2019s request here, the outcome of this appeal certainly is not controlled by the decision in <em>Edmonds v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 197, 597 S.E.2d 210 (2004), which involved very different circumstances. In <em>Edmonds, </em>the defendant was charged with failing to appear at a court hearing. In response to the defendant's motion to strike asserting that there was no proof that the defendant had received notice of the prior hearing, the Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney asserted that the trial court \"can take judicial notice of its records at any time\u201d \u2014 without indicating <em>what specific facts </em>the Commonwealth wanted to be judicially noticed. The trial court summarily denied the motion to strike without making any findings. <em>Id. </em>at 199-202, 597 S.E.2d at 211-12. On appeal, this Court reversed the conviction, holding, \"Here, although the arguments of both parties establish that the issue of judicial notice was before the court, no statement of the trial court clearly demonstrates that it took judicial notice of the fact sought to be proved, <em>i.e. the date and time of the hearing.\u201d Id. </em>at 202, 597 S.E.2d at 212 (emphasis added). In support of that conclusion, this Court explained that a trial court\u2019s need \"to identify the fact it is noticing is 'particularly necessary\u2019 \u201d when a document \" 'from which any number of distinct facts might be drawn, is the object of the notice.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 597 S.E.2d at 213 (quoting <em>Colonial Leasing Co. v. Logistics Control Group International, </em>762 F.2d 454, 459 (5th Cir.1985)). By contrast, there is no ambiguity here pertaining to the specific fact that the prosecutor sought to have established (i.e., the location of the 800 block of Fremont Street as being in Norfolk) through the trial court\u2019s authority to take judicial notice of that same fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. We note also that the following factors establish a strong presumption that the offense in this case was committed in the City of Norfolk: the offense began in Norfolk in the 1700 block of O'Keefe Street; Investigator Boubacar of the Norfolk Police Department indicated that he and appellant went \"over there\u201d from the 1700 block of O\u2019Keefe Street to the 800 block of Fremont Street; and appellant was arrested in the City of Norfolk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">. Although we need not address the point in great detail, we too have the discretionary power to take judicial notice of the official municipal street maps of the City of Norfolk. <em>See generally </em>Charles E. Friend &amp; Kent Sinclair, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 3-7, at 204 (7th ed. 2012) (\"The general Virginia doctrine is that judicial notice may be taken at any stage of the proceedings, whether in trial court or on appeal.\u201d). <em>See, e.g., Buttery v. Robbins, 177 </em>Va. 368, 374, 14 S.E.2d 544, 546 (1941) (The Virginia Supreme Court took judicial notice \u2014 for the first time in the litigation of the case \u2014 of the fact that \"Skyline Drive is in the Shenandoah National Park\u201d because \"[t]hat is a matter of common knowledge, known to everybody else.
