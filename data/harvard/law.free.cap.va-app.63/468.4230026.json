Wroblewski, formerly Karen A. Russell (wife) and Steven T. Russell (husband) appeal a final order of divorce. Wife argues the trial court erred by (1) awarding her spousal support for a limited period of time when she clearly established her ongoing need for, and the ability of husband to pay, spousal support; (2) awarding her spousal support in tapering amounts without evidence that, in the future, her need for support would diminish or that husband\u2019s ability to pay would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201creasonably likely ... be impaired\u201d; (3) entering the final order of divorce and denying her motion for reconsideration in violation of the United States Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Order of Stay; (4) awarding spousal support when factor 8 of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) could not be determined pending resolution of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition; (5) refusing to grant her motion for continuance when her counsel withdrew and in light of her inability to retain new counsel absent the continuance; (6) considering her marital history in determining the equitable distribution and spousal support awards since her prior marriages were not relevant to a determination of her financial assets or ability to support herself; (7) ordering her, in violation of her right to file taxes as \u201cmarried filing separately,\u201d to pay $30,000 of the nearly $300,000 income tax debt that husband incurred by failing to timely file his income tax returns; and (8) awarding husband all the retirement funds earned during the course of the marriage. Husband argues the trial court erred by (1) awarding spousal support to wife after granting his motion to strike wife\u2019s complaint for divorce because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to make such an award in the absence of a valid pleading before the trial court; and (2) ordering him to pay wife\u2019s health insurance premiums in the absence of either a statutory or jurisdictional basis for the entry of such award. We reverse on the issue of spousal support and otherwise affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Husband and wife married on April 29, 2000 and separated on January 2, 2010. On May 2, 2011, wife filed a complaint for divorce and requested, in part, \u201csupport and maintenance, <em>pendente lite, </em>as well as permanent periodic support and maintenance, lump-sum support, and/or a reservation to petition for same <em>in futuro, </em>pursuant to Section 20-107.1 of the Code.\u201d Husband filed an answer and counterclaim, to which wife responded. Wife\u2019s answer to husband\u2019s counterclaim did not include a request for spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>On September 12, 2011, the trial court awarded wife <em>pendente lite </em>spousal support of $20,625 per month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In January 2012, wife filed for bankruptcy protection, necessitating a continuance of the case. Husband filed a motion for relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay. On May 17, 2012, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered an order holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">The divorce proceeding is stayed to the extent that the divorce proceeding seeks to determine the division of property that is property of the bankruptcy estate. This does not prevent an equitable distribution hearing (including all state court matters leading up to such hearing) or order considering or taking into account property that is property of the estate in a monetary award. However, property of the bankruptcy estate may not be ordered to be transferred, conveyed, encumbered or otherwise affected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Wife sought a continuance on June 25, 2012, which the court denied on July 25, 2012. On the eve of trial, on July 30, 2012, wife filed an emergency motion for a continuance. She alleged she had checked herself into the psychiatric unit of a hospital and that she was not presently mentally competent to participate in a judicial proceeding. The court continued the case, although it later learned that wife had checked herself out on July 31, the day after the continuance was granted. The court later granted wife another continuance due to the illness of her attorney. That same counsel withdrew on November 20, 2012 as a result of the illness. At that point, trial was scheduled to begin on February 1 and 4, 2013. On January 7, 2013, acting <em>pro se, </em>wife sought another continuance to find substitute counsel. After it was denied, she renewed it again at trial. In denying the motion, the court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">The subject proceeding had fully matured for adjudication by July of 2012. The nature of the second continuance Motion and the questionable credibility of the Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>through later disclosed facts gave this Court great cause for concern. It appeared at that time that the Wife was using any mechanism possible to stay the proceedings. The Husband claimed the Wife was motivated to delay trial adjudication due to the substantial <em>pendente lite </em>support she was receiving. Hence, when she made additional continuance motions thereafter, the Court considered delay to be an ulterior motive of the Wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Wife represented that \u201cif given more time,\u201d she would obtain counsel. \u201cIn light of her previous delays,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cher representations had doubtful credibility. After nearly two years, the Husband was entitled to have his case adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">At the conclusion of wife\u2019s evidence at trial, husband made a motion to strike wife\u2019s complaint for divorce because she failed to corroborate her grounds for divorce. Husband further argued that, if the trial court were to grant his motion to strike wife\u2019s complaint, then it should likewise strike wife\u2019s request for spousal support. The trial court granted husband\u2019s motion to strike wife\u2019s bill of complaint but declined to strike wife\u2019s request for spousal support, stating, \u201cAs to whether or not the claim for spousal support could remain alive after granting the motion to strike, I\u2019m just going to take that portion of the case under advisement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">On February 26, 2018, the trial court issued its letter opinion. Under the subsection titled \u201cDivorce,\u201d the trial court stated that wife failed to offer any evidence to support entry of a final decree of divorce in her favor and, \u201c[a]s a result, her complaint was dismissed on a Motion to Strike the Evidence.\u201d Instead, husband was granted a no-fault divorce based on his counterclaim. Under the letter\u2019s subsection titled, \u201cSupport,\u201d the trial court found, among other things, that wife had requested spousal support in her complaint, that she had been receiving <em>pendente lite </em>spousal support, and that it would consider wife\u2019s request for spousal support because it had been raised as an issue. Referencing the legal reasoning underlying its decision to award wife spousal support, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>judge specifically noted that \u201c[njeither case law nor the applicable statute requirefs] the <em>prevailing </em>party to raise the issue in its pleadings, only that at least one of the parties raise the support issue to allow the subject to be adjudicated.\u201d (emphasis in original). After considering the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E), the trial court awarded spousal support to wife such that she received $5,000 per month for twelve months, $3,000 per month for the following twelve months, and $1,500 per month for twelve months thereafter. It further ordered husband to pay wife\u2019s health insurance premiums for a period of eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In addition, the trial court considered the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.3, and determined that the former marital residence was in foreclosure, awarded wife the Florida condominium in which her mother had a life estate, awarded husband his Morgan Stanley Brokerage account and stock options, awarded wife her bank accounts, and divided the personal property and vehicles. The trial court also held that husband was responsible for his Morgan Stanley loans and ordered wife to reimburse husband $30,000 for the IRS tax debt he had incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Wife filed objections to husband\u2019s proposed final decree and filed an alternative final decree. On June 17, 2013, the trial court issued a letter opinion stating that it had considered her objections, but denied them. The trial court entered a final order of divorce on June 18, 2013. Wife filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied. Each party filed objections to the final order of divorce. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\"><em>I. Spousal support </em>\u2014 Husband\u2019s <em>first assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Husband argues that a written demand for spousal support is a necessary precondition for the award of such support. Once the trial court struck the only pleading that contained wife\u2019s demand for spousal support, he contends, the court could no longer proceed to award her any spousal support. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Consequently, it was error for the court to do so. Wife argues that the trial court, acting with the powers of a court of equity, could still award wife support notwithstanding the fact that the court struck the one pleading that contained her demand for spousal support. We agree with husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We review this question of law <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Harrell v. Harrell, </em>272 Va. 652, 656, 636 S.E.2d 391, 393 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u201c \u2018Fundamental rules of pleading provide that no court can base its judgment or decree upon a right which has not been pleaded and claimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fadness v. Fadness, </em>52 Va.App. 833, 843, 667 S.E.2d 857, 862 (2008) (quoting <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>2 Va.App. 16, 18, 340 S.E.2d 578, 580 (1986)). \u201c \u2018Pleadings are as essential as proof, the one being unavailing without the other. A decree can not be entered in the absence of pleadings upon which to found the same, and if so entered it is void.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Potts v. Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 207, 181 S.E. 521, 525 (1935)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Here, wife initially made a written demand for spousal support. The trial court, however, granted husband\u2019s motion to <em>strike that pleading. </em>Striking a pleading has the effect of withdrawing any claims rooted in that pleading from consideration by the court \u2014 just as striking testimony removes that testimony from consideration by the factfinder, or striking a member of the venire removes that individual from the jury pool. Rule 1:11, which governs motions to strike the evidence in jury trials, is consistent with this understanding. It provides that once a trial court has granted a motion to strike the evidence, \u201cthen the court shall enter summary judgment or partial summary judgment in conformity with its ruling on the motion to strike.\u201d <em>See also Costner v. Lackey, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>223 Va. 377, 381, 290 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1982) (\u201cA motion to strike is in effect a motion for summary judgment....\u201d). A claim that is grounded upon a stricken pleading does not linger on in spectral form before the court \u2014 it is interred and removed from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Harrell </em>is controlling. In that case, wife alleged as her ground of divorce the fact that she had lived separate and apart from her husband for more than one year. Her complaint included a request for spousal support. 272 Va. at 656, 636 S.E.2d at 394. In fact, she had not lived separate and apart from her husband for the required period, and the trial court dismissed her complaint accordingly. The Supreme Court held that, because separation for one year must be proved to have occurred before the suit was filed, wife failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he trial court <em>had subject matter jurisdiction </em>over the divorce; however, <em>inadequate grounds </em>were alleged in the bill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656-57, 636 S.E.2d at 394 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that \u201cthe request for spousal support contained in the bill of complaint abated with its dismissal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 636 S.E.2d at 394. Wife in <em>Harrell </em>also attempted to file an amended complaint, which included a request for spousal support, but she did not obtain leave of court. The trial court dismissed the amended complaint for that reason. Again, the Court held, \u201c[h]er request for spousal support therein abated with the dismissal of the amended bill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, there was no valid pleading before the court asking for spousal support. \u201cWithout such a pleading, it was error for the trial court to grant [wife] a reservation of spousal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 636 S.E.2d at 395. Likewise here, wife\u2019s request for spousal support abated with the dismissal of her complaint and it was error for the trial court to award spousal support without any pleading at all before the court making the request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Although, by statute, upon decreeing a divorce \u201cthe court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the maintenance and support of the spouses,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(A), we have long held that \u201cthe exercise of such power remains dependent upon the pleadings having raised the issue.\u201d <em>Boyd, </em>2 Va.App. at 19, 340 S.E.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Finally, precedent does not support the notion of an extra-statutory reservoir of authority for courts to draw from in divorce cases that would enable a court to grant relief based on a stricken pleading. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Reid v. Reid, </em>245 Va. 409, 413, 429 S.E.2d 208, 210 (1993) (citations and quotation marks omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">A suit for divorce ... does not involve an appeal to the general jurisdiction of the equity forum. The many limitations, both in respect to jurisdiction and procedure, placed upon divorce suits by the statute, differentiate the divorce case from ordinary suits in equity and render it a chancery case sui generis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In <em>Reid, </em>the Court found that the trial court lacked the authority to order repayment \u2014 a power ordinarily available to a court in equity \u2014 because the jurisdiction of a court of equity is \u201c \u2018entirely statutory and limited\u2019 \u201d in divorce matters. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 429 S.E.2d at 211 (citation omitted); <em>see also Sprouse v. Griffin, </em>250 Va. 46, 50, 458 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1995) (\u201c[Jurisdiction in divorce suits is purely statutory.\u201d). Even in a court of equity, \u201cany relief granted must be supported by allegations of material facts in the pleadings that will sustain such relief.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Bay House Assocs., </em>266 Va. 39, 45, 581 S.E.2d 510, 513 (2003) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The principal case wife relies upon for her assertion of a broad, common law based equity power, <em>Gloth v. Gloth, </em>154 Va. 511, 153 S.E. 879 (1930), does not support her position. In that case, the Supreme Court resolved the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A40\">When alimony is awarded to a wife in a decree granting to her a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>from her husband, may the amount thereof be thereafter changed or modified by the court to meet changed conditions of the parties subsequently arising, or the decree, in so far as it provides for future payments of alimony, be revoked because of the adultery or other misconduct of the wife committed after entry of the said decree?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 532, 153 S.E. at 885. The Court answered that question in the affirmative. The Court examined the history of the law of divorce in England and in Virginia, as well as the distinction that predated statutory enactments between the recognized common law power of a court to order changes to alimony in cases of divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>following entry of the decree, and the absence of a common law power to order changes to the decree with respect to alimony in cases of divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii. Gloth </em>says nothing about the power of a court to award spousal support in the absence of a pleading requesting the same. To the extent <em>Gloth </em>is relevant at all, it undermines wife\u2019s assertion of a vast common law power in cases of divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>by making clear that no such broad power existed. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 153 S.E. at 886. The other cases wife cites do not shed any light on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>issue before us. Neither <em>Upchurch v. Upchurch, </em>194 Va. 990, 76 S.E.2d 170 (1953), nor <em>Hughes v. Hughes, </em>173 Va. 293, 4 S.E.2d 402 (1939), address the question of whether a valid pleading is required as a prerequisite for the award of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">With <em>no </em>pleading requesting spousal support before the court at the time of the award, the trial court could not award such relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court awarding wife spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">This holding renders moot wife\u2019s first, second, fourth, and part of her sixth assignments of error, which turn on the court\u2019s handling of the issue of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><em>II. Health insurance </em>\u2014 Husband\u2019s <em>second assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Husband argues that the trial court erred by ordering him to pay wife\u2019s health insurance premiums for eighteen months after the entry of the final decree of divorce, in the absence of statutory authority to do so. Our reading of the relevant statutes is to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">This issue presents a question of statutory interpretation, a matter we review <em>de novo. Anthony v. Skolnick-Lozano, </em>63 Va.App. 76, 83, 754 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Although no statutory provision expressly confers on trial courts the power to order a spouse to pay for the health insurance of the divorcing spouse, the Code evinces an unmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>takable legislative intent to permit trial courts to enter such an order. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(0) states that \u201cIn any proceeding under this title [i.e., Title 20] on the issue of determining child support, the court shall have the authority to order either party or both parties to provide ... health care coverage for a spouse or former spouse.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Furthermore, and consistently with the language in Code \u00a7 20-108.1(C), Code \u00a7 20-60.3(8), which addresses orders \u201cdirecting the payment of spousal support where there are minor children whom the parties have a mutual duty to support and all orders directing the payment of child support,\u201d requires among other things \u201ca statement as to whether there is an order for health care coverage for a spouse or former spouse.\u201d This provision further signals the General Assembly\u2019s intent to grant authority to the trial court to make such an award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The General Assembly thus recognized the power of the trial court to enter such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Husband relies on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Lassen v. Lassen, </em>8 Va.App. 502, 506, 383 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1989), and <em>Day v. Day, </em>8 Va.App. 346, 348-49, 381 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1989) (citation omitted), to support his arguments. His reliance on these decisions is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The issue wife raised in <em>Lassen </em>was whether the trial court was <em>required </em>to order husband to pay her insurance premiums. The trial court had declined to order husband to pay his prior wife\u2019s health insurance coverage in addition to spousal support, and we affirmed, finding the statute did not require such an award. <em>Lassen, </em>8 Va.App. at 506, 383 S.E.2d at 473 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>(\u201cThere is no statutory <em>mandate </em>that health care coverage be provided____\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, the decision not to order a party to maintain health insurance coverage for a former spouse was within the discretionary power of the court, subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In addition, the holding in <em>Day </em>is inapposite. In <em>Day, </em>the Court did not address whether health insurance coverage was properly made part of the court\u2019s spousal support award. Instead, it reversed a trial court\u2019s ruling that the husband should make payments on the marital debt directly to the creditors, finding the trial court lacked authority to order such payments. <em>Day, </em>8 Va.App. at 349, 381 S.E.2d at 366. The facts in <em>Day </em>do not correlate with the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">We find the trial court committed no error of law in ordering husband to pay the monthly premiums for wife\u2019s health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\"><em>III. Bankruptcy </em>\u2014 Wife\u2019s <em>third and fourth assignments of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Wife argues that the trial court violated the order of stay issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court when it entered the final decree of divorce. She contends the trial court erred in awarding husband his 401 (k) and unvested bonuses. She also asserts that, since the trial court erred by entering the equitable distribution award, it could not award spousal support because Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(8) requires courts determining such support to consider the equitable distribution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Wife filed for bankruptcy in January 2012. She subsequently requested the final hearing be continued pending the bankruptcy proceeding. The trial court granted the continuance and rescheduled the final hearing. Meanwhile, husband sought and received relief from the automatic stay, pursuant to his motion in the bankruptcy court. On May 17, 2012, the bankruptcy court entered an order lifting the automatic stay with the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The divorce proceeding is stayed to the extent that the divorce proceeding seeks to determine the division of property that is property of the bankruptcy estate. This does not prevent an equitable distribution hearing (including all state court matters leading up to such hearing) or order considering or taking into account property that is property of the estate in a monetary award. However, property of the bankruptcy estate may not be ordered to be transferred, conveyed, encumbered or otherwise affected. Property heretofore or hereafter abandoned by the Chapter 7 trustee is not property of the estate and is not subject to this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">On May 13, 2013, the bankruptcy trustee prepared a Notice of Intent to Abandon Property, which wife later filed with the trial court. The notice indicated that the trustee was abandoning its interest in \u201cthe real and personal property listed on [wife\u2019s] schedules A and B, as amended,\u201d except for the Florida condominium, her diamonds, the escrow held by her former divorce attorney, and her contingent claims for one-.half interest in husband\u2019s 401 (k) and his unvested bonuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On June 17, 2013, following a hearing, the trial court issued a letter opinion after receiving wife\u2019s objections to the entry of the final decree. The trial court held that it was free to distribute the property that was abandoned by the trustee. With respect to the property that was not abandoned, the trial court noted that the Florida condominium was subject to a life estate and that the bankruptcy trustee might make a \u201cpotential claim\u201d against the property. Husband had agreed to transfer the property to wife, and the trial court directed husband to \u201crefrain from conveying the real estate in Florida to the [w]ife until the Bankruptcy Court makes a determination as to this real property.\u201d Therefore, the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution award affected neither the Florida property nor wife\u2019s bankruptcy. The trial court assigned no value to wife\u2019s diamonds (which it had determined were her separate property) as it lacked evidence of their value. The trial court took \u201cno position\u201d on the escrow monies held by wife\u2019s former divorce attorney. Lastly, the trial court stated that it did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>award wife any interest in husband\u2019s 401(k) or bonuses because \u201cthe [w]ife had no interest in these accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Wife\u2019s argument that the trial court exceeded its authority by issuing its ruling and entering the final decree on June 18, 2013, before the bankruptcy proceedings were completed, is thus without merit. The bankruptcy court has ruled previously that \u201c[t]he state court may proceed with an equitable distribution hearing as long as it does not involve distribution of property of the [bankruptcy] estate.\u201d <em>Secrest v. Secrest (In re Secrest), </em>453 B.R. 623, 632 (Bankr.E.D.Va.2011). The trial court classified the 401 (k) and the bonuses as husband\u2019s property. Wife does not challenge the trial court\u2019s classification of these assets. The trial court\u2019s equitable distribution ruling therefore did not distribute any property of wife\u2019s bankruptcy estate, so it did not violate the stay.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>IV. Motion for continuance </em>\u2014 Wife\u2019s <em>fifth assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Wife argues the trial court erred when it denied a continuance, to her prejudice, after her attorney withdrew from the case for medical reasons. Wife claims that, because she had to proceed without counsel as a result of the court\u2019s ruling, her spousal support and equitable distribution awards were adversely affected, as was her ability to present the proof required to establish her fault grounds for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Originally, the final hearing was scheduled for April 18 and 19, 2012. On March 12, 2012, wife filed a \u201cMotion to Stay the April Proceedings\u201d because she had voluntarily filed for bankruptcy in January 2012. The trial court rescheduled the final hearing for July 31 and August 1, 2012. On June 25, 2012, wife requested another continuance because the bankruptcy matter was not yet resolved. The trial court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>continuance because, as noted above, husband had obtained an order from the bankruptcy court allowing the divorce proceeding to continue. On July 30, 2012, wife requested another continuance because she had checked herself in to a psychiatric hospital. The trial court granted the continuance and rescheduled the final hearing for December 5, 2012. On October 26, 2012, wife sought another continuance, this one due to medical problems her counsel was experiencing. The trial court granted the continuance and rescheduled the matter for February 1 and 4, 2013. Subsequently, wife\u2019s attorney asked to withdraw as counsel due to the ongoing medical issues. On November 20, 2012, the trial court entered an order allowing wife\u2019s counsel to withdraw. New counsel was not substituted. On January 7, 2013, wife filed another motion for a continuance in order to retain counsel. The trial court denied the motion, and the final hearing was conducted on February 1 and 4, 2013. Wife again asked for a continuance at the outset of trial, and when the trial court denied her request, she proceeded <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u201cThe circuit court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a continuance will be rejected on appeal only upon a showing of abuse of discretion <em>and </em>resulting prejudice to the movant.\u201d <em>Haugen v. Shenandoah Valley Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>274 Va. 27, 34, 645 S.E.2d 261, 265 (2007) (emphasis in original). We review the decision \u201cin view of the circumstances unique to each case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The trial court explained in its letter opinion that the matter had been continued on wife\u2019s motions three previous times. The trial court observed that wife\u2019s counsel withdrew over two months prior to the final hearing, but that wife did not retain new counsel during that time period. Wife claimed that she needed more time to obtain counsel, but also stated that she did not have sufficient funds to retain counsel \u2014 despite receiving $10,000 per month in <em>pendente lite </em>support at that point. The trial court denied the request because \u201cher representations had doubtful credibility\u201d and \u201c[ajfter nearly two years, the [hjusband was entitled to have his case adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Based on the numerous continuances already granted and husband\u2019s right to have the matter heard, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying wife\u2019s request for yet another continuance. She had adequate time to retain counsel prior to the February hearing, but did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Since we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying wife\u2019s request for a continuance, we need not address whether wife was prejudiced by the denial of her motion. <em>See Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 285, 290, 640 S.E.2d 526, 529 (2007) (explaining that a party needs to show abuse of discretion <em>and </em>resulting prejudice because \u201c[t]he absence of one renders inconsequential the presence of the other\u201d (citing <em>Lowery v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 304, 307, 387 S.E.2d 508, 509-10 (1990))); <em>see also Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 565, 680 S.E.2d 361, 365 (2009). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying wife\u2019s continuance request.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\"><em>V. Mention of Wife\u2019s prior </em>marriages\u2014 <em>Wife\u2019s sixth assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Wife argues that the trial court improperly considered her prior marriages, both in awarding spousal support and in fashioning the equitable distribution award. Our holding with respect to the court\u2019s award of spousal support makes this assignment of error partially moot. Under the \u201csupport\u201d heading of its letter opinion, the trial court wrote that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">Mrs. Russell is nearly 60 years old and has not earned any significant income in many years. Thus she has a great need for support. However, this is her fifth marriage and she has been in situations before where she needed to support herself without a husband\u2019s financial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUT\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(9) requires the court to consider each spouse\u2019s \u201cearning capacity.\u201d In context, it is clear the trial court wrote this portion of its letter opinion as part of its assessment of wife\u2019s ability to support herself. Wife stated at trial that \u201cI\u2019ve been married five times. I\u2019ve been self-employed since high school. Along the way, I\u2019ve held real jobs.... Despite my four previous marriages, I have spent most of my productive life as a single woman and mother.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>There is no evidence, however, that wife\u2019s prior marriages entered into the court\u2019s equitable distribution calculus. We conclude that wife\u2019s argument of an improper consideration by the court of her prior marriages is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><em>VI. Debt </em>\u2014 Wife\u2019s <em>seventh assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Wife argues that the trial court erred in ordering her to reimburse husband $30,000 for his payment of the joint tax liability. She contends that the debt was the result of husband\u2019s failure to timely file his tax returns and that she had the right to file \u201cmarried filing separately.\u201d We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The parties did not file income tax returns for 2005 through 2008. Wife refused to file the tax returns jointly, and instead she filed the returns for those years separately in May 2009. The deadline for filing the 2009 taxes occurred after the parties separated on January 2, 2010, so wife would not agree to file jointly for 2009. She also refused to file jointly for 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">On appeal, \u201cdecisions concerning equitable distribution rest within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 407-08, 451 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1994) (citing <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A), the trial court \u201cshall determine the nature of all debts of the parties, or either of them, and shall consider which of such debts is separate debt and which is marital debt.\u201d The trial court found that there was a tax liability of approximately $300,000 for the time period of 2006 through 2010. The tax liability was found to be a marital debt, which has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Marital debt is (i) all debt incurred in the joint names of the parties before the date of the last separation of the parties, if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intends that the separation be permanent, whether incurred before or after the date of the marriage, and (ii) all debt incurred in either party\u2019s name after the date of the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>riage and before the date of the last separation of the parties, if at such time or thereafter at least one of the parties intends that the separation be permanent. However, to the extent that a party can show by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt, or a portion thereof, was incurred, or the proceeds secured by incurring the debt were used, in whole or in part, for a nonmarital purpose, the court may designate the entire debt as separate or a portion of the debt as marital and a portion of the debt as separate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT1\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Contrary to wife\u2019s argument, the tax debt was incurred during the marriage for a marital purpose. Wife benefitted from husband\u2019s income and assets during the marriage. She also presented no evidence that the tax debt was incurred, or that the proceeds secured by incurring it were used, for a non-marital purpose. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the tax liability was a marital debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">When wife chose to file her tax return separately, it resulted in an increase in the joint tax liability. Husband presented evidence from a certified public accountant (CPA) who analyzed husband\u2019s tax returns from 2006 through 2009. She calculated the difference in husband\u2019s tax liability that resulted from filing the return separately rather than jointly. She testified that, overall, the parties would have saved approximately $92,400 had they filed jointly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In deciding equitable distribution, the trial court must consider the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E), including factor 7\u2014 \u201cThe debts and liabilities of each spouse, the basis for such debts and liabilities, and the property which may serve as security for such debts and liabilities.\u201d Here, the trial court considered the debt and the basis for the debt. It also considered wife\u2019s ability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The fact that a spouse has the right under federal law to file separately does not in any way foreclose a state court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>in the context of adjudicating a divorce, from considering the deleterious effect of this decision on the marriage. Wife has cited no authority to this effect, and we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Based on the record, we conclude the trial court did not err in holding that wife is responsible for $30,000 of the tax liability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"><em>VII. Retirement funds </em>\u2014 Wife\u2019s <em>eighth assignment of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Wife listed as her eighth assignment of error that the trial court erred in awarding husband \u201call of the retirement funds earned during the course of the marriage between the parties.\u201d Wife did not present any argument on this issue; therefore, it is waived and will not be considered on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e). \u201c[W]hen a party\u2019s \u2018failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Rule 5A:20(e) is significant\u2019, \u2018the Court of Appeals may ... treat a question presented as waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parks v.

O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996).

Both the trial court and the Supreme Court accepted the trial court\u2019s authority to adjudicate the parties\u2019 divorce. Instead, as in this case, the outcome in <em>Harrell </em>was driven by the absence of a valid request for spousal support in the pleadings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">.

Wife could have moved to amend her answer to husband\u2019s cross-bill to include a demand for spousal support. We note that, ordinarily, leave to amend should be \"liberally granted.\u201d Rule 1:8. Here, wife did not move to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-12\">. An order directing one spouse in a divorce to pay the health insurance premiums of the other spouse is best conceptualized as a component part of the maintenance and support of the spouse receiving the premiums. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1. Husband does not anywhere contend that the voiding of the spousal support award necessarily drags down with it the health insurance premiums. Instead, he argues that there is no statutory or jurisdictional basis for the award. Accordingly, we treat these two issues as analytically distinct for purposes of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">In any proceeding under this title, Title 16.1, or Title 63.2 on the issue of determining child support, the court shall have the authority to order either party or both parties to provide health care coverage or cash medical support, as defined in \u00a7 63.2-1900, or both, for dependent children if reasonable under all the circumstances and health care coverage for a spouse or former spouse.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">.

I respectfully dissent, however, with regard to part I. On appeal, husband argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction to award wife spousal support. Relying on the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Harrell v. Harrell, </em>272 Va. 652, 636 S.E.2d 391 (2006), husband contends that a valid pleading requesting spousal support was not before the court for adjudication after the trial court dismissed wife\u2019s bill of complaint. I believe <em>Harrell </em>is distinguishable, both factually and legally, and I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In <em>Harrell, </em>the wife\u2019s pleading for divorce and support was dismissed because it was not legally effective, having failed to satisfy the statutory criteria required to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). <em>Id. </em>at 654-55, 636 S.E.2d at 393. Specifically, although the wife in <em>Harrell </em>alleged she had been separated from her husband \u201cwithout interruption for one year,\u201d she failed to prove that requisite jurisdictional fact. <em>Id. </em>at 656, 636 S.E.2d at 394. In short, the wife in <em>Harrell </em>had failed to establish a cause of action for divorce. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c \u2018[t]he act relied upon for divorce must be alleged and proved to have occurred prior to the bringing of the suit\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Beckner v. Beckner, </em>204 Va. 580, 583, 132 S.E.2d 715, 717-18 (1963))). Absent compliance with the \u201cmode of acquiring and exercising [the] jurisdiction ... upon which it is conferred ... by statute, ... the proceeding will be a nullity.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Virginia Stave &amp; Heading Co., </em>112 Va. 61, 75, 70 S.E. 545, 549 (1911) (citations omitted). <em>See also Smith v.

Presented thus with a null proceeding, the Supreme Court of Virginia dismissed Ms. Harrell\u2019s bill of complaint for failure to satisfy the statute\u2019s jurisdictional requirements. <em>Harrell, </em>272 Va. at 657, 636 S.E.2d at 394.

Moreover, the trial court expressly exempted wife\u2019s pleading for spousal support from its ruling, as demonstrated by the court\u2019s statements in the record and by its taking the support issue and the evidence admitted on the issue under advisement for further deliberation and adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The statutory requirements for the court\u2019s jurisdiction to adjudicate spousal support having been met, I would find wife\u2019s pleading, under these facts, continued unaffected by the dismissal of her pleadings for divorce. <em>See, e.g., Rochelle v. Rochelle, </em>225 Va. 387, 391, 302 S.E.2d 59, 62 (1983) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>court\u2019s jurisdiction, once properly invoked, is not lost because a part of the claim on which it was based is later found to lack merit.\u201d). <em>See also Erickson-Dickson v.

I would find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Considering this opinion, I would not find that wife\u2019s first, second, fourth, and part of her sixth assignments of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>would be moot. However, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The trial court awarded wife spousal support as follows: $5,000 per month for twelve months, $8,000 per month for the following twelve months, and then $1,500 per month for twelve months thereafter. Wife argues that the trial court erred by-awarding her spousal support for a limited time and in tapering amounts. She contends her need for spousal support is not going to decrease over time, and husband has the ability to pay. She also asserts the trial court erred when it considered her marital history in fashioning a spousal support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing a spousal support award, we are mindful that the trial court has broad discretion in awarding and fixing the amount of spousal support.

Cox, </em>44 Va.App. 674, 679, 607 S.E.2d 126, 128 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In order to establish a foundation for a spousal support award, a trial court must consider the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E). However, it is not \u201crequired to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Woolley v. Woolley, </em>3 Va.App. 337, 345, 349 S.E.2d 422, 426 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">To determine the wife\u2019s need in this case, the trial court reviewed the statutory factors and found that the parties \u201cestablished a very high, if not wasteful, standard of living during their marriage.\u201d However, the court considered the standard one that \u201ccould not continue to be maintained.\u201d Some of wife\u2019s expenses were found to be \u201cunrealistic or inflated.\u201d The court further noted that wife had \u201cfew remaining legally enforceable obligations, compared to the husband,\u201d as a result of her bankruptcy filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">By inference, the court concluded wife would be able to earn income and support herself in the future. Wife had asserted in testimony she \u201chad business skills and the ability to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>herself,\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the court considered testimony from husband\u2019s vocational expert that wife was capable of working, whether for an employer or self-employed, and that she could earn between $25,000 and $40,000, depending on her experience. The court further noted that wife \u201chad been in situations before where she needed to support herself without a husband\u2019s financial assistance,\u201d this marriage being her fifth.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, the trial court also weighed evidence to the contrary and found that wife had not earned \u201cany significant income\u201d in several years, had health complaints, and was nearly sixty years of age. Accordingly, the court concluded that wife had established a \u201cgreat\u201d need for support, but that she would be able to support herself in time. Husband\u2019s ability to pay was established by the evidence of the high income he earned, but the court concluded \u201cit would be unreasonable to require a lengthy period of significant spousal support,\u201d in light of husband\u2019s burden, imposed by the court, to pay the marital debt and in light of the significant spousal support husband had paid <em>pendente lite. </em>I cannot conclude that the premises upon which the court made its spousal support award of limited duration \u201care sufficiently uncertain to render the defined duration award speculative\u201d and improper. <em>Torian v. Torian, </em>38 Va.App. 167, 185, 562 S.E.2d 355, 364 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Lastly, wife argues on appeal that the evidence failed to establish her need for spousal support or that husband\u2019s ability to pay would decrease in the future. As we pointed out in <em>Torian, </em>such \u201cpossibilities [are] inherent in many spousal support situations,\u201d and they were contemplated by the Virgi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>nia legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 184-85, 562 S.E.2d at 364. Nonetheless, \u201cthe legislature decided that defined duration awards are appropriate in at least some of these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 562 S.E.2d at 364; <em>see also Bruemmer v. Bruemmer, </em>46 Va.App. 205, 616 S.E.2d 740 (2005) (the Court upheld a trial court\u2019s tapering, defined duration spousal support award).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Based on the foregoing, I would conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding a defined duration spousal support award that decreased in the amount over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Furthermore, since I agree with the majority that the trial court did not violate the bankruptcy order when the trial court issued its equitable distribution ruling, I would find that the trial court did not err in determining spousal support. It considered all the factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E), including factor 8 regarding equitable distribution, when it determined the amount and duration of spousal support.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">. Ms. Harrell's amended bill of complaint was dismissed because she did not seek leave of court to file an amended pleading, as required by Rule 1:8. <em>Harrell, </em>272 Va. at 657, 636 S.E.2d at 394. She filed a motion for <em>pendente lite </em>relief, but that motion was insufficient for a permanent spousal support award pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.1. <em>Id. </em>She also filed an \"omnibus motion\" and requested that her amended bill of complaint be considered an answer to the cross-bill and that all of her previous pleadings be considered for a permanent spousal support award. <em>Id. </em>The trial court did not rule on the \"omnibus motion,\u201d and Ms. Harrell did not object to the trial court\u2019s failure to rule on the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.1(A), \"upon the entry of a decree providing ... for a divorce ... [or] that neither party is entitled to a divorce, ... the court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning the maintenance and support of the spouses.\" <em>See Rowand v. Rowand, </em>215 Va. 344, 210 S.E.2d 149 (1974) (finding that neither party is entitled to a divorce and reversing the decree of divorce to wife, but allowing the award of alimony to wife to remain).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. In its final decree, which incorporated the court\u2019s letter opinion, the court explained it dismissed wife's complaint on a motion to strike the evidence, because \"she failed to offer any evidence supporting the entry of a Final Decree of Divorce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">. Although the trial judge viewed this assertion as \"perhaps\u201d unrealistic, it was not treated without some weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b542-7\">. The trial court's reference to the wife's earlier marriages related to the court's determination of the extent to which the wife had evidenced any ability to support herself, an issue raised by wife\u2019s request for spousal support. As such, the reference was relevant, contrary to wife\u2019s contention on appeal. <em>See Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987) (\" 'Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish the proposition for which it is offered. Evidence is material if it relates to a matter properly at issue.' \u201d (quoting C. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 134 (2d ed.1983))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
