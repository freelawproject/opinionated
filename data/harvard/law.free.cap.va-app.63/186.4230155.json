There are foreseeable circumstances where <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>fourth factor would place an area squarely outside the reach of Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>protections, notwithstanding the fact that a plain reading of the statute and the purpose behind subsection (B)\u2019s curtilage exception demonstrates an obvious intent to exempt that area from prosecution under subsection (A) \u2014 for example, a front yard or an unfenced backyard. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Foley\u2019s single assignment of error is that the \u201ctrial court erred when it found the easement over Foley\u2019s property was excluded from being considered part of the curtilage of his dwelling,\u201d and therefore Foley could not avail himself of the exception provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u201cOn appeal, we view the facts established at trial in the \u2018light most favorable\u2019 to the prevailing party below, in this case the Commonwealth, and we grant to that party all fair inferences flowing from those facts.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 457, 462 n. 1, 686 S.E.2d 557, 559 n. 1 (2009) (citations omitted). In this light, the evidence establishes the following/</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Holly Tree Road is a one-mile-long, privately maintained, dead-end, dirt road that is \u201clong, narrow, and winding.\u201d Holly Tree Road bisects Foley\u2019s four-acre property \u2014 that portion of the road is still Foley\u2019s property but is subject to a non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>exclusive easement. Where Holly Tree Road crosses Foley\u2019s property, on one side is Foley\u2019s house, and on the other side is his \u201cgarage\u201d and/or \u201cjunkyard\u201d where Foley keeps his farm equipment and \u201ca bunch of scrap stuff for working on whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Foley\u2019s residence is the second to last house, and Thomas Smallwood\u2019s (\u201cSmallwood\u201d) residence is the last house before Holly Tree Road dead ends. Smallwood\u2019s property was gifted to him by deed in 1988 by Foley. In the 1988 deed, Foley and his wife also conveyed to Smallwood \u201can 18-foot wide easement over their remaining property for the purposes of ingress and egress to a private road[,] which is the subject of a non-exclusive easement to the parties of the first part [Foley and his wife].\u201d This easement allows Smallwood to access his house at the end of Holly Tree Road. There are fifteen other residences on Holly Tree Road, however those homes are all located before Foley\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">On the evening of March 21, 2012, Smallwood called his brother-in-law and next-door neighbor, Foley, to ask for a favor. Smallwood told Foley that his daughter (Foley\u2019s niece) and granddaughter were alone in Smallwood\u2019s house. Moments earlier, his daughter\u2019s boyfriend threatened to harm them and was en route to Smallwood\u2019s house. Smallwood asked Foley to block the road and not let anyone through to his house until the police arrived, who were also on their way to Smallwood\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">When the Roanoke County police responded to the disturbance at Smallwood\u2019s house, Foley was standing in the middle of Holly Tree Road and pointing a gun at the approaching marked police vehicles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Foley was standing in the road beyond the entrance to his driveway, \u201che was standing right next to [his house],\u201d about twenty feet away \u201c[a]s a crow flies.\u201d Where Foley was standing, there is a steep slope between the road to his house. After ordering Foley to drop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>his weapon and handcuffing him, the police officers searched Foley\u2019s person and found a loaded .25 caliber handgun in the pocket of his sweatpants.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Foley was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. At his bench trial, Foley argued that he was not guilty because at the time of the offense he was standing on the curtilage of his residence \u2014 an exception expressly provided for by statute in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rejected his argument, finding that \u201cit [i]s pretty clear that the roadway that the defendant was standing on when this occurred was his property but it was subject to an [sic] nonexclusive easement, which I think excludes it from being considered part of the curtilage pertaining to his residence and consequently the exception language of the statute doesn\u2019t apply.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court found Foley guilty of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Subsection (A) of Code \u00a7 18.2-308 prohibits the carrying of concealed weapons. However, subsection (B) of Code \u00a7 18.2-308 provides that \u201c[t]his section shall not apply to any person while in his own place of abode <em>or the curtilage thereof.\u201d </em>Foley concedes that he was carrying a concealed weapon, but argues that the trial court erred in finding that he was not within the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of his place of abode within the meaning of subsection (B) and consequently not exempt from prosecution under subsection (A). A trial court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of a statute[ ] presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d LaCava v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 465, 470, 722 S.E.2d 838, 840 (2012). Thus, in this ease, we <em>review </em>the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccurtilage\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>A. The Term \u201cCurtilage, </em>\u201d <em>as Contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B), Is as Defined at Common Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In accordance with the basic tenets of statutory construction, \u201c[w]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language.\u201d <em>Vaughn, Inc. v. Beck, </em>262 Va. 673, 677, 554 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2001). \u201cThus, \u2018[a]n undefined term must be given its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007) (quoting <em>Sansom v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>257 Va. 589, 594-95, 514 S.E.2d 345, 349 (1999)). \u201c[W]hen the General Assembly has used words of a plain and definite import, courts cannot place on them a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly meant something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d <em>Vaughn, Inc., </em>262 Va. at 677, 554 S.E.2d at 90. \u201cConsequently, \u2018[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 802, 651 S.E.2d at 639 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Both the Commonwealth and Foley agree that the Code does not define \u201ccurtilage\u201d and there is no existing Virginia case law construing the meaning of \u201ccurtilage\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B), or as it is used elsewhere in the Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the Code does not expressly define \u201ccurtilage,\u201d because the term\u2019s plain meaning is well established at common law, we assume the General Assembly intended to assign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>its established meaning. <em>See Meeks, </em>274 Va. at 802, 651 S.E.2d at 639 (finding that when courts interpret the language of a statute, \u201c \u2018[a]n undefined term must be given its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sansom, </em>257 Va. at 594-95, 514 S.E.2d at 349)); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 1-200 (\u201cThe common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u201cThe curtilage concept originated at common law to extend to the area immediately surrounding a dwelling house the same protection under the law of burglary as was afforded the house itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1139, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987). The Supreme Court of Virginia explained in <em>Bare v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 783, 794, 94 S.E. 168, 172 (1917), that \u201c[i]n England the curtilage seems to have included only the buildings within the inner fence or yard, because there, in early times, for defense, the custom was to enclose such place with a substantial wall,\u201d however, in the United States \u201csuch walls or fences, in many cases, do not exist, so that [in the United States] the curtilage includes the cluster of buildings constituting the habitation or dwelling place, whether enclosed with an inner fence or not.\u201d The <em>Bare </em>Court defined a home\u2019s \u201ccurtilage\u201d as \u201ca space necessary and convenient, habitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment; the yard, garden or field which is near to and used in connection with the dwelling.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Bare\u2019s definition embodies the common law conception of the meaning of \u201ccurtilage\u201d: the boundaries of a home\u2019s curtilage are primarily defined by their <em>relationship with the home itself </em>rather than mere physical proximity or ownership. <em>See Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1742, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (\u201cAt common law, the curtilage is the area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the \u2018sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>(quoting <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 630, 6 S.Ct. 524, 532, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886))). Thus, regardless of the context in which the extent of a home\u2019s \u201ccurtilage\u201d arises, the shared inquiry is the relevant area\u2019s connection to the residence and its role in the lives of its occupants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 34, 639 S.E.2d 217, 221 (2007) (\u201c \u2018[T]he extent of the curtilage is determined by factors that bear upon whether an individual reasonably may expect that the area in question should be treated as the home itself.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 300, 107 S.Ct. at 1139)). This is because the term \u201ccurtilage,\u201d as it is used in the legal context, is historically understood to refer to an extension of the home that is so intertwined with the home that the law must provide it the same protection as the home itself. <em>See Florida v. Jardines, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1409, 1414-15, 185 L.Ed.2d 495 (2013) (\u201cJust as the distinction between the home and the open fields is as old as the common law, so too is the identity of home and what Blackstone called the \u2018curtilage or home-stall,\u2019 for the \u2018house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *223, *225)); <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 1, 15 n. 2, 497 S.E.2d 474, 481 n. 2 (1998) (\u201cThe concept that the legal protections afforded to a dwelling house also extend to the curtilage originated at common law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because \u201ccurtilage\u201d is properly defined at common law by its relationship to the residence and its use by its occupants, we reject as erroneous the trial court\u2019s conclusion that non-exclusive easements are per se excluded from being considered part of a home\u2019s curtilage within the meaning of this statute. While an area\u2019s use by third parties may be <em>relevant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>in determining whether the area is in the home\u2019s curtilage, that fact alone does not categorically exclude it. Instead, courts must look to the area\u2019s use and connection to the home itself rather than its use by third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Conversely, this Court also rejects Foley\u2019s argument that simply because he owned the property on which he was standing at the time of the offense, he was within the curtilage of his home and therefore exempt under subsection (B) from criminal prosecution under subsection (A). Such an interpretation of curtilage would deprive the courts of an inquiry into the particular use of the area in question and its relationship with the home. Moreover, if the General Assembly intended Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) to exempt individuals standing on <em>any </em>portion of their property then it would not have chosen to use the more narrow terms \u201cplace of abode or the curtilage thereof.\u201d <em>See Chandler v. Peninsula Light &amp; Power Co., 152 </em>Va. 903, 906, 147 S.E. 249, 250 (1929) (\u201cWhere the language used is clear but is not as broad as it might have been, the court cannot give to the words used a new meaning in order to make them include that which the letter of the law excludes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The Commonwealth urges this Court to apply the United States Supreme Court\u2019s four-factor test articulated in <em>Dunn </em>to determine the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage. The <em>Dunn </em>Court carefully noted that the factors were not intended to be a precise mathematical formula for determining the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage. <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. Rather, the \u201cfactors are useful analytical tools only to the degree that, in any given case, they bear upon the centrally relevant consideration \u2014 whether the area in question is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The four factors are: \u201c[ (1) ] the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, [ (2) ] whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, [ (3) ] the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and [ (4) ] the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is a cardinal principle of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth]\u2019 and \u2018cannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 495, 498, 737 S.E.2d 919, 921 (2013) (quoting <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960)). Although the first three factors of <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>four-factor test are rooted in the common law origins of the term \u201ccurtilage,\u201d the \u201ccentrally relevant consideration\u201d in determining the extent of the home\u2019s curtilage was whether the area should benefit from <em>Fourth Amendment </em>protections. <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. Consequently, the <em>Dunn </em>Court added the fourth factor, which is only relevant in a Fourth Amendment context. Thus, <em>Dunn </em>and its progeny are a myriad of Fourth Amendment cases and represent factual and constitutional considerations that are not particularly relevant or applicable to a statutory interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Dunn\u2019s </em>fourth consideration, \u201cthe steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by,\u201d while clearly relevant to any Fourth Amendment determination concerning a subjective expectation of privacy, is not an essential component of the common law definition of \u201ccurtilage.\u201d <em>Dunn </em>and its progeny are best viewed as analytical tools for determining what <em>portion </em>of the overall curtilage of a home is afforded protection by the Fourth Amendment using the test announced in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). Because there is nothing to suggest that the General Assembly intended to impose a more restrictive definition of curtilage than that found in the common law, considering whether the accused protected the area from observation by people passing by in order to seek protection under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B)\u2019s exception would subject some individuals to criminal prosecution whom the General Assembly clearly intended to statutorily exempt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 415, 650 S.E.2d 89, 91 (2007) (concluding that the Court was required to \u201cconstrue Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) strictly against the Commonwealth and to conf\u00edne the statute to those offenses clearly proscribed by its plain terms,\u201d because it is \u201cthe role of the General Assembly, not th[e] Court, to craft any needed revisions to Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) and to decide what items to include within the statute\u2019s proscription\u201d). Because defendants \u201c \u2018[are] entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt about the construction of a penal statute,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>the law favors the common law\u2019s more inclusive definition of \u201ccurtilage,\u201d rather than <em>Dunn\u2019s </em>more exclusive four-factor test adopted for Fourth Amendment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Additionally, using the <em>Dunn </em>four-factor test in determining the boundaries of a home\u2019s curtilage is inconsistent with the General Assembly\u2019s use of the term in other sections of the Code. For example, Code \u00a7 64.2-307 allows a surviving spouse to \u201cenjoy the principal family residence <em>and curtilage </em>without charge for rent, repairs, taxes, or insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added). If the <em>Dunn </em>factors were applicable outside of the Fourth Amendment context as the established method of determining the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage, a surviving spouse would not be entitled to those benefits in areas that he or she did not take steps to protect from observation \u2014 a result the General Assembly could not have intended. A more logical reading of the statute is that the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>intended for the surviving spouse\u2019s benefits pertaining to principal residence to include those \u201cnecessary and convenient\u201d areas that are \u201chabitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment.\u201d <em>Bare, </em>122 Va. at 794, 94 S.E. at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">For the reasons stated above, we therefore hold that the common law definition of curtilage articulated in <em>Bare </em>is applicable to Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) because it is consistent with a plain reading of the statute, the legislature\u2019s intent, and the well-established rules of statutory interpretation. Having determined the appropriate standard for determining the extent of a home\u2019s curtilage under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B), we now turn to its applicability to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>B. Code \u00a7 18.2-808(B) Is a Statutory Defense.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The \u201cbedrock of Virginia\u2019s criminal jurisprudence\u201d is the fundamental precept that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving every essential element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, 57 </em>Va.App. 341, 351, 702 S.E.2d 260, 265 (2010). However, generally, it is the defendant that bears the burden of producing evidence in support of an affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Foley argued at the trial court below, and now argues on appeal, that in order to convict him of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Foley was <em>not </em>on the curtilage of his abode at the time of the offense. The Commonwealth asserts on appeal that subsection (B) is a statutory defense and that Foley bore the burden of producing supporting evidence. The trial court did not expressly rule whether the exception language in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) was a statutory defense or an element of the crime, but simply concluded that because the area where Foley was standing was subject to a non-exclusive easement it was therefore excluded from being part of the curtilage and \u201cthe exception language of the statute doesn\u2019t apply.\u201d Therefore, in order to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment, we must first resolve whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>subsection (B) is a statutory defense to subsection (A) or, alternatively, a negative element of subsection (A). The resolution of this question will dictate whether Foley or the Commonwealth bore the burden of production on this point at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">When this Court \u201cconstru[es] penal statutes which contain qualifications, exceptions or exemptions to their application, the limiting language may be viewed as a negative element of the offense which the prosecution must disprove,\u201d or alternatively, as \u201ca statutory defense, which the accused can assert to defeat the <em>prima facie </em>case of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995); <em>see, e.g., Flanagan v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 681, 699, 714 S.E.2d 212, 220 (2011) (finding that \u201cthe last clause of Code \u00a7 18.2-85 constitutes a statutory defense for which an accused bears the burden of providing the supporting evidence\u201d). In determining whether specific limiting language is either an element of the offense or a statutory defense this Court considers four factors: (1) \u201c \u2018the wording of the exception and its role in relation to the other words in the statute;\u2019 \u201d (2) \u201c \u2018whether in light of the situation prompting legislative action, the exception is essential to complete the general prohibition intended;\u2019 \u201d (3) \u201c \u2018whether the exception makes an excuse or justification for what would otherwise be criminal conduct, i.e., sets forth an affirmative defense;\u2019 \u201d and (4) \u201c \u2018whether the matter is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>58 Va.App. at 698, 714 S.E.2d at 220 (quoting <em>Mayhew, </em>20 Va.App. at 489, 458 S.E.2d at 307).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Applying the <em>Mayhew </em>factors to Code \u00a7 18.2-308, it is clear that subsection (B) provides a statutory defense. First, the exception contained in subsection (B) which states that \u201c[t]his section shall not apply to any person while in his own place of abode or the curtilage thereof,\u201d is in a separate paragraph following subsection (A) which sets forth the elements of the offense. Furthermore, subsection (B) is followed by subsections (C) and (D) which contain more than a dozen other exceptions where \u201cthis section shall not apply.\u201d Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>quently, subsection (B) is not essential to complete the general prohibition against carrying concealed weapons without a permit. In fact, \u201crequiring the Commonwealth to prove this negative would undermine the general prohibition intended by the legislature\u201d because the Commonwealth would be required to prove in the negative <em>all </em>the exceptions provided for in subsections (B)-(D). <em>Williams, </em>57 Va.App. at 353, 702 S.E.2d at 265. If this Court were to adopt Foley\u2019s position, then in order to convict any defendant of carrying a concealed weapon, the Commonwealth in every such case would have to prove that none of the numerous exceptions found in the various subsections to Code \u00a7 18.2-308 applied, such as for example, that the defendant was <em>not </em>the \u201cHarbormaster of the City of Hopewell.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(D)(5). Thirdly, subsection (B) excuses what would otherwise be criminal conduct under subsection (A), carrying a concealed weapon, if the accused acts \u201cin his own place of abode or the curtilage thereof.\u201d Finally, whether the defendant was standing in an area habitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment \u2014 and therefore within the curtilage of his home\u2014 requires evidence that is \u201c \u2018peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flanagan, </em>58 Va.App. at 698, 714 S.E.2d at 220 (quoting <em>Mayhew, </em>20 Va.App. at 489, 458 S.E.2d at 307).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Consequently, the exception language in subsection (B) is not a negative element of the offense, but rather an affirmative defense. However, as this Court previously noted in <em>Tart v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 272, 276 n. 2, 663 S.E.2d 113, 115 n. 2 (2008), there is no uniform rule in Virginia regarding the burden of persuasion for affirmative defenses. \u201cInstead, the determination of which party has the burden of persuasion turns on which affirmative defense is being asserted.\u201d <em>Id. Compare Simopoulos v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 1059, 1069, 277 S.E.2d 194, 200 (1981) (holding that a defendant charged with a violation of Virginia\u2019s abortion regulation must \u201cinvoke[ ]\u201d the affirmative defense of medical necessity, but that the Commonwealth \u201chas the burden of negating [the defense] beyond a reasonable doubt[]\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>462 U.S. 506, 510, 103 S.Ct. 2532, 2535, 76 L.Ed.2d 755 (1983), <em>with McGhee </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 560, 561, 248 S.E.2d 808, 809 (1978) (rejecting the appellant\u2019s argument that she was entitled to a jury instruction stating that the Commonwealth \u201cha[d] the burden of disproving beyond all reasonable doubt [her] affirmative plea of self-defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Here, given the number and nature of the statutory exceptions found in Code \u00a7 18.2-308, we hold that Foley was required to satisfy his burden of persuasion by pointing to evidence presented by the Commonwealth or presenting evidence on his own behalf sufficient to allow him to invoke a statutory exception. In the context of the exception Foley claimed was applicable in this case, he needed to point to or produce evidence that at the time of the offense he was standing in a \u201cnecessary and convenient\u201d area that was \u201chabitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment.\u201d However, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Foley failed to establish that he was standing on anything more than just property he owned. The record contains insufficient evidence that the section of Holly Tree Road where Foley was standing at the time of the offense was \u201chabitually used for family purposes\u201d or \u201cthe carrying on of domestic employment.\u201d Although Foley was only twenty feet away from his house, there was a steep slope between his location in the road and his home. While Holly Tree Road bisects Foley\u2019s property, there is no evidence in the record that he used either the road itself or the property on the other side of the road for anything but storing his farming equipment or as a \u201cjunk yard.\u201d In short, no evidence was presented that Foley used the portion of his property where he was arrested as an extension of the home to the degree that the law provides it the same protection as the home itself. We therefore conclude that the evidence in the record supports a finding that Foley failed to produce evidence that he was on the curtilage of his home at the time of the offense, and as a result, could avail himself of the statutory exception contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">In light of the foregoing, although it applied the wrong reasoning, the trial court did not err when it concluded that the statutory exception contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) did not apply, and we therefore affirm Foley\u2019s conviction for carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-808(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. Foley was charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer, but was later acquitted by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">. Foley\u2019s trial counsel improperly argued that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving \"beyond a reasonable doubt ... that he wasn\u2019t on his curtilage.\u201d As discussed <em>infra </em>Part II.B, we hold that the exception provided in Code \u00a7 18.2-308(B) is a statutory defense that the accused bears the burden of production, and therefore the inapplicability of any statutory exception is not an essential element of the crime that the Commonwealth is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. There are three additional places where the term \u201ccurtilage\u201d appears in the Code: Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 allows a convicted felon to possess a stun gun \u201cin his residence or the curtilage thereof\u201d; Code \u00a7 64.2-307 allows a surviving spouse to \"enjoy the principal family residence and curtilage without charge for rent, repairs, taxes, or insurance\u201d; and finally, Code \u00a7 18.2-78 limits what is deemed a \"dwelling house\u201d\u2014 excluding certain structures despite being \u201cwithin the curtilage thereof.\u201d Presently, no Virginia appellate court has construed the term \"curtilage\u201d in relation to any of these statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">.
