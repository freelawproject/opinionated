Wagoner, Jr. (\u201cWagoner\u201d) was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of Martinsville (\u201ctrial court\u201d) of abuse or neglect of an incapacitated adult resulting in death, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-369(B). On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Wagoner argues (1) that the trial court applied the wrong decisional standard in denying his motion to set aside the jury verdict; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that his conduct was a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death; and (3) that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he committed a willful act with knowledge and consciousness that injury or death would result to the victim. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On appeal, we \u201cconsider the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u201d <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 475, 525 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In February 2011, Joe Tuggle (\u201cTuggle\u201d), the victim, was living in a group home for men with intellectual disabilities run by the Claye Corporation. Wagoner, who holds a PhD in applied developmental psychology, owns the Claye Corporation and serves as the president of the Corporation. The Claye Corporation has a provider agreement with the Department of Developmental Health to provide services to intellectually disabled adults. The Claye Corporation operates several homes where clients reside. Three clients, including Tuggle, lived in the Minor Street home (\u201cMinor Street\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In February 2011, Tuggle was fifty-seven years old and had severe Parkinson\u2019s disease and Lewy bodies in his brain causing dementia. It is unclear what caused Tuggle\u2019s intellectual disabilities, but whatever the cause, he was unable to communicate effectively, he could not carry on a real conversation, and he mostly moaned and gestured. Tuggle also needed help with eating and with personal care. Tuggle could walk, but he was shaky from the Parkinson\u2019s disease and had trouble with walking and standing on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Around seven in the evening on February 8, 2011, Tuggle was sitting on a couch in the Minor Street living room when he had a diarrhea accident. Jerome Baker (\u201cBaker\u201d), who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>was working on staff, assisted Tuggle to the restroom and sat Tuggle on the toilet. After waiting with Tuggle two to three minutes, Baker left to retrieve a mop bucket and cleaning supplies from the kitchen and began helping another staff member, Kenny L. Brown (\u201cKenny L.\u201d), clean up the diarrhea that was on the couch and floor in the living room. After cleaning for five or six minutes, Baker returned to the restroom and found Tuggle lying down in the bathtub on his back with only hot water running out of the shower. Tuggle was saying \u201cHelp me! Help me!\u201d Baker turned off the hot water and yelled for Kenny L. to come help. Baker and Kenny L. grabbed Tuggle and raised him up and sat him on the toilet. They dried Tuggle off and noticed his skin was very red. Then they took Tuggle to the living room and noted again that his skin was really red and it started to peel about ten minutes later. Baker testified that he grabbed the phone, ready to call 911, but Kenny L. told him \u201cNo,\u201d and to call their supervisor first because that was the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Kenny L. called Kenny A. Brown (\u201cKenny A.\u201d), the staff supervisor that night. Kenny A. left his home and went to Minor Street around 8:30 p.m. Kenny A. inspected Tuggle and determined that Tuggle did not need medical attention. Kenny A. called Tameki Tarpley (\u201cTarpley\u201d), his co-supervisor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to inform her of Tuggle\u2019s accident. Without seeing Tuggle, Tarpley called the emergency room (\u201cE.R.\u201d) on February 8 and asked how to treat a burn that \u201cappeared to be like a sunburn.\u201d Tarpley testified, \u201cAll they could tell me was we could apply cold compressions and go to the pharmacy, [and] ask the pharmacist how to treat it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tarpley called Kenny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>A. back and said to apply cold rags to Tuggle\u2019s burns. Kenny L. and Baker stayed with Tuggle until 11:00 p.m. applying cold rags, and Baker testified that Tuggle made noises indicating he was in pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The next morning, February 9, Kenny A. arrived back at Minor Street around 6:30 a.m. He got there earlier than usual in order to check on Tuggle. He observed that Tuggle looked different that morning and that his burns were \u201ca little bit redder than they were pink\u201d and this concerned him. Kenny A. called Tarpley and told her that they needed to take Tuggle to the hospital to be checked out. Tarpley was on her way to work, a little before 7:00 a.m., when she called staff member Lacoma Hairston (\u201cHairston\u201d) to bring one of the company vans over to Minor Street to transport Tuggle to the hospital. Tarpley then arrived at Minor Street and saw Tuggle\u2019s arm and neck and confirmed that it was red. Cynthia Epley (\u201cEpley\u201d), a director at the Claye Corporation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> called Tarpley prior to arriving at Minor Street and Tarpley told her about Tuggle\u2019s accident the night before and that he was burned. Tarpley also told Epley that a van was coming to transport Tuggle to the E.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Hairston arrived at Minor Street with the van about 7:15 a.m. Some staff members put Tuggle in the van, and the van left. Epley testified that she called Wagoner after speaking with Tarpley and that Wagoner said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to see him before he goes.\u201d Epley then called Tarpley to tell her that \u201cMr. Wagoner would like to see [Tuggle] before he goes.\u201d Tarpley then called Hairston and told her to bring the van back. The van arrived back at Minor Street within a short time, about three minutes after Tarpley called Hairston.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">After the van returned, Tarpley went to CVS \u201cbecause that\u2019s what the hospital [told her to do]\u201d and she asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>pharmacist how to treat a sunburn. The pharmacist told her to use drainage strips, \u201ccold compresses to keep it clean and to dry the heat,\u201d and Neosporin. According to her CVS receipt, Tarpley purchased the recommended supplies at 8:01 a.m., and then she returned to Minor Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Epley arrived at Minor Street around the same time that Tarpley returned from CVS. When Epley entered the house, Tuggle was sitting in the living room in a wheelchair. Tuggle had something over him so she could only see the top of his hand. Wagoner arrived shortly after Epley, and the staff started explaining to them what had happened. Epley described the scene as chaotic and overwhelming, and everyone was talking at once. She stayed inside the Minor Street house less than ten minutes and then went to sit in her car. Wagoner asked Tuggle how he was doing. Then Baker took the sheet off of Tuggle and pulled up Tuggle\u2019s T-shirt for Wagoner to see his injuries. Baker testified that Tuggle\u2019s skin was really red and skin had peeled away. Staff member Lawrence Collins (\u201cCollins\u201d) testified that Tuggle did not have any clothes on and that he and staff member Artis Williams stood Tuggle up and dropped the sheet from him so Wagoner could have a look. \u201ciWagoner] looked at him. He looked him up and down. Then he just looked. We sat [Tuggle] back in the chair. Wagoner] looked at everybody. He didn\u2019t say one word to us. He just looked, this look he had. He walked out.\u201d Epley testified that on February 9, the staff made the treatment decision to send Tuggle to the hospital and that Wagoner made the treatment decision with regard to not sending Tuggle to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Collins described that he was \u201cin shock\u201d when he walked in the home that morning and saw Tuggle because Tuggle \u201chad suffered a very bad burn.\u201d Collins elaborated on Tuggle\u2019s condition that morning: Tuggle looked like he was hurting; he was just staring; he was not smiling or talking. \u201cTuggle didn\u2019t have no flesh on him from the back of his head, like all of his hair was melted and stuff to him, all down his shoulders. His butt was gone. All the way down, you know, he had burns all the way down to his feet.\u201d Collins continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>He couldn\u2019t have nothing on him. You know, not even underwear. He was just that much in the raw. His whole body was like just real pink. It looked like it had just happened. I mean it was just like somebody just took all the skin off the back of him. He didn\u2019t have none. I mean like Tuggle was real hairy. He didn\u2019t have no hair on his back no more, or on his butt, nowhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">After looking at Tuggle for two or three minutes, Wagoner went outside and sat with Epley in her car. According to Wagoner, Epley was upset and nervous and had to take her blood pressure medication while they talked in the car. While Collins smoked a cigarette outside, he watched Epley and Wagoner in the car. Wagoner looked upset and agitated, and based on his hand-gestures, Collins could tell Wagoner was not happy. Epley testified that when Wagoner got in the car he said his nerves were \u201cjust shot,\u201d and \u201cWell, I guess Social Services will investigate us.\u201d He also told Epley that \u201cafter talking to Tuggle and talking to Ms. Tarpley and hearing what the hospital had to say, he decided that we would treat Tuggle at home one on one, with one on one care, that he felt he\u2019d get better care.\u201d Wagoner left Minor Street after talking with Epley for about ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">After Wagoner left, Epley telephoned Tarpley to come out to her car. They went to Family Pharmacy together and Epley picked up her own medication and Tarpley bought more Neosporin and Tylenol. Epley told Tarpley that if Tuggle gets worse they should take him to the E.R. After Epley dropped Tarpley off at Minor Street, Epley left and went to a friend\u2019s house for the afternoon. From there she made two phone calls to Wagoner during which they discussed reporting the burn incident to \u201clicensure,\u201d meaning the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, Office of Licensing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Epley stressed to Wagoner that he did need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>report Tuggle\u2019s injuries to licensure. Wagoner told Epley he did not know if Tuggle\u2019s injury met the criteria for reporting and he would have to check into it. Wagoner indicated that he did not think Tuggle\u2019s injuries needed to be reported because there was no blood present.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Tarpley and Kenny A. supervised the staffs care of Tuggle over the next nine days. The staff applied Neosporin and cold rags to Tuggle\u2019s burns. The staff changed Tuggle\u2019s sheets and T-shirts often because the burns were oozing and they were wet and smelled bad. Sometimes there was blood on the sheets, too. Tuggle\u2019s burn wounds turned yellow, pus came out of them, and they started to stink. Collins, who refused to care for Tuggle because he did not feel qualified to care for burn injuries, reported that the odor in Tuggle\u2019s room was so bad after three or four days that it made him want to vomit. Other staff members mentioned the odor, too. Tuggle had to be turned each hour to be on his right side or left side. Collins said, \u201cIt was bad,\u201d and he was \u201cjust in awe of the whole thing.\u201d Baker, who took care of Tuggle most days between his accident and his death, testified that Tuggle slowed down in movement and would not eat as much. The staff wiped Tuggle very carefully during sponge baths because they could not put any pressure on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Baker made routine notes during his shifts that Tuggle \u201claughed and smiled\u201d as staff put ointment on him; he also wrote, \u201cno problems to report,\u201d and \u201cTuggle ate all of his dinner.\u201d Other notes indicated that Tuggle \u201crelaxed\u201d and watched television. Collins testified that all the notes said \u201cnothing to report\u201d because management would not allow reports otherwise. He added that Tarpley and Kenny A. would tell the staff how to write the notes and the staff did not report anything because the management already knew Tuggle\u2019s condition. Defense counsel also pointed out that neither Baker nor Collins called 911 and they did not call Wagoner to say that Tuggle needed more care. Baker understood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the supervisor should be consulted instead of 911 and that the decision about Tuggle\u2019s care had already been made \u2014 it was understood that \u201che\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Adrian Jones took care of Tuggle only one day after Tuggle\u2019s burns. When Jones saw Tuggle on February 13 he was shocked to see Tuggle\u2019s injuries. Jones observed that Tuggle looked like he was in a lot of pain, and was \u201cburnt real bad, purple, red all over, down from his ankles up to his head. His hair was melted to his head.\u201d Tuggle had blisters on his side, his back, and his buttocks, and pus was running off his body. Tuggle\u2019s room smelled like death. Jones added, \u201cI was sitting beside him and I was the only one to see that tears shed[ ] from his face.\u201d Tuggle was wrapped in sheets without clothes underneath. Tuggle\u2019s sheets had to be changed every 30 minutes, and \u201c[w]hen we\u2019d pull them off, the skin would be pulling with it so you\u2019d be pulling skin with the sheets every time we\u2019d change them.\u201d Jones wrote \u201cno incidents to report\u201d for his shift because Tuggle\u2019s injury did not occur on his shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In the days following Tuggle\u2019s accident, Wagoner did not visit Minor Street and apparently only relied on the supervisors to report on Tuggle. Wagoner had no burn training, and he knew that the supervisors did not have any burn training. The staff members were only trained in first aid and CPR. Wagoner later told a case investigator that the decision to take care of Tuggle at Minor Street \u201cwas a group decision\u201d and that he trusted Tarpley\u2019s advice based on her call to the hospital and her conversation with a pharmacist after she asked how to treat a sunburn. He indicated that he did not think the burn was serious enough to report to licensing; he referred to Tuggle\u2019s injuries as a sunburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">On February 15, Martinsville Police Officer Michael Clark responded to a call from the home of Curtis Williams. Curtis Williams is the father of Artis Williams, who helped care for Tuggle the next shift after Tuggle sustained his injuries, and again on February 10. Officer Clark spoke with Curtis and then spoke with Artis about a gentleman at Minor Street \u201cwho had suffered some burns.\u201d Officer Clark then visited Minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Street on a \u201cwellness check\u201d and was escorted to Tuggle\u2019s room where Tuggle was asleep in his bed. Tuggle\u2019s sheets were pulled back and he was not wearing any clothes; he was lying on his left side. Officer Clark observed that Tuggle had burns on his \u201cbutt area, upper thigh area. There was a burn [] where his right shoulder blade would have been. There was one on his right arm. I also observed one I believe on ... the right area of his neck.\u201d Tarpley told Officer Clark that she had been \u201cin constant contact with the emergency room\u201d and explained how they were treating Tuggle\u2019s wounds. Officer Clark did not take any action or call emergency medical services because he believed that Tuggle was not in any imminent danger given that he appeared to be resting comfortably and was being cared for by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On February 16, Wagoner called Deborah Tankersley (\u201cTankersley\u201d), of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, Office of Licensing, to tell her that the police had come to Minor Street the day before to do a wellness check on Tuggle. The Office of Licensing licenses the Claye Corporation to provide services, and it monitors the services. As a provider of services, the Claye Corporation is required to report an injury that requires evaluation by a medical professional outside of the provider\u2019s location within 24 hours. Tankersley testified that Wagoner was the individual required to report injuries for the Claye Corporation, as he was listed on the license as the \u201cperson responsible for the overall management and [oversight] of the programs or the facilities that are going to be licensed.\u201d Tankersley had no prior notice of Tuggle\u2019s injury and never received an \u201cinjury report\u201d from the Claye Corporation on the scalding incident. Wagoner told her the events of Tuggle\u2019s injury over the phone and said that \u201c[Tuggle] got a little red where the water touched him like a sunburn.\u201d Tankersley told Wagoner that he needed to take the client to the doctor. She so advised him because Tuggle had not seen a doctor, and she took note of the fact that someone felt Tuggle\u2019s injuries were bad enough to call the police to check on him. While Wagoner told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>that the E.R. said not to bring Tuggle in, she said \u201che needs to be seen to let somebody else make that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">During the week following Tuggle\u2019s burns, Tuggle\u2019s cousin, Dwayne Tuggle, called Minor Street telling of his plans to pick up Tuggle to take him to his elderly mother\u2019s house for a visit. He was told it was not a good time to get Tuggle because he had some minor burns, \u201clike a light sunburn,\u201d and diarrhea. Dwayne and Tuggle\u2019s mother decided they would not pick up Tuggle as planned. Dwayne was not alarmed when they said Tuggle had \u201ca light sunburn.\u201d The next time the family heard from Minor Street about Tuggle was at the time of Tuggle\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Around 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. on February 18, Tuggle was alive at the bed check and was assisted to the restroom. He was found unresponsive around 6:00 a.m. that morning. The staff notified the house manager and then called 911. Wagoner notified the Office of Licensing of Tuggle\u2019s death on February 18 via facsimile.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Dr. Gayle Suzuki, the medical examiner for the case and a pathologist, performed the autopsy and determined that about thirty percent of Tuggle\u2019s body was burned and his burns were consistent -with second and third degree burns. She testified that the cause of Tuggle\u2019s death was sepsis (bacteria growing in the blood) and pneumonia resulting from the thermal injuries from immersion in scalding water. She described that the sepsis bacteria was consistent with the type of bacteria found on the skin. Dr. Suzuki testified that Tuggle\u2019s pneumonia was severe. He had yellow-green pus on his lungs, and with this severe lung condition Tuggle could not have been as well off as the notes and the staff reported \u2014 it would have been nearly impossible for him to breathe.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Dr. Kevin Whaley, Assistant Chief Medical Examiner, was qualified as an expert in the field of thermal injury, including classification, diagnosis, and treatment of burns. He reviewed Dr. Suzuki\u2019s autopsy report. He testified that second and third degree burns to thirty percent of the total body surface requires automatic admission to a burn unit. A second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>burn causes the skin to wipe off and it is very painful. A third degree burn \u201ccooks\u201d the skin and it gets hard; it is not painful because the nerve endings are dead. The treatment for someone in Tuggle\u2019s condition would include fluid resuscitation first, then fighting the risk of infection because bacteria thrive in and under dead skin. A very strong pain medication, Fentanyl, is used to treat pain for burn patients in Tuggle\u2019s condition. Neosporin and first aid cream are definitely not recommended treatments for second and third degree burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">After viewing photographs of Tuggle, Dr. Whaley\u2019s opinion was that Tuggle had third degree burns to his knee and buttocks, and second degree burns to his neck and cheeks, right arm, and back. He also said that Tuggle\u2019s third degree burns to his knees would have looked yellowish-white as soon as it dried out, and it would have dried out within twelve hours after the burn, assuming no more water was applied to it. Dr. Whaley testified that Tuggle\u2019s risk of death without treatment was 100%. Initially he testified that Tuggle\u2019s risk of death <em>with treatment </em>was eighty-seven percent, based on the thirty percent burned body surface. On cross-examination defense counsel suggested a recalculation of Tuggle\u2019s burned surface area. Dr. Whaley said, \u201cYou could [] say 18[%].\u201d Dr. Whaley testified that eighteen percent of the body surface burned is still going to mean 100% morality without treatment, and with treatment, Tuggle would have had a seventy-five percent chance of death and a twenty-five percent chance of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Dr. Thomas Berry was received by the trial court as an expert in the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of burns, and testified for the defense. Based on his review of the autopsy, he testified that only twenty percent of Tuggle\u2019s body was burned. He also testified that Tuggle did not present symptoms of sepsis. He opined that the pneumonia onset rapidly and may or may not have been related to the burns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>He testified that he probably would have recommended in home/out-patient care for Tuggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Wagoner\u2019s counsel made a motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and at the close of all the evidence. After the jury found Wagoner guilty, his counsel made a motion to set aside the jury verdict, and then a motion to reconsider the trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside the jury verdict. The trial court denied all of these motions, and entered a sentencing order on November 6, 2012, sentencing Wagoner to five years\u2019 incarceration with all five years suspended for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">II. ANAYLSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">A. Motion to Set Aside the Jury Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">Wagoner\u2019s first assignment of error is that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">The trial court erred in denying [his] Motion to Set Aside the Jury Verdict by applying the wrong decisional standard. Although the trial court was reviewing [Wagoner]\u2019s [m]otion after the jury had returned its verdict, the trial court erroneously applied the decisional standard intended only for guidance in deciding a motion to strike the evidence made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. In deciding [Wagoner]\u2019s post-trial motion to set aside the jury verdict, the trial court should have reviewed the evidence under the traditional standards and jury instructions necessary to support a jury verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u201cToday, as a century ago, \u2018nothing is better settled than that everything is to be presumed in favor of the correctness of the rulings of a court of competent jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>when brought under review in an appellate tribunal, until the contrary is shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caprino v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 181, 184, 670 S.E.2d 36, 38 (2008) (quoting <em>Early v. Commonwealth, </em>86 Va. 921, 925, 11 S.E. 795, 797 (1890)). \u201cA trial court\u2019s judgment approving a jury\u2019s verdict is entitled to great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it is contrary to law or plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 344, 356 S.E.2d 157, 174 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In Wagoner\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict he argued that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that his acts or omissions constituted a proximate cause of Tuggle\u2019s death. In its letter opinion, the trial court pointed to case law that supported its ruling that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as to proximate cause was sufficient to create a jury question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">The language \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d should be \u201cemployed as a decisional standard for the guidance of trial courts in deciding a motion to strike the evidence,\u201d and \u201c[i]t teaches, in short, that if a plaintiffs evidence has shown that the defendant\u2019s negligence has destroyed any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival, then there is sufficient evidence of proximate cause to go to the jury, and a motion to strike the evidence on that ground should be overruled.\u201d <em>Blondel v. Hays, </em>241 Va. 467, 473-74, 403 S.E.2d 340 (1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Wagoner takes this excerpt from <em>Blondel </em>out of context and argues that the trial court erroneously decided the motion to set aside the jury verdict using a \u201cdecisional standard\u201d that should <em>only </em>be applied to motions to strike. He asserts that the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard \u201conly applies to a trial court\u2019s analysis of a motion to strike made before a defendant presents evidence, and not to a motion to set aside a jury verdict.\u201d The dissent agrees with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The question in <em>Blondel, </em>however, was whether the trial court should have instructed the jury on the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival,\u201d and the excerpt Wagoner quotes from <em>Blondel </em>relates to whether the jury was properly instructed. The Supreme Court found, \u201cThe \u2018substantial possibility of survival\u2019 standard, while furnishing the criterion for deciding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>motion to strike, was never designed for the guidance of a jury.... The well-settled law on the subject of proximate cause was correctly expressed by [the jury instructions] which the court granted.\u201d <em>Blondel, </em>241 Va. at 474, 403 S.E.2d at 344. In other words, the Supreme Court approved the use of the standard as good law for a trial court to use in deciding whether there is a proper question for the jury regarding a proximate cause of death of a patient. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 403 S.E.2d at 344. At the same time, the Court warned against indiscriminate use of language from appellate court opinions in jury instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 403 S.E.2d at 344 (citing <em>Oak Knolls Realty v. Thomas, </em>212 Va. 396, 397-98, 184 S.E.2d 809, 810 (1971) (\u201cWe have often said that statements appearing in opinions of this court, while authority for the propositions set forth, are not necessarily proper language for jury instructions.\u201d)). Our Supreme Court did not make a distinction between a trial court\u2019s \u201cdecisional standard\u201d for a motion to strike versus a motion to set aside the jury verdict, as the dissent suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In this case, the trial court did not instruct the jury on the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard. As in <em>Blondel, </em>the trial court here used the substantial possibility of survival standard solely to determine whether proximate cause of death was a proper question to submit to the jury. The law regarding that question is the same whether the trial court is considering a motion to strike the evidence before a jury receives the case or a motion to set aside a jury verdict. As for the trial court\u2019s standard of review when asked to set aside a jury verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence, Code \u00a7 8.01-680 provides that standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">When a case, civil or criminal, is tried by a jury and a party objects to the judgment or action of the court in granting or refusing to grant a new trial on a motion to set aside the verdict of a jury on the ground that it is contrary to the evidence, ... the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> The trial judge\u2019s power to set aside a jury verdict</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>\u201ccan only be exercised where the verdict is plainly wrong or without credible evidence to support it. If there is a conflict in the testimony on a material point, or if reasonable [persons] may differ in their conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent on the weight to be given the testimony, the trial judge cannot substitute his conclusion for that of the jury merely because he would have voted for a different verdict if he had been on the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Doherty v. Aleck, </em>273 Va. 421, 424, 641 S.E.2d 93, 94 (2007) (quoting <em>Lane v. Scott, </em>220 Va. 578, 581, 260 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1979)). Where the evidence is sufficient to make a jury issue of proximate causation, a trial court errs in setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 641 S.E.2d at 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Thus, and contrary to the position taken by the dissent, when deciding how to rule on a motion to set aside the jury verdict, a trial court applies the same principles that apply to a motion to strike the evidence. \u201cA motion to strike challenges whether the evidence is sufficient to submit the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 223, 738 S.E.2d 847, 868 (2013). Where reasonable minds could differ on a factual issue, the trial court does not err in submitting the issue to the jury. <em>Ravenwood Towers, Inc. v. Woodyard, </em>244 Va. 51, 59, 419 S.E.2d 627, 632 (1992). \u201cIt ... is the function of a jury to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence and to resolve all conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 419 S.E.2d at 630-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Indeed in <em>Hadeed v. Medic-24, Ltd., </em>237 Va. 277, 377 S.E.2d 589 (1989), our Supreme Court expressly stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cOn review of a case in which the trial court has sustained a motion to strike after the introduction of all the evidence, we apply the principles governing consideration of evidence upon a motion to set aside a verdict as contrary to the evidence.

That is, upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, if we are of opinion that reasonable men may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>differ on the conclusion to be reached, then it is our duty to hold that the trial court committed error in striking the evidence.\u2019 In viewing the evidence we give the plaintiffs \u2018the benefit of all substantial conflict in the evidence, and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 280-81, 377 S.E.2d at 590 (quoting <em>Matney v. Cedar Land Farms, </em>216 Va. 932, 933-34, 224 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1976)). The Court followed this quote by stating that \u201c[t]he standard enunciated in <em>Matney </em>for appellate review also is the appropriate standard to be applied at the trial level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 377 S.E.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Therefore, we are not convinced by Wagoner\u2019s argument adopted by the dissent that there is one \u201cdecisional standard\u201d that applies to motions to strike and a different \u201cdecisional standard\u201d that applies to motions to set aside a jury verdict. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not apply an incorrect \u201cdecisional standard\u201d in ruling on Wagoner\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">B. Proximate Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Wagoner\u2019s second assignment of error is that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">The trial court erred in denying [his] Motion to Set Aside the [J]ury [V]erdict and in finding that [his] conduct was a proximate cause of Tuggle\u2019s death when the evidence showed that Tuggle had a 75% probability of dying from his burns, which were not caused by [Wagoner]. The trial court erred in allowing the jury verdict to stand when the evidence did not establish that Tuggle\u2019s death would not have occurred but for [Wagoner\u2019s] conduct, or even that Tuggle\u2019s death was made more probable than not because of [Wagoner\u2019s] conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">\u201c[A] party who comes before [an appellate court] with a jury verdict approved by the trial court \u2018occupies the most favored position known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ravenwood Towers, </em>244 Va. at 57, 419 S.E.2d at 630 (quoting <em>Pugsley v. Privette, </em>220 Va. 892, 901, 263 S.E.2d 69, 76 (1980)). \u201cOn appeal, therefore, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>therefrom in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Tuttle v. Webb, </em>284 Va. 319, 324, 731 S.E.2d 909, 911 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The jury convicted Wagoner of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-369(B), which reads in part, \u201cAny responsible person who abuses or neglects an incapacitated adult in violation of this section and the abuse or neglect results in the death of the incapacitated adult is guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">It is uncontested that Wagoner is a \u201cresponsible person,\u201d thus, the Commonwealth was required to prove that Wagoner\u2019s abuse or neglect of Tuggle \u201cresulted in\u201d the death of Tuggle. It is uncontested that Wagoner did not cause Tuggle\u2019s burn injuries. Wagoner stressed that the evidence established that Tuggle\u2019s chance of survival even with treatment was, at best, twenty-five percent, and there was no evidence that Tuggle probably would have lived with different treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u201c[T]he phrase \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is shorthand for the policy-based judgment that not all factual causes contributing to an injury should be legally cognizable causes.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. McBride, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2630, 2642, 180 L.Ed.2d 637 (2011). \u201c[T]he lack of consensus on any one definition of \u2018proximate cause\u2019 is manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the concept of proximate cause \u201cexcludes from the scope of liability injuries that are \u2018too remote,\u2019 \u2018purely contingent,\u2019 or \u2018indirect[ ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 131 S.Ct. at 2645 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., </em>503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 1317-18, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In this case the trial court, without objection, instructed the jury on proximate cause: \u201cA proximate cause of a death is a cause that, in natural and continuous sequence, results in death. It is a cause without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d This jury instruction was uncontested and thus, at a minimum, is the law of the case. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

Therefore, the question is whether the evidence supported a finding that Wagoner\u2019s neglect of Tuggle resulted in Tuggle\u2019s death\u2014 or in other words, whether without Wagoner\u2019s neglect, Tuggle would have lived. The import of the language \u201cresults in the death\u201d as found in Code \u00a7 18.2-869(B) is not addressed in the Code or in Virginia case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The United States Supreme Court has recently interpreted similar language in the federal Controlled Substances Act that \u201cimposes a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who unlawfully distributes a Schedule I or II drug, when \u2018death or serious bodily injury <em>results from </em>the use of such substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burrage v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 881, 885, 187 L.Ed.2d 715 (2014) (emphasis added) (quoting 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)-(C)). Burrage sold heroin to a long-time user who injected the heroin soon thereafter and died. <em>Id. </em>The toxicologist determined that multiple drugs, including heroin, were present in the decedent\u2019s system at the time of his death. <em>Id. </em>The toxicologist concluded that the heroin was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in the decedent\u2019s death because it contributed to an overall effect that caused him to stop breathing. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014 - \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 885-86. Another doctor described the cause of death as \u201cmixed drug intoxication\u201d in which all drugs played a contributing role in the death. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 886. Neither doctor could say that the decedent would have lived had he not taken the heroin. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014 - \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 885-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">The question before the Supreme Court was whether the defendant may be convicted under the \u201cwhen death results\u201d statutory provision when the use of the controlled substance was a \u201ccontributing cause\u201d of the death. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 886. The government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that death resulted from the use of the drug. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 887. Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define the phrase \u201cresults from,\u201d the Court looked to its ordinary meaning and found that this language imports \u201cbut for\u201d causality. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014 - \u2014,\u2014 - \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 887-88, 890-91. \u201cA thing \u2018results\u2019 when it \u2018[a]rise[s] as an effect, issue, or outcome <em>from </em>some action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>process or design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 887 (quoting 2 <em>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary </em>2570 (1993)). \u201cResults from\u201d imposes \u201ca requirement of actual causality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018In the usual course,\u2019 this requires proof \u2018that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of-that is, but for-the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014 - \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 887-88 (quoting <em>Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2517, 2525, 186 L.Ed.2d 503 (2013)). \u201cThis but[ ]for requirement is part of the common understanding of cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 888. An event is the outcome or consequence of another event \u201cwhen the former would not have occurred but for the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBy contrast, it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from ... some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One instructive example of but for causation provided by the Court is as follows: \u201cif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases, it is a but[ ]for cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without the incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">We are persuaded by <em>Burrage </em>that, where the legislature has not clarified otherwise, this Court should give the phrase \u201cresults in\u201d its ordinary meaning, which imports \u201cbut for\u201d causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">We note the significant role of the jury in determining whether a victim would have lived but for the abuse or neglect of the responsible person. On one extreme, we can conceive of situations in which an incapacitated adult becomes ill or injured through no fault of the responsible party and even prompt heroic measures could not have saved the victim from death. Death was certain regardless of the actions or inaction of the responsible party. Clearly, in this scenario, a responsible party\u2019s failure to act would not qualify as a cause of the victim\u2019s death. It could not be said that the ill or injured party would have or even might have lived but for the responsible party\u2019s failure to act. There is no question of fact for the jury on causation in this scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>At the other extreme, we can equally imagine an incapacitated adult who suffers from diabetes and receives a minor injury \u2014 a small abrasion on the foot, for example. The abrasion, if properly treated, would not be a life-threatening injury. However, the abrasion becomes infected when it is left untreated. The patient develops gangrene, which is also left untreated, and ultimately dies from medical consequences traceable initially to the small abrasion. In this scenario, the actions or inactions of any responsible person was a theoretical \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the victim\u2019s death: the injured adult almost certainly would have lived but for the responsible party\u2019s failure to act appropriately. In this scenario, even though the legal culpability would seem to be clear, it remains a question of fact for the jury on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The facts of this case fall between the two extremes posited above, and create a quintessential jury question. Dr. Suzuki testified that thirty percent of Tuggle\u2019s body was burned with second and third degree burns and that his cause of death was sepsis and pneumonia resulting from these thermal injuries. Dr. Whaley testified that without treatment, Tuggle\u2019s risk of death was 100%. With treatment, Tuggle had a thirteen to twenty-five percent chance of survival. Dr. Berry testified that Tuggle did not appear to have sepsis, and his pneumonia onset rapidly and may or may not have been related to the burn injuries. Dr. Berry also testified that he probably would have recommended out-patient care for Tuggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This conflicting evidence creates a question of fact as to whether Tuggle would have lived but for Wagoner\u2019s calling Tuggle back to Minor Street from his trip to the hospital and his ongoing failure to seek professional medical treatment for him. It is the province of the jury \u201cto weigh the facts and to judge the credibility of the various lay and expert witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Presley, </em>256 Va. 465, 470, 507 S.E.2d 72, 75 (1998). A jury may reject a witness\u2019 testimony in part and accept it in part. <em>Hopkins v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 280, 293, 337 S.E.2d 264, 273 (1985). Here, the jury was entitled to believe Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony that Tuggle had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>twenty-five percent chance of survival and to conclude that Tuggle would have lived had Wagoner sought professional medical treatment for him. We find that a twenty-five percent chance of survival is sufficient to take the question of whether Tuggle would have survived absent Wagoner\u2019s neglect \u201cout of the realm of mere conjecture, or speculation, and into the realm of legitimate inference,\u201d thus making the question ripe for submission to the jury. <em>Beale v. Jones, </em>210 Va. 519, 522, 171 S.E.2d 851, 853 (1970) (quoting <em>Hawkins v. Beecham, </em>168 Va. 553, 561, 191 S.E. 640, 643 (1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Alternatively, the jury was entitled to believe Dr. Berry\u2019s testimony that Tuggle\u2019s wounds only required some outpatient care. From this testimony the jury could infer that Tuggle\u2019s wounds were not life-threatening in themselves. Taken with Dr. Suzuki\u2019s testimony, the jury could infer that these non-life-threatening injuries left untreated by a medical professional resulted in pneumonia and led to his death. Thus, the jury could have found that Tuggle\u2019s death would not have occurred but for Wagoner\u2019s actions, namely his directions to the staff to bring Tuggle back to Minor Street while en route to the hospital, and his decision to keep Tuggle at the home even though there is evidence that he saw for himself the seriousness of Tuggle\u2019s burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u201cGreat respect is accorded a jury verdict.\u201d <em>Hall v. Hall, </em>240 Va. 360, 363, 397 S.E.2d 829, 831 (1990). The \u201ctime-honored standard\u201d that a court must apply in deciding whether to approve a verdict is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cIf there is conflict of testimony on a material point, or if reasonably [fair minded] men may differ as to the conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent upon the weight to be given the testimony, in all such cases the verdict of the jury is final and conclusive and cannot be disturbed either by the trial court or by this court, or if improperly set aside by the trial court, it will be reinstated by this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Forbes &amp; Co. v. S. Cotton Oil Co., </em>130 Va. 245, 259, 108 S.E. 15, 19 (1921)). Based on the evidence in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>case, we find that fair minded men and women could differ as to whether Wagoner\u2019s actions and/or inactions constituted neglect that resulted in Tuggle\u2019s death, thus the trial court properly submitted the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Wagoner argues that the Commonwealth must have proved a <em>probability </em>that Tuggle would have survived with different treatment, or in other words, a greater than fifty percent chance of survival. We do not agree. If the only evidence in this case was Dr. Whaley\u2019s testimony that Tuggle only had a twenty-five percent chance of survival, a jury could find that Wagoner\u2019s act of calling Tuggle back while en route to the hospital and failure to correct his action by seeking professional medical treatment hastened Tuggle\u2019s death and destroyed his twenty-five percent chance of survival. It would defeat the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-369(B) to relieve Wagoner of criminal liability only because Tuggle did not have a fifty-one percent chance of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Further, Wagoner\u2019s position is not founded in Virginia law. Virginia case law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not hold that the Commonwealth must prove a probability of greater than fifty percent chance of the victim\u2019s survival absent the defendant\u2019s neglect in order to create a jury question on proximate cause of death. While the Supreme Court in <em>Blondel </em>advised against including the substantial possibility of survival in jury instructions, it affirmed that the law of Virginia is that where there is at least a <em>substantial possibility </em>of survival, proximate causation of death is a question for the jury. <em>Blondel, </em>241 Va. at 472-73, 403 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The Virginia Supreme Court has clearly not equated a \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d to a \u201cprobability\u201d of survival and common sense suggests that a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d is somewhat less of a quantification than a \u201cprobability.\u201d \u201c[0]ur decisions have stated emphatically, in medical malprac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>tice-wrongful death cases, that a defendant physician\u2019s destruction of \u2018any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival\u2019 is \u2018a proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 403 S.E.2d at 343.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201cWhen a physician\u2019s or surgeon\u2019s negligent action or inaction has effectively terminated a person\u2019s chance of survival, he will not be permitted to raise conjectures as to possible chances for survival that he has put beyond realization. If there was any substantial possibility of survival and the defendant has destroyed it, he is answerable. Rarely is it possible to demonstrate to an absolute certainty what would have happened if certain actions had been taken.

United States, </em>215 F.3d 460 (4th Cir.2000), the Fourth Circuit found in its review of Virginia case law that Virginia adheres to \u201cthe traditional standard of proximate cause and that requiring a plaintiff to prove destruction of a \u2018substantial possibility of survival\u2019 is equivalent to requiring the plaintiff to prove that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the decedent would have survived in the absence of the defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463. The Fourth Circuit states that in traditional negligence cases, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove that the \u2018defendant\u2019s breach of duty was more likely than not (i.e., probably) the cause of injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hurley v. United States, </em>923 F.2d 1091, 1094 (4th Cir.1991)). The Fourth Circuit reached the conclusion that Virginia courts interpret \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d as equivalent to \u201cprobability of survival\u201d after a review of the Virginia Supreme Court opinions, none of which explicitly reach this conclusion. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Whitfield, </em>210 Va. at 184, 169 S.E.2d at 568-69 (\u201cWhen a physician\u2019s or surgeon\u2019s negligent action or inaction has effectively terminated a person\u2019s chance of survival, he will not be permitted to raise conjectures as to possible chances for survival that he has put beyond realization.\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Brown, </em>229 Va. at 533, 331 S.E.2d at 446 (There was evidence to support a finding that the doctor\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of death because a prompt diagnosis would have enabled proper treatment with medication \u201cwhich would have substantially increased the patient\u2019s chances of living, according to the testimony.\u201d); <em>Hadeed, </em>237 Va. at 287, 377 S.E.2d at 594 (The evidence indicated that if Hadeed had received the proper treatment at the time the doctor examined him, \u201che would have had a substantial <em>possibility </em>of surviving.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Griffett v.

Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 683, 674 S.E.2d 577 (2009), a child neglect case where the appellant\u2019s conviction was reversed because this Court found the evidence did not show that she recognized the severity of the child\u2019s injuries and willfully disregarded the importance of obtaining medical assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 674 S.E.2d at 580. The child had been burned prior to arriving at the appellant\u2019s home. The child\u2019s second degree burns had been treated by his parents with ointment and then wrapped with gauze and secured with duct tape. Appellant was told the child had some burns from playing in hot water. However, the wounds were completely bound so that appellant could not see the extent of his injuries and the child did not show any signs of discomfort. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 674 S.E.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This case is more akin to <em>Flowers v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 241, 248-50, 639 S.E.2d 313, 317 (2007), where this Court affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction for felony child neglect, finding that the evidence supported that Flowers acted willfully in neglecting to seek medical care for the child. \u201c[E]ven though Flowers believed that the children had taken something and that they needed immediate medical attention, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>failed to call 911 or to take any other prompt action to secure medical attention for the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 639 S.E.2d at 317. She waited three hours to call the child\u2019s father who lived some distance away, and requested that he refrain from calling the police or the child\u2019s mother to avoid \u201cany hoopla.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable fact finder could find that the appellant\u2019s \u201cactions and deliberate inaction\u201d \u201c \u2018created a situation placing the child at risk of actual physical harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249, 639 S.E.2d at 317 (quoting <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 170, 183, 597 S.E.2d 104, 110 (2004)). Thus, the Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s classification of the appellant\u2019s conduct as a \u201cwillful omission\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(B)(1). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Unlike in <em>Shanklin, </em>in the present case Wagoner was able to view Tuggle\u2019s burns about twelve hours after Tuggle sustained the injuries. Like in <em>Flowers, </em>the jury was entitled to believe that Wagoner knew that Tuggle was severely burned, but did not seek proper treatment for Tuggle in order to avoid undesirable personal consequences. Collins testified that on the morning of February 9, staff members stood Tuggle up in front of Wagoner and Tuggle was not wearing clothes, indicating that Wagoner could see all of Tuggle\u2019s burns. Collins was \u201cin shock\u201d when he saw Tuggle\u2019s \u201cvery bad\u201d burns. He described that there was no flesh on the back of Tuggle\u2019s head, his hair was melted to him, and there were burns down to his feet. He also noted that Tuggle looked like he was hurting.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Baker testified that Tuggle\u2019s t-shirt was lifted up to his shoulders so Wagoner could inspect Tuggle\u2019s wounds and Tuggle\u2019s skin was really red and the skin had peeled away. Kenny A. decided Tuggle\u2019s burns were bad enough that he should send Tuggle to the hospital that morning. The jury was entitled to believe the testimony of these witnesses and to infer that Wagoner also saw that Tuggle had very severe burns, and not a minor \u201csunburn\u201d type injury. Epley also testified that the situation at Minor Street on February 9 was chaotic and overwhelming and everybody was talking at once. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The jury could infer from her testimony that the employees present thought a significant injury had occurred and their concern fueled a chaotic environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Then there is the evidence that Wagoner recalled the van as it was transporting Tuggle to the hospital on February 9 so he could take a look at Tuggle. Wagoner looked at Tuggle and then sat in the privacy of Epley\u2019s car and expressed concern that Social Services was going to investigate them. Collins saw from a distance that Wagoner acted upset and agitated in the car. Later the same day, Epley twice encouraged Wagoner to report the incident but he did not report Tuggle\u2019s injuries to the Office of Licensing until seven days later and only because the police made a wellness check on Tuggle. The jury was entitled to consider all of these circumstances and could infer that Wagoner decided not to seek professional medical care for Tuggle in order to avoid investigation and to protect his own self interests. The jury was entitled to disregard Wagoner\u2019s story that he thought Tuggle only had a minor injury and that he relied on the advice Tarpley relayed from a pharmacist and someone at the hospital who had never observed Tuggle\u2019s wounds. The jury was also entitled to consider that Wagoner knew his employees, upon whom he relied to educate him on Tuggle\u2019s condition, did not have any advanced burn training. Given the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable fact finder could conclude that Wagoner acted purposefully and willfully in failing to seek professional medical care for Tuggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Wagoner\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">.

Thus, the issue on appeal is whether the jury\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect \u201cresulted] in\u201d Tuggle\u2019s death is supported by credible evidence. Code \u00a7 18.2-369(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">I agree with the majority\u2019s observation, based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Burrage v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 881, 187 L.Ed.2d 715 (2014), that the phrase, \u201cresults in the death,\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-269(B), is the functional equivalent of \u201cproximately causes the death.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cA frequently quoted definition of proximate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>is that it is a cause \u2018which, in natural and continuous sequence ... produces the injury, and without which the result would not have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v.

In the present case, the above, well-settled principles of proximate cause in Virginia were accurately reflected in Jury Instruction No. 17, which provided that \u201c[a] proximate cause of death is a cause that, in natural and continuous sequence, results in death. <em>It is a cause without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Rule 3A:15 establishes the standards to be applied by a trial court when considering a motion to strike and a motion to set aside a jury verdict. In pertinent part, the standard is the same for both motions \u2014 whether \u201cthe evidence is sufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction.\u201d Rule 3A:15(a), (b). Indeed, as the majority points out, under this standard and Code \u00a7 8.01-680 the trial court \u201cshall not set aside [a jury verdict] unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">\u201cIf there is a conflict in the testimony on a material point, or if reasonable [persons] may differ in their conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent on the weight to be given the testimony, the trial judge cannot substitute his conclusion for that of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>merely because he would have voted for a different verdict if he had been on the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><em>Doherty, </em>273 Va. at 424, 641 S.E.2d at 94 (quoting <em>Lane, </em>220 Va. at 581, 260 S.E.2d at 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">When considering a motion to strike the evidence as insufficient to establish proximate cause in a wrongful death case, however, the Supreme Court has provided additional \u201cguidance\u201d to trial courts beyond the standard established in Rule 3A:15(a). <em>Blondel, </em>241 Va. at 473-74, 403 S.E.2d at 344. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Q\">deciding a motion to strike the evidence ..., if a plaintiffs evidence has shown that the defendant\u2019s negligence <em>has destroyed any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival, </em>then there is sufficient evidence of proximate cause to go to the jury, and <em>a motion to strike the evidence </em>on that ground should be overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 474, 403 S.E.2d at 344 (emphasis added). Considering this additional guidance in the present case, at the motion to strike stage, the evidence established that without treatment, Tuggle had a 100% chance of dying from his burns. With treatment, however, he would have had a thirteen to twenty-five percent chance of survival. Consequently, when appellant decided not to send Tuggle to the hospital, he destroyed a substantial possibility of Tuggle\u2019s survival. Thus, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence as insufficient to establish proximate cause and sent the issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The Supreme Court went on in <em>Blondel, </em>however, to explain that \u201c \u2018[t]he substantial possibility of survival\u2019 standard, while furnishing the criterion for deciding a motion to strike, was never designed for the guidance of a jury.\u201d 241 Va. at 474, 403 S.E.2d at 344. This is because the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard is <em>not </em>the law of proximate cause in the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 403 S.E.2d at 344 (\u201cCourts in a number of other jurisdictions have adopted the \u2018substantial possibility of survival\u2019 standard for jury instructions ..., [but] we are not persuaded of the wisdom of that policy.\u201d); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>Cooper v.

Rather, it is to be \u201cemployed as a decisional standard for the <em>guidance </em>of trial courts in deciding a motion to strike the evidence\u201d as insufficient to establish proximate cause in wrongful death cases. <em>Blondel, </em>241 Va. at 473-74, 403 S.E.2d at 344 (emphasis added). In other words, once a case makes it past the motion to strike stage, the jury\u2019s function is to decide the issue of \u201cproximate cause\u201d according to the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cwell-settled law,\u201d not according to whether a substantial possibility of survival was destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 403 S.E.2d at 344. Our Supreme Court did not intend for the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard to be applied when considering a motion to set aside a jury verdict for lack of proximate cause, as the majority suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Consequently, when considering a motion to set aside a jury verdict for lack of proximate cause of death, a trial court should not seek to determine whether the evidence established that a substantial possibility of a victim\u2019s survival was destroyed, but rather, it should seek only to determine whether \u201cthe evidence is insufficient <em>as a matter of law </em>to sustain a conviction.\u201d Rule 3A:15(b) (emphasis added). Accordingly, when considering appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict in the present case, the trial court should have considered the well-settled law of proximate cause in the Commonwealth, and then asked whether the jury\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect proximately caused Tuggle\u2019s death was \u201c \u2018plainly wrong or without credible evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doherty, </em>273 Va. at 424, 641 S.E.2d at 94 (quoting <em>Lane, </em>220 Va. at 581, 260 S.E.2d at 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In its letter opinion denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict, however, the trial court inappropriately applied the \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard as the law of proximate cause in the Commonwealth, stating that \u201c[i]n the court\u2019s view, a twenty-five percent chance of survival represents a substantial possibility of survival, and the jury was entitled to find that [appellant\u2019s] abuse or neglect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Tuggle was a proximate cause of his death.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In so holding, the trial court specifically relied upon <em>Brown v. Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 331 S.E.2d 440 (1985), and <em>Whitfield v. Whittaker Mem. Hosp., </em>210 Va. 176, 169 S.E.2d 563 (1969), in which the trial courts were reversed for incorrectly <em>striking plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Blondel, </em>241 Va. at 473, 403 S.E.2d at 344. The \u201csubstantial possibility of survival\u201d standard, however, was rejected by the Supreme Court as an incorrect statement of the law of proximate cause. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 403 S.E.2d at 344 (\u201cCourts in a number of other jurisdictions have adopted the \u2018substantial possibility of survival\u2019 standard for jury instructions ..., [but] we are not persuaded of the wisdom of that policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In deciding a motion to set aside a jury verdict, the appropriate inquiry is whether \u201cthe evidence is insufficient <em>as a matter of law </em>to sustain a conviction.\u201d Rule 3A:15(b) (emphasis added). Deciding whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, as a matter of law, requires the trial court to apply the correct law \u2014 in this case, on the issue of proximate causation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That appears not to have been done. Accordingly, I would hold that when considering appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict, the trial court erred by applying a decisional standard intended only as \u201cguidance\u201d when deciding a <em>motion to strike the evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>I would further hold that the trial court erred in denying the motion to set aside the jury verdict because the jury\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect of Tuggle was a proximate cause of Tuggle\u2019s death was \u201c \u2018plainly wrong [and] without credible evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doherty, </em>273 Va. at 424, 641 S.E.2d at 94 (quoting <em>Lane, </em>220 Va. at 581, 260 S.E.2d at 240).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Suzuki testified that thirty percent of Tuggle\u2019s body was burned and that his cause of death was sepsis and pneumonia resulting from these thermal injuries. Whaley testified that without treatment, Tuggle\u2019s risk of death was 100%, and with treatment, he had a thirteen to twenty-five percent chance of survival. This evidence establishes that, in all probability, Tuggle would have died regardless of appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect. No evidence was presented, and no inference could arise, suggesting a likelihood of survival \u201cbut for\u201d appellant\u2019s abuse and neglect. As such, no reasonable trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \u201cbut for\u201d appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect, Tuggle would have survived. Or, in other words, no reasonable trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that without appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect Tuggle\u2019s death would not have occurred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The facts of the present case are similar to the majority\u2019s hypothetical example of an incapacitated adult who becomes ill or injured through no fault of the responsible party, and the \u201cprompt or heroic measures\u201d of the responsible party would not save the victim from death. As the majority notes, in this scenario, the responsible party\u2019s inaction would not qualify as a proximate cause of the victim\u2019s death. Similarly, in the present case, no evidence was presented upon which a jury could base its verdict that appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect was a proximate cause of death. I, therefore, would hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>jury\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s abuse or neglect of Tuggle was a proximate cause of Tuggle\u2019s death was unsupported, as a matter of law. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">. While the United States Supreme Court in <em>Burrage </em>distinguished between \u201cactual cause\u201d and \u201clegal cause [often called proximate cause]\u201d and then went on to address the \"results from\u201d language only in the context of actual cause, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 134 S.Ct. at 887-88, \"there are inconsistencies in the national legal nomenclature as to whether [actual cause] is considered to be a subset of proximate cause or whether [actual cause], in addition to proximate cause, ... together create legal cause.\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Boomer, </em>285 Va. 141, 151 n. 2, 736 S.E.2d 724, 728 n. 2 (2013).

As the majority notes, this instruction was uncontested and thus, at a minimum, is the law of the case. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Thomas Baker Real Estate, Ltd., </em>237 Va. 649, 652, 379 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1989) (\"instructions given without objection become the law of the case and thereby bind the parties in the trial court and this Court on review\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. The majority's suggestion that \"a jury could find that Wagoner's act of calling Tuggle back while en route to the hospital and failure to correct his action by seeking professional medical treatment hastened Tuggle's death and destroyed his twenty-five percent chance of survival'' also has the effect of applying the \"substantial possibility of survival\" standard as the law of proximate cause in Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">. Although the same language is used in Rule 3A:15 for deciding a motion to strike the evidence and a motion to set aside a verdict, the Supreme Court, in <em>Blondel, </em>has provided additional guidance for a trial court to apply in considering a motion to strike the evidence on the issue of proximate cause in death actions, 241 Va. at 473-74, 403 S.E.2d at 344, favoring submission of such cases to the jury. This additional guidance does not change the Commonwealth's law of proximate causation and therefore does not lessen the standard for considering a motion to set aside a jury verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. I respectfully suggest that the extent to which the majority relies on Dr. Berry\u2019s testimony, regarding Tuggle's cause of death, as evidence to support the jury's determination is misplaced because the trial court declined to qualify Berry as an expert in forensic pathology, holding that \"Dr. Berry cannot express an opinion as to cause of death because that is outside his area of expertise.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b314-16\">.
