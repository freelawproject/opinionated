HUMPHREYS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Robert Wayne Dawson, II (\u201cDawson\u201d) appeals his conviction of strangulation, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6, after a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Lancaster County (\u201ctrial court\u201d). Dawson argues that the evidence is insufficient to prove that the strangulation caused a wounding or bodily injury to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). In this light, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In July 2012, Dawson was living at the Knight\u2019s Inn hotel in Richmond with his girlfriend and their young child (collectively, \u201cthe family\u201d). Knight\u2019s Inn was forcing the family to leave due to lack of funds. Dawson called his mother, Penney Pittman (\u201cPittman\u201d), the victim, and told her this news and that the family was going to live in a tent in the woods. Pittman drove from Lancaster County to pick up the family on July 25, 2012. Pittman and the family arrived at Pittman\u2019s home in Lancaster County in the early evening of July 25. The family spent the night at Pittman\u2019s house, and Pittman washed the family\u2019s clothes from 6:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. on July 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Around 10:00 a.m. on July 26, Pittman informed Dawson that he could not stay on her property and he became upset. Dawson started cursing his mother and blaming her for their homelessness. Pittman was holding the child as Dawson was working himself up and yelling at Pittman. Dawson took the child and put him outside on the back deck. As Pittman was trying to go past Dawson to get the child, Dawson started grabbing her upper arms. Pittman pushed Dawson\u2019s chest to get away from him. Dawson grabbed Pittman several times\u2014 grabbing her arms, shoulders, and shirt \u2014 and then he hit her in the face. Pittman told Dawson to stop, and she turned away from him because the child was watching.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Once they were on the back deck, Dawson yanked Pittman\u2019s wrist down to the deck and spun her so that he was behind her and her back was physically touching his chest. His right hand was holding her right wrist and he pinned her hand into the side of her neck and squeezed her neck with the muscle from his right arm. Meanwhile, he \u201cslammed\u201d into her chest with his left hand. \u201cIt knocked the breath out of me. [A]t that point, I could hear my heart beat in my head because I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>couldn\u2019t breathe anymore. I didn\u2019t. Everything started going black.\u201d Pittman continued, \u201cI started to hear my heart beat very loudly. There was pressure on the side of my neck, on both sides.\u201d She reiterated that the pressure was from her hand that Dawson was holding beside her neck on one side and from his upper right arm muscle on the other side. Pittman felt like she was \u201cdrowning without water\u201d because of the pressure inside of her head, and her heartbeat was getting louder and louder.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Pittman believes she lost consciousness, but she could not say for certain. She remembered reaching for Dawson\u2019s girlfriend, who backed away, and then the next thing she knew is that she was on her knees as if Dawson had just dropped her there on the deck beside the picnic table. Once she realized she was down on the deck, she saw blood on her hands and she had a pain in the left side of her chest. At first she thought she had been stabbed. She felt the deck shaking as she was trying to get her \u201cwits together.\u201d As she started to turn, she saw Dawson coming towards her with his right hand raised. He was walking fast and hard towards her while she was still on her knees holding on to the picnic table and trying to get up. Dawson hit Pittman in the back of her head, and her face hit the deck railing. Dawson went inside the house for a few seconds and then came back out, yelling at Pittman again.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">While waiting for help to arrive, Pittman noticed that her nose was bleeding and that physically she was in a \u201cpretty bad situation.\u201d She was also bleeding inside of her mouth on the same side that her face hit the railing. Her arms and chest were hurting. \u201cThe sides of my neck were actually hurting. I just \u2014 my ribs were hurting.\u201d \u201cI was hurting from my neck to my ankles.\u201d Later that day, Pittman\u2019s bruises started to appear. She had bruises on her upper arms and lower arms, a large bruise on her chest, a bruise on her left torso, and bruises all the way down both of her legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The day after the incident, Pittman\u2019s friend took her to the Chesapeake Medical Group where nurse practitioner Christine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Collins (\u201cCollins\u201d) examined her. Collins testified that Pittman \u201chad contusion-type wounds about her face. She had injuries about her neck. She had chest wounds. She had bruises on her legs[,] [bjruises on her arms ... and sort of a dark red ligature-type wound around her neck.\u201d On cross-examination, Collins again testified that Pittman had a dark red bruise on her neck. There was no break in the skin on Pittman\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Collins was suspicious that Pittman had a rib fracture and head injuries so she sent Pittman to Rappahannock General for X-rays. X-rays showed that Pittman sustained a fracture to the rib.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pittman received several prescription medications for her pain. Pittman returned to see Collins two days later, and Pittman was transferred to the Medical College of Virginia where she was admitted for four days with post-concussive syndrome and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Pittman did not have any lasting effect from the injuries around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Without elaborating on its findings of fact, the trial court found Dawson guilty of assault and battery and strangulation. Dawson does not contest his assault and battery conviction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AsY\">Dawson\u2019s assignment of error is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">The circuit court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to convict the defendant/appellant, Robert W. Dawson, II, (\u201cDawson\u201d) in Indictment No. CR12-238 (violation of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6) by ruling \u201cI do believe the evidence supports that charge,\u201d because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove that any strangulation caused a wounding or bodily injury to Pittman, the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we must \u201c \u2018examine the evidence that supports the conviction and allow the conviction to stand unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, </em>282 Va. 16, 20, 710 S.E.2d 733, 735 (2011) (quoting <em>Vincent v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 648, 652, 668 S.E.2d 137, 139-40 (2008)). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the prevailing party below, and determine whether \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cFurthermore, we \u2018accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 90, 95, 712 S.E.2d 464, 466 (2011) (quoting <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 123, 130, 654 S.E.2d 910, 913 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6, enacted in 2012, provides that, \u201cAny person who, without consent, impedes the blood circulation or respiration of another person by knowingly, intentionally, and unlawfully applying pressure to the neck of such person resulting in the wounding or bodily injury of such person is guilty of strangulation, a Class 6 felony.\u201d Pertinent to this appeal is the interpretation of the terms \u201cwounding\u201d and \u201cbodily injury.\u201d While these terms are not defined in the statute, they have been interpreted as used in other statutes in the Virginia Code, particularly the malicious wounding statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-51,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which this Court may look for guidance. <em>See King v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (\u201cThe validity of using other Code sections as interpretive guides is well established. The Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>\u201c[T]o prove the existence of a \u2018wound,\u2019 the Commonwealth must show that the victim\u2019s skin was broken or cut.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, 58 </em>Va.App. 303, 317, 709 S.E.2d 175, 182 (2011) (citing <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 409, 413, 35 S.E.2d 594, 595 (1945)). Here, it is uncontested that any breaks in Pittman\u2019s skin, or \u201cwounds,\u201d were caused by Dawson\u2019s battery of Pittman and not the act of strangulation. Therefore, the only issue before us is whether the evidence was sufficient to show that Pittman suffered a \u201cbodily injury\u201d as a result of Dawson applying pressure to her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-51 nor Code \u00a7 18.2-51.6 defines bodily injury. \u201c[Cjourts have been reluctant to give juries a definition [of bodily injury] because the phrase has an \u2018everyday, ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 832, 531 S.E.2d 41, 43 (2000) (quoting <em>Stein v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 65, 69, 402 S.E.2d 238, 241 (1991) (interpreting bodily injury under Code \u00a7 18.2-51.1, malicious bodily injury to law-enforcement officers)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Bodily injury comprehends, it would seem, <em>any bodily hurt </em>whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831, 531 S.E.2d at 43 (quoting <em>Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 310, 316, 53 S.E.2d 54, 57 (1949)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In <em>Luck, </em>two state troopers were treated in the hospital after the appellant\u2019s vehicle collided with their vehicle. One trooper suffered stiffness for four to five days and took prescription medication for his low back pain. The other trooper \u201chad similar injuries,\u201d also suffering from back pain. <em>Id. </em>at 831, 531 S.E.2d at 42-43. This Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">[t]he evidence permits the finding that the two troopers suffered bodily injury when they received soft-tissue injuries that required medical treatment and caused pain and stiffness. If those injuries did not meet the requirements for bodily injury, we would have the anomaly of an \u201cevery<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>day, ordinary\u201d phrase having different meanings in criminal law and tort law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 832, 531 S.E.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 405 S.E.2d 1 (1991) (en banc) (superseded on other grounds), this Court found that there was sufficient evidence to uphold appellant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-51 when he beat his three-year-old stepson with a belt. While appellant did not break the toddler\u2019s skin, there was \u201cno question that the [appellant] caused his stepson \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 405 S.E.2d at 4. The child had bruises on his legs, back, and shoulders \u2014 the child\u2019s mother was shocked when she discovered the bruises, and the child\u2019s grandmother \u201cwent frantic\u201d when she saw them. The grandmother arranged for the child to go to the hospital where photographs were taken. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 405 S.E.2d at 3-4. While appellant argued that there must be a breaking of the skin to constitute malicious wounding, this Court held that \u201cthe statute has been more broadly interpreted to include any bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 405 S.E.2d at 4 (citing <em>Bryant, </em>189 Va. at 316-17, 53 S.E.2d at 57).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">More recently in <em>English v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 711, 715 S.E.2d 391 (2011), this Court again emphasized that it gives the phrase \u201cbodily injury\u201d its \u201c \u2018everyday, ordinary meaning,\u2019 \u201d \u201cwhich needs no technical, anatomical definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 715 S.E.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Luck, </em>32 Va.App. at 832, 531 S.E.2d at 43). The phrase includes \u201c \u2018any bodily hurt whatsoever.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bryant, </em>189 Va. at 316, 53 S.E.2d at 57). \u201cIt includes any \u2018detriment, hurt, loss, [or] impairment\u2019 that could fairly be considered an injury to the human body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718-19, 715 S.E.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>184 Va. at 416, 35 S.E.2d at 596). \u201cTo prove a bodily injury, the victim need not experience any observable wounds, cuts, or breaking of the skin. Nor must she offer proof of \u2018broken bones or bruises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 715 S.E.2d at 395 (quoting <em>Luck, </em>32 Va.App. at 831-32, 531 S.E.2d at 43). \u201c[I]nternal injuries \u2014 no less than external injuries \u2014 fall within the scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-51.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In this case, Pittman testified that Dawson applied pressure to her neck by pinning her hand to one side of her neck and squeezing the other side of her neck with his arm muscle. She was initially standing up when he committed this act. Pittman could not breathe; she described that she felt like she was drowning and everything started going black. She did not remember falling down, but she found herself on her knees. Pittman testified that the sides of her neck hurt, and the nurse practitioner testified that Pittman had dark red bruises around her neck the day following the incident. From this evidence, a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Dawson applied pressure to Pittman\u2019s neck which impeded her respiration and/or blood flow and that the bruises around Pittman\u2019s neck constituted a bodily injury that resulted from Dawson applying pressure to her neck.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. The parties stipulated to the evidence that the physician\u2019s reading of the X-ray indicated a recent injury to the rib but not the cause of the injury itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-51 provides in relevant part, \u201cIf any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be guilty of a Class 3 felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">. This Court said in <em>Stein, </em>\"It is a basic rule of statutory construction that a word in a statute is to be given its everyday ordinary meaning unless the word is a word of art.\u201d <em>Stein, </em>12 Va.App. at 69, 402 S.E.2d at 241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">. Because the record contains no medical evidence regarding whether Pittman's loss of consciousness had any negative impact on her physical health or well-being, and because the issue has not been briefed, we leave open the question of whether or not loss of consciousness standing alone would constitute a bodily injury as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
