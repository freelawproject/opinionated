On appeal, Papol argues the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>court should have dismissed the eleven second or subsequent counts. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, 265 </em>Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The evidence at trial proved that, on October 22, 2010, Papol downloaded from the Internet to his computer twelve sexually explicit images of prepubescent girls. To obtain the twelve images, Papol used a peer-to-peer, file-sharing program that downloads \u201ctorrent files\u201d from the Internet. App. at 258, 355-56. A digital forensic expert at trial explained that when someone downloads \u201ctorrent files,\u201d the program separately downloads different pieces of the files from different databases maintained by others who participate in the peer-to-peer, file-sharing program. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 355-56. The expert explained it this way: \u201cThe thing with torrents is you can download from ... not just one computer, but if you\u2019ve got 50 people with the same file on it, [the torrent program] can take bits and pieces from all 50 of those people and recreate it on your computer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Papol saved the twelve images on his computer using a folder titled, \u201cLS Magazine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350-51. The expert testified that \u201cLS Magazine\u201d refers to a notorious Ukrainian criminal enterprise that trafficked in pornographic images of prepubescent girls as young as ten. <em>Id. </em>at 352-53. Upon his arrest, Papol gave a full confession and admitted that the twelve images he downloaded involved girls appearing to be \u201cmaybe 12 and 13\u201d years old. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 282. A grand jury indicted Papol on one count of possession of child pornography <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and eleven counts of possession of child pornography, second or subsequent violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">At trial, Papol argued that \u201cbecause he ha[d] never been previously convicted\u201d of possessing child pornography, \u201cthere is no predicate offense\u201d for the eleven charges alleging a \u201csecond or subsequent violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. \u201cAs a result,\u201d Papol reasoned, the eleven charges \u201cmust be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court rejected Papol\u2019s argument and found him guilty on all twelve counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On appeal, Papol argues that the eleven \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d charges under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B) should have been dismissed because he had never been previously convicted of possession of child pornography. Papol also contends that, in any event, he did not commit a second or subsequent violation because he received the images during a single download. For several reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">A criminal defendant violates Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A) when he \u201cknowingly possesses child pornography.\u201d The crime involves the act of <em>possessing </em>child pornography \u2014 not the act of acquiring it. As Papol concedes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A) tailors the unit of prosecution analysis to \u201cthe number of individual items of sexually explicit visual material\u201d possessed by the defendant. <em>Chapman v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 725, 732, 697 S.E.2d 20, 24 (2010) (quoting <em>Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 39, 48, 636 S.E.2d 480, 484 (2006)). The only qualification is that each image possessed must individually fit within the definition of \u201cchild pornography\u201d as defined by Code .\u00a7 18.2~374.KA).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">This analysis tracks the underlying purpose of the statute to protect children from pornographers, pedophiles, and others who seek to take advantage of their vulnerabilities. <em>See Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 301, 309, 288 S.E.2d 461, 465 (1982) (discussing Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1). \u201cThe prevention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\u201d <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 757, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3355, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). The children in the images possessed by Papol were real children. The pornographers who took the pictures did so because there was a market for it \u2014 a market \u201cintrinsically related to the underlying abuse\u201d of the children being exploited. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>559 U.S. 460, 471, 130 S.Ct. 1577, 1586, 176 L.Ed.2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because child pornography has this \u201cproximate link to the crime from which it came,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>535 U.S. 234, 250, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 1401, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002)), the possessors of child pornography should be held accountable for each violation, no less than the pornographers themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1 reinforces these legislative policies by adding an enhanced penalty for recidivists. Under subsection B, \u201cAny person who commits a second or subsequent violation of subsection A is guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d Papol contends that, even if he committed twelve separately prosecuted acts of possessing child pornography, he cannot be charged with eleven counts of \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d violations unless they physically occurred after he had already been convicted of the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Whether a recidivism statute requires evidence of prior violations or prior convictions is a straight-forward question of statutory interpretation. Virginia courts look solely to the text of the statute for the answer. <em>See Commonwealth v. Leone, </em>286 Va. 147, 150, 747 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2013). For example, in <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 38, 501 S.E.2d 391 (1998), a defendant was convicted under the recidivism statute governing habitual offenders of motor vehicle laws. The defendant claimed the \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d provision required a prior conviction. The statute, <em>Thomas </em>held, required only a \u201csecond or subsequent such offense\u201d and the legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201coffense\u201d in the recidivism provision \u201crather than the word \u2018conviction,\u2019 clearly demonstrates an intent to authorize punishment enhancement with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>out a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 501 S.E.2d at 393. This subtle, but important, distinction has been recognized by Virginia courts in many recidivism contexts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Unlike other Virginia statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B) does not use the word \u201cconviction\u201d as a predicate for the enhanced felony charge. Subsection B speaks only of a \u201csecond or subsequent violation\u201d of the child-pornography statute, which even more clearly denotes the underlying violative act. The plain terms of the statute thus demonstrate Papol\u2019s flawed reading of it. He committed the first violation when he possessed the first offending image. Each of the other images he possessed was a subsequent violation of the statute. Having possessed twelve different images of child pornography, Papol was properly charged with, and convicted of, one violation under subsection A of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1 and eleven second or subsequent violations under subsection B.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Even if a separate conviction for the first violation is not necessary, Papol continues, he never actually committed a second or subsequent violation because he received the images during a single download. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 4 (\u201c[W]hether the images were possessed as a result of a single download or multiple downloads is critical to this analysis.\u201d). Under Papol\u2019s reasoning, he could only be convicted of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>count of possession under subsection A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">If Papol\u2019s interpretation were correct, however, it would render Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:l\u2019s unit-of-prosecution analysis easily subject to manipulation. Under Papol\u2019s approach, the statute would allow his current set of convictions (one initial violation and eleven second or subsequent violations) if he had separately clicked \u201cdownload\u201d for each of the twelve images, even though it would take mere seconds to do so. But Papol\u2019s interpretation of the statute would not allow his convictions if he clicked \u201cdownload\u201d only once and initiated a torrent program that, as the Commonwealth\u2019s expert explained, retrieved each of the twelve images from decentralized sources and downloaded the data packets into an aggregate file \u2014 thereby presenting to peer-to-peer network users like Papol the efficiency of a one-click download. We think it highly improbable that the legislature intended the recidivism provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B) to be so easily evaded by the very individuals it was meant to deter and, failing that, to punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">After all, Papol was convicted of possessing \u2014 not downloading \u2014 child pornography. We do not believe the legislature intended the recidivism provision in Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B) to be evaded by aggregate downloading using a torrent program or to be determined by the precise micro-timing of the receipt of each image. It should not matter that the images were downloaded from the Internet during a single download episode any more than it should matter if they all arrived by mail in a single envelope. When multiple images are downloaded on a single occasion, one of those images invariably constitutes the first image possessed, while all the others qualify as second or subsequent images possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The trial court did not err in finding Papol guilty of one count of possession of child pornography, punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(A), and eleven counts of possession of child pornography, second or subsequent violations, punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1(B). Rejecting Papol\u2019s arguments to the contrary, we affirm each of these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">.
