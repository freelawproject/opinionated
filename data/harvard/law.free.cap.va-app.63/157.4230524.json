Appellants\u2019 single assignment of error is \u201cthat the evidence was insufficient to show by clear and convincing evidence that the Petitioner, Carlos Mendoza, failed to substantially remedy the conditions that brought his son, J.M., into [foster] care within the provisions of [ ] Code \u00a7 16.1-283.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we note that although both Thach and Mendoza jointly appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to terminate their parental rights, appellants only assign error to the circuit court\u2019s termination of Mendoza\u2019s parental rights. Consequently, notwithstanding the style of the case and the fact that Thach argues that the circuit court erred in terminating her parental rights, we do not consider her arguments. Rule 5A:20(c); <em>see Fox v. Fox, </em>61 Va.App. 185, 202-03, 734 S.E.2d 662, 670 (2012) (an issue is waived when it is not included in appellant\u2019s assignment of error).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cOn appeal from the [denial of a petition for the] termination of parental rights, this Court is required to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Tackett v. Arlington Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>62 Va.App. 296, 303, 746 S.E.2d 509, 513 (2013). Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to DHS, the evidence establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>A. J.M. \u2019s Initial Placement in Foster Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In August 2010, DHS began to receive complaints that Thach was physically neglecting her son J.M., born December 4, 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After an investigation, DHS reported that J.M. was being physically abused because the family was facing eviction, the utilities had been disconnected, Thach was under the influence of substances while caring for J.M., and was leaving him with inadequate caregivers. At that time, J.M. was in the sole custody of Thach. Thach reported that J.M.\u2019s father, Mendoza, did not live with them as he had been deported to Mexico. Thach refused to give DHS any contact information for Mendoza. DHS obtained a protective order in March 2011. DHS provided the family services to prevent J.M.\u2019s removal, including mental health services for Thach, housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>and employment services, and daycare services. Thach failed to comply with DHS\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The Arlington County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (the \u201cJ <em>&amp; </em>DR court\u201d) granted DHS\u2019s petition to remove J.M. from Thach\u2019s custody on June 29, 2011. Thach had failed to make appropriate child care arrangements for J.M. \u2014 she left him with individuals whom she could not provide DHS with basic information for, such as last names or telephone numbers. In August 2011, the goal of DHS\u2019s first foster care plan was to return J.M. to Thach\u2019s custody. The plan required Thach to complete certain requirements before J.M. could be returned to her care, which included compliance with mental health services, maintain a source of income, refrain from drug use, receive parenting education, and obtain stable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>B. Mendoza\u2019s Involvement with DHS While J.M. was in Foster Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Both parties acknowledge that there have never been any accusations that Mendoza abused or neglected J.M., or was in any way involved with the circumstances requiring J.M.\u2019s removal from Thach\u2019s custody. DHS\u2019s first contact with Mendoza was on October 6, 2011 when Mendoza accompanied Thach to a scheduled visitation with J.M. At that visitation he told DHS that he had been living and working in Arizona but had returned to Virginia where he was living with his maternal aunt. He said that the reason for the delay in initially seeing his son was that he was afraid of being deported again; however, he now had begun the legal process for obtaining a work permit and legal residency in the United States. At the October 6, 2011 meeting with DHS, Mendoza informed DHS that he was also the biological father of Thach\u2019s then unborn child. By the October 25, 2011 status hearing, Mendoza had moved back to Arizona but continued to attend visitations with J.M. in November and December 2011. DHS did not have any direct contact with Mendoza and only communicated with him through messages left with Thach. DHS\u2019s February 2012 progress report indicated that DHS had provided no services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to Mendoza because of difficulty communicating and meeting with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In March 2012, Mendoza moved in with Thach and began caring for their newborn son (\u201cJ.T.\u201d) while Thach was working. Mendoza reported to DHS that he had hired an immigration attorney and was applying for a work permit, however he was unable to get employment for fear it would affect his work permit application. J.M. began overnight visits with Mendoza, Thach, and J.T. in May 2012. J.M. refers to Mendoza as \u201cPapi\u201d and gives him \u201chugs and kisses.\u201d J.M. asks to see J.T. and gives his brother hugs and kisses. In the June 2012 progress report DHS reported that Thach and Mendoza \u201chave made tremendous progress.\u201d Specifically, \u201cMendoza continues to be a strong support in the home,\u201d and during his interactions with J.M. and J.T. \u201che is very active, attentive and loving with both boys ... responding] immediately when either child calls for attention.\u201d DHS referred Mendoza to parenting education classes and home-based services.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Three months later, on September 12, 2012, J.M.\u2019s social worker wrote a memo to the J &amp; DR court recommending the discontinuation of the goal of reunification and a change to a goal of adoption. Immediately preceding this change in recommendation, DHS had suspended J.M.\u2019s unsupervised visits due to Thach\u2019s missed and failed random drug screenings. Additionally, Thach had been sentenced to four weekends in jail for a traffic offense. Due to Thach\u2019s substance abuse issues, a safety plan was created for J.M.\u2019s younger brother J.T. The plan stipulated that Thach was not to be left alone with J.T., and Mendoza was to remain home with the infant. DHS was also concerned that Thach and Mendoza did not renew their housing assistance in July because they wished to pay their rent without assistance. Thach and Mendoza canceled two scheduled visitations with J.M. in late August. As of September 2012, Mendoza had not completed the recommended parenting classes. The parenting class coordinator left messages with Thach but never spoke directly to Mendoza. On September 8, 2012, DHS contacted Thach about scheduling a meeting to discuss alternative plans to J.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>returning home, such as possible placement with a relative, but Thach told them that Mendoza was \u201caway at a beach\u201d and would not be back for a week. No meeting was ever scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\n<em>C. Termination of Mendoza\u2019s Parental Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On November 19, 2012, the J &amp; DR court approved the new goal of adoption and scheduled a termination hearing. However, the J &amp; DR court ordered that the case should be set out \u201cpast 90 days to give father more time to comply with the previous plan.\u201d The J &amp; DR court further ordered that DHS \u201cis required to help father with services,\u201d (but not mother) and \u201cif father is making progress, [DHS] is to file a new plan before the termination hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In December 2012, Mendoza successfully completed an eight to ten week parenting education program. Additionally, he submitted to the psychological evaluation ordered by the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court in January 2013, which was filed with that court in March 2013. The report recommended home support for Mendoza. DHS was concerned about Mendoza\u2019s \u201clack of insight into Thach\u2019s mental health and substance abuse needs.\u201d During the psychological evaluation, Mendoza stated that he did not think Thach had a substance abuse problem and that he felt comfortable with her caring for the children. On January 22, 2013, J.M.\u2019s social worker filed an affidavit for terminating Mendoza\u2019s rights. The only changes in circumstances since the November hearing noted in the affidavit were that Mendoza had enrolled and completed parenting classes in December 2012 and that Mendoza and Thach\u2019s landlord reported that they were behind on their rent and utility bills as of January 16, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Thach moved out of the family\u2019s residence by March 13, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 14, 2013, the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court terminated both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Thach\u2019s and Mendoza\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). At the J &amp; DR court termination hearing, DHS had no major concerns about Mendoza\u2019s ability to care for the children on his own; however, DHS\u2019s \u201cmajor concern was related to [Mendoza\u2019s] acknowledgement of [] Thach\u2019s substance abuse issues, and his lack of acknowledgement that she continued to abuse substances, and [sic] around the children.\u201d DHS\u2019s position was that Mendoza\u2019s unawareness demonstrated his inability to protect the children from Thach\u2019s substance abuse issues. Mendoza concedes that he still did not fully acknowledge Thach\u2019s substance issue at the J &amp; DR hearing. Mendoza and Thach appealed the J &amp; DR court\u2019s decision to terminate their parental rights to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">During the June 10, 2013 circuit court hearing, Mendoza testified that Thach moved out in March because he wanted to recover his children. Mendoza then acknowledged that Thach had a substance abuse problem. When he was asked why he now felt differently than he had at the time of the March termination hearing he said \u201cshe hasn\u2019t done her part, and I am just here to get my children, because I love them ... I don\u2019t want to lose them.\u201d He stated that he was willing to do whatever was necessary to get his child back. When the Commonwealth asked what role Thach would play in his children\u2019s lives if he was granted custody, Mendoza responded: \u201cAt the present time, I don\u2019t think \u2014 none. At this point in time, I just want to make progress with them. I don\u2019t think she has any role to play.\u201d Mendoza stated that his plan for the future was to continue \u201cworking hard, being a dedicated parent to them, feed them, bathe them, and you know, raise them the way they should be raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The record is devoid of any indication that Mendoza has in any way abused or neglected either of his sons, or ever used any drugs himself. When DHS visited Mendoza\u2019s home after Thach moved out, DHS did not find any indication that it was an inappropriate place for children or anything but a loving and familial environment. DHS did not have any concerns about Mendoza\u2019s ability to care for J.M.\u2019s younger brother J.T. on his own. Mendoza testified that he has been living and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>caring for J.T. alone since March. He has begun scheduled visits with J.M. without Thach. Mendoza testified that he is confident he can administer J.M.\u2019s asthma medications. Although he did not complete the home-based services DHS recommended in August 2012, DHS acknowledges that at the time of the circuit court hearing Mendoza was participating in \u201csome sort of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Mendoza testified, and was cross-examined, extensively about his employment and housing situation. He has been working for the same employer doing drywall installation in Washington D.C. for over six months. He is paid in cash biweekly between $1,300 and $1,400. He does not have any credit cards or a bank account. The proof of employment Mendoza provided consisted of personal checks. His rent is $1,200 a month. Although Thach has not lived in the residence since March, her name is the only adult\u2019s name on the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After terminating Thach\u2019s parental rights, which the circuit court referred to as \u201cthe easier of the two cases,\u201d the circuit court next turned to the issue of Mendoza\u2019s parental rights. The circuit court acknowledged that there is no debate that Mendoza wants to care for his children; however, the judge noted that the issues he has with \u201chis entire case is that he came to the table very, very late.\u201d If \u201cthe light bulb went off for [] Mendoza about [Thachj\u2019s inability to care for the children, it came on the eve, if not the day, of the last termination of parental rights trial.\u201d The circuit court noted that if Mendoza\u2019s involvement had been earlier the \u201ccounty would have addressed things a little differently\u201d because there were \u201chome based services that weren\u2019t taken advantage of,\u201d which could have helped Mendoza with \u201chands-on care for [J.M.] and build him up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The circuit court was very concerned with Mendoza\u2019s ability to provide \u201cthe stability a three year old requires or the good judgment that a parent must bring to the table.\u201d In particular, the circuit court noted that Mendoza did not have a valid lease, and because of his illegal alien status \u201che probably can\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>get a lease with his name on it.\u201d The circuit court also cited the fact that both Mendoza and Thach ignored the opportunity for rent subsidy and delayed getting home-based services. The circuit court also concluded that Mendoza ignored Thach\u2019s substance abuse issues \u201cfor the longest time\u201d and found Mendoza\u2019s \u201ccredibility severely lacking\u201d because he had a lot of inconsistencies in his testimony about what jobs he had when and who was actually paying him. Further the record contained conflicting evidence about \u201cwhen he left the country, when he came back, when he was with [ ] Thach, when he wasn\u2019t with [ ] Thach, when he was with [J.M.], when he was with [J.T.], when he wasn\u2019t, when he was in Arizona.\u201d Finally, the circuit court found that Mendoza failed to take advantage of opportunities to visit with J.M. and rejected Mendoza\u2019s claims that he didn\u2019t know about J.M.\u2019s medical appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">In sum, the circuit court found that Mendoza was unavailable to provide a stable home for J.M. and could not \u201cwait another six months or 60 days to figure it out.\u201d The circuit court further found that J.M. \u201chas a stable home right now\u201d and is \u201cnot only being well cared for, he is thriving\u201d in foster care, and the \u201cthe evidence would not support that if [the circuit court] returned him to ... dad\u2019s care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">II. Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, [circuit] courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991) (quoting <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990)). This Court presumes that the circuit court \u201c \u2018thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOn appeal from the termination of parental rights, this Court is required to review the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the circuit court.\u201d <em>Tackett, </em>62 Va.App. at 303, 746 S.E.2d at 513. Where the circuit court\u2019s judgment is based on evidence heard ore tenus, its decision to terminate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>parent\u2019s rights is entitled to great weight and \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan, </em>13 Va.App. at 128, 409 S.E.2d at 463 (quoting <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 364 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988)). Thus, this Court will not reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment terminating Mendoza\u2019s parental rights unless the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to DHS, was insufficient to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Before residual parental rights can be terminated under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) \u201ca trial judge must make two separate inquiries.\u201d <em>Richmond Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. 572, 579, 625 S.E.2d 670, 673 (2006). The circuit court must find, \u201cbased on clear and convincing evidence,\u201d that (i) \u201c[termination] is in the best interests of the child <em>and </em>\u201d (ii) DHS met its burden of proving the requirements of subsection (C)(2). Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0 (emphasis added); <em>see Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. at 578-79, 625 S.E.2d at 673.

In determining what is in the best interests of the child, the circuit court must evaluate and consider many factors: the age and physical and mental condition of the child; the age and physical and mental condition of the parent; the relationship existing between the parent and the child; the needs of the child; the role the parent has played, and will play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child; and any other such factors that are necessary. <em>Barkey v.

Heide, </em>35 Va.App. 328, 337, 544 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2001)). \u201cThe [circuit] court may discount the parent\u2019s current \u2018progress\u2019 if the best interests of the child would be served by termination,\u2019 \u201d or it \u201c \u2018may determine that a parent\u2019s delayed, but nonetheless substantial, progress may overcome the time delay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Heide, </em>35 Va.App. at 337, 544 S.E.2d at 894).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">This case presents an unusual situation because the parent whose rights are at issue not only had nothing to do with the neglect that caused J.M.\u2019s placement in foster care, but also did not even live with J.M. at the time he was removed from his mother\u2019s custody. This raises a question not previously considered by this Court: how does a parent similarly situated to Mendoza \u201cremedy the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement\u201d if he was not the cause of those conditions or living in the home when the conditions occurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">J.M. was initially removed from his mother\u2019s custody because she was neglecting him by abusing substances while caring for him and failing to obtain suitable childcare. J.M.\u2019s placement continued because Thach was unable to abstain from using substances and DHS was concerned that Mendoza and Thach could not provide a stable living situation. During the course of J.M.\u2019s placement in foster care, DHS\u2019s primary focus was on providing Thach with services in order for J.M. to be returned to her custody. DHS\u2019s only recommendations for Mendoza were to complete parenting classes and participate in home-based services. DHS was also concerned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Mendoza, because of his lack of awareness with respect to Thach\u2019s limitations, was unable to protect J.M. from neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Although it is accurate that Mendoza did not make substantial progress in complying with DHS\u2019s recommendations during the twelve-month statutory period, by the time of the circuit court hearing in June 2012 the record is also undisputed that he had made significant progress. Moreover, DHS did not begin offering Mendoza services until May 2012 \u2014 eleven months after J.M. was placed in foster care and one month shy of the expiration of the statutory period to demonstrate substantial progress. This seems to be the basis for the J &amp; DR court\u2019s decision in November 2012 to push back the termination hearing deadline to allow Mendoza more time to comply with the previous plan and ordered DHS to file a new plan \u201cif father is making progress.\u201d By the June 2012 circuit court hearing Mendoza had completed parenting classes, underwent the recommended psychological evaluation, and had begun some home-based services. Yet the record reflects that no new plan was prepared. Thach had moved out, and Mendoza was the sole provider for their infant son J.T. DHS reported that its unannounced visits to Mendoza\u2019s home after Thach moved out revealed that J.T. was being sufficiently cared for, and DHS expressed no concerns about Mendoza\u2019s ability to care for J.T. on his own or that it was an inappropriate place for children.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c \u2018[w]hile it may be occasionally necessary to sever the legal relationship between parent and child, those circumstances are rare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tackett, </em>62 Va.App. at 320, 746 S.E.2d at 521 (quoting <em>Lowe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986)). \u201c \u2018Statutes terminating the legal relationship between parent and child should be interpreted consistently with the governmental objective of preserving, when possible, the parent-child relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>While circuit court judges are vested with considerable deference in determining a child\u2019s best interest, \u201c[i]t is clear that the Constitution requires more than a mere showing of the child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>best interest to terminate parental rights.\u201d <em>Copeland v. Todd, </em>282 Va. 183, 199, 715 S.E.2d 11, 20 (2011). \u201c \u2018The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody and management of their children does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody ... to the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawley, </em>47 Va.App. at 581, 625 S.E.2d at 674 (quoting <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394-95, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982)). \u201cIf there is \u2018reason to believe that positive, nurturing parent-child relationships exist, the [state\u2019s] <em>parens patriae </em>interest favors preservation, not severance, of natural familial bonds.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 766-67, 102 S.Ct. at 1402). Thus, the circuit court could not terminate Mendoza\u2019s rights because it felt that J.M\u2019s foster parents could provide more stability than Mendoza. <em>See Copeland, </em>282 Va. at 199, 715 S.E.2d at 19-20 (the state cannot \u201c \u2018infringe on the fundamental right of parents ... simply because a state judge believes a better decision could be made\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 72-73, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2064, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000))). While the circuit court appropriately expressed concern about Mendoza\u2019s stability in the future and his delayed involvement with DHS, standing alone, those concerns are insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that Mendoza\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. In order to retain his parental rights, Mendoza was not required to overcompensate for Thach\u2019s parental deficiencies \u2014 instead the decision whether to terminate his parental rights should have been an independent evaluation. At the time of the circuit court\u2019s judgment, the record is clear that Mendoza had completed, or was participating in, the services recommended by DHS, he was providing a satisfactory home for J.M.\u2019s younger brother, and the neglectful parent had been removed from the equation. The circuit court clearly relied heavily on Mendoza\u2019s immigration status and insufficient employment verification as evidence that Mendoza may not be able to provide for J.M. in the future. However, the circuit court\u2019s speculation was premature. WTiile it is certainly possible that a different situation may obtain in the future that might require revisiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>this issue, as of the date of the hearing in this case, there is no evidence in the record that Mendoza was not then adequately providing for J.T. and could not continue to do so. Moreover, at the time of the circuit court hearing Mendoza was in the process of applying for residency and had a court date to resolve his immigration issue set for October 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The termination of parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2) amounts to a last resort to protect children when all other reasonable remedies have been attempted and failed and requires that DHS establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination of a parent\u2019s rights is the only reasonable and appropriate recourse \u2014 it does not require a parent to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he should retain his fundamental liberty interest in the custody of his child. In sum, we hold that there is insufficient evidence in the record before us to support the circuit court\u2019s decision to irreversibly sever Mendoza\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Accordingly, although we affirm the decision of the circuit court in terminating Thach\u2019s parental rights, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision to terminate Mendoza\u2019s parental rights with regard to his son J.M. pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, and reversed and final judgment in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">.
