Neff appealed his assault conviction, but not his public-intoxication conviction. He argues on appeal that he had a right to assault the officer because the officer did not have probable cause to believe Neff was intoxicated in public. Finding this argument structurally flawed, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">One evening in June 2012, police arrived at Neffs address in response to a call from Neffs neighbors reporting that an intoxicated individual was \u201ccreating a disturbance.\u201d App. at 22; <em>see also </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3. Neff was sitting on the front porch of the residence, which included four apartments. He spoke with slurred speech, had glassy eyes, and emitted a strong odor of alcohol in his breath and about his person. Neff told the officer that he had \u201chad a couple beers.\u201d App. at 26. The officer asked him to take a preliminary breath test \u201cif he felt that he was not intoxicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neff then raised his voice, cursed at the officer, and became agitated. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>officer arrested him for being intoxicated in public. During the arrest, Neff physically assaulted the arresting officer. The officer described Neffs conduct during the entire episode as being under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Prior to trial on the charges of being intoxicated in public and assaulting an officer, Neff moved to suppress the evidence of his assault claiming that the arrest was \u201can unlawful seizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The trial court denied the motion, heard the evidence on the merits, and convicted Neff of both charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">On appeal, Neff does not challenge his public-intoxication conviction. He did not identify this charge on his notice of appeal, address it in his petition for appeal, or discuss it in his opening brief. In fact, Neff expressly concedes, \u201cThe conviction for public intoxication is not part of this appeal.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2; <em>see also </em>Oral Argument Audio at 1:18 to 1:22. Instead, Neff challenges only his conviction for assaulting the police officer. In line with his argument in the trial court, Neff contends on appeal that the officer lacked \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest him, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5, and thus, Neff retained his common-law \u201cright of an arrestee to use reasonable force to resist an unlawful arrest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Given the manner in which he presents it to us, Neffs argument is fatally flawed. Neff was <em>convicted </em>of being intoxicated in public after being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and Neff did not appeal that conviction. \u201cThe unchallenged finding of the trial court is now the law of the case and binding on the parties for purposes of appeal.\u201d <em>Today Homes, Inc. v. Williams, </em>272 Va. 462, 470, 634 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2006); <em>see also Bd. of Supervisors v. Stickley, </em>263 Va. 1, 6, 556 S.E.2d 748, 751 (2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Probable cause, of course, is far less demanding than the reasonable-doubt standard. <em>See generally Tizon v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 1, 16, 723 S.E.2d 260, 267 (2012) (noting that probable cause does not \u201cdemand any showing that such a belief be more correct or more likely true than false\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 329, 335, 701 S.E.2d 831, 833 (2010) (explaining that \u201cfinely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the probable-cause decision\u201d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt rests exclusively on the officer\u2019s testimony of his observations of Neff prior to and during the course of the arrest. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 7:10 to 7:17 (appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledging that \u201call the facts at the evidentiary hearing were the same facts at the ... trial\u201d). It necessarily follows that the officer had probable cause to arrest Neff for being intoxicated in public because the exact same fact pattern proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was, indeed, intoxicated in public. That observation, standing alone, wholly undermines Neffs argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ment on appeal seeking a dismissal of his conviction for assaulting a police officer. <em>See, e.g., Klaff v. Va. Ry. &amp; Power Co., </em>120 Va. 347, 350, 91 S.E. 173, 174 (1917) (applying a \u201cconclusive presumption of probable cause arising from the judgment of conviction\u201d); <em>Womack v. Circle, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 324, 341 (1879) (explaining that a \u201cfinal judgment of conviction, from which there is no appeal, is conclusive evidence of probable cause\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In short, because Neffs unappealed public-intoxication conviction conclusively establishes his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>a fortiori </em>it establishes the existence of probable cause justifying his arrest. We thus affirm his conviction for assaulting a police officer, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">. The trial court applied <em>Crislip v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 66, 554 S.E.2d 96 (2001), to determine that the porch was open to public view within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\">. Neff framed this issue in the trial court as a motion to suppress. It is better understood, however, as a common-law affirmative defense on the merits to the assault charge, not as an application of the exclusionary rule. Under settled principles, \" 'if a person engages in new and distinct criminal acts' during an allegedly unlawful police encounter, \u2018the exclusionary rule does not apply, and evidence of the events constituting the new criminal activity, including testimony describing the defendant's own actions, is admissible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 283, 685 S.E.2d 213, 216-17 (2009) (quoting <em>Brown v. City of Danville, </em>44 Va.App. 586, 600, 606 S.E.2d 523, 530 (2004)); <em>see also United States v. Sprinkle, </em>106 F.3d 613, 619 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that the exclusionary rule is inapplicable to \"a new, distinct crime\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>occurring during an allegedly unlawful detention (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\">. <em>Accord Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 113, 116, 609 S.E.2d 58, 60 (2005) (holding that \"in situations in which there is one or more alternative holdings on an issue, the appellant\u2019s failure to address one of the holdings results in a waiver of any claim of error with respect to the court\u2019s decision on that issue\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b465-16\">. We can hypothesize cases in which facts unknown and unknowable to the arresting officer could put the issue of probable cause in play even though subsequently known facts presented at trial establish a defendant\u2019s guilt. But that is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
