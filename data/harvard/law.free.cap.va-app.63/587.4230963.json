On appeal, Mason argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the vehicle in which Mason was riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Around 2:30 on the afternoon of March 3, 2012, Officer Willie Richards (\u201cOfficer Richards\u201d) was parked on the side of the road operating stationary speed radar when he observed a vehicle pass by with a \u201c[djangling object on the rearview mirror.\u201d Officer Richards executed a traffic stop of the vehicle because he observed the \u201cdangling object.\u201d He identified the driver of the vehicle, Tony Jarrett (\u201cJarrett\u201d), and \u201cran his information.\u201d When Officer Richards returned to the stopped vehicle after running a search of Jarrett\u2019s information, he was going to issue Jarrett summonses for the dangling object and failure to wear a seatbelt. However, before issuing any summonses, Officer Richards asked Jarrett if he would mind stepping out of the car. Jarrett complied. Jarrett walked to the back of the vehicle he was driving, and Officer Richards told Jarrett why he stopped him. Then Officer Richards asked Jarrett if he had any weapons on him. Jarrett said no. Officer Richards asked him \u201cif he minded if [Officer Richards] patted him down.\u201d Jarrett said, \u201cthat\u2019s fine.\u201d Officer Richards patted Jarrett down for weapons. Officer Richards then saw a multi-colored sunglasses case sticking out of Jarrett\u2019s left rear pocket. Officer Richards asked Jarrett what was in his back pocket. Jarrett paused, pulled out the bag, and threw it on the car stating, \u201cI\u2019m not selling it, I\u2019m just using it.\u201d Officer Richards opened the bag and found green leaf material inside. At that point, Officer Richards placed Jarrett in an investigatory detention and read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>him his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Up to this point, Mason was sitting in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. Upon the detention of Jarrett, Officer Parker, who was training under Officer Richards, pulled Mason out of the vehicle. Officer Parker checked Mason for weapons and walked him to the front of the police vehicle, parked directly behind the vehicle Jarrett and Mason were riding in.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Officer Richards began searching the stopped vehicle. Inside the vehicle, Officer Richards saw a black backpack sitting on top of a jacket in the middle of the backseat. Inside the backpack were about twenty to twenty-five individually wrapped bags in a larger bag, digital scales, cocaine, ecstasy pills, and a large amount of marijuana. After neither individual claimed ownership of the backpack, Officer Richards placed them both under arrest for possession. He searched Mason and found $3,381 in cash and a cell phone on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Other evidence established that the backpack belonged to Mason. Mason filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from the backpack, the evidence found on Mason\u2019s person, and any statements made by Mason at the time of his detention and arrest and while in the custody of Officer Richards. Mason argued that the stop was based solely on Officer Richards\u2019s observation of a parking pass that hung from the rearview mirror and that Officer Richards lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the vehicle as that concept is defined in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">With the agreement of the parties, the trial court took up the suppression motion during the course of Mason\u2019s trial. Officer Richards was questioned about his reason for stopping the vehicle. The prosecutor asked, \u201cwhat brought your attention to the vehicle again?\u201d Officer Richards replied, \u201cDangling object [sic] on the rearview mirror.\u201d Officer Richards subsequently agreed with Mason\u2019s counsel that the dangling object, a parking pass, would block only a small portion of the entire windshield. He also agreed that if a driver was look<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ing straight ahead, the object would not be in his field of vision at all. There was nothing about Jarrett\u2019s driving that made Officer Richards believe that Jarrett\u2019s view was obstructed. The rearview mirror to which the object was attached was in its normal position on the windshield. Mason\u2019s counsel introduced the object into evidence through Officer Richards \u2014 it was a 3\" x 5\" parking pass issued by the Department of Defense for use at Ft. Lee, the top portion of which hooks onto the post that holds the rearview mirror (see below).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">The trial court concluded, and both parties acknowledged, that this pass hung <em>behind </em>the rearview mirror from the driver\u2019s perspective. App. at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>On redirect, the Commonwealth asked, \u201cSo it\u2019s not clear that you can\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t see through it, so it could obstruct a driver\u2019s view?\u201d Officer Richards replied, \u201cIt could, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d After some discussion off the record, Officer Richards was recalled and the Commonwealth resumed questioning him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\">[Commonwealth:] What about [the vehicle] caught your attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">[Officer Richards:] Just the \u2014 initially when it was coming down I was running radar, so I was watching it come down the hill to make sure it wasn\u2019t speeding. And when it got a little closer, I saw the tag on the rearview mirror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgyL\">[Commonwealth:] And was it moving, or anything about it cause you concern for the driver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">[Officer Richards:] Just that there was a dangling object. I mean, I can\u2019t say it was moving back and forth, just that I saw it when it came by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">[Commonwealth:] Were you able to see everything from your vantage point when you saw the vehicle with the object in the window? Were you able to see everything in the car with that object there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">[Officer Richards:] For the most part, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">[Commonwealth:] And when you say \u201cfor the most part\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">[Officer Richards:] I could see the two, the passenger and the driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">[Commonwealth:] Okay. Once you pulled the vehicle over, did you get in the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">[Officer Richards:] Get in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">[Commonwealth:] Yes, the stopped vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">[Officer Richards:] Eventually, yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">[Commonwealth:] And did you look at the rearview mirror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajt\">[Officer Richards:] Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">[Commonwealth:] And what about it, if anything, did you observe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">[Officer Richards:] Just there was a dangling object on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>[Commonwealth:] Did it \u2014 when you got in, were you on the driver\u2019s side or passenger\u2019s side, do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">[Officer Richards:] Well, when I went into the vehicle to search it, it was on the passenger side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[Commonwealth:] You got in on the passenger side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">[Officer Richards:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">[Commonwealth:] Did you look out of the window?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">[Officer Richards:] No, ma\u2019am. Not to see \u2014 not to determine, you know, whether I could see out of the window or not where the dangling object was, no, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEj\">[Commonwealth:] So you didn\u2019t look?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">[Officer Richards:] No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Mason\u2019s counsel renewed his motion \u201ceven more strenuously\u201d based on Officer Richards\u2019s testimony that the stop was based on the dangling object, and not because the officer thought the object was in any way obstructing the driver\u2019s view. The Commonwealth\u2019s position in response was that any object that dangles from the rearview mirror justifies the stop of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">Throughout its deliberation over the motion and extensive discussions with the parties, the trial court consistently and repeatedly stated that the parking pass would not obstruct the driver\u2019s view of the highway. For example, the trial court found that the parking pass would not obstruct the view of the driver at all if hung \u201con any car in America.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it obstructs anybody\u2019s view.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me that object hanging from the mirror-it\u2019s readily obvious, it\u2019s not obstructing anybody\u2019s view.\u201d \u201cIt hangs up in the rearview mirror, which is up here. That doesn\u2019t obstruct your view. You don\u2019t even see the highway up there. The highway is out here. It doesn\u2019t obstruct your view at all.\u201d \u201cThe object that dangled didn\u2019t substantially obstruct a view. You could get in the car and essentially look right through it. But it did dangle down and it was there.\u201d The trial court simultaneously and repeatedly acknowledged that the issue, however, was whether the object gave rise to reasonable suspicion to believe that a traffic infraction was taking or had taken place. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>court ordered additional briefing by the parties on this issue and continued the matter for further consideration of the issue. When the parties reconvened several months later, the trial court repeated that \u201cI think everyone would agree that [the parking pass] didn\u2019t substantially obstruct the driver\u2019s view\u201d and then noted that the issue was \u201cwhether or not essentially the mere fact of a dangling object gives the officer reasonable suspicion to stop to determine whether or not the object ... obstructs the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway.\u201d The trial court then held that there is reason to believe that the object could be blocking the sight of the driver simply \u201cbecause there is an object dangling.\u201d The trial court continued, \u201c[The officer] is entitled constitutionally to investigate further. So the Court believes that the presence of the object is, in fact, sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a detention of the vehicle.\u201d The trial court denied the motion to suppress the evidence and found Mason guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Mason argues on appeal that \u201cthe trial court erred in failing to grant [his] motion to suppress controlled substances seized by Officer Richards of the Waverly Police Department when the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden in showing that he had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the vehicle in which Loren Mason was riding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Officer Richards pulled the vehicle over after observing an object attached to the rearview mirror. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 provides in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person to drive a motor vehicle on a highway in the Commonwealth with any object or objects, other than a rear view mirror, sun visor, or other equipment of the motor vehicle approved by the Superintendent, suspended from any part of the motor vehicle <em>in such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway through the windshield.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">On appeal, it is the appellant\u2019s burden to show that the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress constituted reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>error. <em>Lovelace v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 120, 124, 554 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2001). \u201c[D]eterminations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). \u201cIn performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">A. Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 does not Proscribe <em>All </em>Suspended Objects</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Initially, we note that both at trial and on appeal, the Commonwealth advanced its position that <em>any </em>object suspended from a rearview mirror would provide an officer with reasonable suspicion to justify pulling the car over and this argument was ultimately adopted by the trial court in its holding. However, Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 proscribes only suspended objects that <em>obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway. </em>What exactly constitutes an obstruction of the clear view of the highway is not specified by the statute. However, appellant raises no issue regarding the vagueness of the statute and its constitutionality is presumed, thus we do not consider the applicability of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tanner v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>277 Va. 432, 438, 674 S.E.2d 848, 852 (2009). What is clear is that the statute does not proscribe <em>all </em>objects suspended from the interior of a motor vehicle. If the General Assembly had intended to proscribe all objects suspended from any part of a motor vehicle, it would have said so. See <em>Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 593, 599, 587 S.E.2d 561, 564-65 (2003) (courts may not add language to a statute that the General Assembly has not seen fit to include). Thus, and as discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>in order for an officer to have reasonable suspicion that a driver is violating Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, the evidence must support an officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion that a suspended object is ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>structing the driver\u2019s view of the road and not merely that there is a suspended object. A holding along the lines urged by the Commonwealth that any and all objects suspended from a mirror in a motor vehicle provide reasonable suspicion that the driver is violating Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, would amount to a <em>per se </em>rule obviating the need for <em>particularized </em>suspicion that an individual is engaged in wrongdoing before executing a Fourth Amendment stop and detention. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 694-95, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981). The United States Supreme Court has said that \u201cfor the most part <em>per se </em>rules are inappropriate in the Fourth Amendment context.\u201d <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 201, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 2111, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002) (favoring consideration of the totality of the circumstances of the encounter when determining if a citizen has been seized by police). The <em>per se </em>rule urged by the Commonwealth would stand in stark contrast to the established precedent of the United States Supreme Court requiring an officer to form individualized suspicion that a crime is being or is about to be committed and we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument supported by the dissent that the statute permits every vehicle with any object suspended from the rearview mirror to be stopped based solely because of that fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, we turn to whether the totality of the circumstances of <em>this </em>case provide reasonable suspicion of criminal activity for the stop of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>B. Reasonable Suspicion and the Requirement that Facts Supporting it be Articulated</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We begin, as we must in these cases, with the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">It is quite plain that the Fourth Amendment governs \u201cseizures\u201d of the person which do not eventuate in a trip to the station house and prosecution for crime \u2014 \u201carrests\u201d in traditional terminology. It must be recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has \u201cseized\u201d that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877. \u201cPrior to <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>any restraint on the person amounting to a seizure for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment was invalid unless justified by probable cause.\u201d <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1324, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). <em>\u201cTerry </em>created a limited exception to this general rule: certain seizures are justifiable under the Fourth Amendment if there is articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Even a cursory review of reasonable suspicion cases reveals often repeated language requiring specific facts in support of an officer\u2019s suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. \u201c[T]he police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot,\u2019 even if the officer lacks probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). \u201c[I]n justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. \u201cA court sitting to determine the existence of reasonable suspicion must require the agent to articulate the factors leading to that conclusion.\u201d <em>Sokolow, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>490 U.S. at 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1587; <em>see also United States v. Dennis, </em>115 F.3d 524, 532 (7th Cir.1997) (\u201c[I]n reviewing a reasonable suspicion determination, we require law enforcement authorities to articulate the specific characteristics exhibited by the person or object to be detained which aroused the authorities\u2019 suspicion in the particular case before us, and we determine whether those characteristics would reasonably arouse suspicion under the circumstances presented in the case.\u201d (citing <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1586)). \u201cThe officer, of course, must be able to articulate something more than an \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1585 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883); <em>see also Rudolph v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 209, 210, 722 S.E.2d 527, 528 (2009) (\u201cTo establish reasonable suspicion, an officer must be able to articulate more than an unparticularized suspicion or \u2018hunch\u2019 that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d). \u201cThis demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of this Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21 n. 18, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 n. 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">A reviewing court must consider the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the stop when determining whether the officer\u2019s suspicion was reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5V\">The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances. And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard: <em>would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure </em>or the search \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the action taken was appropriate? Anything less would invite intrusions upon constitutionally guaranteed rights based on nothing more substantial than inarticulate hunches, a result this Court has consistently refused to sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21-22, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 (emphasis added). \u201c[T]he totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture \u2014 must be taken into account. Based upon that whole picture the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 417-18, 101 S.Ct. at 695; <em>see also Navarette v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1683, 1687, 188 L.Ed.2d 680 (2014) (the Fourth Amendment permits traffic stops \u201cwhen a law enforcement officer has \u2018a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 417-18, 101 S.Ct. at 695); and holding that a tipster can provide an officer with enough particular facts to give rise to the officer\u2019s reasonable suspicion); <em>United States v.

New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), a companion case to <em>Terry, </em>the Court considered whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that Sibron was armed and dangerous, so as to justify the officer\u2019s self-protective search for weapons. \u201cThe police officer is not entitled to seize and search every person whom he sees on the street or of whom he makes inquiries. Before he places a hand on the person of a citizen in search of anything, he must have constitutionally adequate, reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>grounds for doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 88 S.Ct. at 1903. \u201cIn the case of the self-protective search for weapons, <em>he must be able to point to particular facts </em>from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (citing generally <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868). The Court found that the officer\u2019s testimony revealed no such facts-the officer did not testify that when Sibron put his hand in his pocket that he feared that Sibron was going for a weapon, and he \u201cnever at any time put forth the notion that he acted to protect himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64 n. 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1903 n. 21. The Court found that the trial court should have suppressed the evidence found in the officer\u2019s search of Sibron. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 88 S.Ct. at 1905.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979), the Court found that the officer failed to articulate a reasonable suspicion for stopping Brown. Officers observed Brown and another man walking away from one another in an alley. Officer Venegas testified that he and the other officer \u201cbelieved the two had been together or were about to meet until the patrol car appeared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48, 99 S.Ct. at 2639. The officers then stopped Brown because the situation \u201clooked suspicious and [they] had never seen [Brown] in the area before.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 99 S.Ct. at 2639. The area was known for drug trafficking, however, \u201cthe officers did not claim to suspect [Brown] of any specific misconduct, nor did they have any reason to believe that he was armed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court noted in its analysis that \u201cnone of the circumstances preceding the officers\u2019 detention of [Brown] justified a reasonable suspicion that he was involved in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641. \u201cOfficer Venegas testified at appellant\u2019s trial that the situation in the alley \u2018looked suspicious,\u2019 but he was unable to point to any facts supporting that conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641 n. 2. The Court noted that in this case the officer\u2019s testimony \u201cis to be distinguished from the observations of a trained, experienced police officer who is able to perceive and articulate meaning in given conduct which would be wholly innocent to the untrained observer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52 n. 2, 99 S.Ct. at 2641 n. 2. \u201cIn the absence of any basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest and appellant\u2019s right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 99 S.Ct. at 2641. \u201cWhen ... a stop is not based on objective criteria, the risk of arbitrary and abusive police practices exceeds tolerable limits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Likewise, in this case, Officer Richards did not testify either to facts sufficient to suspect the driver or Mason of any specific misconduct or reasons why his training and experience would permit further investigation of conduct which to the untrained eye appears to be wholly innocent. Although the prosecutor asked Officer Richards if anything about the dangling object concerned him, his response was \u201cjust that there was a dangling object.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We note that in some cases, \u201c \u2018wholly lawful conduct might justify the suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 9, 109 S.Ct. at 1586 (quoting <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 2754, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980)). However, in determining whether the officer\u2019s suspicions were reasonable the relevant inquiry is the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 109 S.Ct. at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980), the Supreme Court determined that federal narcotics agents seized Reid without an articulable suspicion that he was unlawfully transporting drugs \u2014 Reid\u2019s conduct was mostly typical of any number of innocent travelers and the individual conduct specific to Reid was not indicative of any wrongdoing. The evidence at the suppression hearing established that Reid arrived at the Atlanta Airport on an early morning flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 439, 100 S.Ct. at 2753. The agent testified that Fort Lauderdale is a principal place of origin of much of the cocaine sold in the country. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 100 S.Ct. at 2754. As Reid proceeded through the airport, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>agents observed him looking backward in the direction of a second man. <em>Id. </em>at 439, 100 S.Ct. at 2753. Both men carried similar shoulder bags. The men walked past the baggage claim, then spoke briefly, and left the terminal building together; at this point agents stopped them and found drugs in Reid\u2019s bag. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Georgia found that the agents had reasonable suspicion of Reid\u2019s wrongdoing because (1) Reid arrived from a city known for its cocaine production, (2) Reid arrived \u201cearly in the morning, when law enforcement activity is diminished,\u201d (3) Reid and his associate \u201cappeared to the agent to be trying to conceal the fact that they were traveling together,\u201d and (4) they only carried shoulder bags and no other luggage. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41, 100 S.Ct. at 2754.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">However, the United States Supreme Court reversed and concluded that \u201cthe agent could not, as a matter of law, have reasonably suspected the petitioner of criminal activity on the basis of these observed circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441, 100 S.Ct. at 2754. Of the evidence relied on, only the fact that petitioner occasionally looked back toward his associate relates to his particular conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe other circumstances describe a very large category of presumable innocent travelers, who would be subject to virtually random seizures were the Court to conclude that as little foundation as there was in this case could justify a seizure.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nor could the Court agree that the manner in which Reid and his associate walked through the airport \u201creasonably could have led the agent to suspect them of wrongdoing\u201d \u2014 this was \u201csimply too slender a reed to support the seizure in this case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In this case, Officer Richards, the only witness who testified about the circumstances of the stop, did not articulate facts that would support any particularized suspicion that Jarrett was committing a traffic offense when he pulled the car containing Mason over. He only asserted that he observed an object hanging from the rearview mirror as the vehicle passed, and it is clear from his testimony that he mistakenly believed that <em>any </em>object hanging from the mirror constituted an offense. Officer Richards never testified to any facts or circumstances that suggested a reason to suspect that this 3\" x 5\" object hanging from behind a mirror affixed to the top of the vehicle\u2019s windshield obstructed the driver\u2019s view of any part of the highway. On cross-examination the officer confirmed that the only thing he knew at the point of the stop was the \u201cdangling object.\u201d Officer Richards did not assign suspicion to this fact based on his experience as a law enforcement officer in the field. <em>See United States v. Sigmond-Ballesteros, </em>285 F.3d 1117, 1123 (9th Cir.2002) (where the court considered that the agent never testified about the relevance of the innocent activity of the suspect or that, in his experience, the suspect\u2019s actions indicated criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The prosecutor stipulated that Officer Richards did not notice anything unusual about the driving of the vehicle. The officer acknowledged that the parking pass would only take up a small portion of the entire windshield and that it would not be in a driver\u2019s view when looking straight ahead. We further note, as did the trial court, that the parking pass hung behind the rearview mirror, reducing the area of the parking pass visible to the driver. On redirect, the prosecutor asked Officer Richards, \u201cSo it\u2019s not clear that you can\u2019t-you can\u2019t see through it [meaning the parking pass], so it could obstruct a driver\u2019s view?\u201d Officer Richards replied, \u201cIt could, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Even the officer\u2019s acknowledgement in court that the pass could possibly obstruct a driver\u2019s view specifically because of its opaque nature, does not equate to never articulated facts supporting a reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop that the pass was obstructing the driver\u2019s view <em>of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>highway.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the absence of the articulation of facts supporting a reasonable suspicion in Officer Richards\u2019s testimony is consistent with the trial court\u2019s statements after viewing the exhibit that the parking pass could not obstruct a driver\u2019s view of the highway if hung \u201con any car in America\u201d and the trial court\u2019s later statement made immediately prior to its ruling that, \u201cI think everyone would agree that [the parking pass] didn\u2019t substantially obstruct the driver\u2019s view.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Officer Richards\u2019s observation of the parking pass attached to the rearview mirror is descriptive of wholly innocent behavior exhibited by many drivers on the road who have objects attached to their windshield or rearview mirror that do not obstruct their view of the road. We note that there is little distinction between the size of the parking pass, which when hanging would be covered in part by the rearview mirror itself, and the size of various opaque stickers and other objects that various government agencies require or authorize to be displayed on the windshield of a motor vehicle, such as a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>vehicle inspection sticker, Code \u00a7 46.2-1163, or an E-ZPass toll transponder, Code \u00a7 33.1-23.03:10(C). Without any particular or individualized facts suggesting or supporting a suspicion that this parking pass was obstructing the driver\u2019s view of the road, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the stop in this case are insufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that the driver was violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We hold that the traffic stop and seizure of Mason violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the facts and circumstances available to the officer at the time of the stop did not support a reasonable suspicion that the driver was violating or about to violate the law. However, despite our holding that the stop here is constitutionally infirm, we cannot say based upon the record before us that the exclusionary rule necessarily requires the suppression of the evidence in this case. <em>See Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 592, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2164, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (the exclusionary rule does not apply to \u201c \u2018every item of evidence that has a causal connection with police misconduct\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 829, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3398, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting))). The trial court, having denied the motion to suppress, made no determination as to whether Jarrett\u2019s consent to search his person, which led to the search of the car and the discovery of evidence against Mason, attenuated the illegality of the stop as it pertained to and affected Mason. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248-49, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2058-59, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) (whether an individual\u2019s consent to a search was voluntary is a factual question); <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 548 (4th Cir.1998) (after the trial court determined that the officer entered Seidman\u2019s residence in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that Seidman voluntarily consented to the conversation with the officer, the trial court should have gone further and determined \u201cwhether the taint arising from the unlawful entry was sufficiently attenuated by the consent\u201d). Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>reverse and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion if the Commonwealth is so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-20\">. No effort was made to render the image as actual size because we recognize that those who publish our opinions, whether in printed and bound reports or in an on-line database, will not likely reproduce any image in actual size.

The obvious legislative purpose behind Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 is a recognition that many who drive motor vehicles on the highways of the Commonwealth attach different objects and devices to their vehicles for various reasons. Some are purely decorative such as the iconic \"fuzzy dice\u201d or hold personal or sentimental meaning such as a graduation tassel or rosary beads, while still other objects have utilitarian uses such as GPS devices, toll transponders, air fresheners or, as in this case, parking permits. Significantly, these items are permitted to be attached to a vehicle <em>unless </em>they are of a size or positioned in such a way as to impair the ability of the driver to view the road. Were we to adopt the interpretation advanced by the Commonwealth and supported by the dissent, <em>all </em>who do so would automatically provide police with a reasonable suspicion to detain them without regard to whether there is any evidence articulated by the officer that the article in question may actually be a hazard to the operation of the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b646-6\">. \"The Fourth Amendment applies to seizures of the person, including brief investigatory stops such as the stop of the vehicle....

Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has noted that \"neither police officers nor courts should sanction as 'reasonably suspicious' a combination of factors that could plausibly describe the behavior of a large portion of the motorists engaged in travel upon our interstate highways.\u201d <em>United States v.

A highway includes \"the <em>entire width between the boundary lines </em>of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys.\" Code \u00a7 46.2-100. Barring the approach advocated by the Commonwealth and the dissent that <em>any </em>object affixed to the interior of a vehicle <em>per se </em>generates reasonable suspicion as a matter of law, neither the testimony of Officer Richards nor the parking pass itself, provides reason to believe that the trial court's unequivocal and repeated statements regarding this object\u2019s inability, from its size and location in the vehicle, to obstruct <em>any </em>part of the highway were either nonsense or legally meaningless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">. This latter statement by the trial court immediately prior to its holding seems to us to contradict the dissent's assertion that \"none of the judge\u2019s initial remarks can be fairly deemed a 'factual finding.' \" Indeed, and significantly unlike the situation in <em>Commonwealth v.

It was an opaque parking pass, measuring five inches long and three inches wide. The parking pass was introduced as an exhibit at the suppression hearing. The officer testified that he \u201csaw it <em>clearly </em>\u201d as the vehicle \u201cwent by\u201d him. <em>Id. </em>at 31 (emphasis added). Two questions later, when asked if the dangling parking pass that he so clearly observed \u201ccould obstruct a driver\u2019s view,\u201d the officer said unequivocally, <em>\u201cIt could, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">At the suppression hearing, the trial judge made various remarks from the bench suggesting his inclination to grant the motion to suppress.

The trial judge also later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>examined the parking pass and took a \u201cview of the scene,\u201d <em>id., </em>to determine if the parking pass could obstruct a driver\u2019s vision in a vehicle similar to the one that the officer had stopped. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 9:47 to 9:55, 26:04 to 26:30 (stipulation of counsel).

But after reviewing the caselaw \u201cstacked up against me,\u201d the judge explained, he realized that neither the statute nor the reasonable suspicion standard required a <em>substantial </em>obstruction. <em>Id. </em>at 105. He noted that one of the cases making this point was an unpublished opinion from our Court, <em>Commonwealth v.

There, an officer stopped a vehicle after observing an \u201cair freshener hanging from the rear view mirror\u201d that the officer believed \u201ccould\u201d have partially obstructed the driver\u2019s view. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).

Under these facts, we held that the trial court plainly erred by concluding that these facts did not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle could have been in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054. <em>Id. </em>at *5, 2004 Va.App. Lexis 283 at *15-16; <em>see also Richardson v.

While the first part is highly relevant, the second is not.

Nor do any of the other cases cited by the majority opinion. <em>Sokolow </em>simply restates that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, 109 S.Ct. at 1585 (quoting <em>United States v.

This does not mean that the facts must actually be articulated by the officer on the witness stand or that any such articulation, by itself, must be sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion. The majority\u2019s assertion to the contrary is inconsistent with binding <em>en banc </em>precedent from our Court, <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d at 148 n. 2,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as well as the uniform view among courts that have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>addressed this issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">B. Obstructing a Driver\u2019s \u201cClear View\u201d of the Highway</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">As a provision of the Virginia Motor Vehicle Code, Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 prohibits, among other things, any object from being \u201csuspended from any part of the motor vehicle in such a manner as to obstruct the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway through the windshield, the front side windows, or the rear window.\u201d This portion of the statute has three components: (i) something \u201csuspended,\u201d (ii) that serves to \u201cobstruct\u201d a \u201cclear view\u201d of the highway, (iii) through any window of the vehicle (except for the rear side windows). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">By statute, a highway includes \u201cthe <em>entire width between the boundary lines </em>of every way or place open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel in the Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100 (emphasis added). A highway is not \u2014 as Mason presumes \u2014 simply the stretch of pavement immediately in front of a driver\u2019s vehicle. Under Virginia law, a \u201chighway\u201d is not limited \u201cto a hard-surfaced or partly hard-surfaced way or to a dirt and gravel way. It does not confine a highway to the main-travelled portion of the way or to lanes specifically designated for vehicular traffic.\u201d <em>Crouse v. Pugh, </em>188 Va. 156, 164-65, 49 S.E.2d 421, 426 (1948); <em>see also Jessee v. Slate, </em>196 Va. 1074, 1083, 86 S.E.2d 821, 826 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Because a \u201chighway\u201d includes the \u201centire width of the boundary lines\u201d of the \u201cway or place\u201d used by vehicular traffic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-100, it includes overhead highway signs,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> on-ramps and off-ramps, merge lanes, deceleration lanes, roadways,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> bridges,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> intersections,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> shoulders,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> pedestrian crosswalks,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and shared-use paths.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, a \u201cclear view\u201d of a \u201chighway,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, no doubt means the pavement itself and everything physically on it. It would make no sense for Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 to prohibit a dangling object from obstructing a driver\u2019s view of the pavement directly in front him but not a vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> moving across that same pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In this case, Officer Richards testified that he \u201cclearly\u201d observed the parking pass prior to stopping the vehicle. App. at 31. The parking pass is an exhibit. We need no description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>of it from the officer. We are looking at the very thing that the officer said he clearly saw: an opaque plastic card that is five inches long and three inches wide. And the trial judge had something even better. He took a \u201cview of the scene\u201d to determine if the parking pass could obstruct a driver\u2019s vision in a vehicle similar to the one that the officer had stopped. <em>Id. </em>at 101; <em>see </em>Oral Argument Audio at 9:47 to 9:55, 26:04 to 26:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Given these facts, a reasonable officer could suspect that the opaque, five-by-three-inch parking pass dangling from a rear-view mirror might violate Code \u00a7 46.2-1054 and thus warrant an investigatory stop to find out if it in fact did. Several scenarios show why. The bottom of the parking pass would be at or slightly above eye level for a driver of average height. The parking pass could be at an angle that might partially block a driver\u2019s clear view of a vehicle ahead and to the right of him. If that vehicle put on its left-turn signal, for example, the driver with the parking pass might not see it at all\u2014 particularly when the vehicle is merging into highway traffic from an on-ramp. If a driver simply wanted to make a right turn at an intersection, the parking pass could partially obscure his field of vision. An enhanced risk would exist when the driving occurs at night and only the rear running lights of a vehicle ahead and to the right are visible. Consider, too, highway signs that are often placed overhead and on the right shoulder of the highway.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A person of any height could have his clear view of highway signs partially obstructed by the parking pass especially, once again, during nighttime driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Under settled law, an officer need not have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of any of these scenarios before he makes a vehicular stop. Nor does he need to be convinced by a preponderance of the evidence. To be sure, the quantum of confidence need not even rise to the level of probable cause. <em>See Perry, </em>280 Va. at 581, 701 S.E.2d at 436. He need only have a reasonable suspicion of a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-1054, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>which merely requires that he be aware of articulable facts suggesting that the parking pass could be non-compliant with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Though it was legally unnecessary for Officer Richards to testify that he <em>subjectively </em>believed the parking pass could have obscured the driver\u2019s clear view of the highway, <em>Raab, </em>50 Va.App. at 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d at 148 n. 2, he did in fact come to this conclusion. Within seconds of stating that he \u201cclearly\u201d saw the parking pass, Officer Richards testified that he believed that it \u201ccould obstruct a driver\u2019s view.\u201d App. at 31. In context, he was speaking of the driver\u2019s view of the highway\u2014 not something other than the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The trial court correctly held that a reasonable officer could make an investigatory stop of the vehicle to determine if, in fact, the parking pass violated Code \u00a7 46.2-1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\">. <em>See also </em>App. at 40-41 (The trial judge confirmed that \"the question we have now is [whether there] is reasonable suspicion to believe that there is a traffic infraction taking placet] So again, is there reasonable suspicion to believe that [the parking pass] is obstructing ... the driver's <em>clear view of the highway through the windshield? \" </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">.
