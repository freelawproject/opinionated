AEC argues that the circuit court misapplied principles of <em>respondeat superior </em>by imputing to AEC its site supervisor\u2019s knowledge of the safety violations. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">In March 2011, inspectors from the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (VDLI) observed AEC construction workers on a roof at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk without proper fall-protection equipment. Two workers were later observed walking next to a glass skylight, and two workers were \u201csitting at the edge of the skylight.\u201d App. at 61. Most of the workers were not tied up to any kind of \u201cfall arrest system,\u201d <em>id., </em>a safety measure designed to keep them from falling from the roof and to break their fall if they do. One of the workers wore a harness, but the inspector could not confirm \u201cwhether he was attached\u201d to a \u201cfall arrest system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201c[tjhere was no guardrail system\u201d installed, and \u201c[t]he skylight did not have a cover.\u201d <em>Id. </em>VDLI issued three citations against AEC alleging \u201cserious\u201d violations of the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Act, Code \u00a7 40.1-1 <em>et seq. </em>(VOSHA). <em>See generally </em>Code \u00a7 40.1-49.3 (defining \u201c[sjerious violation\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When AEC contested the citations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>VDLI filed an enforcement action in circuit court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In the circuit court proceeding, VDLI proved that several roofers failed to use fall-protection equipment in violation of VOSHA safety regulations. VDLI also showed that AEC\u2019s site supervisor had been present on the job site at the time and knew of the safety violations. AEC conceded these facts but argued that the supervisor had an exemplary work record and that it was wholly unforeseeable he would have countenanced such basic violations of VOSHA safety rules.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this reason, AEC argued, it could not be held liable for the safety violations under <em>respondeat superior </em>principles, and even if it could be, AEC would be entitled to assert the employee misconduct defense recognized by 16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-60-260(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The circuit court affirmed two of VDLI\u2019s citations for serious violations and vacated the third. The court explained its ruling on the two affirmed citations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[T]he Court finds that AEC\u2019s defense of employee misconduct on the part of their supervisor, Eddy Wever, does not apply based on 16 VAC 25-60-260.C. Further AEC\u2019s defense of lack of foreseeability is also rejected. The Court further finds that [VDLI] proved by a preponderance of the evidence with regard to the skylight fall protection violation, \u00a7 1926.50 l(b)(4)(i) and the roof edge fall protection violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>\u00a7 1926.501(b)(10), that the cited standards applied, that the standards were violated, that the employer knew of the violations, and that employees were exposed to the hazard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">App. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On appeal, AEC contends that the circuit court erred as a matter of law by finding \u201cthat the two VOSHA fall protection citations ... were foreseeable\u201d by AEC. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2. Necessarily implicit in this assertion is that, without foreseeability, AEC could not be held liable for monetary penalties issued for violations of VOSHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">A. The VOSHA Enforcement Action</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">In Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(A)(1), VOSHA authorizes VDLI to inspect private industry workplaces and to issue a citation if VDLI has \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d a violation of a safety or health standard has occurred. <em>Nat'l Coll. of Bus. &amp; Tech., Inc. v. Malveaux, </em>60 Va.App. 22, 31-32, 723 S.E.2d 270, 275 (2012). VDLI, however, can only \u201cpropose\u201d a civil penalty for the cited violation. Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(A)(4)(a). If the employer timely contests the citation or the proposed penalty, VDLI must file an enforcement action in circuit court. Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Reviewing the matter <em>de novo, </em>the circuit court must issue \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law, affirming, modifying or vacating [VDLI\u2019s] citation or proposed penalty, or directing other appropriate relief\u2019 deemed necessary by the court. <em>Id.; see Davenport v. Summit Contractors, Inc., </em>45 Va.App. 526, 528, 612 S.E.2d 239, 240 (2005). In the circuit court proceeding, the litigants have full access to pretrial discovery, Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(L), and VDLI bears the burden of proving, by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d the basis for the citation and the proposed penalty, <em>Nat\u2019l Coll. of Bus. &amp; Tech., Inc. v. Davenport, </em>57 Va.App. 677, 685, 705 S.E.2d 519, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>523 (2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">B. Proving a \u201cSerious Violation\u201d of VOSHA</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Under Code \u00a7 40.1-49.3, a \u201c[sjerious violation\u201d is one involving a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d of \u201cdeath or serious physical harm.\u201d <em>See generally </em>3-11 <em>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act </em>\u00a7 11.05[3][f][ii] (Matthew Bender &amp; Co.2014). Built into this definition, however, is an important caveat: No matter the gravity of the risk of harm, a serious violation cannot be found if \u201cthe employer did not, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of the violation.\u201d Code \u00a7 40.1-49.3. With this limiting concept, VOSHA eschews a strict liability regime and incorporates foreseeability into the statutory standard. <em>See Floyd S. Pike Elec. Contractor, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>222 Va. 317, 322-23, 281 S.E.2d 804, 807 (1981) (\u201cAn employer ... need not take steps to prevent hazards which are not generally foreseeable, including idiosyncratic behavior of an employee.... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Under <em>respondeat superior </em>principles, the knowledge of a \u201cjob foreman\u201d or a \u201csupervisor\u201d that employees under his watch are violating VOSHA can be imputed to his employer. <em>Magco of Md., Inc. v. Barr, </em>33 Va.App. 78, 83-85, 531 S.E.2d 614, 616-17 (2000) (applying the \u201clongstanding principle in the Commonwealth that a foreman\u2019s knowledge of facts or events on a worksite is imputed to his employer\u201d), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>262 Va. 1, 545 S.E.2d 548 (2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Addressing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>issue under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651 <em>et seq. </em>\u2014 the statutory template for VOSHA, <em>Davenport, </em>45 Va.App. at 529, 612 S.E.2d at 241\u2014federal courts have come to the same conclusion: \u201cWhen a corporate employer entrusts to a supervisory employee its duty to assure employee compliance with safety standards, it is reasonable to charge the employer with the supervisor\u2019s knowledge actual or constructive of noncomplying conduct of a subordinate.\u201d <em>Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>623 F.2d 155, 158 (10th Cir.1980). \u201cIt is reasonable to do this because a corporate employer can, of course, only act through its agents ... and the supervisor acts as the \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 of the absent employer. That makes his knowledge the employer\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>ComTran Grp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>722 F.3d 1304, 1317 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The result is different, however, when the foreman or supervisor is himself the \u201cactual malfeasant\u201d guilty of unforeseeable \u201crogue conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313, 1316 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see W.G. Yates &amp; Sons Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>459 F.3d 604, 609 n. 8 (5th Cir.2006). As many courts have explained, \u201cthere is, in fact, a \u2018reasoned basis\u2019 to draw a distinction between a supervisor\u2019s knowledge of a subordinate\u2019s misconduct (which everyone agrees is imputable to the employer) and knowledge of his own misconduct (which the clear majority of [federal] circuits have held is not).\u201d <em>ComTran Grp., </em>722 F.3d at 1317.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>cases in which \u201cthe misconduct is the supervisor\u2019s own,\u201d the employer truly \u201chas no \u2018eyes and ears.\u2019 It is, figuratively speaking, blind and deaf. To impute knowledge in this situation would be fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1317 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">In addition, VOSHA regulations provide an affirmative defense to liability, usually called the employee misconduct defense. It applies if the employer proves it provided employees with the proper training and equipment; established, communicated, and enforced applicable safety rules; and took \u201c[r]easonable steps\u201d to discover safety violations. 16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-60-260(B). The defense protects the employer when, despite these precautions, one of its employees failed \u201cto observe work rules\u201d in violation of VOSHA. <em>Id. </em>For purposes of this defense, however, \u201cthe term \u2018employee\u2019 shall not include any officer, management official or supervisor having direction, management control or custody of any place of employment which was the subject of the violative condition cited.\u201d 16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-60-260(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>C. AEC\u2019s Liability Based Upon Its Supervisor\u2019s Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Sitting as factfinder, the circuit court found that AEC\u2019s supervisor on the job site was aware of the two safety violations involving the roofers working without proper fall-protection equipment. Despite this knowledge, the supervisor did not intervene or take any corrective action. AEC does not contest these findings on appeal. Instead, AEC contends simply that the corporate entity did not have actual or constructive knowledge of these violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">AEC\u2019s argument, however, circles back to first principles. To say that AEC did not have knowledge of the violations presupposes a premise that we do not accept \u2014 that the supervisor\u2019s knowledge cannot be imputed to AEC. Under <em>respondeat superior </em>principles, AEC and its job site supervisor are one and the same for the purposes of determining AEC\u2019s knowledge. The only exceptions to this imputed knowledge do not exist under the facts of this case. VDLI never asserted that the AEC site supervisor personally violated VOSHA to the extent that it could be said that he was an \u201cactual malfeasant\u201d guilty of unforeseeable \u201crogue conduct.\u201d <em>ComTran Grp., </em>722 F.3d at 1313, 1316. Nor does AEC assert on appeal that the employee misconduct defense applies under 16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-60-260(B) or even that it could apply given its inapplicability to supervisors \u201chaving direction, management control or custody\u201d of the job site, pursuant to 16 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-60-260(C).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In sum, the circuit court correctly applied <em>respondeat superior </em>principles to this VOSHA enforcement action. Relying upon these principles, the court\u2019s unchallenged factual findings fully support its decision to affirm VDLI\u2019s two citations against AEC for serious violations of the VOSHA standards for fall protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\">.

AEC also received an \"other than serious\u201d citation for not providing records pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1904.40(a), but that citation was not pursued in the enforcement action before the circuit court and ultimately was vacated.

In these respects, a VOSHA enforcement proceeding bears little resemblance to the typical scenario in which agency decisionmaking is subject to judicial review. <em>See generally Family Redirection Inst., Inc. v.

Assistance Servs., </em>61 Va.App. 765, 771, 739 S.E.2d 916, 919-20 (2013) (Under the Virginia Administrative Process Act, \"the circuit court reviews an agency\u2019s action in a manner equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.

We see nothing conceptually or functionally inconsistent between a fault-based liability standard and the imputed knowledge component of the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The common law of torts, for example, rests on a fault-based liability standard, and it imputes to a principal the knowledge of an authorized agent. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 496 cmt. a &amp; illus. 1, 4. <em>Accord </em>1 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*431-32 (\"[The master] may frequently be answerable for his servant\u2019s misbehavior....
