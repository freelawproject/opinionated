As permitted by Code \u00a7 19.2-398(C), the Commonwealth appeals the defendant\u2019s sentence for that offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It contends that the trial court erred by sentencing the defendant to a term of imprisonment of two years rather than the five-year mandatory minimum sentence. The trial court imposed that sentence after the jury returned a sentencing verdict of two years, despite written and oral instructions properly advising the jury that the only statutorily available sentence for the crime was a mandatory term of imprisonment of five years. The Commonwealth further argues that the trial court was required to set aside the jury\u2019s erroneous sentencing verdict and impanel a new jury to sentence the defendant in accordance with the law. We hold that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a jury sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence of five years was void <em>ab initio. </em>Additionally, we hold that the trial court erred in refusing to impanel a new jury for sentencing after the original jury refused to perform its duties as instructed. Therefore, we reverse in part, vacate the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>dant\u2019s sentence, and remand to the trial court for sentencing before a new jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The defendant requested a jury trial after being charged with the offense of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. At trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that police came into contact with the defendant when he voluntarily agreed to speak with them during the course of a murder investigation. The defendant admitted to detectives that he possessed a firearm during the time period in which he shot and killed Frank Griffin. The defendant cooperated with law enforcement and turned the gun over to them. He admitted that he had previously been convicted of a felony and knew that he was not supposed to have a gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ultimately, the prosecutor concluded that the defendant acted in self-defense when Griffin brandished his own firearm. As a result, the defendant was not charged with murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial on the firearm offense, the jury found him guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted violent felon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In the sentencing phase of trial that immediately followed the determination of guilt, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">You have found the defendant guilty of the crime of possessing or transporting a firearm after having been convicted of a violent felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">Upon consideration of all the evidence you have heard, you shall fix the defendant\u2019s punishment at a specific term of imprisonment of five (5) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>During deliberations, the jury submitted the following handwritten question: \u201cIs the 5 years the only option?\u201d The trial court consulted with counsel and provided the following written response: \u201cThe answer is <em>yes.\u201d </em>The jury then further inquired in writing, \u201cWhat if we do not all agree to the fix [sic] punishment of 5 years?\u201d In response, the court brought the jury back and reminded them that their verdict had to be unanimous and if they could \u201cpossibly reach a verdict, it [was] [their] duty to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">After additional deliberations, the jury submitted the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">We can not [sic] all agree on 5 years but we agree on 2 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">Do we have any other options or do we sit here till we agree on 5 years[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">Is this the minimal sentance [sic] for this crime[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">The court discussed the questions with counsel and observed, \u201c[I]f the verdict is not unanimous, then the [c]ourt impanels another jury for sentencing. If the verdicts are unanimous, then it\u2019s over.\u201d The court referenced prior decisions approving inconsistent jury verdicts in the guilt phase and implied that the jury could act similarly during the sentencing phase by refusing to impose the mandatory minimum of five years. The court noted, in contrast, that a judge lacks such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">The court did not answer the jury\u2019s questions but inquired whether the jury had reached a unanimous verdict, and the jury indicated that it had done so. The jury returned that verdict on the finding instruction provided but altered the language, \u201cWe ... fix [the defendant\u2019s] punishment at 5 years,\u201d to reflect a two-year sentence. The foreperson crossed through the \u201c5 years,\u201d inserted \u201c2 years\u201d in its place, and initialed the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">After the jury had been discharged, the prosecutor objected to the jury\u2019s verdict of a two-year sentence in light of the mandatory minimum of five years required by the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The trial court imposed the two-year punishment set by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Following sentencing, the prosecutor moved the trial court to set aside the jury\u2019s sentence and impanel a new jury to ascertain punishment. She argued that the jury did not agree on a punishment authorized by the legislature and averred that unless the defendant and the court agreed to imposition of the mandatory sentence of five years, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 required the trial court to impanel a new sentencing jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The trial court suggested that the mandatory minimum sentence conflicted with the legal principle that prevented the court from increasing a jury\u2019s sentencing verdict. The judge concluded that he \u201c[did not] have a hung jury because they agreed on the punishment.\u201d Further, the judge posited that he \u201c[did not] know if [he] had the authority to impanel a different jury.\u201d The court considered several existing appellate decisions on the issue but determined that none controlled. The judge ultimately concluded: \u201cIn my conscience I don\u2019t think I can say [that the jury was] wrong. They didn\u2019t give him enough time, but as a trial judge I [cannot] raise the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">This Commonwealth\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The Commonwealth argues that the trial court erred in imposing the two-year sentence instead of a five-year sentence required by the statute. The defendant responds that the jury, in essence, engaged in jury nullification during the sentencing phase by rejecting the mandatory minimum despite receiving proper instructions. He contends further that the trial court lacked authority to set aside the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict because applicable legal principles permitted the court only to shorten, not lengthen, the sentence fixed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">A trial court\u2019s assessment of punishment is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Rawls v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>wealth (J.M. Rawls), </em>272 Va. 334, 351, 634 S.E.2d 697, 706 (2006). A trial court \u201c \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.... The abuse-of-discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 260, 661 S.E.2d 415, 445 (2008) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047-48, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). To the extent that determinations regarding sentencing involve the interpretation of a statute or the common law, such an interpretation is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Woodard v. Commonwealth, </em>287 Va. 276, 280, 754 S.E.2d 309, 311 (2014); <em>Country Vintner, Inc. v. Louis Latour, Inc., </em>272 Va. 402, 410, 634 S.E.2d 745, 750 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) provides that one who possesses a firearm after having been convicted of a felony \u201cshall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d A Class 6 felony is punishable by imprisonment for a minimum of one year and up to five years. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(f). Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) provides further, \u201c[h]owever, [that] any person who violates this statute by knowingly and intentionally possessing ... any firearm and who was previously convicted of a <em>violent </em>felony as defined in \u00a7 17.1-805 shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years.\u201d (Emphasis added). \u201cSince a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) is a Class 6 felony punishable under Code \u00a7 18.2-10 by a term of imprisonment between one and five years, the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm after a previous violent felony conviction <em>equals </em>the statutory maximum sentence [of five years].\u201d <em>J.M. Rawls, </em>272 Va. at 347-48, 634 S.E.2d at 703 (emphasis added); <em>see Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 244, 248-53, 692 S.E.2d 651, 653-55 (2010) (rejecting a separation-of-powers challenge to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Here, the parties agree that because the defendant had a prior conviction for robbery, an offense enumerated in Code \u00a7 17.1-805(C) by reference to Code \u00a7 18.2-58, the \u201cviolent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>felony\u201d provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) applies and the mandatory minimum as well as the maximum sentence for the offense is five years. The parties also agree that the trial court properly instructed the jury that the appropriate sentence is five years in prison. Despite receiving proper instructions, however, the jury unanimously fixed the defendant\u2019s punishment at two years in contravention of the law as set out in those instructions. The trial court sentenced the defendant in accord with the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We hold that the jury\u2019s sentence of two years was erroneous and the trial court\u2019s imposition of that sentence was void <em>ab initio. </em>The judge was obligated to reject the jury\u2019s verdict and to impanel a new jury to determine punishment within the prescribed limits established by the legislature for the crime for which the jury had found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">\n<em>A. The Jury\u2019s Role and Sentencing Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that \u201c \u2018in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2355-56, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI); <em>see also </em>Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. In determining the scope of the right to a jury under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions, we look to the role of the jury at common law. <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 U.S. 160, 170, 129 S.Ct. 711, 718, 172 L.Ed.2d 517 (2009), <em>quoted with approval in S. Union Co. v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2344, 2353, 183 L.Ed.2d 318 (2012); <em>see Fogg v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 164, 166, 207 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">\u201c[TJrial by jury has been understood to require that <em>\u2018the truth of every accusation, </em>whether ... in the shape of indictment [or] information, ... should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant\u2019s] equals and neighbours....\u2019\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. at 2356 (fifth and sixth alterations in original) (quoting 4 William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>343 (1769)). \u201cJust as suffrage ensures the people\u2019s ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary.\u201d <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 306, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Trial by jury \u201c \u2018guard[s] against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers[ ]\u2019 and [serves] \u2018as the great bulwark of [our] civil and political liberties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 477, 120 S.Ct. at 2356 (final alteration in original) (quoting 2 Joseph Story, <em>Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States </em>540-41 (4th ed. 1873)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Although judge and jury may both serve as finders of fact at trial, their duties and powers are not identical. In some contexts, the jury may exercise greater discretion. For example, under settled principles, a trial court may not render inconsistent verdicts in the guilt phase of a bench trial. <em>Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 521, 528-32, 525 S.E.2d 13, 16-19 (2000); <em>see also Cleveland v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 199, 203-05, 562 S.E.2d 696, 698-99 (2002) (upholding a conviction where the trial judge expressly stated that he exercised lenity in dismissing one of several charges, thereby establishing that his acquittal of the defendant for driving while intoxicated was not inconsistent with his conviction of the defendant for another crime that required proof of driving while intoxicated as an element of the offense). Similarly, a jury\u2019s rendering of inconsistent verdicts in the guilt phase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>trial constitutes \u201c \u2018[the] assumption of a power which [the jury] ha[s] no <em>right </em>to exercise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 640, 647-48, 371 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1988) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 63, 105 S.Ct. 471, 475, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, a jury\u2019s rendering of inconsistent verdicts in the guilt phase, although not encouraged, does not, standing alone, provide a basis for reversal. <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 594, 596-98, 391 S.E.2d 75, 76-77 (1990); <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 273, 282, 563 S.E.2d 384, 388 (2002). The United States Supreme Court has held that such behavior \u201cimplicates no constitutional guarantee\u201d of a defendant\u2019s, and as a result, states may develop their own rules regarding such verdicts. <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 648, 371 S.E.2d at 318; <em>see also Walls, </em>38 Va.App. at 282, 563 S.E.2d at 388 (noting that the right to due process does not entitle a party to encourage jury nullification); <em>State v. Bjerkaas, </em>163 Wis.2d 949, 472 N.W.2d 615, 619 (Wis.Ct.App.1991) (recognizing that the jury\u2019s nullification power is not a defendant\u2019s right but, rather, the price paid for \u201cdouble jeopardy [protections]\u2014 the government\u2019s inability to appeal from even the most lawless acquittal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In interpreting the law governing inconsistent verdicts in the Commonwealth, we have observed that juries may reach such verdicts in the guilt phase \u201cthrough mistake, compromise, or lenity, but in such instances it is \u2018unclear whose ox has been gored,\u2019 the government\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>6 Va.App. at 648, 371 S.E.2d at 318 (quoting <em>Powell, </em>469 U.S. at 65, 105 S.Ct. at 477). We have reasoned further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cThe most that can be said in such cases is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d ... For this reason and the fact that the government is precluded from appealing the acquittal verdict, ... inconsistent verdicts [in the guilt phase of a jury trial] should not provide the basis for an appeal by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 647-48, 371 S.E.2d at 318 (quoting <em>Powell, </em>469 U.S. at 63, 105 S.Ct. at 475) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[djespite the apparent inconsistency of a [jury\u2019s] verdict[s] <em>[in the guilt phase </em>], courts may uphold inconsistent verdicts, provided that the evidence supports the verdict challenged on appeal.\u201d <em>Kovalaske v.

Indeed, our statutes and case law dictate a contrary conclusion. Once guilt has been determined, both judge <em>and jury </em>are constrained by the sentencing limits set by the legislature. \u201c[N]othing in the United States or Virginia Constitution gives a defendant the right to be sentenced by a jury or solely by a jury.\u201d <em>Boyd v.

Thus, the sentencing verdict of two years rendered by the jury was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">\n<em>B. The Trial Court\u2019s Role Following the Jury\u2019s Sentencing Verdict and on Remand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV39\">The trial court recognized the problem associated with the fact that the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict was lower than the punishment of five years mandated by statute. However, because the verdict was unanimous, the court determined that it lacked authority to impanel a new jury to consider the defendant\u2019s sentence. The court focused on the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which provides: \u201cIf the jury cannot agree on a punishment, the court shall impanel a different jury to ascertain punishment, unless the defendant, the attorney for the Commonwealth, and the court agree, in the manner provided in \u00a7 19.2-257, that the court shall fix punishment.\u201d The court reasoned that because the jury agreed on a punishment, albeit one below the range prescribed by the applicable statutes, and because the defendant did not agree to an adjustment in that punishment, it had no authority to alter the two-year sentence. Upon <em>de novo </em>review of this legal ruling, we reach a contrary conclusion. We hold that the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in <em>J.K. Rawls, </em>278 Va. 213, 683 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>544, required the trial court to reject the jury\u2019s sentence of two years and to empanel a new jury for sentencing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">In deciding <em>J.K. Rawls, </em>the Supreme Court stated broadly: [W]e adopt the following rule that is designed to ensure that <em>all </em>criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed <em>in violation of the statutorily prescribed ranges </em>are treated uniformly without any speculation. We hold that a sentence imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment is void <em>ab initio </em>because \u201cthe character of the judgment was not such as the [CJourt had the power to render.\u201d Thus, a criminal defendant in that situation is entitled to a new sentencing hearing. This common law rule of jurisprudence will eliminate the need for courts to resort to speculation <em>when determining how a jury would have sentenced a criminal defendant </em>had the jury been properly instructed or <em>had the jury properly followed correct instructions. </em>Applying this rule to Rawls, we hold that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing on his second degree murder conviction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 221, 683 S.E.2d at 549 (second alteration in original) (first, second, fourth, and fifth emphases added) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Anthony v. Kasey, </em>83 Va. 338, 340, 5 S.E. 176, 177 (1887)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The defendant correctly argues that the facts in <em>J.K. Rawls </em>are distinguishable from those in his case. Rawls\u2019 sentence was above, rather than below, the statutorily prescribed range, and the sentencing error in <em>J.K. Rawls </em>resulted from faulty jury instructions rather than the jury\u2019s disregard of proper instructions. <em>Id. </em>at 215-16, 683 S.E.2d at 546. Despite these differences, however, the \u201ccommon law rule of jurisprudence\u201d set out by the Supreme Court was not limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>facts of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 221, 683 S.E.2d at 549. Its holding expressly applies to a jury\u2019s disregard of \u201ccorrect instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also expressly applies to <em>\u201call </em>criminal defendants whose punishments have been fixed in violation of the statutorily prescribed ranges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). It therefore implicitly, and logically, includes both those whose sentences are above the statutory range and those whose sentences are below it. <em>See id. </em>at 220, 683 S.E.2d at 548 (citing <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 848, 858-59 (1871), involving the award of a new trial \u201cwhen the jury fixed the defendant\u2019s punishment <em>below </em>the ... mandatory minimum,\u201d before the advent of the bifurcated trial system (emphasis added)); <em>see also Neace, </em>978 S.W.2d at 321-22 (holding that a jury verdict <em>below </em>the statutory minimum was \u201cunlawful\u201d and that the trial court \u201cproperly corrected the sentence to conform to the law\u201d). Thus, the holding in <em>J.K. Rawls </em>compels the conclusion that the jury\u2019s decision to disregard the proper instruction requiring it to sentence the defendant to five years in prison was error and that the sentence it fixed was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Further, we hold that in this case, under these circumstances, the proper procedure for correcting the error is to remand the case for a new sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 (providing that \u201c[i]f the sentence imposed pursuant to this section is subsequently set aside or found invalid solely due to an error in the sentencing proceeding, the court shall impanel a different jury to ascertain punishment, unless the defendant, the attorney for the Commonwealth and the court agree, in the manner provided in \u00a7 19.2-257, that the court shall fix punishment\u201d); <em>see also J.K. Rawls, </em>278 Va. at 220, 683 S.E.2d at 548 (citing <em>Jones, </em>61 Va. (20 Gratt.) at 858-59).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The Commonwealth specifically requested this remedy in the trial court and assigned error to that court\u2019s refusal to impanel a new jury to remedy the unlawful sentence. On brief and in oral argument, however, the Commonwealth asks us to remand to the trial court with instructions to impose a sentence of five years pursuant to the reasoning in <em>Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 567, 721 S.E.2d 792 (2012). In <em>Hines, </em>we refined the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>J.K. Rawls </em>as it applies to cases in which only a single mandatory sentence is available, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">Ordinarily, \u201ca criminal defendant ... is entitled to a new sentencing hearing\u201d where \u201ca sentence [is] imposed in violation of a prescribed statutory range of punishment.\u201d <em>[J.K.] Rawls, </em>278 Va. at 221, 683 S.E.2d at 549. However, because [on the facts of this case] a term of three years imprisonment is <em>the only available sentence </em>for the trial court to impose, a new sentencing hearing is unnecessary. Accordingly, we need not remand for a new sentencing hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6e\"><em>Hines, </em>59 Va.App. at 581 n. 7, 721 S.E.2d at 798 n. 7 (first, second, and fourth alterations in original) (citation omitted), <em>quoted with approval in Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 682, 689, 739 S.E.2d 276, 279 (2013). Principles of judicial economy supported this result under the facts in <em>Hines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We conclude, however, that regardless of judicial economy, <em>Hines </em>is distinguishable and does not apply here. <em>Hines </em>involved a sentence that <em>exceeded </em>the applicable mandatory fixed sentence, and the defendant in <em>Hines favored </em>the sentence reduction. 59 Va.App. at 570, 721 S.E.2d at 793. In this case, by contrast, the trial court imposed a sentence <em>below </em>the mandatory five years, and the defendant <em>opposes </em>the Commonwealth\u2019s request for an increase of his sentence to the mandatory five years. Additionally, at oral argument, the defendant asserted that if the Court remands the case, resentencing by a jury is the only appropriate remedy. Current Virginia law gives the defendant a statutory right to be sentenced by a jury, and unless the General Assembly provides otherwise, that right takes precedence over principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>judicial economy. Although this procedure may appear formalistic, it is the appropriate resolution in this case absent agreement of the parties as prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Therefore, we remand the case for sentencing by a new jury in a manner consistent with the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The jury\u2019s sentence of two years was unlawful and the trial court\u2019s imposition of that sentence was void <em>ab initio. </em>The court was obligated to reject the jury\u2019s verdict and to impanel a new jury to determine punishment within the limits established by the legislature for the crime for which the original jury found the defendant guilty. Therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling in part, vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence, and remand the case to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding before a different jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>Reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded with instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\">.

The record shows that the jury found that the defendant's prior felony conviction was for an offense classified as \"violent\u201d under the applicable law, the classification that subjected him to the mandatory minimum sentence of five years.

The defendant was afforded that right here when the court, in the guilt phase of trial, submitted to the jury the question whether the prior felony of which he had been convicted was a \"violent\u201d one within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">. <em>J.K.
