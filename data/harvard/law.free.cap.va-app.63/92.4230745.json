Background<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">A. The Events op May 2-3, 2010</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">On the night of Sunday, May 2, 2010, at about twenty minutes before midnight, Huguely walked the short distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>from his apartment building on 14th Street in Charlottesville to another apartment building, also on 14th Street, where Huguely\u2019s former girlfriend, Yeardley Love, resided. Huguely and Love were both nearing graduation from the University of Virginia, and both played lacrosse there. They had dated \u201c[o]n and off\u2019 since their first year at the university, according to the trial testimony of Caitlin Whiteley, one of Love\u2019s roommates. The record establishes a tumultuous relationship between Huguely and Love that deteriorated acrimoniously during the spring semester of 2010. Whiteley testified that, \u201ctowards the end of the [academic] year,\u201d the relationship \u201cwas off, mainly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Love did not invite Huguely to her apartment on the night of May 2. In fact, Whiteley testified that Love was asleep in her bedroom when Whiteley left the apartment at about 10:50 p.m. Huguely arrived just under an hour later. After entering Love\u2019s apartment, which was apparently unlocked, Huguely kicked open Love\u2019s locked bedroom door. No one else witnessed what occurred next. However, Anna Lehmman, a resident of the apartment directly below Love\u2019s, testified that she heard a \u201cvery, very loud\u201d sound from above at about 11:50 p.m. Lehmann explained that it sounded like \u201cslamming the trunk [of a car], that that\u2019s how loud it was, if you really slammed it.\u201d Moments later, Lehmann heard footsteps descending the stairs of the apartment building and then observed a man (later identified as Huguely) walk away outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Whiteley returned to the apartment shortly after 2:15 a.m. on Monday, May 3, 2010. Whiteley went to Love\u2019s bedroom to check on her \u2014 not noticing at first the hole in the bedroom door (that Huguely had created when he kicked in the bedroom door). According to Whiteley, Love was positioned \u201cface down in her pillow\u201d and \u201cher hair was all messed up.\u201d Whiteley moved Love\u2019s hair to the side, but Love made no response. Whiteley saw blood stains on Love\u2019s sheets and pillow case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Then Whiteley noticed that one of Love\u2019s eyes was very badly damaged and that there were many cuts to Love\u2019s face. Whiteley called out for Philippe Oudshoorn, a friend who had accompanied Wdiiteley back to the apartment, and they dialed 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Finding no signs of a pulse from Love, Oudshoorn followed the emergency operator\u2019s instructions to move Love to the floor and attempt CPR. Police officers arrived moments later, followed by the paramedics, who arrived at 2:26 a.m. The paramedics spent twenty-five minutes trying to resuscitate Love. During that entire time, however, Love never showed any signs of life. The medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report that followed Love\u2019s death concluded that the cause of death was blunt force injury to Love\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Whiteley testified that she told the police about Love\u2019s relationship with Huguely, specifically mentioning prior incidents when Huguely had either acted violently or threatened Love with violence. For example, WTiiteley was aware of an incident on February 27, 2010 in Huguely\u2019s bedroom where Love was seen struggling to free herself from Huguely\u2014 whose arms were wrapped around Love\u2019s neck so tightly that Love was being choked. Several witnesses saw Love \u2014 in a panicked state and holding her throat \u2014 run out of Huguely\u2019s apartment. Whiteley testified that, when Love came home to their apartment, Love was \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201cwas crying and visibly shaken and upset.\u201d Whiteley had never seen Love like that before.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Huguely wrote Love a letter apologizing for the way he treated her on February 27, 2010. This letter was admitted into evidence at Huguely\u2019s trial and states, in pertinent part, \u201cYeardley, I cannot describe how sorry I am for what happened this past weekend. I am horrified with the way I behaved and treated you. I\u2019m scared to know that I can get that drunk to that point where I cannot control the way I behave or act.\u201d Huguely\u2019s letter to Love also states, \u201cI\u2019m horrified to think that I was using physical force to keep you in my room. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d The letter concludes, \u201cI\u2019m so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>sorry again and hope to talk with you when you feel you can. I can assure you though that I will never act as I did that Saturday night. I\u2019m sorry again!! Love, George.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Despite the sentiments Huguely expressed in this letter, his relationship with Love continued to deteriorate as the spring semester of 2010 progressed. Notably, following a heated argument between Love and Huguely that occurred on April 27, 2010, the two engaged in a series of angrily worded emails, copies of which were received into the trial evidence. In particular, on April 80, 2010, he emailed her, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">That is so so f* * *ed up on so many levels. I should have killed you. I\u2019m still in utter disbelief at everything that has happened recently and how u handle this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Based on the testimony of several of his teammates from the men\u2019s lacrosse team, Huguely had been drinking alcohol heavily the majority of the day of May 2, 2010 \u2014 since at least 9:30 a.m. Huguely was noticeably intoxicated at a reception following the lacrosse team\u2019s annual golf tournament that afternoon. Dinner at a restaurant with Huguely\u2019s father and two lacrosse teammates was cut short because of Huguely\u2019s drunken behavior. According to one of those teammates, William Thompson, \u201c[I]t just got to the point where we just wanted to get out of there, out of the public.\u201d Huguely urinated in public outside of the restaurant. Huguely\u2019s roommate, Kevin Carroll, testified that Huguely was drunk when Huguely returned to their apartment at 10:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Carroll and another lacrosse teammate, Kenneth Clausen, left the apartment at about 11:40 p.m. and were gone for about fifteen or twenty minutes. Huguely was not there when they returned. Huguely came back at about 12:15 a.m. Clausen testified, \u201cI looked at him for a bit. I noticed there was a change in his demeanor, kind of a blank stare on his face.\u201d Huguely then lied about where he had been \u2014 claiming he had been drinking with a lacrosse teammate who Carroll and Clausen knew was studying at the time. Clausen testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2i\">I said, George, what\u2019s wrong with you? He looked at me and said, nothing. He said that there was nothing wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>I asked him \u2014 I continued to look at him and observe him. I asked him two more times. I said, George, what\u2019s wrong with you? Got no response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Huguely was at his apartment when the police arrived at 7:30 a.m. on Monday, May 3. During an interview with two detectives at the police station that morning, Huguely admitted going to Love\u2019s apartment the night before because he was \u201cso pissed\u201d that she would not talk to him and kicking a hole in the bedroom door to gain access to her bedroom \u2014 but he denied killing her. Huguely also admitted taking Love\u2019s laptop computer as \u201ccollateral\u201d and later throwing the computer in a dumpster.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">B. Huguely\u2019s Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">A grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Huguely with, <em>inter alia, </em>first-degree murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-32 and robbery under Code \u00a7 18.2-58.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By this time, the case had received considerable attention in the media, in the Charlottesville area, and at the University of Virginia. The prospective jurors were directed to complete a nine-page questionnaire that addressed, among other topics, the prospective jurors\u2019 exposure to opinions in the case through the media and through family, friends, and co-workers. <em>Voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors spanned the first three days of the trial. Huguely\u2019s trial ended up lasting over two weeks \u2014 from Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ary 6, 2012 until February 22, 2012. From the beginning of the Commonwealth\u2019s case on February 8, 2012 until the conclusion of the trial, nearly sixty \"witnesses were examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Huguely was represented by two defense attorneys \u2014 Rhonda Quagliana, Esq., and Francis McQ. Lawrence, Esq., both of whom were privately retained by Mr. Huguely. Neither Ms. Quagliana nor Mr. Lawrence was designated as lead counsel, although each attorney assumed different responsibilities during the trial. In particular, it was Ms. Quagliana\u2019s responsibility to examine two medical experts, Jan Leestma, M.D. and Ronald Uscinski, M.D., whose testimony was offered to contradict the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that Love\u2019s death was caused by blunt force trauma to the head. As a matter of trial strategy, Ms. Quagliana and Mr. Lawrence decided that this expert testimony would be more effective if Dr. Leestma and Dr. Uscinski testified in succession, one after the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">On Wednesday, February 15, 2012, the Commonwealth concluded its case-in-chief. The defense\u2019s case-in-chief then began that day with Ms. Quagliana\u2019s examination of Dr. Leestma \u2014 the last witness of the day. However, Ms. Quagliana became very ill due to a stomach virus before the trial proceedings resumed on Thursday, February 16. Ms. Quagliana could not attend court on February 16, and, therefore, she could not examine Dr. Uscinski as the defense had anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Due to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness, the trial judge decided to excuse the jury for the entire day on February 16. Mr. Lawrence alone addressed some matters with the trial judge and the prosecutor, including the instructions to be given to the jury, outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">On the morning of Friday, February 17, Ms. Quagliana remained too ill to attend court. Mr. Lawrence indicated that the nature of Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness was \u201ca day-to-day thing\u201d and that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that she would be able to return to court the following day. Mr. Lawrence stated that he was not prepared to examine Dr. Usckinski and also asserted that it would be unfair to Huguely if Dr. Uscinksi\u2019s examination proceeded without Ms. Quagliana. The trial judge asked Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Lawrence, \u201cNow, today what can you accomplish from your perspective?\u201d Mr. Lawrence replied, \u201cJudge, we have other witnesses today that we are prepared to put on. They are all back there waiting and we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d The trial judge accepted Mr. Lawrence\u2019s offer to examine those defense witnesses on the morning of February 17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial judge also indicated that, if Ms. Quagliana could not return to court by the afternoon to examine Dr. Uscinski, then the jury would likely need to be excused for the remainder of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Following a short recess, however, Mr. Lawrence actually moved for a continuance until Ms. Quagliana was able to return to court. According to Mr. Lawrence, Huguely did not feel comfortable with the taking of any evidence until Ms. Quagliana returned. Mr. Lawrence acknowledged that \u201cthe Commonwealth has pointed out the stress on the people on [the Commonwealth\u2019s] side of the courtroom by these delays and we have sympathy for that\u201d problem. However, Mr. Lawrence added, \u201c[W]e haven\u2019t looked at the case law on [the issue of] if you have two lawyers, do you have the right to both of them? I think you probably do, so [Huguely] objects to proceeding at all until he has his full defense team.\u201d In response, the trial judge asked Mr. Lawrence, \u201cWell, do you feel competent proceeding this morning? I guess you did or you wouldn\u2019t be offering to do it, right?\u201d Mr. Lawrence replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d The trial judge denied the motion for a continuance, commenting that Mr. Lawrence was \u201cabout as capable as any lawyer in the town to handle something like this, and I have no doubt that you\u2019re capable of handling these witnesses today in competent fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Mr. Lawrence then examined those defense witnesses whom he had initially offered to examine \u2014 but not Dr. Uscinski. When the trial judge learned that Ms. Quagliana was unable to return to court at all that day, the trial judge excused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>jury for the remainder of the day.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the next morning, Saturday, February 18, the trial resumed. Ms. Quagliana was in court, and she examined Dr. Uscinski that morning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence and closing arguments, the jury found that Huguely was guilty of second-degree murder and grand larceny. The trial judge denied Huguely\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict, and Huguely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A. Assignment of Error I \u2014 Right to Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"A7p\">In Assignment of Error I, Huguely argues that the trial judge committed reversible error under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by denying Huguely\u2019s motion for a continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>on the morning of Friday, February 17, 2012, when Ms. Quagliana (one of Huguely\u2019s two retained attorneys) remained too ill to attend court. Huguely argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), requires that this Court grant him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>1. Governing Principles and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The Sixth Amendment states, in pertinent part, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201c[A]n element of this right is the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 144, 126 S.Ct. at 2561. However, the United States Supreme Court has never held that the Sixth Amendment right to a retained counsel of choice is <em>absolute. See id. </em>(recognizing that this right \u201cis circumscribed in several important respects\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>see also Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 159, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 1697, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988) (\u201c[Wjhile the right to select and be represented by one\u2019s preferred attorney is comprehended by the Sixth Amendment, the essential aim of the Amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">On appeal, issues of constitutional interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo. See Gallagher v. Commonwealth, </em>284 Va. 444, 449, 732 S.E.2d 22, 24 (2012); <em>Crawford v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 84, 97, 704 S.E.2d 107, 115 (2011). Consequently, any issues raised by Huguely in Assignment of Error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>I that require interpreting the Sixth Amendment or interpreting the binding case law that addresses the Sixth Amendment right to counsel must be considered <em>de novo </em>by this Court. However, as the Supreme Court also explained in <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUG\">Trial judges necessarily require a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials. Not the least of their problems is that of assembling the witnesses, lawyers, and jurors at the same place at the same time, and this burden counsels against continuances except for compelling reasons. Consequently, broad discretion must be granted trial courts on matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary \u201cinsistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay\u201d violates the right to the assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616 (quoting <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)); <em>see also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 369, 374, 657 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2008). Therefore, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that trial judges necessarily retain the discretion, when the circumstances demand, \u201cto make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendant\u2019s first choice of counsel.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 152, 126 S.Ct. at 2566; <em>see also Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616; <em>Johnson, </em>51 Va.App. at 374, 657 S.E.2d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has explained that, \u201c \u2018when a decision is discretionary ... the court has a range of choice, and ... its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 212-13, 738 S.E.2d 847, 862 (2013) (quoting <em>Landrum v. Chippenham &amp; Johnston-Willis Hosps., Inc., </em>282 Va. 346, 352, 717 S.E.2d 134, 137 (2011)). The abuse of discretion standard is \u201chighly deferential\u201d to trial courts and is rooted in \u201c \u2018the venerable belief that the judge closest to the contest is the judge best able to discern where the equities lie.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 104, 111-12, 742 S.E.2d 403, 407 (2013) (quoting <em>Hamad v. Hamad, </em>61 Va.App. 593, 607, 739 S.E.2d 232, 239 (2013)). \u201c \u2018Only when reasonable jurists could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Landeck v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 744, 751, 722 S.E.2d 643, 647 (2012) (quoting <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>2. The Result in Gonzalez-Lopez Does Not Require a New Trial Here</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 150, 126 S.Ct. at 2564-65, the United States Supreme Court held that the erroneous denial of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a retained attorney of choice constitutes structural error. \u201c[Structural error is reserved for the \u2018limited class\u2019 of errors that \u2018defy analysis by harmless error standards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ray v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 647, 651, 688 S.E.2d 879, 881-82 (2010) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, 527 </em>U.S. 1, 7, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)). Put another way, an \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d is required when there is structural error. <em>Neder, 527 </em>U.S. at 8, 119 S.Ct. at 1833. However, no structural error exists in this case, and the decision in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>does not compel a new trial here.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In short, this case is not like <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>because the circumstances here are very different than the circumstances in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>as we note below. Beyond such factual differences, however, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>did not squarely address <em>the very legal issue </em>that we must deal with here \u2014 i.e., specifically, how to determine whether a criminal defendant, such as Huguely, actually has been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to representation by a retained attorney. In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>the prosecution <em>conceded </em>error on that issue, and the Supreme Court accepted that concession as appropriate without further analysis. Thus, the Supreme Court only addressed the proper <em>remedy </em>for a Sixth Amendment violation of this type of conceded structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Before being entitled to the remedy of a new trial, Huguely must first show that there actually was some error that requires a new trial. <em>See Johnson, </em>51 Va.App. at 376, 657 S.E.2d at 815 <em>(\u201cGonzalez-Lopez </em>clearly applies only to sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tions where a trial court <em>erroneously </em>denies a defendant his right to counsel of his choice.\u201d). As this Court explained in <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 600, 652 S.E.2d 156 (2007), when discussing structural error under the Sixth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">The \u201cstructural\u201d adjective merely denotes that the violation of the right cannot be subjected to the harmless error doctrine on appeal. <em>Id. </em>Whether the right has been violated in the first place is not affected by the structural classification of the alleged violation. A constitutional defect, in other words, must first be shown to exist before its structural or nonstructural qualities become relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 604, 652 S.E.2d at 158. Stated more simply, Huguely\u2019s argument on <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>here places the cart before the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Neither <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>nor any other decision Huguely relies upon actually supports Huguely\u2019s claim that the trial judge committed Sixth Amendment <em>error </em>here. Those cases have significant factual differences from this case. The commonality in those cases \u2014 but not in this case \u2014 was a ruling <em>by a trial court </em>that essentially <em>barred </em>a retained attorney from representing the defendant in the first place. In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 144, 126 S.Ct. at 2561, due to an erroneous application of the local rules of court by the trial judge in that case, one of the defendant\u2019s retained attorneys was actually prohibited from examining witnesses, arguing the case at trial, or even sitting at the counsel table \u2014 and could not even meet with the defendant until the last night of trial. In <em>London v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 230, 239, 638 S.E.2d 721, 725 (2006), the defendant\u2019s family had retained an attorney sixteen days before trial, and the trial judge was notified of that fact only four days later; however, the trial judge there nevertheless denied a continuance to permit the retained attorney to prepare for trial. In <em>United States v. Laura, </em>607 F.2d 52, 54-55 (3d Cir.1979), the trial judge erred by summarily ruling that one of the defendant\u2019s retained attorneys could not represent the defendant simply because of a perceived conflict of interest between that attorney and the trial judge. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>short, the trial judge barred the defendant from the defendant\u2019s retained attorney of choice rather than deciding whether transferring the case or reassigning it to a different judge was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. Likewise, in <em>Rodriguez v. Chandler, </em>492 F.3d 863, 864 (7th Cir.2007), the trial judge there erroneously barred a retained attorney from even representing the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Here, however, the trial judge never <em>barred </em>Ms. Quagliana from representing Mr. Huguely at trial. The issue here arose due to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s untimely illness. The trial judge was simply responding to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence. He did not create it. Furthermore, the trial judge actually accommodated Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence \u2014 excusing the jury during an already lengthy trial for the entire day on February 16 and for the afternoon on February 17 so that Ms. Quagliana could return to examine Dr. Uscinski. It is true that Ms. Quagliana was not present when testimony was heard by the jury on the morning of February 17. However, surely the Sixth Amendment does not impose an absolute requirement, when a defendant is represented by two or more retained attorneys, that a jury trial must completely grind to a halt, as a matter of constitutional law, simply because <em>one </em>of the defendant\u2019s retained attorneys has become ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>3. No Abuse of Discretion by the Trial Judge Here</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Huguely recognizes there is language in the <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>decision explaining that a trial judge retains discretion \u201cto make scheduling and other decisions that effectively exclude a defendant\u2019s first choice of counsel.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 152, 126 S.Ct. at 2566. Huguely contends that the trial judge here was required to balance Huguely\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment with the court\u2019s scheduling concerns. He argues that no such balancing occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, however, as we must since the Commonwealth prevailed at trial, the record shows that the trial judge\u2019s decision here was reasonable. First, we note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>trial judge excused the jury for <em>the entire day </em>on Thursday, February 16, when Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness first arose as an issue in this case. When the trial judge first learned of Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness on the morning of February 16, he ordered a recess without any such request by Mr. Lawrence even appearing in the record. Explaining to the jury why the court was recessing until 12:30 p.m., the trial judge indicated that he hoped to proceed with the trial at that time <em>if </em>Ms. Quagliana was able to return to court by then. When it became clear that Ms. Quagliana could not return at all on February 16, Mr. Lawrence moved to adjourn until 9:00 a.m. the next day. The trial judge granted this request without at all questioning the need to adjourn at that time. The record reflects that the parties and the trial judge hoped that Ms. Quagliana would be able to return to court the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">When Ms. Quagliana was unable to attend court for a second consecutive day on Friday, February 17, 2012, the continuing nature of Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness meant that the issue needed to be dealt with somewhat differently as her illness persisted. The record suggests that the attorneys present and the trial judge recognized that the circumstances had changed. Thus, Mr. Lawrence himself offered first to question those defense witnesses whom he was prepared to examine. Mr. Lawrence then retracted this offer and moved for a continuance after speaking with Huguely during a short recess. Mr. Lawrence suggested that there was authority stating that a defendant who has hired two lawyers has a right to have both lawyers present. Mr. Lawrence contended that this right \u201cprobably\u201d exists, although he was vague concerning the source of authority for his contention. Mr. Lawrence\u2019s argument in support of the motion instead essentially concerned Huguely\u2019s level of comfort with having both of his attorneys present. Furthermore, even as he sought a continuance, Mr. Lawrence still acknowledged the Commonwealth\u2019s interests and expressed \u201csympathy\u201d for \u201cthe stress\u201d put on the Commonwealth \u201cby these delays\u201d resulting from Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness. Moreover, Mr. Lawrence also candidly represented to the trial judge that he still felt capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>examining the defense witnesses whom he had initially offered to examine that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As an appellate court, \u201cwe do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court\u201d when a matter is discretionary and we \u201cconsider only whether the record fairly supports the trial court\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385, 484 S.E.2d 898, 906 (1997). Based on the totality of the circumstances here, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s decision to proceed with the examination of defense witnesses by Mr. Lawrence on February 17, 2012 must be affirmed because it was supported by the record on appeal. <em>Id. </em>The record supports a conclusion that the trial judge thoughtfully considered Huguely\u2019s right to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s presence in the courtroom against other concerns that Mr. Lawrence himself recognized \u2014 i.e., the need to proceed with the trial in a timely manner and Mr. Lawrence\u2019s ability to examine those witnesses he was already prepared to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In support of this conclusion, we rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s own explanation in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>of why the erroneous deprivation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the retained counsel of choice is so significant that it constitutes structural error defying the normal harmless error review. The Supreme Court there discussed the many aspects of a criminal case that might be handled differently depending on a defendant\u2019s choice of retained counsel, which includes (in the words of the Supreme Court in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez </em>):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u2022 \u201cinvestigation and discovery\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u2022 \u201cdevelopment of the theory of defense\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u2022 \u201cselection of the jury\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u2022 \u201cpresentation of the witnesses\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">\u2022 \u201cstyle of witness examination\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">\u2022 \u201cjury argument\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">\u2022 \u201cwhether and on what terms the defendant cooperates with the prosecution\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">\u2022 \u201cplea bargains\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u2022 \u201cthe framework within which the trial proceeds\u201d \u2014 or \u201cwhether it proceeds at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 150, 126 S.Ct. at 2564-65 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Almost none of these considerations apply to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence in this case while she was ill.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Furthermore, while the examination of some defense witnesses proceeded in Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence, Mr. Lawrence represented to the trial judge that he was prepared to examine those witnesses\u2014 and he actually reaffirmed this representation even after seeking a continuance on Huguely\u2019s behalf. <em>See Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616 (\u201cIn the face of the unequivocal and uncontradicted statement by a responsible officer of the court that he was fully prepared and \u2018ready\u2019 for trial, it was far from an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance. On this record, it would have been remarkable had the trial court not accepted counsel\u2019s assurances.\u201d). There is no indication that Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence had a meaningful effect on the style or manner in which those defense witnesses were examined by defense counsel. Indeed, it appears from the record that Mr. Lawrence would have been the retained defense attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>examining those witnesses<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> even if Ms. Quagliana had been present in court on the morning of February 17. Given all of the circumstances in the record of this case, the nature of Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence from the trial was not so pervasive as to render its effect essentially unquantifiable and thereby create structural error under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s application of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 150, 126 S.Ct. at 2565 (when the Supreme Court said, after the government conceded Sixth Amendment error, \u201cIt is impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Simply put, the trial judge here did not display an <em>\u201cunreasoning and arbitrary </em>insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12, 103 S.Ct. at 1616 (emphasis added). The trial judge certainly did not arbitrarily disregard Huguely\u2019s right to Ms. Quagliana\u2019s presence at trial. Given the way the trial court handled Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence, it appears that he actually gave the request to have Ms. Quagliana present in the courtroom significantly <em>greater </em>weight than the other concerns which he had to consider. As a result, the trial judge excused the jury for the entire day of February 16 and for the afternoon of February 17. However, the trial judge was also entitled to find that Ms. Quagliana\u2019s presence at trial did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>necessarily outweigh any and every other concern at all times. This is especially true since Huguely was represented by two retained attorneys of equal authority \u2014 one of whom was still in the courtroom and assuring the court that he felt comfortable with examining witnesses that he was prepared to examine and would have examined anyway. Otherwise, we would be obligated to hold as a matter of law that Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness completely bound the trial judge\u2019s hands and required that the trial come to a standstill for a second consecutive day. That holding would remove any discretion from the trial judge \u2014 which would contradict established case law interpreting the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. at 152, 126 S.Ct. at 2565-66; <em>Morris, </em>461 U.S. at 11-12,103 S.Ct. at 1616; <em>Johnson, </em>51 Va.App. at 374, 657 S.E.2d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Based on our review of the record, the trial judge only ordered the trial to proceed in Ms. Quagliana\u2019s absence when doing so had the least impact on her role as co-counsel at trial. Especially given the uncertainty of when Ms. Quagliana actually would return to court, we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion. Huguely was not <em>erroneously </em>deprived of his Sixth Amendment right. <em>See Johnson, </em>51 Va.App. at 376, 657 S.E.2d at 815. Accordingly, despite Huguely\u2019s request for a new murder trial on this basis, a new trial simply is not required under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>B. Assignment of Error <em>11(A) </em>\u2014 Voir <em>Dire </em>Question<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">In Assignment of Error 11(A), Huguely argues that the trial judge erred by deciding during <em>voir dire </em>that defense counsel could not ask the remaining prospective jurors the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">If [the] defense offered testimony about Ms. Love\u2019s consumption of alcohol or uncomplimentary testimony about her behavior to explain the nature of her relationship with Mr. Huguely and his motives, would that cause you to think that we were blaming or attacking Ms. Love?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial judge explained his ruling by stating, \u201cI don\u2019t think the question is really a helpful one because I think it all has to do with what the evidence actually shows, and I think without them knowing what the evidence shows, it\u2019s hard for them to know whether or not it\u2019s going to appear to be blaming the victim or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In other words, the trial judge found that the nature of the question was too conditional to satisfy the purpose of jury selection. As the trial judge commented in denying a somewhat rephrased version of the question proposed by defense counsel,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this line of questioning went \u201cinto the merits of the defense\u201d that would actually be presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\n<em>1. The Question Was Not Required Under Code \u00a7 8.01-858</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">The Supreme Court has held that a criminal defendant \u201cdoes not have an unlimited constitutional or statutory right to propound any question to a jury panel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em>264 Va. 315, 319, 568 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002). Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>\u201cthe questions propounded during <em>voir dire </em>must be relevant to the factors prescribed in Code \u00a7 8.01-358.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358 states, in pertinent part, that the trial court and the attorneys for either pqrty \u201cshall have the right to ask [a prospective juror] directly any relevant question to ascertain whether he is <em>related to either party, </em>or has any <em>interest in the cause, </em>or has <em>expressed or formed any opinion, </em>or is <em>sensible of any bias or prejudice </em>therein.... \u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMF\">\u201cThe test of relevancy is whether the questions relate to any of the four criteria set forth in the statute. If an answer to the question would necessarily disclose, or clearly lead to the disclosure of the statutory factors of relationship, interest, opinion, or prejudice, it must be permitted. Questions which go beyond this standard are entirely within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><em>Hill, </em>264 Va. at 319, 568 S.E.2d at 675 (quoting <em>Davis v. Sykes, </em>202 Va. 952, 121 S.E.2d 513 (1961)); <em>see Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 594-95, 96 S.Ct. 1017, 1020, 47 L.Ed.2d 258 (1976) <em>(\u201cVoir dire </em>is conducted under the supervision of the court, and a great deal must, of necessity, be left to its sound discretion.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>96 F.3d 734, 739 (4th Cir.1996) (\u201cPart and parcel of deference to the trial court\u2019s conduct of <em>voir dire </em>is a reluctance to second-guess the court\u2019s decision to refuse inquiry into certain matters.\u201d). Stated another way, the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cA party has no right, statutory or otherwise, to propound any question he wishes, or to extend <em>voir dire </em>questioning <em>ad infinitum.\u201d LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 581, 304 S.E.2d 644, 653 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Applying these principles, we hold that the question that Huguely wished to pose to the prospective jurors was not required for purposes of <em>voir dire </em>because it did not relate to the four factors stated in Code \u00a7 8.01-358. First, the question would not reveal whether a prospective juror was related to the parties. Second, the question would not reveal whether a prospective juror had an interest in the case. Third, the question would not reveal whether a prospective juror had expressed or formed an opinion about the case. Fourth, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>question would not reveal whether a prospective juror was \u201csensible of any bias or prejudice\u201d that would affect the juror\u2019s ability to render a fair verdict. Code \u00a7 8.01-358. Furthermore, as the trial judge ruled, a juror could not accurately answer the question until he saw how the defense actually presented its evidence at trial. And so the question could not reveal any bias or prejudice on the juror\u2019s part \u2014 or anything that would relate to any of the other criteria before the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">While the trial judge may have initially approved the use of this question by Huguely\u2019s counsel, it did so before <em>voir </em>dire\u2014 before the trial judge could observe the question being posed in practice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nothing prevented the trial judge from reconsidering his earlier decision. The trial judge\u2019s later ruling that the question was inappropriate for <em>voir dire </em>certainly did not constitute an abuse of discretion \u2014 given that the question was not relevant under any of the factors stated in Code \u00a7 8.01-358.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>2. Juror 34,\u2019s Responses Do Not Prove the Question\u2019s Relevance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Contrary to Huguely\u2019s argument on appeal, the trial judge\u2019s decision to strike Juror 34 from the venire does not prove the relevance of Huguely\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>question about blaming the victim. Juror 34 did <em>not </em>state during <em>voir dire </em>that he would feel as though the defense was blaming the victim if the defense offered evidence that was uncomplimentary of Love. Instead, Juror 34 said that his response <em>would depend on how the evidence was presented. </em>Several times during <em>voir dire, </em>Juror 34 conveyed the conditional nature of his response, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">If you presented it in a mean or accusatory way trying to put all the blame on her, you know, then I might.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Well, if you were mean about it instead of just presenting facts, you could turn me over to the other side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">I don\u2019t think [my view of the case would be affected] so as long as you presented the facts in a dignified manner instead of ... in an angry manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Furthermore, Juror 34 told Huguely\u2019s attorney that his concern that the facts be presented in a dignified manner would not affect his sense of impartiality or neutrality.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In addition, Juror 34 clarified his view even more while responding to the trial judge\u2019s questioning. The trial judge asked, \u2018Would your displeasure be shared between the sides equally if you felt that one side or the other was presenting what they were presenting in an angry [manner] or a manner that you felt was inappropriate?\u201d Juror 34 replied, \u201cI think so.\u201d Juror 34 then agreed with the trial judge\u2019s observation that it seemed as though Juror 34\u2019s potentially negative reaction to an angry or undignified presentation of evidence \u201cwould go against both\u201d parties \u201ceither way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">In short, Juror 34\u2019s responses indicated that he might react negatively if a party\u2019s attorney seemed <em>angry or undignified. </em>His responses did not necessarily concern how he would react if the defense presented evidence that was uncomplimentary of Love \u2014 without also doing so in an angry or undignified manner. The responses of Juror 34 reflected the ambiguity inherent in defense counsel\u2019s question. <em>See Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 401, 384 S.E.2d 757, 764 (1989) (\u201cFurther, trial courts are not required to allow counsel to ask questions which are so ambiguous as to render the answers meaningless.\u201d). As Juror 34 himself said, the answer to the defense\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>question would depend \u201con how [that evidence] was presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The trial judge ultimately granted Huguely\u2019s motion to strike Juror 34 for cause, but the trial judge appeared to do so mainly because the Commonwealth decided not to oppose the motion. Nevertheless, the trial judge also recognized the conditional nature of Juror 34\u2019s responses \u2014 remarking that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Juror 34 seemed to \u201cqualify\u201d his responses by disapproving of anything done at trial in an \u201cangry\u201d manner. Based on our review of the transcript of Juror 34\u2019s <em>voir dire, </em>the trial judge\u2019s assessment here was reasonable and further refutes Huguely\u2019s contention that the trial judge was required to permit the <em>voir dire </em>question.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he ruled after the <em>voir dire </em>of Juror 34 that the defense\u2019s line of questioning about blaming the victim was not an appropriate topic for <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">C. Assignment of Error 11(B) \u2014 Motions to Strike Prospective Jurors for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In Assignment of Error 11(B), Huguely argues that the trial judge committed reversible error when the judge declined motions to strike several prospective jurors from the venire. <em>See Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736-37 (1976) (holding that a criminal defendant cannot be forced to use peremptory strikes on jurors who should have been stricken for cause). Huguely contends that these prospective jurors\u2019 \u201canswers during <em>voir dire </em>raised serious doubts about their ability to remain impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\n<em>1. General Principles and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Code \u00a7 8.01-358 states, in pertinent part, \u201c[I]f it shall appear to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause, another shall be drawn or called and placed in his stead for the trial of that case.\u201d Thus, \u201c[i]f a prospective juror \u2018does not stand indifferent to the cause, he is not competent. If he has any interest in the cause, or is related to either party, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice, he is excluded by the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lovos-Rivas v.

Juror impartiality is a question of fact, <em>see Wainwright v.

Juror 32</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">On brief, Huguely contends that the \u201cmost glaring error\u201d made by the trial judge during <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors involved Juror 32. Huguely relies in large part on the fact that Juror 32 indicated in the juror questionnaire that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>felt that Huguely was guilty based on conversations with others and based on the media reports that she had seen. However, that does not tell the entire story, as reflected in the entire record from the questionnaire and the <em>voir dire. </em>Juror 32 also wrote by hand, \u201cDo have an open mind!\u201d Juror 32 indicated further on the questionnaire that she was unsure whether she had formed an opinion about the accuracy or truth of the media reports that she had seen about the case. By the time of <em>voir dire, </em>Juror 32 denied having formed an opinion as to Huguely\u2019s guilt or innocence and explained that she could make a decision based on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 180, 279 S.E.2d 151 (1981), guides our analysis of Juror 32. <em>Briley </em>\u2014 like this case \u2014 attracted considerable media attention. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 279 S.E.2d at 152. In light of the extensive media coverage of that case, prospective jurors were asked if they believed Briley was guilty. One prospective juror responded, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t ... say my opinion but <em>right now my opinion is that he is guilty ... </em>but I can\u2019t really say until I hear the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182, 279 S.E.2d at 152 (emphasis added). Another replied, \u201cWell, I think it looks pretty bad for him ... from what I\u2019ve seen and read in the paper, I mean it \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t judge it on that basis but it looks pretty bad, I think.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That second prospective juror continued, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t see how all of the information that has been given in the papers and it\u2019s gone through the Grand Jury and has gotten to this point if there wasn\u2019t some guilt there,\u201d also adding that he did not consider it \u201clikely\u201d that Briley could be not guilty. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court affirmed Briley\u2019s convictions \u2014 disagreeing with Briley\u2019s argument that these prospective jurors made a \u201cpre-determination of guilt\u201d that disqualified them from sitting on the jury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Briley </em>expressed several principles that apply here. First, the Supreme Court rejected Briley\u2019s assertion that prospective jurors who have \u201cformed an opinion from what they had read and heard in news accounts\u201d simply \u201ccan never qualify\u201d as impartial jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 279 S.E.2d at 154. Instead, the Supreme Court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>\u201cIn these days of swift, widespread and diverse methods of communication, an important case can be expected to arouse the interest of the public in the vicinity, and scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 186, 279 S.E.2d at 154 (quoting <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1642, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961)). Second, the Supreme Court differentiated between \u201ca casual impression\u201d that does not necessarily disqualify a prospective juror and \u201ca fixed and abiding conviction\u201d that must disqualify a prospective juror. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 279 S.E.2d at 154; <em>see Griffin, </em>19 Va.App. at 621, 454 S.E.2d at 364 (\u201cIt is not uncommon to discover during <em>voir dire </em>that prospective jurors have preconceived notions, opinions, or misconceptions about the criminal justice system, criminal trials and procedure, or about the particular case.\u201d). And third, the Supreme Court emphasized that the prospective juror\u2019s entire <em>voir dire </em>must be considered \u2014 not just isolated portions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Briley, </em>222 Va. at 186, 279 S.E.2d at 155 (noting that, in <em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 802, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2037, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975), a prospective juror did not need to be struck for cause, even though he acknowledged that \u201cright now I would find [the defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>guilty,\u201d since the <em>voir dire </em>transcript also revealed other \u201cindicia of impartiality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">With these principles in mind, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s decision not to strike Juror 32 for cause was not manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion. <em>See Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826, 553 S.E.2d at 732. While the responses by Juror 32 in the jury questionnaire were somewhat in tension, she did indicate plainly and emphatically in her own handwriting, \u201cDo have an open mind!\u201d Furthermore, during the actual <em>voir dire </em>\u2014 when the trial judge could actually observe her responses and demeanor \u2014 Juror 32 made several statements supporting a finding that she could be an impartial juror with an open mind. Noting that there are two sides to a story, Juror 32 said she would withhold judgment \u201cuntil I\u2019ve heard the ifs and ands on what happened, you know.\u201d Juror 32 further alleviated concerns that she had prejudged the case by pointing out that \u201cthe actual individual does not get all the facts through the media\u201d and also by stating that, \u201cif I didn\u2019t feel factually that I had been shown that he was guilty, then, you know, no, I would not\u201d find Huguely guilty. Based on these responses, and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Briley, </em>the decision not to strike Juror 32 for cause was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>3. Juror 35</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Huguely argues that Juror 35 should have been struck for cause because Juror 35 is an employee of the University of Virginia, because Juror 35 felt that Huguely\u2019s case placed the University of Virginia in a bad light, and because he believes that male athletes are violent. Huguely also contends that several of Juror 35\u2019s responses during <em>voir dire </em>were equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Juror 35 said during <em>voir dire </em>that the case was \u201cwidely discussed\u201d at the university, acknowledged that he had been involved in \u201cmy share\u201d of casual discussions about it with colleagues, and opined that \u201cit would be better if we [made] the news with another Nobel prize or something.\u201d When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>asked whether he could explain a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict to his colleagues, Juror 35 replied, \u201cI think I can handle it.\u201d Similarly, when asked whether he would \u201chave any reluctance at all to return a not guilty verdict given the impact this case has had on the University of Virginia, the fact that it\u2019s generated bad publicity for them,\u201d Juror 35 said, \u201cNo, I think I could take it on the evidence as it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Huguely seizes on Juror 35\u2019s use of the word, \u201cthink,\u201d characterizing Juror 35\u2019s responses as too equivocal to ensure his impartiality and indifference to the cause. However, the Supreme Court has observed that the word \u201cthink\u201d can have different meanings depending on one\u2019s demeanor, emphasis, and tone of voice \u2014 and has held that such contextual determinations must be made by the trial court during <em>voir dire. Weeks v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 460, 475, 450 S.E.2d 379, 389 (1994). Furthermore, the cases upon which Huguely relies in support of his argument that Juror 35 was too equivocal are distinguishable from this case. Specifically, in those cases, the prospective jurors who gave equivocal responses all acknowledged a personal connection to the nature of the criminal offense being prosecuted. <em>See Clements v. Commonwealth, 21 </em>Va.App. 386, 391, 464 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1995) (in a forcible sodomy case, the prospective juror had a relative who had been a victim of sexual assault, leaving him \u201c[sjlightly\u201d predisposed against people charged with sexual offenses); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 199, 204, 510 S.E.2d 751, 753 (1999) (in a rape case, the prospective juror, who had been the victim of an attempted abduction and possible sexual assault, did not \u201chonestly know\u201d whether this experience would leave her with a bias against the accused); <em>Moten v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 956, 957, 420 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1992) (in a drug case, the prospective juror said that her husband was a recovering addict and that drugs were a \u201ctouchy\u201d subject for her). By contrast, the record does not establish that Juror 35 or any of his loved ones had been the victim of a violent crime. Moreover, the record discloses several <em>voir dire </em>responses by Juror 35 that were not equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In addition, the trial judge was not required to strike Juror 35 for cause based on Juror 35\u2019s stated opinions about male athletes. During <em>voir dire, </em>Juror 35 clarified his questionnaire response on that subject and asserted a belief that male athletes are not <em>inherently </em>violent. Instead, he said he believed only that violence can result due to the competitive environment of athletics. The record shows that defense counsel asked Juror 35, \u201cIs your predisposition ... that men who are athletes are more likely to be violent people or less violent people?\u201d Juror 35 responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">I think they\u2019re about the same. I think they\u2019re sort of the same as everyone else. I think they\u2019re put in situations\u2014 they\u2019re deliberately put in situations where they\u2019re competitive and they sort of thrive on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Juror 35 added, \u201c[T]he games are violent.\u201d Juror 35 never actually said that male athletes themselves were more inherently disposed by their nature to violence off the playing field.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">On this record, we cannot say that <em>no </em>reasonable jurist would agree with the trial judge that Juror 35 was competent to serve as a juror here. <em>See Grattan, </em>278 Va. at 620, 685 S.E.2d at 644. Accordingly, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he declined to strike Juror 35 for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">J. <em>Juror 182</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">With respect to Juror 182, Huguely notes that this juror made a comment during <em>voir dire </em>that the area of Charlottesville near Love\u2019s apartment was \u201ca dangerous place to be.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, during questioning by defense counsel, Juror 182 clarified that he only meant this comment in the sense that \u201csomeone lost their life.\u201d Juror 182 added, \u201cI\u2019m not speaking to the facts of the case except for the fact that a death happened. There\u2019s no \u2014 that is a fact but it doesn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>really have anything to do with guilt or innocence.\u201d As the trial judge found, Juror 182 did not form an opinion that would disqualify him as a juror. Therefore, the trial judge certainly did not commit manifest error by declining to strike Juror 182 for cause. <em>See Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826, 553 S.E.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>5. Juror 211</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Huguely moved to strike Juror 211 based on her affiliation with the University of Virginia, including the fact that one of Love\u2019s friends was enrolled in a class taught by Juror 211 at the time of Love\u2019s death. Juror 211 stated during <em>voir dire </em>that she helped the student to get a postponement of the final exam so that the student could attend Love\u2019s funeral. However, Juror 211 also stated that she did not know Love\u2019s friend well at all \u2014 adding that she was mortified because she could not even remember the name of the student during <em>voir dire. </em>Juror 211 asserted plainly that having Love\u2019s friend in her class \u201chas not\u201d had any impact on how she viewed Huguely\u2019s case and also denied that her status as an employee of the university would affect her view of the case. In response to the following question by defense counsel, Juror 211 replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">Q: Was there anything about anything that\u2019s gone on at the university with respect to this case, including information you\u2019ve received, e-mails you\u2019ve received, information you received from [University of Virginia President] Teresa Sullivan, any of those things, that has caused you to form any opinions or understanding or sympathies or anything of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">A: Not at all, no. I read the memos but I did not participate in any of the activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Defense counsel sought to strike Juror 211 \u201cjust for the record,\u201d and the trial judge denied this request, finding that \u201cthere\u2019s not a shred of indication that this juror cannot be objective.\u201d We must defer to the trial judge\u2019s finding because it was not plainly wrong or unsupported by the record. <em>See Lovos-Rivas, </em>58 Va.App. at 61-62, 707 S.E.2d at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\n<em>6. Jurors 36 &amp; 72</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In arguing that Jurors 36 and 72 should have been struck for cause, Huguely relies on their statements concerning excessive consumption of alcohol. However, both prospective jurors said that their views would not affect their judgment in this case. Juror 36 denied believing that evidence of Huguely\u2019s drinking would make him \u201cmore blameworthy\u201d in Juror 36\u2019s view and also saw \u201cno problem\u201d with applying the trial judge\u2019s instructions. Juror 72 called the use of alcohol \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said that a close family member had suffered a serious injury due to the effects of being intoxicated. However, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think my viewing it as something of consequence would blind me to information or prejudice me against facts.\u201d Juror 72 did not express any reservations about applying the law as instructed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Accordingly, based on our review of the voluminous pages of the transcript devoted to jury selection, we do not detect any abuse of discretion by the trial judge that occurred during <em>voir dire </em>with regard to Jurors 32, 35, 36, 72, 182, or 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">D. Assignment op Error III \u2014 Jury Instruction Addressing Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In Assignment of Error III, Huguely argues that the trial judge erred when he refused Huguely\u2019s proposed jury instruction concerning malice. Huguely\u2019s proposed jury instruction would have added language to the jury instruction offered by the Commonwealth. Huguely\u2019s entire proposed jury instruction is quoted below \u2014 with the language he sought to add to the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction italicized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Malice is that state of mind which results in the intentional doing of a wrongful act to another without legal excuse or justification, at a time when the mind of the actor is under the control of reason. Malice may result from any unlawful or unjustifiable motive, including anger, hatred or revenge. <em>It is not confined to ill will to any one or more particular persons, but is intended to denote an action flowing from a wicked or corrupt motive, done with an evil mind and purpose and wrongful intention, where the act has been </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>attended with such circumstances as to carry in them the plain indication of a heart regardless of social duty and fatally bent on mischief. </em>Malice may be inferred from any deliberate, willful, and cruel act against another, however sudden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The law governing review of this assignment of error is settled. \u201c \u2018A reviewing court\u2019s responsibility in reviewing jury instructions is to see that the law has been clearly stated and that the instructions cover all issues which the evidence fairly raises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 725, 735, 697 S.E.2d 20, 26 (2010) (quoting <em>Chibikom v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 422, 425, 680 S.E.2d 295, 296 (2009)); <em>see Hancock-Underwood v. Knight, </em>277 Va. 127, 131, 670 S.E.2d 720, 722 (2009) (\u201cWhether the content of the instruction is an accurate statement of the relevant legal principles is a question of law that, like all questions of law [is] reviewed] <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>A trial court \u201chas broad discretion over whether to give or deny proposed jury instructions.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>56 Va.App. at 736, 697 S.E.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Here, the trial judge without question provided the jury an accurate instruction addressing malice. The instruction offered by the Commonwealth, which the trial judge accepted and read to the jury, has been approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia and is a model jury instruction on malice. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 131, 160-61, 688 S.E.2d 220, 236-37 (2010); Model Jury Instruction No. 33.220. The jury was correctly instructed on malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Huguely argues that the language he wanted added to the Commonwealth\u2019s instruction is an accurate statement of the law as well and should have been given to the jury. However, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by declining to use Huguely\u2019s instruction. \u201cWhen granted instructions fully and fairly cover a principle of law, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing another instruction relating to the same legal principle.\u201d <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 145, 314 S.E.2d 371, 384 (1984) (citing <em>Lincoln v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 370, 375, 228 S.E.2d 688, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>691-92 (1976)). This principle is well established in Virginia. <em>See also, e.g., Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 255, 397 S.E.2d 385, 396 (1990) (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion \u201cin refusing to grant another, duplicative instruction\u201d); <em>Gaines v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 562, 568, 574 S.E.2d 775, 778 (2003) (en banc) (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s instruction was no more or less correct than the instruction given. While it \u2018was a correct statement of the legal principles involved and the trial court, in its discretion, could properly have given the instruction, it does not follow that it was reversible error to refuse it.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Lincoln, </em>217 Va. at 375, 228 S.E.2d at 692)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Accordingly, the trial judge here did not abuse his \u201cbroad discretion over whether to give or deny proposed jury instructions.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>56 Va.App. at 736, 697 S.E.2d at 26. Consequently, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative argument that the evidence supporting a finding that Huguely acted with malice was so strong as to render harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>less any error resulting from the trial judge\u2019s decision not to adopt Huguely\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">For the reasons noted <em>supra, </em>the trial judge did not erroneously deny Huguely\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment or the Virginia Constitution. Furthermore, the trial judge did not err during <em>voir dire. </em>Moreover, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to adopt Huguely\u2019s longer proposed jury instruction addressing malice. Accordingly, we affirm Huguely\u2019s conviction for second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-14\">. Initially, Huguely appealed both convictions. However, he moved to withdraw the appeal of the grand larceny conviction on November 26, 2013. This Court granted Huguely's motion. <em>See Huguely v. Commonwealth, </em>Rec. No. 1697-12-2 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 3, 2013). Therefore, this Court will consider Huguely's assignments of error only as they pertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>to his appeal of the second-degree murder conviction because Huguely has now withdrawn his appeal of the grand larceny conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-15\">. Huguely actually raised eight assignments of error in his petition for appeal to this Court. An appeal was not granted on four of these assignments of error \u2014 including an assignment of error challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, we do not address in this opinion the assignments of error for which an appeal was not granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b146-16\">. On appeal, we view the evidence \"in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u201d in the trial court. <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004). The only exception to this settled rule here concerns Huguely\u2019s assignment of error challenging the refusal of his proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>jury instruction. On that issue alone, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Huguely. <em>See, e.g., Hartigan v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 243, 257, 522 S.E.2d 406, 412 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\">. A video recording of Huguely\u2019s interview was admitted into evidence at trial. Briefly summarized, Huguely told the detectives during the interview that Love \"freaked out\u201d and \u201cbecame\u201d aggressive when Huguely entered her bedroom. Huguely admitted that he grabbed Love and \"shook her a little bit\u201d before a struggle ensued on the bedroom floor. Huguely claimed that Love\u2019s nose started bleeding at that time. Huguely said that he stood up and \"tossed\u201d Love on her bed before leaving the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\">. In separate indictments, the Commonwealth alleged that Huguely committed first-degree murder by premeditation and in the commission of robbery. The jury acquitted Huguely of both of these first-degree murder counts and instead convicted him of the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder (which requires a finding of malice but not premeditation). The jury also found Huguely not guilty of robbery and of two felony charges involving breaking and entering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. One of these witnesses was an expert in biomechanical analysis. However, it appears from the record that he was not an expert witness that Ms. Quagliana was supposed to examine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">. Thus, during the course of Ms. Quagliana\u2019s illness (which kept her out of court on February 16 and 17), the trial judge excused the jury from hearing testimony at all times \u2014 except for the morning of February 17, when Mr. Lawrence examined the witnesses whom he had told the trial judge he was prepared to examine (and had actually offered to examine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. At the end of the day on Friday, February 17, Mr. Lawrence asked the trial judge not to resume the trial until the following Wednesday, February 22. (The record establishes that one of the jurors was scheduled to be out of town on Sunday, February 19, that Monday, February 20 was a state holiday, and that Tuesday, February 21 was reserved for grand jury proceedings.) The trial judge denied Mr. Lawrence's request. Contrary to Huguely\u2019s suggestion on appeal, it is unknown whether the trial judge actually would have required Mr. Lawrence to examine Dr. Uscinski on February 18 because Ms. Quagliana indeed returned to court that morning. Huguely does not contend that Ms. Quagliana was still too ill to properly examine Dr. Ucsinski on Saturday, February 18, when she returned to court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\">. Although the right to counsel \u201cis not explicitly set out in the Constitution of Virginia,\u201d the Supreme Court of Virginia has \u201cheld that it is nonetheless a fundamental right guaranteed to an accused by the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Virginia.\u201d <em>Thomas v.

Indeed, before Ms. Quagliana ever became ill, the following events transpired: The parties had already conducted their investigations of the case, discovery had occurred, and it became clear that the matter would proceed to trial without a plea bargain. A theory of defense had been identified and developed. The jury had been selected and seated. Opening arguments had been delivered. The Commonwealth had examined its witnesses and concluded its case-in-chief \u2014 with Ms. Quagliana present for the cross-examination of each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. The defense had begun its case-in-chief. Ms. Quagliana had examined Dr. Leestma, one of the defense\u2019s experts. Only then did Ms. Quagliana become ill. While Mr. Lawrence examined defense witnesses in her absence on the morning of February 17, the record establishes that Ms. Quagliana was not left in the dark about the substance of that testimony, since she had access to an \u201cunofficial transcript\u201d of the proceedings in order to review those witnesses\u2019 testimony despite her absence from the courtroom. It is undisputed that Ms. Quagliana then returned to court while the defense's case-in-chief was still ongoing, examined Dr. Uscinski as part of the defense's case, was present for the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal evidence and the closing arguments to the jury, and actually delivered the argument on Huguely's behalf during the sentencing phase of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">. It appears from the record that Mr. Lawrence actually was the attorney responsible for examining the witnesses who testified on the morning of February 17. In response to Huguely's motion to set aside the verdicts, the Commonwealth claimed that \"Mr. Lawrence examined only those witnesses for whom he advised the Court he was responsible for and prepared\u201d to examine that day. The reply brief in support of the motion to set aside the verdict prepared by Huguely\u2019s trial attorneys appeared to accept the Commonwealth's claim that Mr. Lawrence was responsible for examining those witnesses \u2014 while also asserting that \"the prosecution does not get to dictate how the defense allocates its responsibilities\u201d and that Huguely was entitled to the presence of both attorneys \"regardless of which attorney was responsible for the examination of any particular witness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">. Moreover, we disagree with Huguely's argument in the alternative that the trial judge\u2019s ruling disrupted the defense\u2019s strategy to the extent that reversible error occurred even absent structural error under the Sixth Amendment. While the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the morning of February 17 may have resulted in the defense's witnesses being called in a different order than defense counsel preferred, \u201d[t]he rule is well established in Virginia that 'great latitude [will be given] to the discretion of the trial [judge] as to the order in which witnesses may be called and the manner of their examination.\u2019 \" <em>Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 311, 318, 522 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2000) (quoting <em>Butler v. Parrocha, </em>186 Va. 426, 433, 43 S.E.2d 1, 5 (1947)). In addition, we disagree with Huguely\u2019s argument on appeal that his second-degree murder conviction must be reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial due to his claim that some jurors might not have viewed Ms. Quagliana as a co-equal counsel when the trial proceeded without her presence on the morning of February 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. In Assignments of Error 11(A) and 11(B), Huguely contends that he was denied his right to an impartial jury under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">. Defense counsel proposed asking the remaining prospective jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">[W]ould you have any difficulty listening to testimony about the behavior of victims such as drinking to excess, physical aggressiveness, use of bad or foul language or sexual behavior as it became relevant to explain the relationship between Mr. Huguely and Ms. Love, and would you form a negative impression of Mr. Huguely as a defendant for bringing up the subject?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\">. During earlier <em>voir dire </em>questioning of the pool of jurors, defense counsel failed to ask the supposedly crucial question to a number of prospective jurors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">. The Supreme Court actually addressed a fourth principle in Briley\u2014 that a prospective juror may not be rehabilitated through leading questions. Although Huguely argues on appeal that Juror 32 was improperly rehabilitated, the record does not show that this argument was preserved in the trial court during the motion to strike Juror 32 for cause. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 210, 217, 688 S.E.2d 185, 188 (2010) (\"Rule 5A:18 requires a litigant to make timely and specific objections, so that the trial court has an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>Schmitt v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 127, 142, 547 S.E.2d 186, 197 (2001) (explaining that, for objections relating to the <em>voir dire </em>of prospective jurors to be timely, the trial judge must be given \"a timely opportunity to rule on the merits of such objections and to take any necessary corrective action\u201d). For the same reason, Huguely also did not preserve in the trial court his argument on appeal that certain <em>voir dire </em>responses by Juror 32 were too equivocal to establish her impartiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b174-10\">. Huguely also points on appeal to Juror 182\u2019s statements during <em>voir dire </em>indicating that he was sensitive to domestic violence issues because of a family member who had been a victim of domestic violence and also acknowledging that he was a University of Virginia employee. However, defense counsel did not identify these issues in the motion to strike Juror 182. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. If anything, even viewing the facts pertaining to this assignment of error in the light most favorable to Huguely, as we must since he was the proponent of the rejected jury instruction, the jury instruction actually given by the trial judge better reflected the evidence admitted at trial. Huguely and Love clearly had a tumultuous and sometimes acrimonious romantic relationship that had deteriorated badly by the night of May 2, 2010. Huguely even told Love in an April 30, 2010 email, \u201cI should have killed you.\u201d Any finding of malice on Huguely\u2019s part with regard to Love would be based on his existing anger toward Love at the time he killed her. Anger was a component of the Commonwealth\u2019s malice instruction that the trial judge accepted. By contrast, Huguely\u2019s additional language \u2014 which explains that malice is \"not confined to ill will\u201d \u2014 would not necessarily conform to the facts of this case. The evidence actually established Huguely\u2019s ill will toward Love, so Huguely's additional language would not necessarily have been helpful to the factfinder. Huguely\u2019s expanded language often applies to situations unlike this case, where the defendant is not necessarily familiar with the victim but nevertheless acts violently toward the victim in a way that might defy explanation. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 131, 140, 41 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1947) (\"[TJhe law is not impotent to impose punishment to fit the crime because explanation of the abnormal act is not given.\u201d); <em>see also Fletcher v. Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 636, 637-39, 166 S.E.2d 269, 271-72 (1969) (where no personal relationship between the defendant and the victims was mentioned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
