Moore appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the DSS finding. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s holding and vacate the finding made by DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The parties vigorously disputed most of the underlying facts at every stage of this case. None of these disputes, however, are relevant to our holding, and thus, we recite only those undisputed facts pertinent to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In 2011, DSS investigators accused Moore of committing an act of sexual abuse of a child. The child claimed the abuse occurred when she was three or four years old during the time that she resided temporarily in her grandmother\u2019s home. Moore resided in that home for a brief period between March 1998 and February 1999, while the child was only one-and-a-half years old to two-and-a-half years old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No evidence suggested that Moore ever babysat the child, ever asked to care for the child, or ever volunteered to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Acting through its designated hearing officer, the DSS Commissioner found that Moore committed the alleged sexual abuse of the child. The Commissioner recognized that this conclusion required a factual finding that, at the time of the abuse, Moore was either a parent of the child or some \u201cother person responsible for his care.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4). Given that Moore was not a parent, the Commissioner addressed the \u201cpreliminary issue\u201d of whether he \u201cqualifie[d] as a \u2018caretaker.\u2019 \u201d App. at 125. Because no evidence suggested Moore was in fact responsible for the child\u2019s care \u2014 a point DSS concedes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>on appeal, <em>see </em>Oral Argument Audio at 26:28 to 26:56 \u2014 DSS legally \u201cdeemed [him] to be a caretaker\u201d because he was \u201ca relative over the age of 18\u201d and \u201cliving in the home with the child\u201d at the time of the abuse, App. at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Alleging thirteen grounds of error, Moore appealed to the circuit court under the Virginia Administrative Process Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4025 to 2.2-4030. The circuit court affirmed, focusing primarily on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the allegation of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Moore appeals to us, contending that the circuit court and DSS erred on various grounds. Concluding that one of these grounds is dispositive \u2014 whether DSS improperly deemed Moore a caretaker \u2014 we limit our discussion to this one point.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Virginia\u2019s criminal laws punish child abuse no matter who commits it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.4:2, 18.2-67.10. In contrast, the authority of DSS to make administrative findings of child abuse is far more narrow. Code \u00a7 63.2-1505 only grants DSS the authority to investigate and make administrative findings with respect to any \u201cabused or neglected\u201d child. The statutory definition of \u201c[a]bused or neglected child\u201d is, among other things, a child \u201c[w]hose parents or other person responsible for his care commits or allows to be committed any act of sexual exploitation or any sexual act upon a child in violation of the law.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4); <em>see also </em>22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-30(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Acting pursuant to its authority to issue regulations, Code \u00a7 63.2-217, DSS promulgated an administrative regulation to define the scope of a caretaker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">\u201cCaretaker\u201d means any individual having the responsibility of providing care for a child and includes the following: (i) parent or other person legally responsible for the child\u2019s care; (ii) any other person who has assumed caretaking responsibility by virtue of an agreement with the legally responsible person; (iii) persons responsible by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>their positions of conferred authority; and (iv) adult persons residing in the home with the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10. At an administrative hearing, DSS bears the burden of proving that the suspect committed the abuse and that he was either a parent or some other person responsible for the child\u2019s care. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4020(C) (assigning burden of proof); <em>see generally Navistar, Inc. v. New Balt. Garage, Inc., </em>60 Va.App. 599, 611 n. 2, 731 S.E.2d 13, 19 n. 2 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In this case, DSS presented no evidence to show that Moore was a parent or a person responsible for the child\u2019s care. Instead, DSS asserted that Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4) and 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10 permitted it to legally <em>deem </em>Moore a caretaker based solely on the fact that he was an adult residing in the home of the child. The DSS Commissioner accepted this assertion, recognizing that it was a threshold issue upon which the entire case depended. The first paragraph of the hearing officer\u2019s analysis began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">The preliminary issue is whether [Moore] qualifies as a \u201ccaretaker.\u201d According to the <em>CPS Guidance Manual, </em>a relative over the age of 18 living in the home with the child is deemed to be a caretaker. As the Appellant was a relative by marriage and over the age of 18 at the time the alleged abuse occurred, he may be considered a caretaker despite the testimony that he was never [the child\u2019s] babysitter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">App. at 125.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This reasoning, Moore contends, cannot be squared with the governing statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>We begin our analysis by first calibrating the scope of our judicial review. \u201cPure statutory construction, a matter within the \u2018core competency of the judiciary,\u2019 requires <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cThis axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d <em>Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n v. Comty. Alts., Inc., </em>57 Va.App. 700, 708, 705 S.E.2d 530, 534 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018Virginia courts do not delegate that task to executive agencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 635, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">On the other hand, \u201cwe take a very different approach to interpreting administrative regulations.\u201d <em>Family Redirection Inst., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Med. Assistance Servs., </em>61 Va.App. 765, 772, 739 S.E.2d 916, 920 (2013). We afford great deference to administrative agencies in their interpretation of their own regulations. That deference, however, dissipates when the agency acts outside \u201cits delegable authority\u201d by failing to construe its regulations \u201creasonably and in a manner consistent with the legislative directive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After all, \u201cdeference is not abdication, and it requires us to accept only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.\u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., </em>52 Va.App. 460, 466, 663 S.E.2d 571, 574 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Adhering to these principles, we believe DSS misinterpreted both the enabling statute and its own regulation. Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4) requires that the suspect be either a parent of the abused child or some \u201cother person responsible for his care.\u201d A person <em>responsible </em>for a child\u2019s care necessarily means an adult who \u2014 by law, social custom, express or implied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>acquiescence, collective consensus, agreement, or any other legally recognizable basis \u2014 has an obligation to look after the well-being of a child left in his care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply being an adult residing in the same home as a child does not make one responsible for every child in the home. One renting a spare bedroom, for example, would hardly think that he was somehow taking on the responsibility to care for the landlord\u2019s children merely because of his presence in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">We find equally puzzling the assertion by DSS that its own regulation legally deems all adult persons residing in the home with the child to be within the scope of Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4). The DSS regulation defines a \u201c[c]aretaker\u201d as any person \u201chaving the responsibility of providing care for a child\u201d and then gives examples of those who might be \u201cinclude[d]\u201d in that category. 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10. The illustrative (not exhaustive) list includes four sub-categories: those \u201clegally responsible for the child\u2019s care,\u201d persons who have agreed to be responsible, those with \u201cpositions of conferred authority,\u201d and \u201cadult persons residing in the home with the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The first three sub-categories, by their very nature, necessarily describe individuals who would be persons \u201cresponsible\u201d for the child\u2019s care under Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4). However, the fourth sub-category \u2014 any adult person \u201cresiding in the home with the child\u201d \u2014 may or may not be someone responsible for the child\u2019s care. It would depend on the circumstances. If the adult resident had expressly or implicitly assumed \u201cthe responsibility of providing care\u201d for the child, 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10, as the first half of the definition of \u201c[c]are-taker\u201d in the regulation states, then he would fall within the statutory and regulatory definition. If not, he would simply be a non-caretaker, co-resident in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We concede that the syntax of the regulation, read literally without any regard for the enabling statute, could suggest just what DSS claims: Any adult residing in the home is <em>ipso facto </em>a caregiver as a matter of law. We cannot, however, read the regulation in a vacuum. Administrative agencies do not legislate; they merely enforce the statutory authority delegated to them by the legislature. Agency regulations, therefore, cannot contradict governing enabling statutes. <em>See Kavanaugh v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>60 Va.App. 440, 447, 728 S.E.2d 527, 531 (2012); <em>see generally </em>1 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 6.4, at 325 (4th ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">It follows, then, that regulations should be read \u2014 if possible \u2014 to be consistent with governing enabling statutes. Here, the enabling statute limits DSS\u2019s authority to findings of abuse committed by a parent or \u201cother person responsible\u201d for the abused child\u2019s care. Code \u00a7 63.2-100(4). It seems inescapable to us that a person who is <em>not </em>in any way truly responsible for the child\u2019s care <em>cannot </em>be said (either by us or DSS) to be a \u201cperson responsible\u201d for the child\u2019s care. <em>Id. </em>And we fail to see how residing in the same home as the child, without more, changes that fact. Our interpretation of 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10, as well as its administrative application by DSS, must necessarily take into account this overarching statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In sum, absent a factual basis for the assertion that Moore was a person responsible for the child\u2019s care, DSS could not legally deem him so simply because of his residing presence in the home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We read neither the statute nor the administrative regulation to authorize that conclusion. We thus reverse the circuit court\u2019s holding and vacate the administrative finding made by DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\">. No evidence appeared to reconcile these disparate time lines. Given our holding, however, we need not address this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">. Though the DSS hearing officer noted that Moore was a relative of the victim, the decision did not turn, even in part, on the nature of his familial relationship or the potential inferences that could be drawn from it. Instead, DSS argues on appeal only that \"[b]ecause Mr. Moore was an <em>adult </em>residing in the home where the victim child resided, he met the definition of caretaker under 22 VAC 40-705-10.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 11 (emphasis added). <em>See also id. </em>at 14 (\"The local department ... presented evidence that the Appellant was considered a \u2018caretaker\u2019 as defined by 20 VAC 40-705-10 in that he was an <em>adult ... </em>residing in the home of the child at the time of the incident.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id. </em>(Thus, Moore \"may be considered a caretaker despite the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>that he was never [the child's] babysitter.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(Moore was \"an <em>adult </em>residing in the same home as the child at the time of the incident, and therefore was deemed a caretaker under the CPS regulations.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b429-5\">. Our cases illustrate the numerous circumstances in which this definition can be met. For example, cases interpreting Code \u00a7 16.1-228, within the chapter governing juvenile and domestic relations district courts, classify persons that qualify as a \"person responsible\u201d for an abused or neglected child. <em>Cumbo v. Dickenson Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>62 Va.App. 124, 742 S.E.2d 885 (2013) (uncle custodian); <em>DeAmicis v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 437, 524 S.E.2d 151 (2000) <em>(en banc) </em>(professional counselor). Cases interpreting the criminal statute for child abuse and neglect, Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1, also classify a \u201cperson responsible\u201d for a child's care. <em>Carrington v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 614, 721 S.E.2d 815 (2012) (live-in boyfriend); <em>Flowers v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 241, 639 S.E.2d 313 (2007) (friend's mother supervising sleepover); <em>Bean-Brewer v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 3, 635 S.E.2d 680 (2006) (child care provider); <em>Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 537 S.E.2d 6 (2000) (uncle driving vehicle). Further, cases interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1, which criminalizes taking indecent liberties with a child, illustrate persons who have a \"custodial or supervisory relationship over a child.\u201d <em>Sadler v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 17, 654 S.E.2d 313 (2007) (athletic coach); <em>Guda v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 453, 592 S.E.2d 748 (2004) (school security officer). A \"caretaker\u201d or person \"responsible for the care of a child,\u201d pursuant to 22 Va. Admin. Code 40-705-30, is also demonstrated in <em>Mulvey v. Jones, </em>41 Va.App. 600, 587 S.E.2d 728 (2003) (teacher).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b431-15\">. On brief, Moore contends DSS acted without \"subject matter jurisdiction\u201d thus making its decision in this case \u201cnull and void.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. We reject this characterization. DSS made a legally invalid interpretation of its own regulation and incorrectly applied it to this case. It does not follow that the erroneous administrative finding was <em>void </em>because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See generally Winslow v. Commonwealth, </em>62 Va.App. 539, 545, 749 S.E.2d 563, 566 (2013) (warning \" 'against the <em>faux </em>elevation of a [tribunal's] failure to comply with the requirements for exercising its authority to the same level of gravity as a lack of subject matter jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>De Avies v. De Avies, </em>42 Va.App. 342, 345-46, 592 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004) (en banc))). Instead, the erroneous finding by DSS was merely <em>voidable </em>on direct appeal \u2014 which is the only remedy available under these circumstances. <em>See generally J.P. v. Carter, </em>24 Va.App. 707, 723-24, 485 S.E.2d 162, 170-71 (1997) (holding DSS had subject-matter jurisdiction to make final agency determination even if doing so may have violated statutory requirements designating hearing officers).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
