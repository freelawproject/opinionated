Tyson in 2012. Tyson exhausted his grievance remedies afforded by the State Grievance Procedure, Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, the circuit court reversed the administrative hearing officer\u2019s decision, which upheld the agency\u2019s decision to terminate Tyson, on the ground that the agency violated Tyson\u2019s procedural due process rights. Finding no legal basis for that conclusion, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s holding and reinstate the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Ordinarily, an appellate court recites the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the circuit court. \u201cIn cases involving administrative review of state employee grievances, however, the light-most-favorable rendition of the facts is inapt.\u201d <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Stevens, </em>53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Va.App. 654, 658, 674 S.E.2d 563, 565 (2009). The facts of this case came before the circuit court, as they do to us, \u201con the record\u201d developed in the agency proceedings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). \u201cIn reviewing agency factfinding, a circuit court acts much like an appellate court \u2014 reviewing the facts developed in the agency record in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in that forum and deferring to agency factfinding unless patently insubstantial.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. at 658, 674 S.E.2d at 565 (citing <em>Va. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Compton, </em>47 Va.App. 202, 217-18, 623 S.E.2d 397, 404 (2005)). On further appeal to us, we apply the same standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In 2012, Tyson worked as a project manager for the agency. He was fired after receiving multiple disciplinary notices for various things, such as \u201cabuse of state time,\u201d the \u201cfailure to follow supervisory instructions,\u201d and \u201cpoor job performance.\u201d App. at 4, 6, 73. The specific process that led to his dismissal began with a meeting with his supervisor who counseled Tyson about a poorly written and inaccurate letter that he sent to an agency consultant. The supervisor instructed Tyson to take certain remedial measures, but he failed to comply fully with her instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Subsequently, on April 4, 2012, the agency issued to Tyson a \u201cMemorandum of Pending Disciplinary Action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The memo advised Tyson that his supervisor had recommended disciplinary action against him and explained in detail her basis for doing so. The memo ended with the statement: \u201cIn an effort to provide you with due process, you are given 48 hours to respond in writing to the charge listed above. This is your opportunity to provide any comments you wish to add concerning these incidents before the disciplinary action is issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Tyson signed the memo, acknowledging that he personally received it on April 4, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Two days came and went without any oral or written response to the memo by Tyson. Approximately two weeks later, on April 20, 2012, the agency issued two written disciplinary notices to Tyson. The second of the two notices terminated Tyson\u2019s employment effective April 23, 2012. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>notices informed Tyson of his rights under the agency\u2019s grievance procedure. Tyson responded to the notices with a \u201cGrievance Form A \u2014 Expedited Process\u201d and a detailed written statement attached explaining his position and giving his version of the facts. <em>Id. </em>at 8,14-15. The agency reviewed the grievance and denied it. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Represented by counsel, Tyson then requested and received a formal hearing before an administrative hearing officer. The hearing officer received multiple exhibits and heard from six witnesses. Tyson testified on his own behalf and offered his rebuttal to the agency\u2019s complaints about his work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">At the evidentiary hearing, Tyson produced a physician\u2019s note dated April 6, 2012, entitled \u201cCertificate to Return to School or Work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. The note stated Tyson \u201chas been under my care from 4-6-12 to 4-16-12\u201d and will be \u201cout of work 4-9 to 4-16.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No explanation of any kind accompanied these statements. Tyson also provided another note, dated April 12, 2012, stating that Tyson was \u201ctotally incapacitated\u201d from April 16 to May 21, 2012, but was able to return to full \u201cregular\u201d duty with no restrictions on May 21 (the last day of his total incapacity). <em>Id. </em>at 71. In emails to his supervisor on April 5 and 6, Tyson said he would be \u201cout sick\u201d due to \u201cpain from [his] head into [his] back,\u201d allegedly from \u201cmuscle spasms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. These conditions, counsel argued, precluded Tyson from offering his side of the story after receiving the April 4 memo outlining his supervisor\u2019s concerns about his work. No physician, however, testified in support of this assertion at Tyson\u2019s evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The administrative hearing officer affirmed the agency\u2019s decision to terminate Tyson for cause. Tyson appealed to the circuit court pursuant to the State Grievance Procedure, Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). The circuit court reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision, awarded back pay to Tyson, and ordered the agency to pay Tyson\u2019s attorney fees. The court grounded its decision on the finding that Tyson \u201cwas not afforded a constitutionally acceptable opportunity to respond to the pre-termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>nation notice of disciplinary action which was issued to him on April 4, 2012.\u201d App. at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">On appeal, the agency argues that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in reversing the hearing officer\u2019s decision. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In this case, as in most, the procedural context fixes the boundaries of a circuit court\u2019s adjudicatory power. A state employee may seek judicial review of an agency\u2019s personnel decision only if it is \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. at 661, 674 S.E.2d at 567 (quoting Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B)); <em>Compton, </em>47 Va.App. at 218-19, 623 S.E.2d at 405. \u201cIn this context, the \u2018law\u2019 represents \u2018the aggregate of legislation, judicial precedents and accepted legal principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. at 661, 674 S.E.2d at 567 (quoting <em>Tatum v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Agric. &amp; Consumer Servs., </em>41 Va.App. 110, 124, 582 S.E.2d 452, 459 (2003)). \u201cThe party challenging the hearing officer\u2019s decision must specify how that decision is contradictory to the law and what law is thereby being contradicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We are \u201clikewise limited to such review in considering whether the trial court erred in its determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The circuit court held that the agency violated Tyson\u2019s procedural due process rights. The court did not hold that the State Grievance Procedure, Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et </em>seq.\u2014 which the agency scrupulously followed \u2014 was in any way unconstitutional. Nor did the court hold that the agency violated any provision of the grievance statute or its supporting regulations. Rather, the court held only that Tyson \u201cwas not afforded a constitutionally acceptable opportunity to respond to the pre-termination notice of disciplinary action which was issued to him on April 4, 2012.\u201d App. at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> The circuit court\u2019s decision is not at all self-explanatory. Under settled principles, a state employee with a prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>erty interest in his employment is entitled to pre-termination \u201coral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to tell his side of the story.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Homar, </em>520 U.S. 924, 929, 117 S.Ct. 1807, 1811, 138 L.Ed.2d 120 (1997) (citing <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985)); <em>see also Garraghty v. Jordan, </em>830 F.2d 1295, 1299-1300 (4th Cir.1987). The \u201celaborate statutory grievance procedures\u201d required by the State Grievance Procedure \u201cmore than satisfy the minimal requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>53 Va.App. at 664, 674 S.E.2d at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Here, the agency followed the employee grievance statutes at all stages of the process. It ultimately ended with an evidentiary hearing in which Tyson was represented by counsel and allowed to present evidence, to call and examine witnesses, and to contest all aspects of the agency\u2019s decision. It is hard to imagine how this process violated Tyson\u2019s due process rights. <em>See generally Moore v. Williamsburg Reg\u2019l Hosp., </em>560 F.3d 166, 180 (4th Cir.2009) (\u201cPlaintiff was notified of the allegations against him, given ample opportunity to present evidence, allowed to call and cross-examine witnesses, and was represented by counsel throughout. There was no procedural due process violation.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Though the circuit court never said as much, Tyson claims the circuit court concluded that he suffered from a medical condition that precluded him from participating in the due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>process being offered to Mm prior to the April 4 \u201cMemorandum of Pending Disciplinary Action.\u201d We have several responses to this hypothesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">To begin with, the circuit court had no authority to review <em>de novo </em>the facts recited in the agency record or to substitute its own judgment for that of the hearing officer. The court\u2019s only role was to determine whether the agency violated the law. No \u201claw\u201d \u2014 constitutional, statutory, or regulatory \u2014 requires an agency to suspend employment decisions because the affected employee had (as Tyson claimed) \u201cpain from [his] head into [his] back\u201d associated with \u201cmuscle spasms.\u201d App. at 72. Nothing about these alleged symptoms precluded Tyson from contacting the agency to explain why he thought the agency should not fire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Thus, the circuit court\u2019s holding (whether characterized as a question of fact or as a mixed question of fact and law) is plainly wrong. Tyson <em>was </em>\u201cafforded a constitutionally acceptable opportunity to respond to the pre-termination notice of disciplinary action which was issued to him on April 4, 2012.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102. He met with his supervisor prior to receiving the April 4 memo and was given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the supervisor\u2019s complaints about his job performance. In Tyson\u2019s own recitation of the facts, which was attached to his grievance form, he admitted to giving his supervisor oral explanations for his job performance prior to April 4 when each of the issues arose. <em>See id. </em>at 14, 15. He personally received the memo on April 4 and was given two days to repeat his side of the story. He made no response.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In an abundance of caution, the agency waited not two days \u2014 but sixteen days \u2014 before taking any further action. At no time during that extended period did Tyson accept the agency\u2019s invitation to offer whatever response he had to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>supervisor\u2019s criticism of his work. Nor did he ever contact the agency seeking additional time to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Tyson\u2019s reliance on the two cryptic medical forms (which presumably persuaded the circuit court) adds nothing of substance to the debate. One of the notes, dated April 6, 2012, stated he would be out of work beginning April 9, 2012 \u2014 five days after the April 4 memo and thus well after the two-day response period. <em>Id. </em>at 70. The other note, without any supporting medical diagnosis or explanation, claimed Tyson was \u201ctotally incapacitated\u201d from April 16 to May 21, 2012, but was able to return to full \u201cregular\u201d duty with no restrictions on May 21. <em>Id. </em>at 71. Even if the hearing officer had accepted this note at face value, Tyson\u2019s alleged incapacity between April 16 and May 21 says nothing about his earlier ability to respond within two days of the April 4 memo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Finally, the circuit court\u2019s holding failed to identify the structural flaw in Tyson\u2019s argument: Tyson did not challenge his termination, but only the process that led to it. \u201cProcess is not an end in itself.\u201d <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 250, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 1748, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983). The point of due process is to ensure that the government does not deprive anyone of \u201clife, liberty, or property\u201d arbitrarily and capriciously \u2014 that is, \u201cwithout due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Pre-deprivation process provides \u201can initial check against mistaken decisions \u2014 essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are <em>true </em>and support the proposed action.\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S.Ct. at 1495 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The right of an aggrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>person to challenge the process leading to his deprivation, therefore, presupposes he also challenges the deprivation itself. <em>See </em>3 Ronald D. Rotunda <em>&amp; </em>John E. Nowak, <em>Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure </em>\u00a7 17.9(c)\u00ae, at 269 (5th ed. 2012) (\u201cA pre-termination opportunity to respond to charges would help to avoid erroneous or unjustified termination decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">On appeal, Tyson concedes the adequacy of his post-deprivation remedies and accepts that they support the agency\u2019s decision to fire him. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 24:20 to 24:43; <em>see also </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 2 (acknowledging that Tyson did not ask for his employment to be reinstated). It necessarily follows that the adequacy of the hearing officer\u2019s evidentiary hearing and his decision on the merits of the termination decision cures any alleged deficiency in Tyson\u2019s pre-deprivation process, particularly Tyson\u2019s claim that he did not have an opportunity to respond to a memo he received many weeks prior to the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We fail to see what difference his initial informal explanation could have made if his formal explanation, delivered in the context of a full evidentiary hearing, was concededly insufficient to save his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In rebuttal, Tyson suggests his post-deprivation remedy, while adequate, should be disregarded as legally irrelevant. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio at 22:54 to 23:21. Settled precedent, however, has rejected the assertion that \u201conce we find a due process violation in the denial of a pretermination hearing we need not and should not consider whether the post-termination procedures were adequate\u201d because, among other reasons, \u201cthe existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the necessary scope of pretermination procedures.\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 547 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. at 1496 n. 12. \u201cPre-termination and post-termination proceedings are not evaluated for constitutional adequacy in isolation from each other; a reviewing court studies the totality of the process received in light' of the factual record to determine if the procedural due process was sufficient.\u201d <em>Senra v. Town of Smithfield, </em>715 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2013) (citing <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 547 n. 12, 105 S.Ct. at 1496 n. 12). \u201cTherefore, a pretermination opportunity to respond, coupled with post-termination administrative procedures provides \u2018all the process that is due.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland v. Rimmer, </em>25 F.3d 1251, 1258 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 547-48, 105 S.Ct. at 1496).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In sum, the circuit court erred in reversing the hearing officer\u2019s decision, which upheld the agency\u2019s termination of Tyson\u2019s employment, on the ground that Tyson\u2019s procedural due process rights were violated. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s order and reinstate the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. <em>See also Dennison v.
