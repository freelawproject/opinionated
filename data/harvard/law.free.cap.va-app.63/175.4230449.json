Alabama, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012).\u201d For the following reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s life sentence for first-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Under settled principles of appellate review, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u201d in the trial court. <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004). On April 11, 2011, about two months before appellant\u2019s eighteenth birthday, appellant and a co-defendant planned to rob the victim. After appellant and the co-defendant entered the victim\u2019s residence, appellant produced a handgun and ordered the victim to a bedroom. While the victim was on his knees looking in his bedroom closet for money, appellant shot the victim in the head. The victim\u2019s girlfriend and two-year-old son were in the bedroom and, thus, were forced to watch the murder of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">On June 1, 2011, a grand jury indicted appellant on eight felony charges, including capital murder. Code \u00a7 18.2-31 classifies capital murder as a Class 1 felony. For defendants, such as appellant, who were under eighteen years of age at the time of the offense, Code \u00a7 18.2-10(a) states that the punishment for a Class 1 offense is life imprisonment. Furthermore, inmates who have been convicted of Class 1 felonies are not eligible to apply for conditional release under the geriatric parole statute, Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Apb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>On June 25, 2012, prior to appellant\u2019s trial, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Miller, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2469, that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.\u201d In response to the decision in <em>Miller, </em>the Commonwealth moved to amend the capital murder indictment to change it to a charge of first-degree murder. Code \u00a7 18.2-32 classifies first-degree murder as a Class 2 felony, and Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 10(b) states that Class 2 felonies are punishable by a range of twenty years to life imprisonment. Furthermore, inmates who have been convicted of Class 2 felonies are eligible to apply for conditional release under the geriatric parole statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01. The trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to amend the indictment against appellant to a charge of first-degree murder, and appellant has not challenged that decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict convicting appellant of first-degree murder, among other offenses, the trial court sentenced appellant as a juvenile offender pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A). In anticipation of sentencing, appellant\u2019s counsel submitted to the trial court a series of articles that addressed adolescent brain development. According to appellant\u2019s counsel, these articles supported a finding that the brain of a person who is appellant\u2019s age at the time that these offenses occurred has not completely grown and developed. Based on these articles, appellant\u2019s counsel contended that the trial court should not consider appellant as culpable as a fully mature adult would be. The Commonwealth, in turn, submitted documents from the City of Lynchburg Public Schools that detailed, <em>inter alia, </em>the many suspensions that appellant had received \u2014 including several that involved acts of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In addition, the probation officer prepared a presentence report that was presented to the trial court and to the parties prior to sentencing. The presentence report indicated that many prior juvenile petitions had been filed against appellant, with several of those petitions resulting in probation or adjudications of guilt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The presentence report also stated that appellant had been a member of the Bloods gang since he was about thirteen years old and that appellant admitted to a juvenile and domestic relations district court officer in August 2008 that he had risen to \u201cthe rank of 2-Star General\u201d in that gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth argued that a life sentence for appellant\u2019s first-degree murder conviction was appropriate. In support of this argument, the prosecutor contended that appellant\u2019s prior record was \u201catrocious,\u201d that appellant\u2019s murder of the victim was \u201cbrutal,\u201d \u201cheartless,\u201d and \u201csick,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that a life sentence would \u201cguarantee the next two to three generations of Lynchburg residents that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>defendant will no longer harm anyone on our streets.\u201d The prosecutor noted that appellant would be eligible to apply for geriatric parole at age sixty and asserted that it should be the role of \u201cthe geriatric parole board to make the determination whether it\u2019s ever safe for him to be released again.\u201d In response, appellant\u2019s counsel relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller </em>for the view that \u201cjuveniles are different.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel asserted, \u201cWhether you are an adult at eighteen by the law does not negate the psychological and scientific evidence that you remain a juvenile with regard to the development of the brain until your mid-twenties.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel requested that the trial court impose a total sentence that was within the recommended sentencing guidelines range of twenty-eight years, two months and forty-seven years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The trial court decided to impose a life sentence for the first-degree murder conviction, explaining from the bench at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">[I]n this case we had a helpless victim, the shooting was unprovoked, and it was cruel and callous. It was just mean. It was, it\u2019s as cruel and callous as anything I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been sitting here on the bench and that\u2019s been awhile. Just totally unnecessary to put a bullet in this young man\u2019s head.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for reconsideration. Summarizing the ways in which he alleged that the trial court had erred at sentencing, appellant\u2019s counsel argued in the motion for reconsideration, \u201cNothing announced in the court\u2019s imposition of sentence demonstrates an individualized sentencing taking into consideration the various characteristics of Raheem Chabezz Johnson detailed in the presentence report, the trial of the case, or the scientific studies of the brain received by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration in a written order that also incorporated a letter opinion, in which the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The life sentence was imposed after careful consideration of your client\u2019s individual characteristics as reflected in the record, including without limitation, the presentence report and school records. The materials submitted with your letter dated September 4, 2012 were reviewed. The sentencing guidelines were also considered and felt to be inappropriate due to the horrendous nature of the crime. Raheem Chabezz Johnson has a history of disrespect for authority and aggressive behavior which, coupled with the brutality of the offense, make him, in my opinion, a danger to himself and others should he be returned to society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A. Sentencing in Virginia</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Virginia\u2019s law pertaining to appellant\u2019s appeal of his sentence is well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">We review the trial court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Valentine v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 334, 339, 443 S.E.2d 445, 448 (1994). Given this deferential standard of review, we will not interfere with the sentence so long as it \u201c \u2018was within the range set by the legislature\u2019 \u201d for the particular crime of which the defendant was convicted. <em>Jett v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 252, 256, 540 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 158, 160-61, 390 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1990)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 35, 46-47, 707 S.E.2d 17, 23 (2011); <em>see Abdo v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 473, 479, 237 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1977) (\u201cWe have held in numerous cases that when a statute prescribes a maximum imprisonment penalty and the sentence does not exceed that maximum, the sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>see also Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 334, 351, 634 S.E.2d 697, 706 (2006); <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 580, 584, 621 S.E.2d 98, 100 (2005); <em>cf. </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01(F) (stating that a trial court\u2019s decision not to follow the discretionary sentencing guidelines range \u201cshall not be reviewable on appeal or the basis of any other post-conviction relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In this case, appellant was convicted of first-degree murder. That offense is a Class 2 felony, which is punishable by a statutory sentencing range of twenty years to life imprisonment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-32; <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-10(b). The trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder conviction. That sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder. Accordingly, \u201cthe sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion\u201d under Virginia law. <em>Abdo, </em>218 Va. at 479, 237 S.E.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Nevertheless, appellant argues that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Miller </em>requires this Court to reverse his life sentence for first-degree murder as a matter of federal constitutional law. Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court of Virginia previously has addressed <em>Miller </em>in a published opinion. To the extent that appellant\u2019s argument under <em>Miller </em>raises a question of constitutional interpretation, that issue is reviewed <em>de novo. Lawlor v. Commonwealth, </em>285 Va. 187, 240, 738 S.E.2d 847, 877 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">B. The Decision in <em>Miller v. Alabama</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The United States Supreme Court limited its review in <em>Miller </em>to the constitutionality of <em>mandatory sentencing statutes </em>that provide sentencing courts <em>no discretion </em>to sentence juvenile offenders to anything other than life sentences <em>without the possibility of parole. </em>Indeed, the first paragraph of the majority opinion in <em>Miller </em>summarizes the issue before the Supreme Court and states the scope of its holding as a matter of constitutional law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">The two 14-year-old offenders in this case were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment <em>without the possibility of parole. </em>In neither case did the sentencing authority have <em>any discretion </em>to impose a different punishment. State law <em>mandated </em>that each juvenile die in prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that his youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the nature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example, life with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>possibility of parole) more appropriate. Such a scheme prevents those meting out punishment from considering a juvenile\u2019s \u201clessened culpability\u201d and greater \u201ccapacity for change,\u201d <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. [48, 68-69, 73-74, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2026-2027, 2029-2030, 176 L.Ed.2d 825] (2010) (slip op., at 17, 23), and runs afoul of our cases\u2019 requirement of individualized sentencing for defendants facing the most serious penalties. <em>We therefore hold that mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><em>Miller, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2460 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at \u2014, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2461, 2463 (explaining that both juvenile defendants who petitioned the Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>were sentenced under state statutes that mandated life without the possibility of parole for their offenses). The Supreme Court then repeated its central holding in Miller\u2014 i.e., that a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments \u2014 at least two more times later in the majority opinion. <em>See id. </em>at \u2014, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2468, 2475.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Thus, the Supreme Court clearly did not hold in <em>Miller </em>that <em>all </em>life sentences for juvenile offenders violate the Eighth Amendment. The Supreme Court in that case addressed a specific type of life sentence \u2014 a <em>mandatory </em>life sentence <em>without the possibility of parole.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court expressly <em>declined </em>to consider in <em>Miller </em>whether \u201cthe Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar\u201d on all life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. <em>See id. </em>at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201c[W]e do not consider [the petitioners\u2019] alternative argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life without parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and younger.\u201d). The Supreme Court\u2019s actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>holding in <em>Miller </em>states that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that <em>mandates </em>life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">C. Appellant\u2019s Sentence was within the Trial Court\u2019s Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"ANd\">It is plainly evident that the life sentence imposed by the trial court here passes the United States Supreme Court\u2019s test for constitutionality that it expressed in <em>Miller. </em>An Eighth Amendment violation occurred in <em>Miller, </em>in the view of the Supreme Court, because the fourteen-year-old defendants were automatically sentenced to mandatory terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for their offenses. By contrast, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the trial court here indisputably had the discretion to sentence appellant to a term that ranged from twenty years to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder that appellant committed about two months before his eighteenth birthday. That discretion alone places this case clearly outside of the category of cases that the Supreme Court addressed in <em>Miller.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Ultimately, the trial court found that a life sentence for appellant\u2019s first-degree murder of the victim was appropriate because appellant\u2019s prior record, \u201ccoupled with the brutality of the offense,\u201d made appellant \u201ca danger to himself and others should he be returned to society.\u201d To hold that the trial court somehow lacked the discretion to impose a life sentence under the circumstances of this case would require us to step far outside the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Miller </em>\u2014 which addresses statutes <em>mandating </em>life sentences without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. In addition, the Supreme Court of Virginia has already held that geriatric parole under Code \u00a7 58.1-40.01 (for which appellant will be eligible to apply at age sixty) represents a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation\u201d for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Angel v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 248, 275, 704 S.E.2d 386, 402 (2011). Accordingly, it is clear that appellant\u2019s life sentence for the horrific first-degree murder of the victim in this case must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial court, in its discretion, sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for first-degree murder. This sentence was proper under Virginia law, given that life imprisonment is within the sentencing range for first-degree murder. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller </em>simply does not apply here because <em>Miller </em>concerns the mandatory imposition of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s life sentence for his first-degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-12\">. In addition to the life sentence, appellant was also sentenced to a total of forty-two years for several other offenses \u2014 i.e., statutory burglary, two counts of attempted robbery, and four counts of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. Appellant has not challenged the sentences for those convictions on appeal. Furthermore, an appeal was not granted on assignments of error alleging that the trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to strike the statutory burglary and attempted robbery charges, erred by improperly instructing the jury on the issue of eyewitness identification, erred by denying appellant\u2019s request for the appointment of a neuropsychologist, and erred with respect to the preparation of the trial transcripts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\">. Code \u00a7 53.1-40.01 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">Any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense, other than a Class 1 felony, (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional release. The Parole Board shall promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. Included in these documents was a report from appellant's principal explaining why appellant was suspended from school for ten days in January 2009. The principal wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">On January 21, 2009 at approximately 9:05 a.m. Raheem was involved in a fight with another student in front of the school building. Raheem initiated the confrontation by punching and then slamming the other individual to the ground. This referral is Raheem\u2019s 12th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>referral for the 2008-09 school year. He has previously been suspended from school for 22 days. Raheem is a habitual offender.... This is to notify you that I am suspending Raheem for 10 school days and that I will forward a recommendation to the superintendent that the school board consider a long-term suspension/alternative educational placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In addition, it appears that appellant was suspended at least twice during the 2009-10 school year after hitting other students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. For example, in November 2005, Johnson was charged with assault and battery. After being placed on probation, appellant was found guilty of a probation violation in February 2006. Appellant was also found guilty of disorderly conduct in April 2006. Johnson was then charged with assault and battery and brandishing a firearm in April 2008, and he was found guilty of that assault and battery offense in June 2008. Appellant remained on supervised probation until March 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\">. The victim\u2019s mother and the victim's girlfriend both testified at the sentencing hearing. The victim's girlfriend, who had dated the victim for eight years and is the mother of the victim\u2019s son, testified at sentencing that her then-three-and-a-half-year-old son \u201cknows who his father is.\u201d She testified that the victim's death has been especially difficult for their son (who witnessed his father's murder), adding, \"He remembers everything.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">. The majority opinion in <em>Miller </em>simply cannot be read outside of the context of a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Indeed, the phrases \"without parole,\u201d \u201cwithout the possibility of parole,\u201d and \"life-without-parole\u201d appear approximately seventy times in the majority opinion in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. Furthermore, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, the trial court here actually <em>did </em>render an \"individualized\u201d sentencing decision in this case. <em>See </em>Miller, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2475 (noting that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \"individualized sentencing decisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles\u201d (citing <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010), and <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005))). In its letter opinion denying appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider \u2014 which the trial court incorporated in its final order \u2014 the trial court expressly stated that appellant\u2019s \"life sentence was imposed after careful consideration of [appellant\u2019s] <em>individual </em>characteristics as reflected in the record\u201d before the trial court at the time of sentencing. (Emphasis added). The trial court\u2019s statements indicating that it sentenced appellant on an individualized basis speak for themselves, and this Court will not second-guess them. <em>See McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 30, 35, 480 S.E.2d 126, 128 (1997) (\"A court speaks through its orders and those orders are presumed to accurately reflect what transpired.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">As the trial court explained in its letter opinion, it considered the contents of the presentence report and appellant\u2019s school records. The trial court also explained that it reviewed the articles on adolescent brain development submitted by appellant's trial counsel. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>court\u2019s decision not to accord those articles significant weight certainly will not be disturbed on appeal \u2014 given that the trial court exercised its discretion in selecting an appropriate sentence for appellant within the statutory sentencing range. See <em>Williams, </em>270 Va. at 584, 621 S.E.2d at 101. The trial court also considered, but rejected, the range of recommended sentences under the sentencing guidelines, and that decision is not reviewable on appeal. See Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01(F).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
