Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law and his guarantee against self-incrimination were violated where the conviction of petitioner Gilbert was based substantially upon the out-of-court declaration of his co-defendant King which recited Gilbert\u2019s participation in robbery, kidnaping and murder and King\u2019s in-court confession which the California Court has ruled as a matter of state law was impelled by the wrongful admission of King\u2019s hearsay statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">\u201c3. Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure was violated where a conviction was had upon a capital offense and sentence of death was rendered upon eyewitness identification that was based, in whole or in part, upon a viewing by such witnesses of four photographs that were seized by the F.
