Although petitioner received a hearing on the issue of his competence to stand trial, there appears to have been no hearing or inquiry into the issue of his competence to waive his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel and proceed, as he did, to conduct his own defense. \u201cThe constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court, in which the accused \u2014 whose life or liberty is at stake \u2014 is without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U. S. 458, 465; <em>Carnley </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>369 U. S. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>From an independent examination of the record, we conclude that the question whether this \u201cprotecting duty\u201d was fulfilled should be re-examined in light of our decision this Term in <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 U. S. 375. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
