Doc. 13 \u00b6 14. That post led to her arrest. Ms. King alleges that her ex-husband and his friend, Trey Burgamy, were responsible for her unconstitutional arrest and thus she filed this action alleging claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Georgia law.

Her post referred to Captain Corey King, the father of Ms. King's children, her ex-husband, and an officer with the Washington County Sheriff's Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 29 at 11:2-7, 21:22-22:6; 33 at 8:20-9:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that morning, Captain King, feeling upset and \"disrespected\" over the post, contacted Washington County's magistrate court about initiating a criminal complaint against Ms. King. Docs. 33 at 15:24-16:4; 38-7. Captain King then went to the courthouse office of Washington County Sheriff's Department Investigator Trey Burgamy, his \"[p]retty good friend\" or \"close friend,\" to begin the process for having Ms. King arrested. Docs. 32 at 14:2-11; 33 at 56:8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a part of that process, Captain King prepared an \"application of issuance of criminal warrant.\" Doc. 38-7. Anyone can complete such an application, and Ralph Todd, Washington County's Chief Magistrate, testified that it was his practice to hear each one that came across his desk, regardless of who filed it. Doc. 31 at 8:5-9, 11:1-17. Under \"tell what happened, in your own words (not what the police report says) and why you want this person arrested\" on the warrant application, Captain King wrote \"see attached report.\" Doc. 38-7 at 2. The attached report was an incident report prepared by Investigator Burgamy at Captain King's request. Docs. 32 at 14:12-18; 33 at 35:13-17; 38-8. Investigator Burgamy recorded that \"Complainant Corey King reported that his former wife, Anne King, is harassing him via Facebook postings.\" Doc. 38-8 at 2. Although Investigator Burgamy had not seen Ms. King's Facebook post and did not know if it was true or false, he wrote, under \"incident type\" on the incident report form, \"16-11-39.1 - Harassing Phone Calls.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docs. 32 at 15:7-12, 25:5-18; 38-8 at 1. He later testified that he chose that charge because it was the only \"remotely close charge\" he found that could apply. Doc. 33 at 15:2-16. The same day, in conjunction with Captain King's application and Investigator Burgamy's incident report, Magistrate Todd issued Ms. King a notice that a hearing had been scheduled for January 21\n   to determine whether sufficient probable cause existed for her arrest. Doc. 38-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the hearing, Magistrate Todd swore in Ms. King, and she testified that she made the Facebook post and explained why. Doc. 29 at 33:17-34:7. Captain King, wearing a polo shirt with an emblem of the Washington County Sheriff's Department, also attended the hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 38:2-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 33 at 9-12. Investigator Burgamy was also present, although he testified in his deposition that he was asked to sit in as a bailiff \"for security purposes.\" Doc. 32 at 18:21-24. It was at the hearing that Investigator Burgamy first saw the Facebook post.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 25:5-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Investigator Burgamy, Magistrate Todd told Investigator Burgamy that \"if you will take the warrant for defamation of character, I'll sign it.\" Doc. 32 at 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Of course, law enforcement officers do not actually \"take a warrant.\" Rather, Magistrate Todd was clearly referring to a typical process that leads to the issuance of an arrest warrant. A law enforcement officer executes an affidavit swearing to facts that allow a judicial officer to determine whether a warrant will issue. Thus, Magistrate Todd effectively told Investigator Burgamy that if Investigator Burgamy would execute an affidavit supporting the issuance of an arrest warrant, he-Magistrate Todd-would issue the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Burgamy then executed an affidavit, swearing to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Personally came\n   <em>\n    INV.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   When the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to Ms. King, Investigator Burgamy did personally participate in her unconstitutional arrest. Indeed, he participated in a critical way. Specifically, Investigator Burgamy signed an affidavit swearing that probable cause existed to arrest Ms. King for criminal defamation. Doc. 38-10. Investigator Burgamy argues that Magistrate Todd\n   <em>\n    ordered\n   </em>\n   him to sign the affidavit and that Investigator Burgamy was simply carrying out that order.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 26-1 at 8; Doc. 43 at 2. Investigator Burgamy cites deposition testimony from Magistrate Todd, Ms. King, and the Defendants describing Magistrate Todd as \"instructing,\" \"directing,\" or \"ordering\" Investigator Burgamy to draw up a warrant for criminal defamation and concludes, \"Because all parties agree that the instruction by Magistrate Todd was in fact an order for Burgamy to draw up the arrest warrant and to arrest [Ms. King], there is no issue of fact in this regard.\" Doc. 43 at 2. But it is not at all undisputed that Magistrate Todd \"ordered\" Investigator Burgamy to simply \"take a warrant.\" First, according to Investigator Burgamy, Magistrate Todd said, \"Mr. Burgamy, if you will take the warrant for defamation of character, I'll sign it.\" Doc. 32 at 22:11-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On its face, that is not an order. Second, Investigator Burgamy did not simply \"take a warrant.\" He swore to the truth of the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Personally came\n   <em>\n    INV.

Investigator Burgamy swore to these facts, including the \"fact\" that Ms. King's Facebook post was false, even though he knew of no facts supporting her arrest generally and had no idea whether her Facebook post was false. Doc. 32 at 29:15-16, 32:10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Investigator Burgamy then made clear why he was swearing to those facts: \"And thus deponent makes this affidavit that a warrant may issue for [Ms. King's] arrest.\" Doc. 38-10 at 1. While Investigator Burgamy may argue to a jury that he was acting under orders, the fact that he affirmed \"on oath\" as the \"prosecutor\" that Ms. King's \"false\" Facebook post constituted criminal defamation supports the inference that he was acting as an independent affiant and not just as an arm of Magistrate Todd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, when the evidence is construed in the light most favorable to Ms. King, Investigator Burgamy did not merely \"fill[ ] out an arrest warrant form to reflect Magistrate Todd's order,\" and summary judgment on this ground is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Court agrees that clearly \"Investigator Burgamy's actions in filling out an incident report and drafting a warrant pursuant to a magistrate's instructions fall within his discretionary functions.\" Doc. 26-1 at 9.

As to Ms. King's First Amendment claims, Investigator Burgamy only argues that he cannot be held liable because \"Magistrate Todd made the sole determination that [Ms. King] should be charged with criminal defamation,\" and therefore, Ms. King cannot show that Investigator Burgamy's conduct \"adversely affected\" her protected speech. Doc. 26-1 at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pittman v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010351\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/213/867/#p870\">\n    213 F.

Doc. 38-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to Ms. King's claims under the Fourth Amendment, Investigator Burgamy essentially makes the same argument factually, but with a different legal spin. Malicious prosecution is a violation of the Fourth Amendment and is thus a constitutional tort under \u00a7 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingsland v.

To prove a \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim under federal law, a plaintiff must establish that \"(1) a criminal prosecution [was]\n   <em>\n    instituted\n   </em>\n   or continued by the present defendant; (2) with malice and without probable cause; (3) that terminated in the plaintiff accused's favor; and (4) caused damage to the plaintiff accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Kjellsen v.

Investigator Burgamy argues that Magistrate Todd's conclusion that criminal defamation was a more appropriate charge than harassing phone calls precludes Ms. King's Fourth Amendment claim because the Eleventh Circuit has held that \"intervening acts of [a] prosecutor, grand jury, judge and jury-assuming that these court officials acted without malice that caused them to abuse their powers-each break the chain of causation unless plaintiff can show that these intervening acts were the result of deception or undue pressure by the defendant policemen.\"\n   <em>\n    Barts v.

Naturally, Investigator Burgamy does not argue that it was not clearly established that an officer could not sign an affidavit seeking an arrest for criminal defamation, nor does he argue that it was not clearly established that he could not swear something was false when he did not know it to be false. Rather, building on his \"following orders\" argument, he asserts that the issue is whether it was clearly established that it was unconstitutional or illegal for a law enforcement officer to \"second guess a [M]agistrate [J]udge's decision\" or \"refuse to follow the court's order.\" Docs. 26-1 at 13; 43 at 6. As discussed repeatedly, that is not the issue; there is evidence that Investigator Burgamy was not merely following an order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 31 at 23:5-24:1; 32 at 22:11-20; 38-10 at 1.

Indeed, the Georgia Code describes the elements of the two torts identically, except malicious prosecution, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-40, requires \"prosecution\" while malicious arrest, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-7-1, does not. Accordingly, in\n   <em>\n    Ferrell v. Mikula\n   </em>\n   , the Georgia Court of Appeals noted that Georgia case law distinguishing \"false imprisonment,\" \"false arrest,\" \"malicious arrest,\" and \"malicious prosecution\" \"is quite confusing,\" in part as a legacy of \"inexact nomenclature.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134145\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/295/326/#p330\">\n    295 Ga.

A jury could reasonably find Captain King enlisted Investigator Burgamy (who was not a licensed attorney) to assist him in his quest.

While Magistrate Todd's expectation of law enforcement officers is not dispositive of Investigator Burgamy's responsibility, it supports the conclusion that, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Ms. King, Investigator Burgamy was serving as an affiant rather than simply following Magistrate Todd's orders.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Court is not convinced that, even if it were undisputed that Magistrate Todd ordered Investigator Burgamy to sign an affidavit Investigator Burgamy knew to be false, Investigator Burgamy would escape \u00a7 1983 liability.
