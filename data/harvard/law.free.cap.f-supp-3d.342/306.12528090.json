BRODIE, United States District Judge\n  Plaintiff Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC commenced the above-captioned action in Texas state court, on February 17, 2017, against the above-listed Defendants. (Pl. Pet., Docket Entry No. 1-2.) On April 5, 2017, invoking the Edge Act,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20611\">\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 611\n  </extracted-citation>\n  <em>\n   et seq.\n  </em>\n  , Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. (Notice of Removal, Docket Entry No. 1.) On April 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, (Am. Compl., Docket Entry No. 4), and moved to remand the case to the Texas state court, (Pl. Mot. to Remand (\"Pl. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 6). Defendants opposed Plaintiff's motion. (Defs. Opp'n. to Pl. Mot. (\"Defs. Opp'n), Docket Entry No. 54-1.) On August 3, 2017, while the motion to remand was pending, the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation (\"MDL\") transferred the case to the Eastern District of New York because it shares \"substantially similar factual allegations with [cases consolidated in\n  <em>\n   In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litig.\n  </em>\n  , 05-MD-1720], and thus falls squarely within the subject matter of the MDL.\"\n  <em>\n   In re Payment Card Interchange Fee &amp; Merch.

Aug. 2, 2017). By order dated September 14, 2017, the Court referred Plaintiff's motion to Magistrate Judge James Orenstein for a report and recommendation. (Order dated Sept. 14, 2017.)\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   By report and recommendation dated July 12, 2018, Judge Orenstein recommended that the Court deny Plaintiff's motion (\"R &amp; R\"). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R, Docket Entry No. 76.) Plaintiff filed objections to the R &amp; R on July 18, 2018. (Pl. Obj. to R &amp; R (\"Pl. Obj.\"), Docket Entry No. 77.) Defendants responded to the objections on August 1, 2018. (Defs. Resp. to Pl. Obj. (\"Defs. Resp.\"), Docket Entry No. 78.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court adopts the R &amp; R and denies Plaintiff's motion to remand the case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts as detailed in the R &amp; R and provides only a summary of the pertinent facts and procedural background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action in Texas state court alleging that Defendants \"conspired, combined, and made agreements to restrain trade\" in violation of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act of 1983. (Pls. Pet. \u00b6 3.) The Complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges that Defendants harmed merchants, such as Plaintiff, by imposing \"competitive restraints\" that resulted in \"supracompetitive interchange fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff does not bring any claims under federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Pet.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Defendants' removal to federal court and Plaintiff's motion to remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Edge Act, which states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity to which any corporation organized under the laws of the United States shall be a party, arising out of transactions involving international or foreign banking, or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States, or out of other international or foreign financial operations, either directly or through the agency, ownership, or control of branches or local institutions in dependencies or insular possessions of the United States or in foreign countries, shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States, and the district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction of all such suits; and any defendant in any such suit may, at any time before the trial thereof, remove such suits from a State court into the district court of the United States for the proper district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20632\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants contend that removal was proper because the action is a \"suit of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\" five of the Defendants are \"corporation[s] organized under the laws of the United States\" (\"Edge Act corporations\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the action arises out of \"transactions involving international or foreign banking, or banking in a dependency or insular possession of the United States.\" (Notice of Removal \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the Edge Act does not confer federal jurisdiction, and the Court should remand the case back to the state court for four reasons. (Pl. Mot. 1.) First, Plaintiff contends the Court must determine jurisdiction based on its pleadings and cannot consider extrinsic evidence of foreign issued cards used at Plaintiff's restaurants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) Plaintiff also argues that even if the Court could consider such evidence, Defendants' argument is without merit because the use of foreign issued cards at Plaintiff's restaurants is too \"fortuitous\" and does not satisfy the Edge Act requirement that the suit arise out of transactions involving international or foreign banking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, Plaintiff contends that \"setting fees and rules for a restaurant's use of a non-banking entity's network such as Visa and MasterCard\" does not fall within the Edge Act's requirement of \"an international or foreign transaction which falls within the realm of those characterized as traditional banking activities,\" or \"international or foreign financial operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, Plaintiff contends that even if the case arose out of \"an international or foreign transaction which falls within the realm of those characterized as traditional banking activities,\" or \"international or foreign financial operations,\" federal jurisdiction is still improper because the transaction must be through direct participation of an Edge Act corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Court should remand the action on the basis of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, because it \"expressly disclaims any damages related to attenuated purchases\" made by foreign-issued cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Judge Orenstein' recommendations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Judge Orenstein recommended that the Court deny Plaintiff's motion to remand the case to state court. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R &amp; R.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Orenstein found that the supracompetitive fees complained of by Plaintiff arise from multi-party payment card transactions that include both issuing and acquiring banks, and that some issuing banks are foreign, including dozens identified by Defendants that approved transactions with Plaintiff and its acquiring bank Chase, an Edge Act corporation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (citing Decl. of R. Garrison Harvey (\"Harvey Decl.\"), annexed to Defs. Opp'n as Ex. A, Docket Entry No. 54-2).) Judge Orenstein noted that these transactions \"fall[ ] within the realm of those 'characterized as traditional banking activity' \" because a \"foreign issuing bank's role in approving payments made on a consumer's credit card is an essential element of administering the four-way transactions at the center of this lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20632\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20632\">\n    at 6-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Pinto v.

June 4, 2003) ). In recommending denial of the motion to remand, Judge Orenstein noted that there is \"federal jurisdiction over a case if\n   <em>\n    any part of it\n   </em>\n   arises out of transactions involving international or foreign banking, even when foreign banking activity [is] not central to the case.\" (R &amp; R 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am.

Plaintiff's objections and Defendants' response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff objects to Judge Orenstein's recommendation that the Court deny its motion to remand on three grounds. Plaintiff argues that: (1) jurisdiction is determined on the basis of Plaintiff's pleading and Judge Orenstein improperly considered \"affidavits from Defendants alleging that a few purchases at [Plaintiff's restaurants] were made with a foreign issued card,\" (Pls. Obj. 4); (2) \"[e]ven if the Court were to consider Defendants' extraneous evidence of foreign issued card purchases, the Edge Act requires that the case 'arise out of' - not merely 'involve' or 'include' foreign banking,\" and foreign issued card purchases do not rise to that standard, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6); and (3) Judge Orenstein erroneously determined that by requesting injunctive relief that would impact foreign transactions, and despite disclaiming damages from any foreign-issued card transactions, the Amended Complaint confers jurisdiction under the Edge Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Plaintiff contends that the injunctive relief requested is against Defendants' anticompetitive behavior in the United States, and, if granted, Plaintiff \"could still choose to accept foreign issued card purchases absent the competitive restraints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants contend that the R &amp; R should be adopted in its entirety because: (1) Judge Orenstein properly relied on declarations to determine jurisdiction because the precedent in the Second Circuit allows the Court to do so and none of the cases cited by Plaintiff show otherwise, (Defs. Resp. 5-6); (2) Judge Orenstein applied the correct standard in determining that this suit \"arises out of\" foreign or international banking transactions or other foreign financial operations because in this\n   Circuit \"a suit satisfies the jurisdictional requisites of Section 632 if any part of it arises out of transactions involving international or foreign banking,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8 (citations omitted) ); and (3) Plaintiff should not be allowed to circumvent jurisdiction by amending its Complaint because jurisdiction is determined based on the complaint at the time of removal, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff was allowed to amend its Complaint, Plaintiff's claim that the Amended Complaint only includes claims for antitrust injuries related to purchases by customers using credit and debit cards issued to them in the United States, does not defeat the Court's jurisdiction under the Edge Act because the Amended Complaint does not disclaim damages from cards issued in Puerto Rico or Guam - \"dependenc[ies] of insular possession of the United States,\" as specified by the Edge Act, or cards issued by foreign banks to individuals in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court considers each of Plaintiff's arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Court may look beyond Plaintiff's pleading to determine subject matter jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff contends that in finding jurisdiction pursuant to Edge Act, Judge Orenstein impermissibly considered Defendants' declarations showing the use of foreign-issued cards at Plaintiff's restaurants. (Pls.

(Notice of Removal \u00b6 6.) If the issuing bank in question is a foreign bank, then the interchange fee is charged by the foreign bank, making the transaction foreign. The record indicates that Defendant Chase Bank, an Edge Act corporation, served as an acquiring bank for Plaintiff in a number of transactions involving foreign issuing banks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Those transactions required participation of both the acquiring bank - Chase Bank - and the issuing foreign bank. Therefore, there is a direct nexus between the qualifying transaction and an Edge Act corporation that is not fortuitous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Speedy Stop\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff argues that there must be a more direct relationship between its claim and the foreign transaction. (Pl. Obj. 6-7.) In\n   <em>\n    Speedy Stop\n   </em>\n   , although considering the same type of payments by foreign issued cards as are before the Court, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    American International Group\n   </em>\n   to conclude that \"[t]he involvement of any foreign banks [was] fortuitous and legally insignificant to Speedy Stop's lawsuit,\" and remanded the case to state court.\n   <em>\n    Speedy Stop\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-0073, slip op. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the R &amp; R, Judge Orenstein disagreed with\n   <em>\n    Speedy Stop's\n   </em>\n   application of\n   <em>\n    American International Group\n   </em>\n   , stating that \"[w]hile [it is] true ... that ... plaintiffs were not complaining specifically about the subset of transactions that were approved by foreign issuing banks, it also glosses over the relevant inquiry. [Plaintiff] is targeting in its [C]omplaint an entire category of transactions, some entirely domestic but others that involve foreign issuing banks.\" (R &amp; R 5.) Judge Orenstein also noted that Plaintiff \"is challenging the [D]efendants' respective roles in creating and implementing the system that regulates those transactions,\" for example, Plaintiffs challenge to Defendants' \"Honor All Cards\" rules imposed upon the merchants, requiring a merchant to accept all cards if it accepts one card, including those that are issued by foreign banks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Judge Orenstein concluded that \"it is thus clear that payment card transactions in which one of the parties is a foreign bank play an inextricable part of the conduct at the heart of this case,\" and therefore, removal was proper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite the limitations placed on the Edge Act jurisdiction by the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    American International Group\n   </em>\n   , the Edge Act does not require the foreign transaction to be central to the claim. The Edge Act reads in relevant part that the suit must \"aris[e] out of transactions involving international or foreign banking.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20632\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute does not require that the suit arise out of the foreign transaction but out of transactions involving foreign banking. As noted by Judge Orenstein, Plaintiff's claim is based on an \"entire category of transactions\" that involve, among others, foreign transactions when a customer uses a card issued by a foreign bank. In addition, the very antitrust conduct that Plaintiff challenges, such as the Honor All Cards rules, necessarily include the use of foreign cards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R &amp; R 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, the facts here are distinguishable from cases where courts lacked jurisdiction due to the lack of connection between the claim and the foreign transaction. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   , the complaint alleged that \"Wells Fargo employees lied to customers and 'bundled' products, including ExpressSend, in order to meet sales quotas.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204886391\">\n    2015 WL 4886391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5-6. The\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   court noted that \"the [c]omplaint [did] not allege that Wells Fargo employees caused customers to use the ExpressSend product; it only assert[ed] that Wells Fargo employees would tell customers that opening a checking account would 'automatically' come with other accounts and/or enroll customers in other services, including ExpressSend.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204886391\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the conduct Plaintiff challenges, such as the Honor All Card rules, requires merchants to accept all cards, including those issued by foreign\n   banks. Therefore, even though the claims do not arise out of any fees specific to foreign-issued cards, the use of foreign issued cards is sufficiently integral to Plaintiff's claims challenging the rules requiring acceptance of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cards. Thus, the Court finds that the suit arises out of transactions involving foreign banking and the removal was proper pursuant to the Edge Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    e.

This concern, however, hardly justifies a categorical prohibition on the remand of cases involving state-law claims regardless of whether the plaintiff has attempted to manipulate the forum and regardless of the other circumstances in the case. A district court can consider whether the plaintiff has engaged in any manipulative tactics when it decides whether to remand a case. If the plaintiff has attempted to manipulate the forum, the court should take this behavior into account in determining\n   whether the balance of factors to be considered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine support a remand in the case.

Thus, Plaintiff is precluded from gaining the benefits of competition as to the terms upon which they will accept or reject the cards of any issuing bank that is a member of Visa or MasterCard. As a result, the \"default\" interchange fees become binding on Plaintiff.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    (R &amp; R 6 (citing Am.
