BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2015, Daniel Davies was arrested and charged with aggravated battery.\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1) at \u00b6 21. He was brought to the Broward County Sheriff's Office Main Jail, which is operated and maintained by the Broward County Sheriff's Office (\"BSO\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Since 2004, BSO has contracted Armor Correctional Health Services, Inc. (\"Armor\") to provide\n   medical care to inmates of the Broward County jail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Davies arrived at BSO, EMT Waddle, an Armor employee, medically prescreened Davies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Davies did not have any visible injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Deputies Magliore and McKenzie then escorted Davies-who was not injured at the time-into a cell that was not under surveillance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Approximately six minutes later, Davies left the cell injured and very upset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. He told BSO employees that Deputies Magliore and McKenzie had assaulted him in the cell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Davies was then examined by EMT Waddle, who put Davies on suicide watch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Although a \"suicide watch\" designation mandates constant observation, Davies was placed in isolation and remained alone from 2:51 a.m. to 5:40 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42, 44-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At 5:40 a.m. another inmate noticed that Davies was unconscious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. Armor employees, including Nurse Dupiche and EMT Waddle, immediately arrived to assist Davies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-51. EMT Waddle prepared an Urgent Medical Care Record stating that Davies was discovered on the floor of his cell unresponsive and bleeding from the mouth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Nurse Dupiche and Deputy McKenzie lifted Davies, who was unconscious, and brought him to the third floor infirmary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Kotzen, an Armor employee, was charged with control of Davies's care and made decisions about treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 298-99. Thus, the following treatment took place under Dr. Kotzen's care. At 6:06 a.m. Davies, still unresponsive, was placed on a makeshift bed on the floor in the infirmary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. At 7:29 a.m., Nurse Dupiche checked on Davies, who was immobile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. About an hour later, Nurse Benoit-who eventually wrote a report stating that Davies was swollen and bleeding-wiped blood off of Davies's face.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54, 317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Over seven hours after he was found unconscious and bleeding, Davies was transported to Broward General Medical Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. Armor labeled the transport \"non-emergency\" and classified Davies's condition on release as \"good.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   An examination at the hospital revealed that Davies had severe swelling on the right side of his face, swelling on the left side of his eye, pain in his ribs, and a large subdural hematoma on the left side of his brain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63. Davies had two emergency brain surgeries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. The treating neurosurgeon reported that Davies's injuries were consistent with an impact to the right side of his face, which would cause the left side of Davies's brain to make contact with the inside of his skull.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Davies has suffered permanent brain damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68, 74. He is wheelchair bound and requires total assistance with mobility and all activities of daily living.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73. He lives in a nursing and rehabilitation facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75. Plaintiff alleges that Davies's prognosis would have been better had Armor transported him to the hospital sooner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Armor consistently declines to provide immediate emergency medical care-which is more expensive to Armor under the terms of its contract with\n   BSO-and instead permits inmates to die or suffer serious injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 88, 94. Plaintiff specifically identifies ten people who have died in BSO custody while under Armor's care, detailing causes of death that Plaintiff contends required immediate emergency care (sepsis, pneumonia, starvation, hemorrhaging, etc.).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99. Plaintiff alleges that BSO knew of Armor's practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 at 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In March 2018, Plaintiff sued several defendants-Scott Israel, as Constitutional Deputy of Broward County Sheriff's Office; Deputy McMorris Magliore; Deputy Germaine McKenzie; Armor Correctional Health Services, Inc.; Doctor Stephen Kotzen; Nurse Esner Benoit; Nurse Francis Dupiche; and EMT Nicolas Waddle- under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and state law.\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 1). In May 2018, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Am. Compl.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 38).
