Count Eight of NorthBay's complaint alleges that Blue Shield's reimbursement methodology constituted an unfair business practice under California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), California Business and Professions Code Section 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Count Nine seeks related declaratory relief. NorthBay asserts that Blue Shield uses a flawed methodology or manipulates data, did not properly apply criteria for setting reimbursement rates, and engaged in an unfair payment pattern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Blue Shield moves for partial summary judgment on those counts, contending that there is no private right of action to challenge the methodology used to determine reasonable reimbursements and urging that even if there were the court should abstain from functioning like an administrative body on issues of complex economic policy. Given the regulations and oversight of the Department of Manage Health Care (\"DMHC\") concerning these payments, NorthBay's UCL claim must be predicated\n   on an incorrect reimbursement amount that causes it injury rather than the methodology that led to it. Accordingly, I GRANT Blue Shield's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The hospitals provide comprehensive care, including emergency care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Blue Shield is a health care service plan in which members receive care from in-network hospitals for more favorable reimbursement terms than if they were out-of-network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Crawford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5 (Dkt.

(Dkt No. 1); Amended Compl. (Dkt. No. 17). It brings nine claims against Blue Shield for violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, various breaches of contract, recovery for services rendered, unfair business practices, and declaratory relief. Blue Shield answered the amended complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer and Counterclaim (Dkt. No. 18). At a June 2018 case management conference, the parties agreed to bifurcate the issues for a jury trial first addressing the reasonable value of NorthBay's services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Case Management Statement (Dkt. No. 36); Minutes Entry (Dkt. No. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This motion brings two of NorthBay's nine claims to the fore. NorthBay alleges in Count Eight that Blue Shield engaged in unfair business practices under the UCL for failing to compensate NorthBay hospitals for non-contracted services, and manipulating data inputted to a flawed methodology to underpay non-contracted claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6 128. Considering those alleged unfair practices, NorthBay seeks injunctive relief and restitution to stop Blue Shield from using a reimbursement methodology that improperly considers factors required in Section 1300.71 and\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6 130. Relatedly, Count Nine seeks declaratory relief that Blue Shield's reimbursement methodology is improper, that it manipulates data to underpay claims, and that it will not continue being used for future reimbursements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Compl. \u00b6 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A party is entitled to summary judgment where it \"shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and [it] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

Applying the tethering test, NorthBay's claim that Blue Shield is engaged in an unfair payment pattern for improperly considering the\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   factors or Section 1300.71 does not violate any \"legislatively declared policy\" for the same reasons it is not predicated on an unlawful action or a violation of any provision in the Knox-Keene Act. Even though NorthBay argues that the existing R &amp; C methodology harms Blue Shield members, NorthBay is not bringing a representative claim seeking relief on behalf of consumers, nor is it clear that it could establish such standing. As Blue Shield asserts, private actions under the UCL may be \"brought exclusively by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.\"\n   <em>\n    Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v.

ABSTENTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Blue Shield asks the court to abstain from interpreting or enforcing the prompt-pay laws in the Knox-Keene Act even if a private right of action existed under the UCL. It contends the court is \"ill-equipped\" to make \"complex economic and actuarial determinations\" on the proper way to consider the\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   factors in its R &amp; C methodology and would improperly assume the administrative functions of the DMHC by attempting to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

Because I agreed with Blue Shield that no UCL claim can be predicated on improperly applying Section 1300.71 and improperly considering the\n   <em>\n    Gould\n   </em>\n   factors in developing an R &amp; C methodology, I need not opine on the abstention arguments presented by the parties. However, even if I were to allow NorthBay's UCL claim to proceed, since the DMHC did not mandate a specific methodology to be applied I would not attempt to either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v.

I disagree that enjoining any application of the existing R &amp; C methodology would necessarily require the court to devise a replacement methodology for Blue Shield. Nevertheless, NorthBay's claim for injunctive relief is not successful for the reasons discussed.
