For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff David Freeman's trial is scheduled for May 31, 2016, as the second bellwether trial of the over 3500 cases that make up this multidistrict litigation (\"MDL\"). The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation describes the cases in its Transfer Order as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   All the actions are personal injury or wrongful death actions arising out of plaintiffs' alleged ingestion of drinking water contaminated with a chemical, C-8 (also known as perfluorooctoanoic acid (PFOA) or ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) ), discharged from DuPont's Washington Works Plant near Parkersburg, West Virginia. All of the plaintiff's in this litigation allege that they suffer or suffered from one or more of six diseases identified as potentially linked to C-8 exposure by a study conducted as part of a 2005 settlement [\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement\"] between DuPont and a class of approximately 80,000 persons residing in six water districts allegedly contaminated by C-8 from the Washington Works Plant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leach v.

The\n    <em>\n     Leach\n    </em>\n    Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As indicated by the Judicial Panel in its Transfer Order, the cases that make up this MDL are a subset of cases that originated in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case. The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Case was brought by a group of individuals who alleged a variety of claims under West Virginia common law tort theories for equitable, injunctive, and declaratory relief, along with compensatory and punitive damages, as a result of alleged drinking water contamination. In the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, the parties fashioned a unique procedure to determine whether the approximately 80,000 members of the class (\"\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class\") would be permitted to file actions against Defendant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company's (\"DuPont\") based on any of the human diseases they believed had been caused by their exposure to C-8\" discharged from DuPont's Washington Works plant. (\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement (\"S.A.\"), ECF No. 820-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The procedure required DuPont and the plaintiff's to jointly select three completely independent, mutually-agreeable, appropriately credentialed epidemiologists (\"Science Panel\") to study whether there is a connection between C-8 and human disease among the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class. (S.A. at \u00a7\u00a7 12.2.1, 12.2.2.) Pursuant to the agreed procedure the parties established in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, the Science Panel established a protocol and studied numerous human diseases, examining health data and blood samples from approximately 69,000 individuals exposed to C-8 in the communities served by the water districts whose water had been contaminated with C-8 released from DuPont's Washington Works plant. (\n   <em>\n    http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/c8health.html\n   </em>\n   ) (\"The Science Panel, as part of the Community Study, received the anonymised and non-identifiable health data collected by Brookmar [in the C-8 Health Project] to examine and analyze as part of its work.\"). DuPont paid the entire cost of the study which was more than $20 million dollars. (S.A. \u00a7 9.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement provided that the conclusions of the Science Panel's study would be issued in either a \"Probable Link Finding\" or a \"No Probable Link Finding\" for each human disease the Panel studied. (S.A. \u00a7 12.2.3.) \"[T]he Probable Link reports [are] presented in detail in scientific articles (follow link [on the C-8 Science Panel website to the] Study Publications).\" (\n   <em>\n    http://www.c8sciencepanel.org/study.html\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Science Panel engaged in its work for seven years and in 2011 and 2012 issued Probable Link Findings for six human diseases, including testicular cancer, (\"Linked Diseases\") and No Probable Link Findings for over forty human diseases. The\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement defines \"Probable Link Finding\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Probable Link\" shall mean that based upon the weight of the available scientific evidence, it is more likely than not that there is a link between exposure to C-8 and a particular Human Disease among Class Members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (S.A. \u00a7 1.49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the Science Panel delivered a Probable Link Finding as to the six Linked Diseases, the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement permits the individual class members to pursue the claims \"for personal injury and wrongful death, including but not limited to any claims for injunctive relief and special, general and punitive and any other damages whatsoever associated with such claims, that ... relate to exposure to C-8 of Class Members\" and\n   <em>\n    DuPont agreed not to contest general causation in those actions.\n   </em>\n   (S.A. \u00a7 3.3) (emphasis added). DuPont\n   <em>\n    retained the right to contest specific causation\n   </em>\n   and to assert any other defenses not barred by the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. (S.A. \u00a7 3.3) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties defined general and specific causation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"General Causation\" shall mean that it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing a particular Human Disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Specific Causation\" shall mean that it is probable that exposure to C-8 caused a particular Human Disease in a specific individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1.25, 1.60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the Science Panel delivered its Probable Link Findings and No Probable Link Findings, the individual class members whose claims are based on one or more of the Linked Diseases began to file cases in West Virginia and Ohio. DuPont moved the United States Judicial Panel on\n   Multidistrict Litigation for centralization of these individual actions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Judicial Panel granted DuPont's request and on April 9, 2013, it transferred the centralized action to this Court. Ultimately, 3,542 cases were filed in or transferred to this Court as part of this MDL. Through a negotiated process, the parties chose, and this Court approved, five plaintiff's whose cases would serve as bellwether trials. The first bellwether plaintiff, Carla Marie Bartlett, tried her case to a jury in September 2015. The second bellwether case was resolved. Mr. Freeman was chosen as the third bellwether case, and will be the second case to go to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Freeman's Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Freeman has lived in Cutler, Ohio, since 1993. The water to his residence was supplied from the Little Hocking water district, a named district in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. In March 2000, when Mr. Freeman was forty years old, he felt pain in his right testis when he bumped it while taking a shower. Upon self-examination, he found what he described as a \"hard testicle which turned out to have a mass inside.\" (Freeman Dep. at 224-25, ECF No. 4312-4.) After consulting his primary care physician, who referred him to a urologic surgeon, \"he underwent a right radical orchiectomy (inguinal approach),\" on April 5, 2000. (Bahnson Report at 3, ECF No. 4311-1.) Pathology revealed that his \"right testicular tumor was a teratoma with both mature and immature elements:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a malignancy.

Dr. Bahnson's Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To meet his burden of proving his claim that C-8 caused his testicular cancer, Mr. Freeman has proffered the expert opinion of Robert Bahnson, M.D., F.A.C.S. Dr. Bahnson is a licensed medical doctor, a surgeon, and a Board Certified urologist, a field of medical specialization in diseases of the urinary tract and the male reproductive system, who has been practicing medicine for over thirty years. He is a Professor in the Department of Urology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, which is part of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. He practices at the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, where he was recently the Chief of Staff. He has authored or co-authored over one-hundred peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and book chapters, many of which focus on different aspects or urologic oncology, which includes cancer of the prostate, bladder, kidney, and testicular cancer. There is no dispute that Dr. Bahnson is qualified to give an expert opinion as to the specific cause of Mr. Freeman's testicular cancer and/or his potential for future cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. performed a differential diagnosis on Mr. Freeman, which is discussed in detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that he holds the following opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   David Freeman's exposure to C-8 in his drinking water was a substantial contributing factor in bringing about the development of his testicular cancer. Further, his cancer in the right testis now puts him at substantial risk (approximately 15% chance) for developing\n   cancer in the left testis. Additionally, because Mr. Freeman underwent (appropriately so) frequent repeated CT scanning as part of his 10 year observation protocol, his risk for developing other cancers has also increased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DuPont has moved to exclude Dr. Bahnson's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Daubert v.

He further considered the \"generally accepted risk factors for testicular cancer including; cryptorchidism ; a strong close family history of testicular cancer (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in a brother or father); HIV infection.... calcification of the testis,\" and race and age distribution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7632075,3698149\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As for the third element, \"eliminate [ion of] alternative causes,\" Dr. Bahnson performed a physical examination of Mr. Freeman, reviewed his medical records from his primary care physician, oncologic surgeon, oncologist, and all of his relevant hospital, pathology, and laboratory medical records; the depositions of Mr. Freeman and his oncologist; Mr. Freeman's C-8 MDL fact sheet; the expert report of David Macintosh who opined that Mr. Freeman is a\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class member; the Science Panel's Probable Link Finding for the Linked Disease testicularcancer ; scholarly research by other experts; his experience, expertise, and knowledge gained through research and treatment of urologic cancers ; and, the standard methodology used in the field and practice of urologic surgery. (Bahnson Report at 4-5.) Dr. Bahnson ruled out close family history, HIV infection, calcification of the testis, and cryptorchidism because these risk factors were not applicable to Mr. Freeman.

And, importantly, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Tamraz\n   </em>\n   where the court recognized that the expert \"conceded he knew of no studies finding a link between manganese and Parkinson's Disease,\" here the Science Panel issued a Probable Link Finding for testicular cancer, which provides not just reliable and admissible evidence but an agreed conclusion made by the parties that \"it is more likely than not that there is a link between exposure to C-8 and [testicular cancer ] among Class Members.\" (S.A. \u00a7 1.49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Last, the Court notes that DuPont's proposition that Dr. Bahnson was required to \"consider that Mr. Freeman's testicular cancer was more likely than not the result of unknown causes,\" misstates the inquiry. Dr. Bahnson was required to consider that no cause is found in the majority of cases of testicular cancer - which he did. He was not required to consider that Mr. Freeman's cancer was more likely than not the result of unknown causes. Indeed, that statement is a conclusion - a conclusion on which the parties' specific causation experts disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis Beyond a Differential Diagnosis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   DuPont argues that Dr. Bahnson's expert opinion is inadmissible because he \"failed to conduct any analysis other than a differential etiology.\" (DuPont's Mot. at\n   8.) DuPont maintains that a differential diagnosis \"alone is not a reliable methodology where, as here, the condition at issue is idiopathic in the vast majority of cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Specifically, DuPont posits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Dr. Bahnson relied exclusively on a differential etiology methodology to arrive at his specific causation opinions in this case, despite the well-accepted rule that differential etiology alone is not a reliable methodology where the cause of the disease is unknown in the majority of cases. Plaintiff wants the Court to simply disregard this rule, claiming for the first time in his brief that Dr. Bahnson was able to \"rule out\" idiopathic etiology in Plaintiff's case because under the Court's current rulings, C-8 exposure is capable of causing testicular cancer in\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class Members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Because this new \"basis\" for Dr. Bahnson's specific causation opinion was not timely disclosed in his report, and was not even disclosed at Dr. Bahnson's deposition, it should be disregarded by the Court.

The parties agreed in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement to have this general causation issue determined by the Science Panel's epidemiological study, which was concluded with the Probable Link and No Probable Link Findings- not this Court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Further, this is not the first time Mr. Freeman has taken the position that his testicular cancer is not idiopathic. An idiopathic disease is defined as \"one that exists without any connection with any known cause.\" The Free Medical Dictionary, http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/idiopathic.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Dictionary.com, www.dictionary.com (\"of unknown cause\"); Cambridge Dictionaries Online, www.dictionary.cambridge.org (\"an idiopathic disease or medical condition has no known cause\"). Mr. Freeman has always\n   taken the position that his testicular cancer was caused by C-8, which by definition means that he does not believe it is of unknown cause in his case. And, while Dr. Bahnson recognized that the majority of cases of testicular cancer are of unknown origin, in 15% of his patients he\n   <em>\n    can determine\n   </em>\n   a cause of the testicular cancer. Thus, even if Dr. Bahnson had taken this position for the first time, it is certainly not \"outside the scope\" of his report and/or deposition testimony as the cases upon which DuPont relies prohibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, the Court points out that DuPont's framing of this issue throughout its briefing as whether Dr. Bahnson \"rul[ed] out idiopathic causation\" confuses the inquiry, as can be seen by the following exchange in Dr. Bahnson's deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. And what methodology do you use that allows you to say that Mr. Freeman's testicular cancer would not have resulted but for his exposure to C-8 from Du Pont's plant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. The medical reasoning, I think we've covered this earlier in the deposition, that he didn't have any of the known risk factors for cancer, his age was atypical of individuals that develop cancer, and finally, the histology of his tumor, which was teratoma, is very distinctly uncommon in adult testicular tumor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Do you claim that you ruled out idiopathic causes for Mr. Freeman's testicular cancer ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. That question makes no sense. Idiopathic means there's no known cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (Bahnson Dep at 117:7-22.) Indeed, the scientific method\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   actually precludes the statement that there is no cause of testicular cancer, as opposed to no\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     known\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   cause. For example, no scientist has ever found extraterrestrial life. But, the scientific method would preclude saying that extraterrestrials do not exist-only that there is no verifiable or known scientific finding of their existence. Similarly, here, it cannot be said that there is no cause of testicular cancer-only that there is no known cause in the majority of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Additionally, the Court disagrees with DuPont's position that there is a \"well-accepted rule that differential etiology alone is not a reliable methodology where the cause of the disease is unknown in the majority of cases.\" In other words, DuPont's position is that in a situation where the cause of a disease is unknown in the majority of cases, a plaintiff may not rely on a valid and reliable differential diagnosis, but must instead provide a second opinion based upon a different reliable and valid methodology to support specific causation. The Court finds no such well accepted rule in the case law, finding dispositive distinguishing factors in the cases to which DuPont cites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For example, while DuPont correctly points out that the Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Bland v. Verizon Wireless, (VAW) L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   stated: \"Where the cause of the condition is unknown in the majority of cases, [an expert] cannot properly conclude, based upon a differential diagnosis, Bland's exposure to freon was 'the most probable cause' of Bland's exercise-induced asthma.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127824\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/893/#p897\">\n    538 F.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897 (8th Cir. 2008) (an employee claimed she ingested freon after another employee sprayed canned-air containing freon into her water bottle, contending that her ingestion of freon caused her to suffer exercise-induced asthma ). However, as Mr. Freeman correctly explains, the\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   court made that statement in the midst of an analysis where it was clear that the plaintiff's expert failed to,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , rule out other known sources.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127824\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/893/#p897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127824\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/893/#p897\">\n    at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The district court excluded [the expert]'s causation testimony because [she] (1) failed scientifically to eliminate other possible causes as part of her differential diagnosis; ....\").

And, the only district court in this circuit to cite to\n   <em>\n    Bland\n   </em>\n   is\n   <em>\n    Dickson v. Natl.

In\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that the plaintiff's expert's \"failed to consider that multiple myeloma is an idiopathic disease.\" The\n   <em>\n    Dickson\n   </em>\n   court disagreed, denying exclusion of the expert's opinion, stating: \"The Court finds that Dr. Brautbar's differential diagnosis adequately accounts for other possible causes of Plaintiff's disease, including idiopathic origin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. Similarly, here, as explained in detail above, Dr. Bahnson adequately accounted for idiopathic origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Circular Reasoning\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In its last argument as to why Dr. Bahnson's differential diagnosis is unreliable, DuPont contends that \"Dr. Bahnson engages in circular reasoning that has been soundly rejected as legally insufficient by numerous courts in situations like the one present here.\" (DuPont's Reply at 3.) DuPont raises two arguments in this regard,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   First, DuPont highlights Dr. Bahnson's deposition testimony, \"including his acknowledgments that: 'some people who live in the area around the plant would get testicular cancer anyway' for reasons unrelated to C-8 exposure; men were developing testicular cancer in the area around the plant long before DuPont started using C-8 at the plant; and Plaintiff could have developed his testicular cancer even without any exposure from the plant.\" (DuPont's Reply at 3) (citing to Bahnson Dep. at 11, 116). DuPont continues, stating that \"Dr. Bahnson simply assumes that, because C-8 is assumed to be a possible cause of testicular cancer for Class Members, something unknown (idiopathic) could not have caused Plaintiff's testicular cancer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court finds DuPont's assessment of Dr. Bahnson's analysis inaccurate. As can be seen by his differential diagnosis (discussed in more detail above), Dr. Bahnson did not simply assume that Mr. Freeman's cancer was caused by C-8 because it was a possible cause. Dr. Bahnson performed a physical examination of Mr. Freeman, reviewed his medical records from his primary care physician, oncologic surgeon, oncologist, and all of his relevant hospital, pathology, and laboratory medical records; the depositions of Mr. Freeman and his oncologist; Mr. Freeman's C-8 MDL fact sheet; the expert report of David Macintosh who opined that Mr. Freeman is a\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class member; the Science Panel's Probable Link Finding for the Linked Disease testicularcancer ; scholarly research by other experts; his experience, expertise, and knowledge gained through research and treatment of urologic cancers ; and, the standard methodology used in the field and practice of urologic surgery, (Bahnson\n   Report at 4-5.) He considered, the rarity of testicular cancer, the fact that \"beyond C-8 and a patient's history of cancer in the other testicle, there is no generally accepted 'cause' of testicular cancer and all of the \"generally accepted risk factors for testicular cancer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He then ruled out close family history, HIV infection, calcification of the testis, and cryptorchidism because these risk factors were not applicable to Mr. Freeman. He also ruled out age and race, because Mr. Freeman \"was atypical of individuals that develop cancer\" and the \"histology of his tumor, which was teratoma, is very distinctly uncommon in adult testicular tumor.\" (Bahnson Dep at 117, ECF No. 4312-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   That being said, the cases upon which DuPont relies for its proposition are both easily distinguished in that the expert witnesses in those cases failed to utilize\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   methodology. In\n   <em>\n    Mills v. Riggsbee\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-148,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201154060\">\n    2014 WL 1154060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Ky. Mar. 20, 2014), the issue was whether a hose utilized by fire departments was defective. The expert failed to offer \"evidence of any sort of analysis,\" which \"result[ed] in a complete gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (\"There is simply no information before the Court explaining how [the expert] got from 'point A' (the hose jumped) to 'point B' (therefore water hammer must have occurred).\"). Instead of utilization of a reliable method, the expert \"offer[ed] nothing more substantive than [he] will testify that the hose jumped because of water hammer; he knew it was water hammer because the hose jumped.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Sutherland v.

Here, however, unlike the cases upon which DuPont relies, Dr. Bahnson does not rely\n   <em>\n    only on\n   </em>\n   the presence of C-8 to reach his conclusion. As shown above, he \"ruled in\" potential causes and \"ruled out\" other potential causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The final case upon which DuPont relies is \"[a] recent decision from an MDL in the District Court of South Carolina,\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   (Atorvastatin Calcium) Mktg.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20168335\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

Speculation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   DuPont argues that \"Dr. Bahnson's reliance on Mr. Freeman's age at diagnosis and tumor type (teratoma ) as 'evidence' that C-8 substantially contributed to Mr. Freeman's development of testicular cancer is scientifically unsupported and rank speculation.\" (DuPont's Mot. at 1.) DuPont maintains that \"[n]either the Science Panel's Probable Link Report on cancer nor any other medical or scientific source has ever linked C-8 exposure to the development of testicular cancer at a certain age or to the development of a specific type of tumor in humans.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Therefore, DuPont concludes that \"Dr. Bahnson manufactured this unsupported, speculative theory solely for purposes of Mr. Freeman's litigation, he should be excluded from offering it at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This issue, however, has been rendered moot by Mr. Freeman's response that DuPont misunderstands or misconstrues Dr. Bahnson's opinions concerning the relevance of Mr. Freeman's age and tumor type, which merely form a part of his differential diagnosis. DuPont does not oppose admission of Dr. Bahnson's reliance on these factors as part of his differential\n   diagnosis. And, Mr. Freeman confirms that \"Dr. Bahnson does not intend to offer the opinion that Mr. Freeman's age and tumor type are indicative of C-8-induced testicular cancer as DuPont posits.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Increased Risk of Cancer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   DuPont next takes issue with Dr. Bahnson's opinions related to Mr. Freeman's increased risk of developing cancer in his left testis as a result of his prior cancer in his right testis, and his increased risk of developing cancer as a result of his continued monitoring for cancer. DuPont argues that the evidence supporting either of these propositions is not \"reasonably certain\" which is required under Ohio law. (DuPont's Mot. at 14) (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bouchard v. Am. Home Prods.

Ohio 2002) (\"Ohio law does not permit recovery for the 'mere possibility' that a plaintiff may develop a condition because that would invite speculation by the jury.\"). In his opposition memorandum, Mr. Freeman indicates that he does not offer the evidence to prove that he will develop cancer in the future, but instead to support his emotional distress, which he alleges manifested itself as cancerphobia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \"Cancerphobia is a claimed present injury consisting of mental anxiety and distress over contracting cancer in the future, as opposed to risk of cancer, which is a potential physical predisposition of developing cancer in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Cantrell v.

DuPont posits that, because it is entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Freeman's emotional distress claims, \"any suggestion that Mr. Freeman is at an increased risk of developing cancer in the future is irrelevant, would unfairly prejudice DuPont, and should be excluded from Plaintiff's trial.\" (DuPont's Reply at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   This Court, however, in ruling on DuPont's Motion for Summary Judgment on Mr. Freeman's Emotional Distress Claims, found that while Mr. Freeman's allegations related to his fear and anxiety over contracting cancer in the future do not state an independent claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, they do constitute a separate injury that may be compensated as a portion of damages in his negligence claim. (Dispositive Motions Order No. 14, ECF No. 4458.) To recover those requested damages for cancerphobia, Mr. Freeman must show that he was aware that he in fact possesses an increased statistical likelihood of developing cancer, and that from this knowledge springs a reasonable apprehension which manifests itself in mental distress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cantrell v. GAF Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959530\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/1007/#p1012\">\n    999 F.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1993) (citing\n   <em>\n    Lavelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , for the proposition that damages for cancerphobia were available as a portion of damages in a negligence action where the plaintiff's suffered a contemporaneous physical injury, if the plaintiff could show that he \"is aware that he in fact possesses an increased statistical likelihood of developing cancer, and that from this knowledge springs a reasonable apprehension which manifests itself in mental distress\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Consequently, as the Sixth Circuit has recognized, \"[e]vidence of an increased risk of cancer is relevant to whether a plaintiff's fear of cancer is reasonable, as required by\n   <em>\n    Lavelle\n   </em>\n   .... [and] [t]his evidence, in addition to the evidence that [a plaintiff] had an actual fear or concern about the risk of cancer were the necessary predicates for the mental anguish damages they sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1012 (holding that \"[t]he district court's admission of the risk of cancer evidence was therefore proper\"). Accordingly, the evidence Mr.\n   Freeman seeks to introduce related to his alleged increased risk of developing cancer is relevant and probative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Generally Accepted and Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In its Motion, DuPont raises an argument related to its understanding that Dr. Bahnson intends to opine that C-8 is \"generally accepted\" as a \"cause\" of testicular cancer. (DuPont's Mot. at 16-18.) DuPont acknowledges \"that this issue may be moot based on a discussion between counsel during Dr. Bahnson's deposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, n.1. Mr. Freeman responds that Dr. Bahnson did not intend to \"proffer the opinion at trial that C-8 is generally accepted in the medical community as a cause of testicular cancer.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 20, n.10.) Thus, in reply DuPont states that it \"now understands this specific issue to be moot, based on the agreement of Plaintiff's counsel not to offer any such evidence.\" (DuPont's Reply at 15.) Beyond that understanding, however, the parties disagree as to the phrasing Dr. Bahnson may use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   DuPont objects, however, not to language utilized by Dr. Bahnson, but instead to Mr. Freeman's \"claim in the Opposition that it is 'indisputable and\n   <em>\n    uncontestable\n   </em>\n   in this litigation that C-8 is, in fact, a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of testicular cancer for Class Members, which Mr. Freeman is ....' \" (DuPont's Reply at 16) (quoting Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 20) (emphasis added by DuPont). The parties do not cite the Court to any testimony or written opinion by Dr. Bahnson where he states that C-8 is, in fact, a cause of testicular cancer for class members, nor does DuPont request exclusion of any testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In his expert report, Dr. Bahnson states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   On April 15, 2012, the C8 Science Panel concluded on the basis of epidemiologic and other data available that, \"among class members,\" \"there is a probable link between exposure to C8 (also known as PFOA) and testicular cancer.... [and] [i]n addition, the expert report of Dr. David Macintosh concludes that Mr. Freeman is a Class Member due to his exposure to C8 in his drinking water, and thus at an increased risk for developing testicular cancer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   From my review of Mr. Freeman's deposition, as well as Dr. Macintosh's expert report, it is clear that Mr. Freeman ingested C8 contaminated water for many years beginning no later than 1993 and thus he falls into the group of people for whom C8 can cause testicular cancer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (Bahnson Report at 6.) The phrasing Dr. Bahnson utilized in his expert report is not objectionable. The phrasing he utilizes is in accord with the contractual language the parties established in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement. (S.A. \u00a7 1.49: \"it is more likely than not that there is a link between exposure to C-8 and [testicular cancer ] among Class Members\") ( (S.A. \u00a7 1.25) (\"it is probable that exposure to C-8 is capable of causing\" testicular cancer ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Thus, the phrasing regarding general causation and the Science Panel's Probable Link Finding is more nuanced than that used by Mr, Freeman. As guidance, the Court utilizes the statement objected to as an example, the more appropriate phrasing reflecting the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement is that it is indisputable and uncontestable that C-8 is, in fact, capable of causing testicular cancer in the\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class members. And, no expert can opine that C-8 is incapable of causing testicular cancer in a\n   <em>\n    Leach\n   </em>\n   Class member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   DuPont's Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Trial Plaintiff David Freeman's Specific Causation Expert,\n   Dr. Robert Bahnson.
