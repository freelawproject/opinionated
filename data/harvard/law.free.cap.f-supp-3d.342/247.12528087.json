INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the court is defendant Devell Conley's Motion to Suppress (Doc. No. 49) and Supplemental Motion to Suppress (Doc. No. 76). Conley argues that the Government violated his Fourth Amendment rights by (1) unlawfully stopping his vehicle on May 18, 2017; (2) unlawfully arresting him without probable cause; (3) conducting an unlawful search by calling a cell phone that was within the vehicle; (4) unlawfully seizing three cell phones from the vehicle; (5) searching the cell phones pursuant to an invalid warrant; (6) unlawfully entering and searching his residence without a warrant; and (7) searching his residence pursuant to an invalid warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Suppress (\"Mot. to Suppress\") (Doc. No. 49); Supplemental Motion to Suppress (\"Suppl. Mot. to Suppress\") (Doc. No. 76). On July 30, 2018, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on both Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated below, Conley's Motion to Suppress is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and his Supplemental Motion to Suppress is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Testimony/Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion to Suppress on July 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry (Doc. No. 86). At the hearing, the Government presented testimony from Detective Jeffrey Valiette of the East Haven Police Department, Officer Edrick Agosto of the New Haven Police Department, Task Force Officer Allyn Wright of the New Haven Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\"), and Special Agent Dana Mofenson of the DEA. Conley did not present any witnesses. The Government and the defendant each also introduced a number of exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Exhibit List by USA (Doc. No. 83); Defendant's Proposed Exhibit List (Doc. No. 85); Defendant's Supplemental Exhibit List (Doc. No. 87). In his Motions, Conley attacks the credibility of two of the Government's witnesses, Officer Wright and Detective Valiette. The court summarizes the relevant testimony below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Wright testified at the hearing that, when he arrived at the scene where Conley's vehicle was stopped, Conley was already outside the vehicle. Tr. (Doc. No. 88) at 115. Conley introduced Officer Wright's grand jury testimony on September 20, 2017, at which Officer Wright did not include this detail. Tr. at 115-17; Defense Ex. 2 at 45-48. Officer Wright's grand jury testimony does not contradict his testimony at the hearing before this court, however; it merely omits a detail to which he testified here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, Officer Wright testified at the hearing that Conley interacted with the driver of a green Subaru through the driver's side window. Tr. at 118. Conley introduced Officer Wright's grand jury testimony that he saw Conley approach the Subaru from the passenger side.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 118-19; Defense Ex. 2 at 45. Officer Wright testified that the two statements were reconcilable, because he saw Conley approach the Subaru from the passenger side of his field of view, continue around to the driver's side, and then conduct the transaction from the driver's side. Tr. at 118-19 Taken in context with the rest of Officer Wright's testimony and his presentation on the stand, the court concludes that neither of these statements undermines the credibility of Officer Wright's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Valiette testified at the hearing before this court that he interviewed an individual (\"Frequent Caller 1\"), who stated that he or she knew the person who used the phone number at issue in Valiette's investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 32. Valiette testified that Frequent Caller 1 stated that he or she knew the person by the name of D.L., and that he or she knew D.L. to be a black male, 35 years old, operating a white Infiniti SUV. Tr. at 32-33. Valiette stated that Frequent Caller 1 said that he or she had met D.L. an hour before the interview and purchased heroin from D.L. Tr. at 32-33. Frequent Caller 1 added that he or she normally met D.L. at the intersection of Elliot Street and Sylvan Avenue. Tr. at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Valiette testified that he interviewed another individual (\"Frequent Caller 2\"), who stated that he or she met with a black male, known to them as D.L., who held the phone with the number at issue in the investigation. Tr. at 33. Detective Valiette added that Frequent Caller 2 stated he or she had recently purchased heroin from D.L. with the stamp \"Griselda Blanco\" on it. Tr. at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Conley argues that Detective Valiette's statements were inconsistent with his report. Specifically, Conley contends that the report contains no \"meaningful description\" of the black male described.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. to Suppress (\"Suppl. Mem. in Supp.\") (Doc. No. 76-1) at 12-13. Conley adds that the report makes no note of a meeting between Frequent Caller 1 and D.L. that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Conley argues that Detective\n   Valiette's report contains \"even less information\" as to Frequent Caller 2, and that the report was less detailed than Detective Valiette's testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While there are inconsistencies between Detective Valiette's report and his testimony before this court, the discrepancies are minor. The report states that Frequent Caller 1 described the user of the phone number at issue as a drug dealer, and as \"a black male in his mid to early thirties,\" known to Frequent Caller 1 as D.L., who operates a white Infinity SUV to conduct his transactions at the intersection of Sylvan Avenue and Elliot Street.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The report states that Frequent Caller 2 identified the user of the phone number at issue as a black male who went by the name D.L.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The report states that Frequent Caller 2 met D.L. on Elliot Street in New Haven, and that Frequent Caller 2 had recently purchased heroin stamped \"Griselda Blanca\" from D.L.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The report does not mention an earlier meeting between Frequent Caller 1 and D.L. However, the remaining information in the report largely tracks Detective Valiette's testimony at the hearing. After comparing Detective Valiette's testimony at the hearing with his written report, the court finds that these minor inconsistencies did not undermine Detective Valiette's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ultimately, the court finds the Government's four witnesses to be credible, and credits their testimony. While Conley noted minor inconsistencies in testimony, he did not succeed in impeaching any of the four witnesses such that the court would discredit their testimony. The court finds no reason to discredit the witnesses based on their testimony and demeanor in court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court finds the following facts. On May 5, 2017, Detective Valiette responded to a scene where a suspected overdose victim, Christina Pace, was found deceased at the top of a stairway with a syringe in one hand. On a table nearby, Detective Valiette found,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , three unused heroin bags stamped \"Griselda Blanco,\" which tested positive for fentanyl, a number of used heroin bags, and a cell phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Valiette seized the cell phone and searched it for evidence to identify the individual who sold the heroin to Ms. Pace. Detective Valiette observed a number of text messages over several days to the same phone number (203-390-9948). He believed the messages were arrangements for drug transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 8-21. The text messages included (1) references to requests for \"two whole\" or \"one whole,\" which Detective Valiette understood, based on his experience, to refer to bundles of heroin; (2) quantities of 140 and 130, which Detective Valiette understood, based on his experience, to reflect the market price for two bundles of heroin; and (3) Elliot Street, which Detective Valiette understood in context to refer to the location of the transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Exs. 8-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Detective Valiette then sought assistance from the DEA to access the toll records for the phone number, 203-390-9948 (hereinafter \"Targeted Phone\"). The DEA used a program to generate a call frequency list from the toll records, identifying phone numbers that frequently called the Targeted Phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 22. Detective Valiette ran the numbers on the call frequency list through Facebook in an effort to determine the identities of the operators of any of the phones that frequently called the Targeted Phone. On May 17, 2017, Detective Valiette learned the identities of two of the frequent callers\n   on the list and interviewed those individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Frequent Caller 1 stated that he or she had been in contact with the owner of the Targeted Phone for the purpose of purchasing heroin from that individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 23 \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defense Ex. 5. Frequent Caller 1 described the operator of the Targeted Phone ass \"a black male, approximately 35 years old, who used the name D.L.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Frequent Caller 1 stated that he or she believed D.L. resided on Sylvan Avenue, near the intersection of Elliot Street, and he drove a white Infiniti SUV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Frequent Caller 1 then went with police to the intersection of Sylvan Avenue and Elliot Street and identified the location where D.L. frequently parked his white Infiniti SUV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The second individual, Frequent Caller 2, stated that he or she frequently purchased heroin from the operator of the Targeted Phone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; Defense Ex. 6. Frequent Caller 2 described the operator of the Targeted Phone as a black male who used the name D.L.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Neither Frequent Caller 1 nor Frequent Caller 2 had worked with the police as an informant in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on the information received from Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2, Detective Valiette set up surveillance at the location of Elliot Street and Sylvan Avenue on May 17, 2017. The surveillance team consisted of Detective Valiette and one other officer in one surveillance vehicle. Detective Valiette observed a black male enter a white Infiniti SUV near the intersection and drive away. While following the white Infiniti SUV, Detective Valiette observed this vehicle stop at a traffic light in a non-turning lane, then cut off another vehicle to make a right turn. Detective Valiette testified that he believed someone from the area who knew where they were going would not normally make a maneuver like that. The surveillance vehicle then followed the white Infiniti SUV onto the highway and the officers observed the SUV cross four lanes of traffic from the leftmost lane to make an exit. Detective Valiette testified that, based on his experience, he believed that the maneuver was an attempt to elude law enforcement. Detective Valiette terminated surveillance because he believed more than one vehicle would be needed to conduct surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 18, 2017, at 6:30 AM, officers from the New Haven Police Department and the DEA, including Officer Wright and Special Agent Mofenson, joined Detective Valiette to conduct surveillance at the same location on Elliot Street and Sylvan Avenue. They observed the SUV parked on Elliot Street facing Sylvan Avenue. A green Subaru pulled up at the corner in front of the SUV. Officer Wright observed a black male, later identified as Conley but unknown to the officers at the time, approach the green Subaru. Without engaging in conversation with the driver of the Subaru, Conley approached the driver's side window, reached his hand in, and then retreated from the vehicle. The green Subaru then pulled away. Officer Wright testified that the transaction took less than 25 seconds and that he believed the transaction was consistent with a hand-to-hand drug transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Conley then entered the white Infiniti SUV, drove up Elliot Street, and took a right on Sylvan Avenue. A number of the surveillance vehicles, including Officer Wright's vehicle, followed the SUV. Officer Wright observed the SUV make several square turns, looping around the block several times. Officer Wright testified that, based on his experience, the maneuvers were consistent with measures to evade law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The officers in the surveillance team issued a request to conduct a motor vehicle stop on the white Infiniti SUV. In two\n   separate marked patrol cars, Officer Agosto, Officer in Training Louis Rivera, and Detective Fred Salmeron of the New Haven Police Department responded to the request and stopped the SUV. The officers were not aware of the reason for the stop or the identity of the driver. Detective Salmeron approached the vehicle from the driver's side and spoke with Conley. Officer Agosto approached from the passenger side and observed Conley lean over and reach his right arm toward the glove compartment. He testified that, when Conley saw him, Conley returned to a seated position before again sliding over as if reaching for something.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After observing these motions, Officer Agosto walked to the driver's side of the vehicle, and either he or Detective Salmeron asked Conley to step out of the vehicle. Conley exited the vehicle without resisting. The officers did not use force to get him out of the vehicle. Officer Agosto testified that he would have remembered if he or Detective Salmeron had used force because he would have had to file a report documenting the use of force and had not had to do so in this case. The officers patted Conley down for weapons and found none. Officer Agosto, Detective Salmeron, and Officer in Training Rivera then escorted Conley to the rear of the vehicle away from the glove compartment. At the rear of the vehicle, they waited for the other units to arrive. The officers did not tell Conley that he was under arrest at the time, nor did they use handcuffs or draw their weapons. In addition to Officer Agosto's testimony, Detective Valiette, Officer Wright, and Special Agent Mofenson all testified that, when they arrived on the scene, they observed that Conley was not in handcuffs and that no officers had their weapons drawn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Special Agent Mofenson and Officer Wright arrived at the scene of the stopped vehicle approximately 30 seconds after Conley was escorted to the rear of the vehicle. Officer Wright observed through the driver's side window that three cell phones were located inside the door pocket on the driver's side. He informed Special Agent Mofenson, who then dialed the telephone number of the Targeted Phone. The officers then heard a phone ringing inside the vehicle. Officer Wright seized the three cell phones: the phone that was ringing, an Alcatel phone (\"Cell Phone 1\"); an Apple iPhone (\"Cell Phone 2\"); and a Kyocera cell phone (\"Cell Phone 3\"). Cell Phone 1 and Cell Phone 3 were both Android \"smart phones.\" Gov't Post Hr'g Mem. (Doc. No. 89) at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Special Agent Mofenson then directed that Conley be placed under arrest. Conley was placed in handcuffs and transported to the New Haven Police Department. Since his arrest, Conley has been incarcerated at Wyatt Detention Facility, which does not permit its inmates to possess cell phones. Special Agent Mofenson testified that he would have been the person to process a request for return of the cell phones, if any had been made, but that he did not receive any requests, from Conley or anyone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Following Conley's arrest, Special Agent Mofenson and Detective Valiette returned to the DEA office to process evidence and paperwork. Special Agent Mofenson authored an affidavit for a criminal complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 23. Detective Valiette made a second call to the Targeted Phone and observed Cell Phone 1 ringing with his own phone number visible on the screen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Special Agent Mofenson testified that, between May and June 2017, he continued to work on the case by processing paperwork and evidence, writing reports, and interviewing witnesses. He interviewed two other witnesses, including Robert Stawarz, the owner of the white Infiniti SUV. He also was the case agent on 12 to 15\n   other overdose cases and was dealing with personal medical issues that had required three surgeries that year. He testified that he missed a total of 6-8 weeks of work because of the surgeries, and that the resulting backlog and his diminished health made his workload more challenging to complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On June 12, 2017, Special Agent Mofenson submitted three search warrant applications for Cell Phones 1, 2, and 3; Magistrate Judge Margolis signed the warrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Suppress, Ex. C (\"June Warrants\"), at 56-90. A Task Force Officer (\"TFO\"), Michael Chaves, extracted the data from Cell Phone 3 on or about June 22, 2017, pursuant to the June Warrants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Govt.'s Post Hr'g Mem. at 2. TFO Chaves provided the extracted data from Cell Phone 3 to Special Agent Mofenson, who conducted a search of the data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. TFO Chaves determined that the process to extract data from Cell Phone 1 might result in destruction of the cell phone, so he did not extract data pursuant to the June Warrants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On August 17, 2017, \"believing that the June 12, 2017 warrants ... may have expired\" and after the Government conferred with defense counsel, Special Agent Mofenson submitted a new application for a search warrant as to Cell Phone 1; Magistrate Judge Margolis signed the warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 (\"August Warrant\"). TFO Chaves extracted data from Cell Phone 1, pursuant to the August Warrant, on or about August 21, 2017. Gov't.'s Post Hr'g Mem. at 4. TFO Chaves provided the extracted data from Cell Phone 1 to Special Agent Mofenson, who conducted a search of the data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The contents of Cell Phone 2, the Apple iPhone, were not \"dumped\" because the technology to do so did not exist at the time. As of the date of the hearing, the search warrant had not yet been executed on Cell Phone 2. Evidence obtained from Cell Phones 1 and 3 included text messages that the Government believes refer to drug transactions, contact information and names, and records of telephone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Conley argues that the Government violated his Fourth Amendment rights with respect to the stop of his vehicle, his arrest, the seizure and search of each of the three cell phones, and two searches of his apartment. He seeks to suppress all of the evidence obtained from the vehicle stop, the cell phones, and the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Government represented at the evidentiary hearing that it does not intend to use the evidence seized from Conley's residence at trial. Therefore, to the extent that the Motion to Suppress addresses the searches of Conley's residence, based on the Government's representation, the Motion is denied as moot. The court addresses the remaining issues below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Stop of Conley's Vehicle\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On May 18, 2017, officers pulled Conley over while he was driving the white Infiniti SUV. Conley argues that he had a privacy interest in the vehicle, even though it was borrowed, because the vehicle's owner granted him permission to operate it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Suppress at 11-13. He argues that the officers lacked reasonable suspicion or probable cause\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to stop his vehicle because (1) the information obtained from Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2 were not specific enough to\n   identify him; (2) his interaction with the Subaru and turns made while driving were not suspicious; (3) he did not violate any traffic laws; and, (4) the officers who conducted the stop did not know the reason for the stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Suppl. Mem. in Supp. at 10-11. The Government does not dispute whether Conley had a privacy interest in the car, but argues that they had reasonable suspicion to stop the car based on facts known to them at the time of the stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Suppress (\"Mem. in Opp.\") (Doc. No. 67) at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Police may conduct a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle based on \"reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may be afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Arvizu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p273\">\n    534 U.S. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p273\">\n    122 S.Ct. 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p273\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

Ultimately, the court's inquiry is whether there are \"specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts ... provide detaining officers with a particularized and objective basis for suspecting wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115405\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/743/322/#p332\">\n    743 F.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this case, the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop Conley's vehicle. The information provided by Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2 gave officers reason to believe that the driver of the white Infiniti SUV was involved in selling drugs related to the overdose death of Christina Pace. Neither Frequent Caller 1 nor Frequent Caller 2 were cooperating witnesses or informants with a history of working with the police. Nonetheless, considering the totality of the circumstances, the court finds that the information provided by Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2 are sufficiently reliable to establish reasonable suspicion to stop the white Infiniti SUV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phaneuf v.

On the evening of May 17, 2017, Detective Valiette observed the operator of the white Infiniti SUV engage in manuevers that he believed, based on his experience, to be attempts to evade law enforcement. On the morning of May 18, 2017, Officer Wright observed the SUV make several square turns around the block, which he similarly believed were counter surveillance measures. Officer Wright observed Conley approach the driver's side of a green Subaru, reach his arm in without conversation, and quickly retreat while the Subaru drove away. He testified that, based on his experience, he believed the activity to be consistent with a hand-to-hand drug transaction. Officer Wright did not see drugs pass between Conley and the driver of the vehicle. However, the standard for an investigatory stop of a vehicle requires reasonable suspicion, not probable cause or a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arvizu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p273\">\n    534 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108176\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/266/#p273\">\n    122 S.Ct. 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In determining whether the means were too intrusive, the Second Circuit has considered a number of factors, including (1) the amount of force used by police; (2) the need for such force; (3) the extent to which the individual's freedom was restrained; (4) the number of agents involved; (5) whether the target of the stop was suspected of being armed; (6) the duration of the stop; and (7) the physical treatment of the suspect, including whether or not handcuffs were used.\n   <em>\n    Perea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"661990\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/633/#p644\">\n    986 F.2d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this case, Conley did not resist the order to exit the vehicle. The officers did not use force to get Conley to exit the vehicle. Nor did they use force when escorting Conley to the rear of the vehicle or while waiting at the rear of the vehicle for other units to arrive. Officer Agosto testified that he observed Conley appear to be reaching for something in the glove compartment; thus, his reason for requesting\n   Conley to exit the vehicle was officer safety. At the time officers took Conley to the rear of the vehicle, three officers were present at the scene. More officers arrived afterwards, including Special Agent Mofenson, Officer Wright, and Detective Valiette. The testimony indicates that eventually there were at least three, possibly more, police vehicles, both marked and unmarked, at the stop. Conley was \"secured\" at the rear of the vehicle by the presence of the three officers watching him. The officers testified that they neither drew their weapons nor placed Conley in handcuffs when he was taken to the rear of the vehicle. Officers handcuffed Conley only after Special Agent Mofenson later ordered Conley arrested. Finally, the investigatory stop in this case was very brief. Special Agent Mofenson and Officer Wright arrived within a minute after of Conley being escorted to the rear of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Considering these factors, the court concludes that the stop did not become an arrest when Conley was held at the rear of the vehicle. \"[A] police officer may as a matter of course order the driver of a lawfully stopped car to exit his vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

While there is little doubt that as the number of armed officers at a stop increases, so too does the likelihood that an investigative stop will develop into an arrest, the mere presence of more than one officer during an investigatory stop is not sufficient to reach such a conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, the question at the time of the seizure is whether the officers had probable cause to believe that the cell phones contained evidence of a crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court analyzes Cell Phone 1 separately from Cell Phone 3. As to Cell Phone 1, there were sufficient facts for officers to believe that Cell Phone 1, which is the Targeted Phone, was involved in arranging drug transactions with the deceased overdose victim. After Special Agent Mofenson dialed the Targeted Phone, the officers immediately heard ringing inside the car, and Officer Wright observed that Cell Phone 1 was the phone that was ringing. The immediate, audible ringing in response to Special Agent Mofenson's call would be sufficient for a reasonable officer to believe that Cell Phone 1 was the phone used to arrange drug transactions with the victim.

Although the officers did not have information indicating that Cell Phone 3 was used in drug trafficking, they did have information that Cell Phone 1 was used in drug trafficking, and Cell Phone 3 was found in the same car\n   door pocket as Cell Phone 1. Additionally, officers found the cell phones in the door next to Conley, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Moreover, Conley fit the description of the man from whom Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2 claim to have purchased drugs, was driving a vehicle that matched the description Frequent Caller 1 and Frequent Caller 2 gave to investigators, and was on the street the Callers claimed the drug dealer, D.L., frequented. Finally, officers had observed Conley making evasive maneuvers in the vehicle and interacting with the green Subaru in a manner consistent with a hand-to-hand drug transaction. Considering all of these facts together, the court concludes that officers had probable cause to believe that Cell Phone 3, like Cell Phone 1, contained evidence of the crime of drug trafficking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Motion to Suppress is denied as to Cell Phone 3 on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Searches of Cell Phones 1, and 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On June 12, 2017, Special Agent Mofenson sought and obtained from Magistrate Judge Margolis a search warrant to search the contents of Cell Phones 1, 2, and 3.

First, Conley argues that Special Agent Mofenson unreasonably delayed in seeking the warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Suppress at 21-22; Suppl. Mot. to Suppress at 7-8.

While Conley's expectation of privacy in a legitimately borrowed vehicle is sufficient to challenge the search of the vehicle, it is not, without more, adequate for him to challenge the separate search warrants for the cell phones seized from that vehicle pursuant to the automobile exception. However, Conley submitted an affidavit swearing to his ownership of the cell phones seized on May 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p133\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Attach.

Special Agent Mofenson delayed for 25 days, from May 18, 2017 to June 12, 2017, in seeking the first search warrant. He delayed a further 66 days in seeking the August Warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't.'s Post Hr'g Mem. at 3.

Based on the circumstances in this case, the court finds that the delay in seeking the June Warrants was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The additional 66-day delay in seeking the August Warrant, however, is harder for the Government to explain. The Government stated in its Post Hearing Memorandum that Special Agent Mofenson sought the August Warrant because he believed the June Warrant might have expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't.'s Post Hr'g Mem. at 3. The Government further argued in its Reply to the Defendant's Reply to the Government's Post-Hearing Memorandum (\"Gov't's Reply to Def.'s Reply\") (Doc. No. 101) that the delay was reasonable because \"when it was determined that extraction of data from [Cell Phone 1] would likely destroy the device, the Government invited defense counsel to observe the extraction process.\" Gov't Reply to Def.

The Government argued that Conley failed to explain \"how attempting to accommodate defense counsel ... should be weighed against the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204708063\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the Government failed to provide an adequate explanation of how inviting defense counsel to observe an extraction of data, standing alone, accounts for the Government's\n   <em>\n    two-month delay\n   </em>\n   in seeking a search warrant. As to the August Warrant, the court therefore concludes that the length of deprivation weighs in Conley's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   However, the remaining factors weigh in the Government's favor. In at least two cases, taking into account the preceding factors, courts have held that deprivation of a cell phone or a laptop has little or no effect on an individual's liberty interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howe\n   </em>\n   , 545 Fed.

In his Affidavit, Agent Mofenson also affirmed that, based on his experience, data on a cell phone, including contacts and text messages, internet browsing history, images and video, as well as location data, can contain evidence of narcotics distribution and that examining these categories of data could uncover evidence of who used a device, as well as evidence of co-conspirators the user of the device contacted. Because evidence of ownership and use of the device, as well as information regarding the identity of coconspirators could reasonably be found in a broad range of data stored on a cell phone, the court concludes that the Magistrate Judge had a substantial basis upon which to find probable cause for the search of Cell Phone 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The strongest basis for a finding of probable cause as to Cell Phone 1 was that the phone rang when Special Agent Mofenson dialed the cell phone number both Frequent Callers had identified as the one used by the drug dealer D.L.

C; Gov't Post Hr'g Mem. Ex. 2. Moreover, the Government has represented to this court through its filings, and Agent Mofenson has sworn in his statements submitted to this court, that his searches of the devices were \"limited to the crimes under investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Post Hr'g Mem. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   While the Government's conduct in this case is problematic, the court concludes that the errors were due to \"isolated negligence,\" as opposed to systemic or deliberate failures to adhere to the Fourth Amendment's requirements.

The standard for a lawful seizure, however, is not certainty, but probable cause. Therefore, the officers did not need to know for \"certain\" that Cell Phones 2 and 3 contained evidence of a crime.
