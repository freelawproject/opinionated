Plaintiff Andrew Tyler, (\"Tyler\"), initiated this action against his former employer, Defendant JP Operations, LLC d/b/a Jack's Pizza, Inc., (\"Jack's\"), for unpaid wages and the failure to pay minimum wage for hours worked while working as a pizza delivery driver. On October 24, 2017, Jack's filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing No. 62), and on December 13, 2017, Tyler filed his Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing No. 70). For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    grants in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denies in part\n   </strong>\n   Jack's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    grants in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denies in part\n   </strong>\n   Tyler's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises out of a wage dispute involving Tyler's time working for Jack's as a part-time pizza delivery driver. JP Operations, LLC operates Jack's, a chain of pizza stores in central Indiana. (Filing No. 64-3.) Tyler worked primarily at the store located at 8025 Pendleton Pike, Lawrence, Indiana 46226 (the \"Pendleton Pike store\") from approximately August 6 to December 23, 2013, and was subsequently transferred to the store located at 5650 East 86\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46240 (the \"Castleton store\"), where he worked from January 9 to May 10, 2014. (Filing No. 64-1 at 21; Filing No. 64-3 at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both stores were open 4:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m., Sunday through Thursday. On Friday and Saturday, the business hours for the Pendleton Pike store was 4:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m., and the Castleton store hours were from 4:00 p.m. until 12:00 a.m. (Filing No. 64-3 at 2). The Pendleton Pike store used a computer-based point-of-sale system (\"POS\") to enter customer order details including the delivery address and assigned pizza delivery driver. (Filing No. 64-14 at 31.) Because the Castleton store did not have a POS system, all orders were recorded on paper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tyler's base rate of pay was $7.25 per hour. (Filing No. 64-3 at 3.) Tyler's supervisor, Ryan Johnson (\"Johnson\"), recorded Tyler's clock-in and clock-out times while Tyler was employed at the Pendleton Pike store. (Filing No. 64-1 at 38.) For several shifts, Tyler initialed completed timesheets, prepared by Johnson, verifying that the timesheet was accurate. (Filing No. 64-1 at 82-84.) Tyler did not keep track of his own log of hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. The Castleton store had actual timesheets that Tyler initialed each and every shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Tyler testified that he closed the Pendleton Pike store almost every shift he worked, which caused him and Johnson (closing manager) to leave the store close to midnight or shortly thereafter at the end of Tyler's shifts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. The closing duties included: washing dishes, taking out the trash, sweeping and mopping the floor, and folding boxes if needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. Tyler testified that it would take an hour or more to perform all of the closing tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A sample of Tyler's clock out times for\n   certain dates where he alleges that he was not paid for all of his hours is included below:\n  </p>\n  <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n   a. Tuesday 8-6-13 11:30 p.m. b. Tuesday 8-27-13 11:35 p.m. c. Monday 9-9-13 11:10 p.m. d. Monday 9-16-13 11:35 p.m. e. Wednesday 9-18-13 11:30 p.m. f. Monday 9-23-13 11:25 p.m. g.

Wednesday 10-30-13 11:15 p.m. n. Tuesday 11-5-13 11:00 p.m.\n  </opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (Filing No. 71 at 4-5). Most of Tyler's closing shifts were worked with Johnson. On such days Johnson's timesheets reflect the same clock-out times as Tyler's. (Filing No. 64-3 at 3.) Tyler's timesheets for both the Pendleton Pike store and Castleton store reflect that 696.16 hours were recorded and paid to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to Tyler's base hourly rate, he also received reimbursements for driving expenses (\"Driver's Fees\") which was calculated based on the following formula: \"for each order a driver delivered, the driver received $1.25 + 3% of the order total (pre-tax)\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Jack's maintained a policy that it would not deliver an order if the order total was less than $15.00, thus based on the calculation ($1.25 + [0.03 * $15.00] ), a driver would receive at least $1.70 on each order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The store manager on shift calculated the Driver's Fee reimbursements at the end of each shift. The Pendleton Pike store manager used the POS system, which printed out an account report that showed the total order amount for each driver, to calculate and pay Driver's Fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42. Because the Castleton store did not have a POS system, the store\n   manager used a paper form called a Driver Checkout sheet to calculate Driver's Fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61. As an example, on August 21, 2013, Tyler delivered three orders totaling $103.23, and based on the Driver's Fee calculation he received $6.59 in Driver's Fees. (Filing No. 64-3 at 5.) Tyler earned a total of $1,520.97 in Driver's Fees during his employment at both store locations. The parties disagree on the total mileage driven by Tyler as a delivery driver, however the disagreement is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   as it is a seventy mile difference. Tyler's calculation for total mileage, for the Pendleton Pike store, is 2,416.4 miles derived from Tyler's counsel using Mapquest.com and customer's addresses round-trip miles, while Jack's figure is approximately 2,346.40 derived from the POS system. (Filing No. 70-2 at 1; Filing No. 64-3 at 4.) It is undisputed that Tyler was paid $866.17 total in Driver's Fees from the Pendleton Pike store; however, based on the different total mileage calculations, Tyler alleges Jack's mileage rate actually paid to him equals $0.36 per mile, while Jack's calculation equals $0.37 per mile. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 71 at 6; Filing No. 63 at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is only appropriate by the terms of Rule 56 where there exists \"no genuine issue as to any material facts and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

I drove my truck, the 2001 Mazda Tribute, for both my jobs at Central Insulation and Jack's.\" (Filing No. 70-1 at 1). Jack's requests that this Court disregard this portion of the Affidavit, as it improperly contradicts Tyler's prior deposition testimony that he drove different cars for both jobs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 64-1 at 22-23; Filing No. 74 at 6.) The Court agrees on this point. \"It is a well-settled rule of this Court that a plaintiff cannot create an issue of material fact merely by manufacturing a conflict in his own testimony by submitting an affidavit that contradicts an earlier deposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Piscione v. Ernst &amp; Young, L.L.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11636307\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/527/#p532\">\n    171 F.3d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532 (7th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). Because Tyler's expert report relies on a vehicle expense calculation based on Tyler driving the same car to both jobs, Jack's also contends that this proves that the expert report is unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Filing No. 74 at 9.) Tyler responds that the Affidavit was submitted to clarify the mistaken testimony and the relevant vehicle (or vehicles) used for both jobs goes to the calculation of cost per mile in arriving at a figure, for the expert report calculation, rather than on an issue of material fact. (Filing No. 80 at 7.) (\"If the expert report was given false information, then this would greatly increase the cost per mile for Mr. Tyler to deliver pizza for Jack's and the potential liability of Jack's.\") Thus, Tyler contends that the clarification is not an attempt to manufacture a conflict (or create a disputed issue of material fact) and Jack's contention that the testimony should be struck is unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court will disregard Tyler's Affidavit regarding Tyler driving different vehicles to his two jobs. Tyler does not allege that he was confused or tricked by opposing counsel when asked which vehicle he drove to either job during the initial deposition. However, the Court will not find Tyler's expert report unreliable solely on the basis of this. In any event, Tyler alleges that the expert report was based on the correct information. Moreover, even if the expert report relied on a faulty calculation, Tyler has also proposed the Internal Revenue Service mileage rate as the rate that he should have been reimbursed at.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Tyler's Expert Report\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Tyler's expert report was prepared by CJ &amp; E Associates, LLC, a certified public accounting (\"CPA\") firm. Jack's objects to the use of Tyler's Expert Report on the bases that it was untimely disclosed and is inadmissible due to unreliability. (Filing No. 74 at 4.) The Court will address each contention in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jack's contends that Tyler's expert report was not served at least 90 days prior to the dispositive motion deadline. (Filing No. 74 at 2.) Tyler responds that the reason that the expert report could not be served within the 90 day timeframe is due to Jack's failure to timely produce all records from its POS system which is relevant to Tyler's minimum wage claim. (Filing No. 80 at 3.) On July 21, 2017, Jack's served the documents relating to Tyler's delivery locations from the POS system at the Pendleton Pike store. (Filing No. 80-1 at 2.) Tyler persuasively argues that based upon receiving the delivery locations from the POS data, he could now engage an expert to calculate his costs per mile for making deliveries armed with the POS data. (Filing No. 80 at 4.) In any event, on August 16, 2017, Tyler filed a Motion to Extend Expert Report Deadline to which Jack's filed a brief in opposition. (Filing No. 49; Filing No. 50.) Magistrate Judge\n   Matthew Brookman granted the extension. Contained in Tyler's Motion to Extend Expert Report Deadline, Tyler notified Jack's that he intended to use an expert in this matter to calculate his vehicle cost per mile driven. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 49 at 1.) Tyler contends that his Motion to Extend Expert Report Deadline, including the notice that he intended to use an expert, occurred within the first 26 days after receiving the POS documentation from Jack's, a reasonable amount of time. (Filing No. 80 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because the timing of Jack's disclosures affected the relevant information that Tyler needed to hire an expert for the underlying calculations and Tyler's extensions were granted, the Court declines to strike the expert report on the basis of timeliness. A party must make an expert disclosure at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 (a)(2)(D). \"Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Whether to admit expert testimony rests within the discretion of the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Although, she could not identify with specificity the hours or days for which she worked uncompensated overtime, she introduced evidence, including personal observations, that management subsequently altered her time records (and that of others) prior to the issuance of paychecks.\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n    534 F.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, while employed, the plaintiff pointed out to management that other employees' checks were short, and was given the response that they would not be paid. The Seventh Circuit explicitly held that this evidence was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the accuracy of the records kept by the employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n    at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The similarity that Tyler attempts to draw with the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   case, concerns the additional evidence that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   submitted that her employer's time records could not have been accurate given the time it would have taken her to perform closing duties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on its facts. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   testified that she was the only person with managerial duties who could open and close the store, yet not only did the employer's time records not account for the time it took to close the store, but the records also had her clocking out before the store would have even closed. Given that the plaintiff was the only one who could close the store, the fact that the employer's time records had her clocking out before the store closed cast doubt on the accuracy and adequacy of the employer's time records under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), and thus the Seventh Circuit held under the just and reasonable inference standard that the records were inaccurate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065979\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/593/\">\n    at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jack's persuasively argues that Tyler's unpaid wage claim is flatly refuted by the evidence. (Filing No. 74 at 9.) The present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   on a number of grounds. Although Tyler alleges that he performed closing duties, he was not tasked with being the only person that could close the store. In this case, it is undisputed that Johnson was the store closing manager for the closing shifts in\n   which Tyler alleges he was not paid for all of his hours. (Filing No. 64-1 at 35.) During Tyler's deposition, Jack's counsel went over a series of identical clock-out times by date for Tyler and Johnson, and Tyler testified that the times were identical and that he had no reason to believe Johnson would inaccurately report his own time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 64-1 at 78-93.) Jack's argues (and Tyler does not dispute) that for the twenty-three shifts cited by Tyler, the time sheets show Johnson clocking out at the same time. (Filing No. 74 at 16.) Moreover, Tyler also testified that there were slow times that he would start closing duties before the store officially closed. (Filing No. 64-1 at 42.) Jack's contends that this testimony evidences that Tyler did not necessarily have to be at the store for an hour after the store closed,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   midnight, because Tyler admitted that he sometimes performed the same closing tasks prior to 11:00 p.m. (Filing No. 74 at 15.) Tyler's Castleton store clock-out times, which Tyler admits are accurate, reveal similar clock-out times. (Filing No. 64-4; Filing No. 64-5.) The Castleton store also closed at 11:00 p.m. on weekdays and Tyler had the same position and job duties. This is not a case, such as\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , where the employer's timekeeping records were lacking in several respects, in addition to the plaintiff in that case personally observing her employer's alteration of timekeeping records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court agrees with Jack's that Tyler's unpaid wages claim is flatly refuted by the hard evidence. Tyler fails to create a just and reasonable inference that he was not paid all of his hours in closing the Pendleton Pike store or that Jack's timekeeping records are inaccurate. Thus, the burden does not shift to Jack's as Tyler has failed to clear the initial hurdle.\n   <em>\n    Turner v. The Saloon, Ltd.,\n   </em>\n   considered facts in which the employer submitted evidence of co-workers that worked the same shift to prove its timekeeping records were accurate as to the plaintiff employee.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215788\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/679/\">\n    595 F.3d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2010) (holding plaintiff's mere assertions that employer's records were inaccurate insufficient to create a jury issue nor raise a just and reasonable inference that the plaintiff was not paid all wages). In any event, largely pointing to Tyler's own testimony, Jack's has negated the inference raised by Tyler that the clock-out times recorded on his timesheet do not (and could not) reflect the time necessary for his closing duties. Accordingly, summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   in favor of Jack's on Tyler's unpaid wages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Failure to Pay Minimum Wage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Jack's also moves for summary judgment on Tyler's failure to pay at least the minimum wage claim. (Filing No. 74 at 17.) Tyler contends that due to vehicle expenses (thereby reducing his base hourly rate), his rate of pay failed to meet the minimum wage. (Filing No. 71 at 16.) Minimum wages must be paid \"free and clear\" of job-related expenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20531.35\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The DOL has promulgated regulations addressing how employers should reimburse certain business-related expenses that an employer requires solely for the convenience of the employer.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.217\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Such payment is not compensation for services rendered by the employees during any hours worked in the workweek.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.217\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The regulations provide that vehicle expenses, measured by actual or reasonably approximate amounts expended by employee, while traveling on the employer's business, will not be regarded as part of the employee's regular rate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20778.217\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). \"In some cases it is necessary to determine the costs involved when employees use their cars on their employer's business in order to determine minimum wage compliance.\" U.S. DEP'T OF LABOR, FIELD OPERATIONS HAND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   BOOK , \u00a7\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20Cow.%2015\">\n    30 C 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 17, 2016).

There are three reimbursement mileage rates at issue in this case: 1) the rate paid by Jack's; 2) the rate provided by Tyler's expert; and 3) the Internal Revenue Services' (\"IRS\") standard business mileage rate. Because the mileage rate is the subject of both parties' cross-motions, at this juncture, the Court construes each party's proposed rate in a light favorable to the non-moving party on each motion. \"Plaintiffs' own expert offers an alternative rate that Plaintiffs contend is a reasonable, albeit conservative, approximation of their expenses for minimum wage purposes.

Although the calculation does not take into account miles driven, rather it is based on the customer's order total, Jack's explains that the miles driven can be derived from analyzing customer address data from the POS system. Nevertheless, this calculation appears appropriate in determining what Jack's actually paid on a reimbursed cost per mile basis ($.037 for the Pendleton Pike store) taking Tyler's total miles driven in hindsight. However, it does not resolve if this was a reasonable approximation of Tyler's overall vehicle expenses as a delivery driver, particularly with regards to the question of whether Tyler's wages fell below the minimum wage for any given week. As noted previously, Tyler's expert calculated a reasonable rate of actual expenses at $.0419 for the Pendleton Pike store, and the IRS standard business mileage rate for the relevant time period was $.0565 in 2013 and $.056 per mile in 2014.

Although from different district courts,\n   <em>\n    Zellagui\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Perrin\n   </em>\n   are both consistent with regards to analyzing the DOL Handbook's mandate regarding vehicle reimbursement expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, neither party has designated evidence of Tyler's actual driving expenses in support of the alternate proposed rates. Jack's faults Tyler for not submitting such evidence; however, the DOL mandate provides that the IRS standard business rate may be used in lieu of actual costs and associated recordkeeping, a duty arguably imposed on the employer.\n   <em>\n    Zellagui's\n   </em>\n   facts dealt with an employer that did not keep records of drivers' actual expenses, thus finding no alternative rate at which the employer reimbursed actual expenses, the court found the IRS standard business rate a reasonable approximation.\n   <em>\n    Zellagui\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129372\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/59/712/#p716\">\n    59 F.Supp.3d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\"Because Domino's failed to keep detailed contemporaneous records of its delivery drivers' actual expenses, Plaintiff and the Class members are entitled to be reimbursed at the IRS rate.\"). Jack's also misapprehends\n   <em>\n    Zellagui\n   </em>\n   in asserting that the case failed to cite or mention the applicable FLSA regulations. (Filing No. 74 at 19.) While\n   <em>\n    Zellagui\n   </em>\n   does not explicitly cite the FLSA regulations, the case clearly concerns and refers to a minimum wage violation under FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-51\">\n   Employers are required to reimburse hourly-paid employees who drive for work to cover the vehicle-related expenses they incur so their hourly wages do not fall below the minimum when those expenses are taken into account.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perrin v.

Pa. 2014) (analyzing and discussing the difference between the actual driver's expense mileage rate and the\n   IRS standard business mileage rate). The fact that the case explicitly focused on the rate to be used, under the DOL Handbook, to reasonably reimburse the tipped delivery drivers where such tips failed to account for their vehicle expenses,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   violation of minimum wage requirements, is a technicality that does not warrant discrediting of the case as Jack's suggests. Because the rate to be used is a material factual dispute, the Court finds the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Perrin\n   </em>\n   more appropriate, and leaves this issue to the jury. As noted previously, there are three possible mileage rates for a trier of fact to weigh and determine which provides a more reasonable approximation of Tyler's vehicle expenses. Regarding Tyler's contention that a material fact exists as to the total number of delivery miles at the Pendleton Pike store, the Court finds a seventy-mile difference from Tyler and Jack's proposed mileage numbers is not material, and summary judgment is not denied on this basis. Accordingly, summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to Jack's, and it is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   as to Tyler as well on his claim for failure to pay minimum wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Indiana Wage Claims Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Tyler moves for summary judgment on his Indiana Wage Claims Act (\"IWCA\") count contending that Jack's is statutorily liable for illegal deductions taken from his wages during his employment. (Filing No. 71 at 9.) Specifically, Jack's deducted $60.00 from Tyler's wages for accepting a counterfeit $100 dollar bill. The statute provides that an employee wage assignment to his or her employer is valid only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The majority of the wage disputes in this case surround the Pendleton Pike store.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Tyler does not allege any unpaid hours for the time period that he worked at the Castleton store.

Tyler did not sign a document agreeing to the deduction of money from his wages for accepting the counterfeit $100 dollar bill. (Filing No. 70-1 at 1.) Jack's has not disputed that it violated the IWCA, but requests that it be allowed to preserve and not waive a good faith defense regarding Tyler's requested entitlement to 200% in liquidated damages. (Filing No. 74 at 22.) (\"To the extent the Court finds that Plaintiff can establish a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case as to his wrongful deduction claim or unpaid wage claim, Jack's preserves and does not waive its good faith defense.\") As such, the $60.00 owed to Tyler is not disputed, and summary judgment is\n    <strong>\n     granted\n    </strong>\n    . Moreover, regarding liquidated damages, the IWCA provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    Every such person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, or association who shall fail to make payment of wages to any such employee as provided in section 1 of this chapter shall be liable to the employee for the amount of unpaid wages, and the amount may be recovered in any court having jurisdiction of a suit to recover the amount due to the employee. The court shall order as costs in the case a reasonable fee for the plaintiff's attorney and court costs. In addition, if the court in any such suit determines that the person, firm, corporation, limited liability company, or association that failed to pay the employee as provided in section 1 of this chapter was not acting in good faith, the court\n    shall order, as liquidated damages for the failure to pay wages, that the employee be paid an amount equal to two (2) times the amount of wages due the employee.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    I.C. \u00a7 22-2-5-2. Citing\n    <em>\n     Naugle v. Beech Grove City Schools\n    </em>\n    , Tyler contends that liquidated damages are mandatory once a violation is established.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326103\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/864/1058/#p1065\">\n     864 N.E.2d 1058\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1065-66 (Ind. 2007). Jack's correctly notes that a good faith exception was added to the statute in 2015, and the Indiana Court of Appeals has held that there is no bar to the exception applying retroactively.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

Ct. App. 2017). Although Jack's cites the correct (updated) version of the law regarding the good faith defense, Jack's does not provide its good faith defense leaving that for another day. (Filing No. 74 at 23.) (\"Thus, Jack's preserves and does not waive the good faith defense in the event of a finding of liability for Plaintiff's claims under the Indiana Wage Claims Act.\") The Court agrees with Tyler that Jack's had a duty to put on evidence, at this stage, of its alleged good faith defense as the party opposing summary judgment. (Filing No. 80 at 15.) Thus, the Court has no choice but to find that Jack's did not act in good faith in violating the IWCA when Jack's illegally deducted $60.00 from Tyler's wages.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Thacker v.
