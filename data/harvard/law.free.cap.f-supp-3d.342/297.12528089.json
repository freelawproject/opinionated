It creates, manufactures and distributes original jewelry products, which it actively markets and sells throughout the United States. (Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9.) Star is a Georgia corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia. It is a wholesale manufacturer and seller of jewelry products, which it sells and distributes throughout the United States and internationally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2, 10, 11.) Desai is the principal shareholder and chief executive officer of Star and has his principal place of business in Georgia. As such he is responsible for all of Star's important business decisions, including what artwork is used in connection with the products Star manufactures, markets and sells.

(Comp. \u00b6 12.) A substantial similarity exists between the Artworks and the Knock-off Products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Prior to Star marketing and selling the Knock-off Products, Adwar, as owner of the Artwork registered it with the United States Copyright office and said registration was in full force and effect at the time of the relevant\n   events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Star was not licensed or authorized to use any of the Artwork. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.)

Specific Jurisdiction Does Not Exist for Plaintiff's Reformulated Copyright Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In an apparent attempt to bring its copyright claim within the holding of\n   <em>\n    Penguin Group\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's opposition papers recast their copyright claim. Although not contained in its pleading, it is now alleged that Star \"retrieved the images\" of the two products at issue \"from Adwar's website and digitally downloaded them to its computer.\" It then \"reproduced the Artwork, derivative versions of the Artwork, and publicly displayed such images on its Facebook page which is linked to its website.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Mem. at 4.) In support of this position it is claimed that \"Adwar has been and continues to be damaged as a result of customers and potential customers of Adwar being encouraged by Star Gems to download Adwar's original jewelry designs from Adwar's catalog and Star Gems' system to produce unauthorized products using such works.\" (Adwar Declar. \u00b6 11.)

The location of the infringement in online cases is of little import inasmuch as the primary aim of the infringer is to make the works available to anyone with\n   access to an Internet connection, including computer users in New York. In addition, the injury to a New York copyright holder, while difficult to quantify, is not as remote as a purely indirect financial loss due to the broad spectrum of rights accorded by copyright law. The concurrence of these two elements - the function and nature of the Internet and the diverse ownership rights employed by copyright holders situated in New York - leads us to view this case as closer to\n   <em>\n    Sybron\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Fantis Foods\n   </em>\n   . Thus, we conclude that the alleged injury in this case occurred in New York for purposes of CPLR 302(a)(3)(ii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745238\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/295/\">\n    16 N.Y.3d at 306-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745238\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/295/\">\n    921 N.Y.S.2d 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3745238\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/16/295/\">\n    946 N.E.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Centennial Pictures, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n    729 F.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013), upheld the dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction under N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 301(a)(3) of a New York Plaintiff's copyright infringement action against two non-New York domiciliaries. These two individuals entered into an agreement to broadcast two films in Germany without first acquiring a license from the New York copyright holders. The\n   <em>\n    Troma\n   </em>\n   court began its analysis with the \"well-settled\" principle that \"residence or domicile of the injured party within New York is not a sufficient predicate for jurisdiction under section 302(a)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Continuing, the court found that\n   <em>\n    Penguin\n   </em>\n   was not controlling. First, it was possible to \"circumscribe\" the alleged injury to a particular location and therefore the case was \"more like the traditional commercial tort cases in which the place where plaintiff's business is lost or threatened exerts a significant gravitational influence on the jurisdictional analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n    at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the \"theory that out-of-state-infringement may harm the bundle of rights held\" by the New York copyright holder, it found \"it was just a theory\" and did not \"relieve[ ] intellectual property owners of the obligation in each case to allege facts demonstrating a non speculative and direct New York based injury to its intellectual property rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Applying the foregoing it concluded that plaintiff's allegations that the broadcasting of unlicensed copyrighted material in Germany caused only a generalized harm to its exclusive distribution right and was too speculative to support an injury suffered in New York within the meaning of CPLR 302(a)(3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699868\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/215/#p218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, there is no \"non-speculative and direct New York based injury\" to Plaintiff's intellectual property. The conclusory allegations as to the loss of its rights as a copyright holder are similar to the allegations rejected by the\n   <em>\n    Troma\n   </em>\n   court. That the images at issue were allegedly uploaded to the internet does not warrant a finding of in-state injury under\n   <em>\n    Penguin Group\n   </em>\n   as this case does not involve the type of digital piracy at issue therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeplay Music LLC v.

Indeed, there is nothing to support that the allegedly offending image on Star's facebook page is downloadable. To paraphrase the\n   <em>\n    Arbogast\n   </em>\n   court, \"to hold that the posting of copyrighted material to the Internet for any purpose, such a posting a copyrighted photo to Instagram or Facebook - would automatically cause an in-state injury to a New York copyright holder\" is a broad result not intended by the New York Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

The Request to Amend the Complaint is Denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the day that Defendants filed their reply, Plaintiff filed a letter requesting that it be allowed to amend its complaint, stating \"[w]hile Plaintiff believes in good faith that its declaration (including exhibits) ... combined with the current complaint raises the necessary allegations to demonstrate personal jurisdiction over Defendants, should the court believe that Plaintiff needs to supplement the facts in its complaint regarding such matter, Plaintiff is prepared to do so consistent with its declaration and its present pleadings.\" (DE 27.)
