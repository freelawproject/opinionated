Moreover, Defendant asserts that attorneys' fees incurred before May 2013 are too attenuated to be compensated and that Plaintiffs cannot recover costs expended for experts. Defendant asks the court to award no more than $110,311.54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After considering the parties' submissions and the relevant law, the court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney Fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court awards attorneys' fees and costs to Plaintiffs calculated at an hourly rate of 75% of the United States Attorney's Office Matrix, in the total amount of $140,238.97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Reasonableness of Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs seek an award of fees for the services of two lawyers: Douglas\n   Tyrka and Alana Hecht.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 2, ECF No. 30-2 [hereinafter Billing Itemization]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 3, ECF No. 30-3 [hereinafter Hecht Decl.]; Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 4, ECF No. 30-4 [hereinafter Tyrka Decl.]. Hecht is a solo practitioner and represented Plaintiffs in the administrative proceedings underlying this case. Hecht Decl. \u00b6 2. Tyrka is the sole owner of the law firm Tyrka &amp; Associates, LLC, and functions primarily as a solo practitioner. Tyrka Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 42. From his billing records, it appears that Tyrka represented Plaintiffs only in the federal court litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Itemization at 37-39. Plaintiffs seek an hourly rate of $483 for Hecht and $536 for Tyrka.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Itemization. These rates align with the rates for lawyers of comparable years of experience as reflected in the United States Attorney's Office (\"USAO\") Attorney's Fees Matrix for 2017-2018 (\"the USAO Matrix\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 12, ECF No. 30-12 [hereinafter USAO Matrix]; Def.'s Opp'n, Ex. 6, ECF No. 31-6, at 3. The USAO Matrix is a schedule of hourly billing rates for attorneys and paralegals/law clerks maintained by the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USAO Matrix at 1 n.1. The rates in the USAO Matrix \"were calculated from average hourly rates reported in 2011 survey data for the D.C. metropolitan area, which rates were adjusted for inflation with the Producer Price Index-Office of Lawyers (PPI-OL) index.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524481\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/213/#p216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 n.2.

Those cases address the exact same evidence and arguments offered in support of Plaintiffs' fees petition in this case. Plaintiffs here present the same affidavits, the same survey of rates charged by IDEA attorneys in the District of Columbia, the same USAO Matrix, and cite the same authorities-all in an effort to show that the USAO Matrix rates reflect the prevailing hourly rate for IDEA litigation.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 6-12,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot., Exs. 4-16, ECF Nos. 30-4-30-16,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524481\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/213/#p216\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 219-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the parties proffer the exact same evidence as the court considered in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   on the related question of whether 75% of the USAO Matrix rate is sufficient to attract competent counsel in IDEA cases.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 13-14,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524481\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/213/#p216\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 222-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This overlap is no coincidence.

The court need not repeat its findings in those cases here, but incorporates them by reference. For the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , and based on the same evidence presented in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   as in this case, the court finds the reasonable hourly rate for IDEA litigation in the District of Columbia is equivalent to 75% of the applicable USAO Matrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Current v. Historical Rates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties also disagree as to whether the rates awarded should reflect current or historical USAO Matrix rates. Plaintiffs contend that the court should apply current USAO Matrix rates to compensate for the delay in receiving their fee award. Pl.'s Mot. at 15. Defendant, on the other hand, maintains that the court\n   should apply historical rates corresponding to years in which counsel performed the work. Def.'s Opp'n at 22-25. If the court were to adopt Defendant's approach, it would apply the USAO\n   <em>\n    Laffey\n   </em>\n   Matrix for years 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, and the USAO Matrix for the years 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, each corresponding to the matrix year in which Tyrka and Hecht performed legal services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n, Ex. 6, ECF No. 31-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court thoroughly discussed this very issue in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   and held that current rates \"may be appropriate to account for delay in payment\" in IDEA cases.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524481\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/213/#p216\">\n    302 F.Supp.3d at 226-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying that principle here, the court finds that using the current USAO Matrix rates is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hecht was first retained in 2012, and Tyrka in 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Itemization. Six and four years, respectively, is a significant delay in receipt of payment. Accordingly, as it did in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , the court will use the current USAO Matrix rate to calculate Plaintiffs' fee award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rate for Fees-on-Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant recognizes that IDEA litigants are entitled to receive compensation for the hours expended pursuing an initial fee award,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172499\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/517/#p520\">\n    843 F.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but argues that the hourly rate for the time spent preparing Plaintiffs' fees petition (i.e., \"fees-on-fees\") should be awarded at 50% of the USAO Matrix rates. Def.'s Opp'n at 27-28. Once more, the court addressed this issue in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , and it rejected Defendant's position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the court will apply the same prevailing market rate-75% of the current USAO Matrix rate-to calculate the award for Plaintiffs' fees petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether Plaintiffs Obtained a More Favorable Judgment than Defendant's Final Offer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Though the court answered the first three contested issues in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , the remaining issues are unique to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The first of these new issues concerns whether Plaintiffs may recover fees and costs incurred after rejecting Defendant's\n   last settlement offer. Contending that Plaintiffs \"unreasonably rejected an offer of judgment,\" Defendant insists that any award cannot include fees and costs incurred after March 29, 2017, the date on which Defendant extended its last settlement offer to Plaintiffs. Def.'s Opp'n at 8, 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant's position is premised on a fee-capping mechanism contained in the IDEA itself. Section 1415(i)(3)(D) provides that \"[a]ttorneys' fees may not be awarded and related costs may not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding under this section for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent if ... the court or administrative hearing officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i)(III). The statute contains an exception to this rule.

Thus, when, as here, a plaintiff rejects an \"offer of settlement,\" courts should consider two inquiries in deciding whether to cap fees. \"First, the [court] must determine whether the relief awarded by the hearing officer was not more favorable to plaintiffs than [the District of Columbia Public Schools ('DCPS')'s] offer of settlement. If so, plaintiffs may not receive any award of fees or costs\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   their rejection of the offer of settlement was substantially justified.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

It included $14,000 for vocational programing to be used on or before December 30, 2018; 50 hours of mentoring not to exceed a total cost of $3,250; 60 hours of tutoring not to exceed a total cost of $3,900; and up to $1,500 for tools, books, and/or equipment necessary to participate in the vocational program chosen. Def.'s Opp'n at 11-12. By contrast, the final judgment entered by the court, at least on its face, would appear to be less favorable than the final settlement offer. The court awarded Plaintiffs a slightly higher amount-$15,000-for a vocational program of J.M.'s choice and an additional $1,000 in related costs, with no expiration date. Pl.'s Reply Regarding Fees &amp; Costs, ECF No. 33 [hereinafter Pl.'s Reply], at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 28. The final judgment, however, lacked specific funding for mentoring and tutoring. According to Defendant, the absence of these additional dollars renders the relief obtained by Plaintiffs through the court's judgment less favorable than the terms of settlement offered by the District, thereby requiring Plaintiffs' fees to be capped. Def.'s Opp'n at 11-12. Not surprisingly, Plaintiffs dispute this characterization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ultimately, the court need not decide whether the court-ordered relief was more or less favorable than Defendant's settlement offer. That is because the court holds that Plaintiffs' rejection of the offer falls within the statute's exception for recovery of fees where rejection of an offer was substantially justified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant's final offer did not include any compensation for attorneys' fees and\n   costs. Def.'s Opp'n, Ex. 1, ECF No. 31-1. Although the offer, if accepted, still would have putatively allowed Plaintiffs \"to apply for reasonable attorney's fees and costs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346647\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/532/#p541\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , it included no mechanism by which Plaintiffs could have gotten into court to make such an application. As Plaintiffs correctly point out, the Circuit has held that an IDEA plaintiff who obtains a result through settlement does not qualify as a \"prevailing party\" for purposes of the IDEA's fee-shifting provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alegria v.

Thus, in reality, Defendant's offer included no compensation for any attorneys' fees and costs incurred in this case. This obvious absence substantially justified rejecting Defendant's settlement offer. As Judge Jackson wrote in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   : \"Parents or guardians of children with special needs should not have to choose between a District offer of special education services for those children on the one hand, and continuing to pursue litigation so that their counsel who caused DCPS to make the offer in the first place may obtain some measure of reasonable compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346647\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/532/#p541\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the District's offer of no compensation for attorneys' fees and costs \"bore no rational relationship to the legal fees plaintiffs plainly had incurred at the time the offer was made, plaintiffs were substantially justified in rejecting it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346647\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/532/#p541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Def.'s Opp'n at 25-26. According to Defendant, Plaintiffs filed the administrative complaint upon which they secured relief on May 26, 2014, and therefore fees relating to the earlier, withdrawn complaint are not compensable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 25-26.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rooths\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dicks\n   </em>\n   , there is a reasonable connection between the work performed on the initial administrative complaint and the later successful one.

The court rejects Plaintiffs' effort to recover these costs for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, Plaintiffs' reliance on the District of Columbia statute comes too late. Plaintiffs raise the statute for the first time in their reply brief, and for that reason alone the request to recover expert fees under District of Columbia law is denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.W. v.

The statute makes expert fees recoverable only as to \"actions and proceedings initiated\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   July 1, 2016.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2038-2571.03\">\n    D.C.

Furthermore, the statute provides that \"[a]ny fees awarded under this paragraph shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2038-2571.03\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 38-2571.03(7)(B). Plaintiffs have not, however, provided any evidence about the prevailing rates for expert services of the kind provided by Ms. Holman in the District of Columbia. For these reasons, the court denies Plaintiffs' request for expert fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In summary, after considering the evidence submitted by the parties, the court rules as follows: (1) the fees award shall be calculated at 75% of the current USAO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Matrix rates for 2017- 2018; (2) the fees incurred in preparing the fees petition and reply likewise will be calculated at 75% of the current USAO Matrix rates; (3) Plaintiffs' fees will not be capped by virtue of rejecting Defendant's settlement offer; (4) Plaintiffs may recover for expenses incurred in preparing the initial, withdrawn administrative complaint; and (5) the cost of experts is not recoverable.
