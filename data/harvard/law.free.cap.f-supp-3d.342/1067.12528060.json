Simon, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, Innovation Law Law (\"Law Lab\") and Luis Javier Sanchez Gonzalez, by Xochitl Ramos Valencia as next friend (\"Sanchez Gonzalez\"), bring this action challenging certain actions taken by Defendants related to immigrant detainees held at the Federal Detention Center in Sheridan, Oregon (\"FDC Sheridan\"). Defendants are officials at the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\"), and the United States Department of Justice. On June 25, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for temporary restraining order (\"TRO\"), requiring Defendants to, among other things: (1) provide adequate attorney visitation and telephone access for immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan; (2) permit Law Lab to conduct \"know your rights\" (\"KYR\") training for detainees; and (3) not proceed with interviews, cases, or deportations until after a detainee has had a full and fair opportunity meaningfully to consult with an attorney and attend KYR training conducted by Law Lab. Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction, which Defendants oppose. A hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction was held on July 30, 2018. For the reasons stated below, Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A preliminary injunction is an \"extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction generally must show that: (1) the plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities tips in favor of the plaintiff; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the Ninth Circuit's earlier rule that the mere \"possibility\" of irreparable harm, as opposed to its likelihood, was sufficient, in some circumstances, to justify a preliminary injunction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   , however, did not disturb the Ninth Circuit's alternative \"serious questions\" test.\n   <em>\n    Alliance for the Wild Rockies v.

Under this test, \" 'serious questions going to the merits' and a hardship balance that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other two elements of the\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   test are also met.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088053\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1127/#p1131\">\n    at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, a temporary restraining order or a preliminary\n   injunction may be granted \"if there is a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff; there are serious questions going to the merits; the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the plaintiff; and the injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    M.R. v.

On May 31, 2018, ICE transferred 124 immigrant men to FDC Sheridan for civil detention. ECF 14-1 (Newman Decl.) \u00b6 4. Approximately 121 immigrant detainees remain at that location.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870916\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/873/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The detainees are housed in two units, at least one of which also houses inmates of the federal prison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Many of the detainees have come to the United States to request asylum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 26; ECF 6 (Garcia Decl.) \u00b6 5. Before June 25, 2018, both social and legal visits at FDC Sheridan took place each Monday through Friday from 8:30 until 11:30 a.m. for inmates and from 12:00 until 3:00 p.m. for immigrant detainees. ECF 14-1 (Newman Decl.). \u00b6 8. Defendants add that they intended to provide legal visitation for all pretrial/pre-sentence and civil detainees from 8:30 a.m. until 3:00 p.m, Monday through Friday, on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis by June 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2. Plaintiff Law Lab is a nonprofit organization founded by its executive director Stephen W. Manning that advocates on behalf of noncitizens in the United States. Law Lab provides representation to noncitizens, in part, through its Oregon-based network of 125 private, pro bono attorneys who have been trained in asylum and removal defense. ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 2. Law Lab, through Manning, designed a pro bono representation project to facilitate access to, and legal representation of, the FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees. Manning and Law Lab have previously run two similar detention-based\n   pro bono representation projects. ECF 49 (Second Manning Decl.) \u00b6 2. One of those projects, the Dilley Pro Bono Project in South Texas, has represented more than 40,000 noncitizens since its inception in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Manning, in his role with Law Lab, has also collaborated with the Southern Poverty Law Center to design the model for a large-scale noncitizen representation project, and directs the Centers for Excellence-a pro bono project that provides technical and strategic assistance to noncitizens and their attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   3. Law Lab's pro bono representation project seeks to provide a minimum of three attorney contacts with each detainee who requests legal representation, consisting of: (1) a KYR group orientation that provides an overview of immigration relief; (2) an individualized screening with a trained advocate; and (3) an individualized client conference. Law Lab has determined that at least three know-your-rights orientations of 60 to 90 minutes duration is needed adequately to inform all interested FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees of their rights. ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 8. After beginning the pro bono project, approximately 900 community members, including immigration specialist attorneys, civil rights attorneys, and other legal advocates have offered to provide pr bono legal services through Law Lab. ECF 49 (Second Manning Decl.) \u00b6 9. Law Lab perceives that its ability to provide representation to the immigrant detainees is limited only by the physical and temporal restrictions in place at FDC Sheridan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   4. Between June 8 and June 21, 2018, Law Lab's pro bono attorneys requested, but repeatedly were denied, access to the detained individuals for the purposes of delivering legal services. ECF 23 at 6-9; ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 12-17; 21-22; ECF 8 (Smith Decl.) \u00b6 2-10; ECF 9 (Strautman Decl.) \u00b6 3-8; ECF 7 (Philbaum Decl.) \u00b6 5-10; ECF 5 (Baxter-Neal Decl.) \u00b6 5; ECF 4 (Sinlapasai Decl.) \u00b6 12. In that time period, approximately 50 detainees had requested representation from Law Lab. ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 25-27. Only one attorney had met with a client, however, and that client was thereafter transferred from FDC Sheridan to the North West Detention Center in Tacoma,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   5. Plaintiff Sanchez Gonzalez is currently detained at FDC Sheridan. He is unable to file a complaint on his own due to lack of access to legal counsel. His domestic partner of ten years, Xochitl Ramos Valencia, requested pro bono legal representation from Law Lab on his behalf. Before June 25, 2018, Law Lab attorneys twice attempted to meet with Sanchez Gonzalez but were denied access both times. ECF 3 (First Manning Decl.) \u00b6 33-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   6. On June 22, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a complaint and a motion for TRO against Defendants, alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). At the time Plaintiffs filed their complaint, removal proceedings for the 121 immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan had not yet commenced. Further, none of the immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan had been served with an administrative summons known as a \"Notice to Appear,\" which is how a removal proceeding typically begins. ECF 27 (TRO Hearing Transcript) 5:20-25. Before June 25, 2018, \"Credible fear\" interviews for immigrant detainees seeking asylum were scheduled to begin at FDC Sheridan on June 28, 2018. ECF 14-2 (Heaton Decl.) \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   7. On June 25, 2018, the Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' motion for TRO. The\n   Court granted the motion and entered the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1. For all immigrant detainees currently housed at FDC Sheridan or who may become housed at FDC Sheridan during the pendency of this Order, Defendants shall not proceed with any asylum interview or hearing, including any \"credible fear\" interview or screening, for such detainee, nor shall Defendants deport or remove any that detainee, until after that detainee has had a full and fair opportunity meaningfully to: (1) attend a \"know your rights\" training session conducted by Law Lab; and (2) if the detainee has requested representation from a Law Lab attorney or other legal counsel, consult with that attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   2. For all immigrant detainees currently housed at FDC Sheridan or who may become housed at FDC Sheridan during the pendency of this Order, Defendants shall not transfer any such detainee outside of the District of Oregon without: (1) the consent of counsel for that detainee; or (2) prior leave of the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   3. Defendants shall provide Law Lab's designated pro bono attorneys, or a detainee's otherwise designated counsel of choice, with access to at least two of FDC Sheridan's attorney visitation rooms for a minimum of six hours per day, seven days a week (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , including weekends), to perform group \"know your rights\" training as well as individualized interviews and consultations for the immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan. In addition, Defendants shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provided attorney visitation rooms are equipped with outside-line telephones that have speakerphone capability, to facilitate the attorney's consultation with a detainee who does not speak English by calling a telephone-accessible interpreter or interpretation service. Attorney calls may not be monitored, after Defendants are satisfied that the telephone call involves an attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   4. Defendants shall install at least four telephone lines in each unit where immigrant detainees are held, with each line capable of placing free direct calls to legal service providers, including to Law Lab. Defendants shall permit all immigrant detainees housed at FDC Sheridan to access these telephones during facility \"awake hours,\" or between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., whichever is longer, each day of the week, including weekends. Attorney calls may not be monitored, after Defendants are satisfied that the telephone call involves an attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   5. For all immigrant detainees currently housed at FDC Sheridan or who may become housed at FDC Sheridan during the pendency of this Order, Defendants shall provide timely advance written notice to the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the District of Oregon of any scheduled \"credible fear\" interview or screening or any other asylum interview at FDC Sheridan. In addition, after Defendants have been informed that a particular attorney or Law Lab represents a specific detainee, Defendants shall provide timely advance written notice to that attorney or Law Lab, as appropriate, of any scheduled \"credible fear\" interview or screening or any other asylum interview at FDC Sheridan for that detainee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   6. Defendants shall allow attorneys to use laptops in accordance with BOP security guidelines while performing legal services on behalf of any immigrant detainee at FDC Sheridan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   7. Defendants shall appropriately allocate ICE and BOP resources, including but not limited to personnel and equipment, sufficient to accommodate the expanded\n   attorney visiting time and other requirements of this Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   ECF 23 at 19-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   8. At subsequent status conferences, Plaintiffs and Defendants have generally reported good faith efforts to comply with the TRO and cooperate with one another. After the Court issued the TRO, Law Lab provided KYR presentations to 114 immigrant detainees, completed 100 initial client screenings, 95 client consultations, and 68 ancillary legal conferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   9. As of July 30, 2018, Law Lab represents 80 detainees at FDC Sheridan, each of whom was, at the time of their detention, subject to expedited removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Of Law Lab's 80 detainee clients, 79 have completed credible fear screening interviews under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) and one has withdrawn his screening request at the interview. Of the 79 detainee clients who have completed credible fear interviews, 74 have received determinations. All 74 detainee clients of Law Lab who have received determinations, including Plaintiff Gonzalez, have been determined by an asylum officer to have a credible or reasonable fear of persecution. The determinations for the other five detainee clients remain outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   10. Law Lab continues to provide representation to its client detainees who have received positive fear determinations to assist those detainees with their petitions for release pending adjudication of their asylum applications. Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction limited to issues affecting the ability of Law Lab attorneys to continue to deliver legal services to its client detainees at FDC Sheridan. Plaintiffs no longer seek an order enjoining Defendants from moving forward with removal proceedings or asylum hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue that the INA, as amended, removes subject matter jurisdiction from federal district courts to provide relief for all detainees, whether they are subject to expedited removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) or other formal immigration proceedings before an immigration judge. The jurisdiction-stripping provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) apply only to detainees subject to expedited removal proceeding under \u00a7 1225(b)(1). Although all of Law Lab's clients were subject to expedited removal proceedings at the time of their detention, all but one of their clients has since completed an credible fear interview as provided under \u00a7 1225(b)(1)(B). Five of those detainee clients' credible fear determinations remain outstanding, but of the 74 determinations that have been made, every detainee client has received a positive fear determination. Thus, these 74 detainees are now permitted to pursue their asylum application under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   before an immigration judge and, if removal proceedings are commenced, will be subject to formal, rather than expedited, removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a before an immigration judge. At this stage in the litigation, therefore, essentially all of the detainee clients are no longer subject to the provisions of \u00a7 1225(b)(1). The jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A) and \u00a7 1252(e) are thus inapplicable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that the detainees who are no longer subject to expedited removal nevertheless bring claims that arise from their removal proceedings, and that such claims are therefore barred by \u00a7 1252(b)(9) and (g).

In the pending case, Plaintiffs do not challenge any such decision or action. Indeed, they cannot, as no removal proceeding has yet begun and no removal decision has yet been made. Defendants argue that the very fact of the detainees' detention means that removal proceedings have been initiated, and thus claims arising from the circumstances of the detainees' confinement arise from the decision to initiate removal proceedings. The Supreme Court, however, rejected this argument in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , writing \"[w]e will assume for the sake of argument that detention is an action\n   taken 'to remove an alien' ...

Law Lab's stated mission is to advocate on behalf of and provide legal representation to noncitizens in the United States. In furtherance of this mission, they have undertaken considerable effort to provide pro bono legal representation to the FDC Sheridan immigrant detainees. The alleged policies, procedures, and actions at FDC Sheridan, however, have prevented Law Lab from fulfilling its mission of advocating on behalf of noncitizens, and render futile its efforts to coordinate pro bono legal representation. The challenged policies and procedures also have resulted in the diversion of Law Lab resources, as attorneys have repeatedly traveled to FDC Sheridan only to be turned away, and have established a toll-free hotline for detainees that detainees have not been able to access or use. Such facts sufficiently establish that Law Lab has suffered injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also have demonstrated that Law Lab has a sufficiently close relationship with the detainees to advocate on their behalf. Plaintiffs have submitted affidavits indicating that at least 50 detainees at FDC Sheridan have requested representation from Law Lab. The Federal Public Defender (\"FPD\"), as\n   <em>\n    amica curiae\n   </em>\n   , also states that at least 64 detainees have communicated their requests for immigration representation, which the FPD cannot provide, to FPD staff attorneys. ECF 18. These numerous requests from immigrant civil detainees and FDC Sheridan sufficiently demonstrate that Law Lab has a close relation to the detainees, even if Defendants' actions have prevented Law Lab attorneys from formalizing their legal relationship with many of those detainees. Further the circumstances of the detainees' confinement-specifically, the lack of access to immigration lawyers that forms the foundation of this case-poses a significant hindrance to the detainees' ability to advocate on their own behalf, as do the foreign language barriers faced by many of the civil detainees. Finally, counsel for Plaintiff Law Lab states, and counsel for Defendants do not dispute, that Law Lab currently represents 80 of the detainees at FDC Sheridan. As Law Lab has explained, it seeks preliminary injunctive relief only on behalf of itself and its 80 detainee clients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The harms likely to arise from the denial of access to legal representation in the context of asylum applications are particularly concrete and irreparable. The Ninth Circuit has repeatedly emphasized the complexity of immigration laws and procedures and the difficulty of navigating immigration proceedings without a lawyer.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baltazar-Alcazar v.

The denial of access to legal assistance is likely to lead to the denial of asylum and ultimately to the deportation of detainees with meritorious asylum claims. Early representation is particularly important in asylum claims, given the complexity of treaty-based human rights statutes and the serious harm-including persecution, torture, and death-that may result if asylum is improperly denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona v.

Nothing in Plaintiffs' requested relief, however, prevents Defendants from carrying out the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) as the statute contemplates. Any detainee at FDC Sheridan who is subject to expedited removal who does not express an intent to apply for asylum may be removed \"without further hearing or review\" under \u00a7 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). Similarly, any detainee at FDC Sheridan who\n   requests asylum, but is found not to have a credible fear of persecution following his screening interview may be removed \"without further hearing or review\" under \u00a7 1224(b)(1)(B)(iii), subject to the limitations of subclauses (I)-(IV) of that section. The requested relief merely ensures that those detainees with a right to counsel who have retained or requested counsel through Law Lab are ensured the same degree of access to that counsel that Defendants' own policies guarantee in PBNDS 2011. The preliminary relief, as ordered by the Court creates no loophole and imposes no new impediments to the expeditious functioning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The equities in this case also tip sharply in favor of emergency relief for the Plaintiffs. They request only that BOP and ICE actually provide the same degree of access to legal assistance that their own regulations purport to guarantee. Thus, Defendants do not persuasively show that the requested preliminary relief will pose an undue burden on Defendants' time, resources, or personnel. Moreover, any such burden on Defendants is more than justified by the need to ensure the fulfillment of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights and to prevent the improper denial of meritorious asylum applications. Finally, it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party's constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have failed to meet these adopted \"policies and procedures\" in violation of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(A).

For the same reason, \u00a7 1252(e)(3), which requires that challenges to agency regulations, written policies, and written procedures be heard in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, does not affect the Court's jurisdiction over this claim.

This request goes too far. First, Plaintiffs do not have standing to request an order affecting all current or future detainees at FDC Sheridan because some of those detainees have retained counsel not associated with Law Lab. Plaintiffs have standing to request relief that applies only to those immigrant detainees at FDC Sheridan who have either requested pro bono representation and are not already represented, or who are already represented by a Law Lab attorney. Second, for reasons explained in the earlier section, this Court lacks jurisdiction to prevent the transfer or removal of immigrant detainees who have been ordered removed under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1)(A)(i) or (B)(iii). Thus, Plaintiffs cannot obtain preliminary relief that restricts Defendants from transferring or removing immigrant detainees who are subject to expedited removal and have not requested asylum, or those who have requested asylum but have been found not to have a credible fear of persecution. Plaintiffs, however, have limited their requested relief, and subject to these modifications and clarifications, Plaintiffs have established that they have standing in this case sufficient to obtain the modified relief that they seek.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants urge the Court to apply the three-part balancing test of\n    <em>\n     Mathews v.
