Hodes seeks information about four contracts the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded to private companies to outsource debt collection for certain IRS tax liabilities. Hodes filed this lawsuit after the IRS refused to disclose the contracts' commission percentage rates in response to his request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The task order contracts include a base period contract and future options for four additional years. Gregory Decl. \u00b6 12. Four days after the awards, Hodes submitted a FOIA request to the IRS requesting the contracts, including the \"pricing percentage rates to be paid to the contractors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   IRS's Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; Minauro Decl. Ex. A, Dkt. 13-4. The IRS gave Hodes copies of the contracts but invoked FOIA exemption 4 to redact and withhold the pricing percentage rates (or \"commission percentages\") that the IRS agreed to pay the debt collection companies. IRS's Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 7. Exemption 4 protects \"matters that are ... trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hodes filed an administrative appeal of the IRS's decision to redact and withhold the commission percentages. IRS's Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. After the IRS denied his administrative appeal, Hodes filed this lawsuit on February 1, 2017, naming both the IRS and the United States Department of the Treasury as defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1, Dkt. 1.

Because Hodes never submitted a FOIA request to Treasury, Treasury argues that it cannot provide any relief apart from that available from the IRS, which is a bureau of Treasury. Treasury's Mem. at 1, Dkt. 12-1. Hodes insists that Treasury must remain in the case because it is the \"agency,\" as defined by FOIA, and the IRS is merely its \"component.\" Pl.'s Opp'n to Dismissal at 2, Dkt. 15-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The same day that Treasury moved to dismiss, the IRS moved for summary judgment on the ground that FOIA exemption 4 shields commission percentages from disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRS's Mot. at 1, Dkt. 13. Intervenor ConServe, one of the four task order contract awardees, subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment supporting the IRS's position. ConServe's Mot. at 1, Dkt. 14.

The IRS's request for quotations required the competing companies to provide pricing information for the base year and four option periods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10, 12. Most relevant here, the IRS required the competing companies to propose commission percentages that would apply to the collection of four separate categories of taxpayer debt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 (1) Individual taxpayer accounts with balances of $10,000 or less\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 (2) Individual taxpayer accounts with balances of $10,001-$50,000\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 (3) Individual taxpayer accounts with balances of $50,001 and above\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 (4) Other account types\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Although the bidding companies' publicly available General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts set the \"ceiling for the commission percentage that the company may propose when competing for a government contract,\" most of the companies' proposed commission percentages were less than those reflected on their respective GSA schedules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As reflected in the chart and equations below, the commission percentages are multipliers used to calculate the price of four separate line items: (1) debt collections involving debts of $10,000 or less; (2) debts between $10,001-$50,000; (3) debts $50,001 and greater; and (4) non-individual taxpayer debts of any amount.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. For this reason, the commission percentages more closely resemble line-item (as opposed to total) prices. Each line-item price is the commission percentage multiplied by the total dollar amount of tax debt collected within each category.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the total price is the sum of all four line-item prices. In this sense, each commission percentage is no different than a typical mark up in a contract that includes prices for various line-item goods or services.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669678,11662718\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/303/\">\n    180 F.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (proposed prices for several launch missions and various other launch-related services held to be line items protected under exemption 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The following chart and corresponding equations illustrate how the various commission percentages are used to calculate line-item prices for each category of debt and how the line-item prices are then aggregated to calculate the total contract price:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-35\">Category 1 debts $10,000 or $$ debt collected commission % 1 <strong>line-item price</strong> less <strong>1</strong> Category 2 debts $10,001-$50,000 $$ debt collected commission % 2 <strong>line-item price</strong> <strong>2</strong> Category 3 debts $50,001 $$ debt collected commission % 3 <strong>line-item price</strong> and above <strong>3</strong> Category 4 Non-individual $$ debt collected commission % 4 <strong>line-item price</strong> taxpayer debts <strong>4</strong> <strong>TOTAL</strong> <strong>CONTRACT</strong> <strong>PRICE</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Line-Item Prices\n    </em>\n    = $$ amount of debts collected multiplied by commission percentage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Total Contact Price\n    </em>\n    = Line-Item Prices 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This interpretation of the commission percentages is not only consistent with the view expressed by Gregory, a contracting officer with extensive experience, but also consistent with the plain meaning of the term \"total\" contract price: the aggregate amount that the government pays for goods or services-in this case, taxpayer debt collection services for four separate categories of debt. Each individual commission percentage is not even a dollar price at all; rather, it is just one of several figures used to calculate the total contract price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To support his argument that each commission percentage is a\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   (or \"final\") contract price subject to disclosure under exemption 4, Hodes relies on two 1980s cases-\n   <em>\n    Racal-Milgo Government Systems, Inc. v. Small Business Administration\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546571\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/559/4/\">\n    559 F.Supp. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 1981), and\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Information Systems, Inc. v.

In both cases, courts applied the\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   test to unit (or line-item) prices and held that the party seeking to prevent disclosure failed to demonstrate that the unit pricing was \"confidential\" and thus exempt from disclosure under exemption 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Racal-Milgo Gov't Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546571\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/559/4/\">\n    559 F.Supp. at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unit pricing not exempt under exemption 4 because the government did not prove that disclosure would either impair its ability to obtain necessary information in the future or cause substantial harm to the company supplying the equipment);\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Info.

Both courts touted the strong public interest in disclosing prices awarded in government contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Racal-Milgo Gov't Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546571\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/559/4/\">\n    559 F.Supp. at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the disclosure of contract pricing as \"a cost of doing business\" with the government);\n   <em>\n    AT &amp; T Info.

But neither case stands for the blanket rule that FOIA exemption 4 does not apply to line-item prices. Nor does either case provide support for Hodes's argument that the commission percentages are total contract prices. Moreover, both cases predate D.C. Circuit decisions which make clear that line-item pricing data can be withheld under exemption 4 if it satisfies the\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Canadian Commercial\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 41 (rejecting a per se rule that pricing data must be disclosed);\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3669678,11662718\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/303/\">\n    180 F.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377344,3433985\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/1182/\">\n    375 F.3d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that line-item pricing information in a government contract falls within FOIA exemption 4 if it satisfies the\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   test).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that to the extent the commission percentages are \"prices\" at all, they are more akin to line-item (rather than to total) prices. Each of the four categories of tax debt collections are \"line items\" or \"deliverables\" to recover tax debts that fall within specified financial ranges. Thus, the commission percentage-the multiplier used to calculate each\n   <em>\n    line-item\n   </em>\n   price-is just\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   of several numbers used to calculate the total contract price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the Commission Percentages Are Confidential Information Under Exemption 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As noted, courts apply the two-part\n   <em>\n    National Parks\n   </em>\n   test to determine whether commercial or financial information is \"confidential\" under exemption 4.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169442,3682154\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/498/765/\">\n    498 F.2d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this test here, the Court concludes that the defendants have satisfied both prongs of the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, disclosing the commission percentages would cause substantial harm to the debt collection companies' competitive positions should the IRS decide not to renew the task order contract for future option years and re-bid the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gregory Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16, 17. As the declarations of the IRS and three of the four task order awardees-ConServe, CBE Group, Inc., and Performant Recover Inc.-make clear, disclosure of the commission percentages would enable competitors to (1) gain insight into the awardees' pricing strategy and (2) underbid the awardees in future competitive bidding processes for IRS debt collection or other similar contracts. Gregory Decl. \u00b6 25; CBE Group Decl. \u00b6 5, Dkt. 13-6; Performant Recovery Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, Dkt. 13-7; ConServe Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 21, 22, Dkt. 14-2. Because the D.C. Circuit has held that releasing line-item pricing in contracts that contain option years substantially harms a contractor \"by informing the bids of its rivals in the event the contract is rebid,\"\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377344,3433985\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/1182/\">\n    375 F.3d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court reaches the same conclusion here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, disclosing the commission percentages also would impair the IRS's ability to get necessary information in the future. As Gregory explains, should the IRS decide to expand its debt-collection program, new bidders might draw misleading inferences about their competitors' pricing approach that could cause bidders to include unrealistically low commission percentages. Gregory Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23. Gregory predicts that this could compromise a new bidder's performance and lead to increased contract administration costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377344,3433985\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/1182/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Hodes argues that the IRS should be able to detect whether a bidder's low bid puts it at risk of poor performance, particularly because the IRS \"does not evaluate the price offered by a debt collection company in a vacuum, but i[t] also considers each competing contractors' [sic] relevant experience, past performance, and operating plan for conducting collection operations and complaint process in evaluating a potential awardee's ability to meet the RFQ's requirements for high quality performance.\" Gregory Decl. \u00b6 24. But as Gregory explains, commission percentage prices are based on each vendor's \"assessment of the effort that will be required to\n   perform under the contract with regard to the vendor's cost accounting structure, profit objectives and financial condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Thus, it is plausible that even a small drop in a percentage rate could be perilous for a new bidder that is in weak financial condition or has an unrealistic aspiration about its profitability and ability to perform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Balanced against this risk, the Court must consider the public's countervailing interest in \"be[ing] informed about what its government is up to.\"\n   <em>\n    Canadian Commercial\n   </em>\n   , 514 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted). In this case, the public knows the outer percentage rate that the government could pay because commission percentage ceilings are publicly available in GSA contracts. Gregory Decl. \u00b6 13. Consequently, knowing the precise commission percentage discounts \"would seem to shed little if any light upon the agency's performance of its statutory duties.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377344,3433985\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/1182/\">\n    375 F.3d at 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).
