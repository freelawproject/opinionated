(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) At issue in this suit are \"aircraft cargo manifests,\" which contain information regarding airborne cargo shipments entering the United States. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 25.) CBP has the statutory authority to require that aircraft entering the United States submit these cargo manifests, as well as the authority to regulate the contents of and submission procedures for these manifests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (d) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20122.48\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 122.48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122.48a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs have each submitted FOIA requests seeking aircraft manifest information from CBP. Specifically, on January 26, 2015, ImportGenius submitted a FOIA request to CBP seeking \"access to and\n   copies of the portions of ALL aircraft manifests for inbound shipments form [sic] January 1, 2014 to July 31, 2014 that have been designated for public disclosure by 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1431(c).\" (Compl. \u00b6 32.) CBP denied ImportGenius's request. (Compl. \u00b6 40.) ImportGenius appealed, and CBP again declined to respond to the request because \"doing so would impose an unreasonable burden upon the agency.\" (Compl. \u00b6 48.) Similarly, on January 17, 2017, Panjiva submitted a FOIA request to CBP seeking \"access to and copies of the portions of ALL aircraft manifests for inbound shipments from December 5, 2016 to December 9, 2016 that have been designated for public disclosure by 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1431(c).\" (Compl. \u00b6 57.) As of October 26, 2017, CBP had not made a final determination on Panjiva's request. (Compl. \u00b6 66.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Panjiva filed this action in connection with those unsuccessful FOIA requests. Its claims fall into three groups: first, Panjiva asserts that CBP violated FOIA by failing to disclose the requested aircraft manifest information, failing to adhere to the statute's procedural requirements, and engaging in a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct by specifically withholding aircraft manifest information. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-125 (Counts I-V).) Second, in the alternative, Panjiva asserts that CBP's failure to satisfy the requirements of FOIA also violates the APA. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 114-125, 148-155 (Counts V, VIII).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And third, Panjiva asserts that CBP has violated the Tariff Act and the APA by failing to disclose the information, and that the Treasury has violated the same statutes by failing to promulgate regulations to facilitate access to such aircraft manifest data. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 126-147 (Counts VI-VII).) The Government now moves to dismiss the Complaint in part, seeking to dismiss the second and third sets of claims invoking the Tariff Act and the APA for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government seeks dismissal of two sets of claims against it: (1) claims premised on the Tariff Act and its amendments (Counts VI-VII); and (2) claims under the APA that are duplicative of Panjiva's FOIA claims (Counts V and VIII). The Court discusses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Tariff Act Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Count VI of the Complaint, Panjiva asserts that CBP's failure to disclose the requested aircraft manifest information constitutes a violation of the Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act (\"ACPA\"). (Compl. \u00b6 129.) Panjiva reads the ACPA to require CBP to make certain categories of information in aircraft manifests \"available for public disclosure,\" and to permit withholding the information only if the agency invokes specific exceptions. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Relatedly, in Count VII, Plaintiffs assert that the ACPA required the Treasury to \"establish procedures to provide access to [aircraft] manifests\" and promulgate regulations to carry out the terms of the ACPA related to aircraft manifests, but it has unlawfully failed to do so. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 137-140.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Government has moved to dismiss both of these claims, arguing that they rest on an incorrect interpretation of the Tariff Act and its amendments. In the Government's interpretation of the relevant statutes, it is not required to publicly disclose aircraft manifests, and thus it need not adopt procedures or promulgate regulations facilitating access to aircraft manifests. (Dkt. No. 22 at 1-2.) The Court agrees with the Government's reading of the statutes, and therefore grants its motion to dismiss these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To understand the parties' dispute, the Court first examines how the statutory provision at issue has evolved over time. The foundational statute at issue is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which required that all vessels entering the country maintain certain information in \"a manifest\" for customs inspection. Pub. L. No. 71-361, \u00a7 431,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20Stat.%20590\">\n    46 Stat. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710 (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ). Since the enactment of the Tariff Act, the statutory term \"vessel\" has been consistently defined to encompass anything \"capable of being used, as a means of transportation in water,\" and the term expressly \"does not include aircraft.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 401(a), 46 Stat. at 708;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201401\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Congress amended \u00a7 431 of the Tariff Act in 1984, adding as subsection (c)(1) the requirement that a list of specified \"information, when contained in such manifest, shall be available for public disclosure.\" Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-573, Title II, \u00a7 203,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%202948\">\n    98 Stat. 2948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2974 (codified as amended at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ). This provision in effect created a public-disclosure requirement for vessel manifests, subject to exceptions that the Secretary of the Treasury could invoke to withhold information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In July 1996, Congress amended the public-disclosure requirement in \u00a7 431(c)(1) of the Tariff Act with the enactment of the ACPA. The ACPA modified \u00a7 431(c)(1) \"by inserting 'vessel or aircraft' before 'manifest.' \" Pub. L. No. 104-153, \u00a7 11(1), 110 Stat.1386, 1389 (July 2, 1996). The ACPA also amended the list of specified information to be disclosed, to insert references to airports and aircraft.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11(2)-(4). The effect of these changes was to extend the public-disclosure requirement\n   to encompass both vessel and aircraft manifests.

This time, the amending statute provided that \"Section 431(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 ( 19 U.S.C. 1431(c)(1) ) is amended in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) by striking 'such manifest' and inserting 'a vessel manifest.' \" Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act, Pub.

The Government disagrees, asserting that the October 1996 amendment removed the requirement to disclose aircraft manifests under \u00a7 431, such that now only vessel manifests are subject to public disclosure. (Dkt. No. 22 at 7-11.) To address this question of statutory interpretation, the Court considers first the statutory text, then the application of the rule against superfluity, and finally the relevant legislative and statutory history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

(Dkt. No. 34 at 11-12.) Not so. In amending \u00a7 431(c)(1), the Corrections Act struck the phrase \"such manifest\" and substituted the phrase \"a vessel manifest.\" Pub. L. No. 104-295, \u00a7 3(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3515. It is undisputed that the codified provision did not execute that precise change, because making that precise change was impossible: the phrase \"such manifest\" no longer appeared in \u00a7 431. The Office of Law Revision Counsel tried to accommodate this impossible amendment by replacing the word \"such\" with \"a vessel.\" But the fact that the Office had to deviate from the specific amendment directed by the Corrections Act demonstrates an inconsistency between the codification and the enactment. As a result, the Court must look to the text of the Statutes at Large to discern the meaning of \u00a7 431(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The relevant Statutes at Large here are the ACPA, 110 Stat. at 1389, and the Corrections Act, 110 Stat. at 3515.

Pub. L. No. 104-153, \u00a7 11(1), 110 Stat. at 1389. The effect of this action was to amend the phrase \"such manifest\" to become \"such vessel or aircraft manifest.\" In October 1996, the Corrections Act \"str[uck] 'such manifest' and insert[ed] 'a vessel manifest' \" in the operative clause of \u00a7 431(c)(1). Pub. L. No. 104-295, \u00a7 3(a)(3), 110 Stat. at 3515. However, the phrase \"such manifest\" no longer appeared in \u00a7 431(c)(1) when this amendment was made. As a result, the Court cannot combine\n   the ACPA and Corrections Act in a straightforward manner to yield a single, definitive statutory text that fully incorporates both amendments. Rather, the statutes contain contrary indications of congressional intent, which both parties rely on to support their preferred interpretations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Panjiva contends that the Corrections Act left the requirement to disclose aircraft manifests untouched in the statute, because although the Corrections Act amended the reference to a \"vessel manifest\" in \u00a7 431(c)(1), it did not remove the reference to \"aircraft manifests.\" (Dkt. No. 34 at 11.) And according to Panjiva, because Congress is presumed to know how to amend statutes, its failure to expressly strike the reference to \"aircraft manifests\" in \u00a7 431(c)(1) means that the phrase was left in intentionally. (Dkt. No. 34 at 11-12, 17 &amp; n.7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Government asserts to the contrary that in inserting the phrase \"vessel manifest\" into the operative clause of \u00a7 431(c)(1) in the Corrections Act, Congress intended to limit the public-disclosure requirement to cover only vessel manifests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 22 at 7, 10.) Acknowledging that the text of the Corrections Act amendment did not precisely map onto the then-existing text of \u00a7 431(c)(1), the Government offers two potential explanations: first, that Congress was working off of the text of \u00a7 431 that pre-dated the ACPA amendment, which included the phrase \"such manifest\"; and second, that Congress meant to direct the replacement of all the words between \"such\" and \"manifest\" with the phrase \"a vessel manifest,\" but in doing so Congress omitted an ellipsis. (Dkt. No. 22 at 10 n.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court agrees that the first scenario is what likely occurred here. On its face, the Corrections Act was purporting to amend language in \u00a7 431(c)(1) as it existed prior to the ACPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the ACPA was enacted only three months prior, and different committees of the Senate originated the conflicting amendments, a mistake of this nature is easy to comprehend.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 104-177, 104th Cong. (1995) (Judiciary Comm.),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 104-393, 104th Cong. (1996) (Finance Comm.). And if this outdated-text scenario is indeed what occurred, it would mean that when adopting the Corrections Act amendment, Congress would have understood the new text of \u00a7 431(a)(1) to refer to vessel manifests only. And, contrary to Panjiva's assertion, Congress's failure to expressly strike the phrase \"aircraft manifest\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   under these circumstances would provide no indication of a deliberate effort to keep the words in the statute. Looking at the plain meaning of the text in conjunction with the statutory history of \u00a7 431(c)(1), therefore, the Court is inclined to favor the Government's understanding of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Ultimately, however, the Court is faced with an amalgamation of language from incompatible statutes and left to speculate about how they came to be. The Court thus concludes that no clear meaning can be discerned from the statutory text alone. Because \"the text is ... subject to 'divergent, but plausible, constructions' on the issue of [aircraft manifests], ... it is ambiguous in revealing Congress's intent on this subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

First, Panjiva asserts that Congress added \"aircraft manifest\" to the operative clause of \u00a7 431(c)(1) in the ACPA and never removed it; therefore, \"aircraft manifest\" remains in the text of statute and must be given effect. (Dkt. No. 34 at 13-14.) The Government responds that this argument is premised on the assumption that the U.S. Code furnishes the conclusive text of the provision at issue, and that on a proper reading of the statutes \"aircraft manifest\" was removed from the operative provision by the Corrections Act. (Dkt. No. 35 at 3.) The Court agrees with the Government. Panjiva's argument that the Government's proposed construction of the text would render redundant the word \"aircraft\" holds weight only if the Court were to agree with Panjiva's argument that the word \"aircraft\" is in fact still contained in the statutory text. Where there is not a single, definitive statutory text to analyze, a surplusage argument premised on giving effect to disputed language rests on circular logic. Panjiva's first surplusage argument is thus unpersuasive because it assumes the correctness of Panjiva's position as to the more fundamental question of what the text is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Panjiva's second surplusage argument, though more persuasive, is similarly unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As discussed above, the ACPA amended the list of information subject to disclosure under \u00a7 431(c)(1) to add references to airports and aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C \u00a7 1431(c)(1)(D)-(F). The Corrections Act subsequently amended the operative clause, but it did nothing to remove these additional references. Panjiva argues that the rule against superfluity counsels in favor of its interpretation of the statute, in order to \"make sense of the continued presence of\" those terms and \"give them effect.\" (Dkt. No. 34 at 14.) The Government acknowledges that the Corrections Act did not expressly remove those terms from the statute. (Dkt. No. 22 at 11.) But it maintains that those \"vestigial references\" have no continuing force, because the operative clause that creates the entitlement to disclosure was amended to exclude aircraft manifests. The upshot of the Corrections Act amendment, according to the Government, was essentially to impliedly repeal those references. (Dkt. No. 22 at 11-12; Dkt. 35 at 5-6.) In response, Panjiva strenuously contests whether the requirements for an implied repeal are satisfied here. (Dkt. No. 34 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court need not resolve that dispute, however, because the rule against superfluity would not lead the Court to adopt Panjiva's interpretation in any event. This is because \"the canon against superfluity assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect 'to every clause and word of a statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v. I4I Ltd.

Not only is the statement clear evidence that the Corrections Act amendment was enacted to restrict the scope of \u00a7 431(c)(1), but the Finance Committee report contains other evidence confirming congressional intent to do so. The report concludes with a section demonstrating the changes to be made to existing law, showing \"existing law to be omitted ... enclosed in black brackets\" and \"new matter ... printed in italic.\" S. Rep. No. 104-393 at 37. This section of the report represents \u00a7 431(c)(1) as follows: \"(c)(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2), the following information, when contained in [such manifest],\n   <em>\n    a vessel manifest\n   </em>\n   shall be available to public disclosure: ....\" S. Rep. No. 104-393 at 43. This confirms that the committee understood that the version of \u00a7 431(c)(1) that would exist after its amendment would cover vessel manifests only, and that it would omit any reference to aircraft manifests from the operative clause of \u00a7 431(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Ultimately, both parties have invoked legislative history demonstrating clear indications of contradictory congressional intent. The Senate Judiciary Committee intended the ACPA to extend the public-disclosure requirement to aircraft manifests. And the Senate Finance Committee intended just the opposite, namely for the Corrections Act to limit the requirement to vessel manifests only. \"It is well established that 'when two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, we must give\n   effect to the most recently enacted statute since it is the most recent indication of congressional intent.' \"\n   <em>\n    California Pub.

In 1998, Congress was considering a bill that proposed to return \u00a7 431(c)(1) to the language of the ACPA, and thereby specifically provide for aircraft manifest disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. 4342, 105th Cong. \u00a7 1001(b)(11) (Aug. 4, 1998) (as passed by House of Representatives). The amendment passed the House, but was taken out of the bill before it was voted on by the Senate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. 4342, 105th Cong. \u00a7 1001(b)(11) (as reported by S. Comm. on Finance, Sept. 29, 1998). The Government reasons that this proposed amendment casts doubt on Panjiva's reading of the statutes, because if Panjiva were correct the proposed amendment \"would have been wholly necessary.\" (Dkt. No. 35 at 7-8.) The Court notes the limited usefulness of this type of evidence, given that \"[a] bill can be proposed for any number of reasons, and it can be rejected for just as many others.\"\n   <em>\n    Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505463\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/159/\">\n    531 U.S. at 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505463\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/159/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But to the extent that this rejected amendment can be said to illuminate congressional intent, it further supports the Government's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The parties also invoke subsequent statutory history in support of their positions. For its part, Panjiva points out that although two additional miscellaneous trade acts have been enacted since 1996, neither has amended \u00a7 431(c)(1). Panjiva reasons that if not expressly striking \"aircraft manifests\" was indeed an oversight in the Corrections Act of 1996, Congress would have fixed the resulting ambiguity in a subsequent statute; its failure to do so, according to Panjiva, is evidence that Congress intended to leave the public-disclosure requirements applicable to aircraft manifests. (Dkt. No. 34 at 17 n.7.) The problem with this argument, however, is that it again assumes the correctness of Panjiva's position;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the phrase \"aircraft manifests\" still appears in the operative clause. But it does not make it any more likely that Panjiva's reading of the statute is actually correct. The Court therefore declines to draw any inference in Panjiva's favor from Congress's inaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Government also relies on subsequent statutory history, emphasizing that \"Congress has very purposefully maintained\n   a distinction in the treatment of goods shipped by sea and by air\" in statutes following the Corrections Act of 1996. (Dkt. No. 35 at 8-9 (citing Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-71, \u00a7 110(f),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Stat.%20597\">\n    115 Stat. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, Pub.

Distinguishing between aircraft and vessel manifests for purposes of public disclosure, according to the Government, is thus consistent with how Congress distinguishes between air and waterborne cargo in other ways. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court concludes that reliance on these subsequent enactments further supports the Government's reading of the statute, by showing that this interpretation \"does not lead to anomalous or unreasonable results.\"\n   <em>\n    Carlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277161\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/207/#p214\">\n    852 F.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Puello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068515\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/324/#p327\">\n    511 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   327 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the Government's reading of \u00a7 431(c)(1) of the Tariff Act is correct. Consideration of the text of the relevant statutes-in conjunction with the rule against superfluity, legislative history, and subsequent legislative and statutory history-supports interpreting the operative clause to provide for the public disclosure of vessel manifests only. As a result, Panjiva is not entitled to the disclosure of information from aircraft manifests under \u00a7 431(c)(1), and the Treasury had no duty to adopt procedures and regulations to facilitate such disclosure. Therefore, Counts VI and VII of the Complaint will be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. APA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Government also seeks to dismiss Counts V and VIII of the Complaint, to the extent that those claims rely on the APA to seek relief available under FOIA. (Dkt. No. 22 at 12-13.) Count VIII asserts that CBP's failure to issue timely determinations on Plaintiffs' FOIA requests and to provide Plaintiffs with estimated completion dates constitutes \"agency action unlawfully withheld and unreasonably delayed\" and arbitrary and capricious agency action under APA \u00a7 706. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 149-155.) And Count V asserts that CBP has a pattern or practice of denying FOIA requests for aircraft manifests as \"overly broad and burdensome or by mischaracterizing [such] requests as 'third party' requests\" in violation of FOIA and the APA. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115, 124.) The Court agrees that these APA claims are duplicative of Plaintiffs' FOIA claims and therefore must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The APA provides that \"[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action\n   <em>\n    for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court\n   </em>\n   are subject to judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The requirement that \"there be no other adequate remedy\" for review to be appropriate under the APA \"reflects Congress' judgment that 'the general grant of review in the APA' ought not 'duplicate existing procedures for review of agency action' or 'provide additional judicial remedies in situations where Congress has provided special and adequate review procedures.' \"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Wash.
