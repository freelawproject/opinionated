HOWELL, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff, Bazarian International Financial Associates, LLC, sued the defendants, Desarrollos Hotelco, C.A. (\"Hotelco C.A.\"), Desarrollos Hotelco Corporation DHC Aruba, N.V. (\"DHC\"), and Desarrollos Hotelco Corporation Curacao Holding, N.V. (\"Hotelco Curacao\"), after the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff for investment banking services provided in anticipation of developing Aruba's beachfront Ritz Carlton hotel. Following a five-day trial, a jury found that Hotelco C.A. had breached its written agreement with, and consequently awarded $2,200,000 in damages to, the plaintiff. DHC and Hotelco Curacao also were found liable as alter egos of Hotelco C.A. and as its successors in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have filed several post-trial motions. First, DHC and Hotelco Curacao seek judgment as a matter of law, or alternatively a new trial, repeating arguments made unsuccessfully pre-trial that neither is Hotelco C.A.'s alter ego or its successor in interest. Defs.' Renewed Mot. JMOL or New Trial (\"Defs.' Mot. JMOL\"), ECF No. 136. Second, all three defendants seek remittitur of the jury's damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defs.' Mot. Remittitur or New Trial (\"Defs.' Mot. Rem.\"), ECF No. 137. Finally, the plaintiff seeks prejudgment and post-judgment interest on the jury's damages award as well as reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Interest &amp; Fees (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained below, both co-defendants' motions are denied because the defendants have failed to show that the trial evidence did not permit the jury's verdict as to alter-ego or successor-in-interest liability or that the jury's damages award is beyond all reason. Further, the plaintiff's fee motion is granted because the plaintiff is entitled to prejudgment interest under District of Columbia law, post-judgment interest under federal law, and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses under the terms of the parties' contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Dismissal of Plaintiff's 2009 Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This litigation dates to 2009, when the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment to establish its right to payment under an agreement, dated February 5, 2007 (\"the Agreement\"), executed with Desarrollos Aerohotelco, C.A. (\"Aerohotelco\"). Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Bazarian Int'l Fin. Assocs., LLC v. Desarrollos Aerohotelco,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.A.\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 09-1764 (D.D.C. Sept. 17, 2009), ECF No. 1. Under the Agreement, the plaintiff was to provide financial services to Aerohotelco, in exchange for a \"debt fee,\" as Aerohotelco built Aruba's Ritz Carlton hotel. That initial complaint was dismissed, without prejudice, because no justiciable controversy had yet arisen.\n   <em>\n    Bazarian Int'l Fin. Assocs., L.L.C. v.

Plaintiff's 2013 Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second iteration of this matter dates to 2013, when the plaintiff again sued Aerohotelco, asserting that Aerohotelco had breached the Agreement and been unjustly enriched by receiving, but failing to pay for, plaintiff's services. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 30-47. The amended operative version of that complaint added several defendants, all affiliated with Aerohotelco, including DHC and Hotelco Curacao. Am. Compl., ECF No. 13. Following a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the claim for unjust enrichment was dismissed. Order, ECF No. 36. The breach-of-contract claim, however, survived against not only Aerohotelco but also against its affiliated enterprises, including DHC and Hotelco Curacao, because the Amended Complaint plausibly alleged each was an alter ego of Aerohotelco.\n   <em>\n    Bazarian Int'l Fin.

Pre-Trial Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In anticipation of trial, the defendants filed two\n   <em>\n    motions in limine\n   </em>\n   . The first sought exclusion of testimony from the\n   plaintiff's expert on hotel financing, William Clover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Lim. Expert, ECF No. 65. The second sought to preclude references to the defendants' foreign status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Lim. Foreign Status, ECF No. 67. The first motion was granted only in part and Clover was allowed to testify about industry standards and understandings regarding certain documentation used in hotel financing and the meaning of certain terms, including \"structuring\" and \"commitments.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 104. The second motion also was granted in part, prohibiting unfairly prejudicial references to the defendant-entities' foreign status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Evidence at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the five-day trial, the plaintiff presented the testimony of seven witnesses: Carl Bazarian, the plaintiff's President and Owner; Stipa; Willem Broekaart, a Vice President of Corporate Finance for the Aruba Investment Bank (\"AIB\"); Frendsel Giel, the Managing Director of AIB; Pedro Vera, a representative of the various defendant-entities; Gregory Zorella, the plaintiff's employee from 2004-2016; and Clover, the plaintiff's expert. The testimony of Stipa, Broekaart, and Giel was in the form of their pre-trial depositions, with most objections resolved pre-trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Orders (May 2, 2018) (ruling on the parties' objections to designations in deposition transcripts of Giel, Stipa and Broekaart, respectively). The defendants presented a single witness: William Nicholson, an expert in real estate brokering, financing, and investing. The plaintiff introduced 93 exhibits into evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exhibit Log, ECF No. 121, and the defendants introduced 17,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exhibit Log, ECF No. 122. Relevant to the now-pending motions, the evidence at trial revealed the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2003, the Aruban government inquired of the plaintiff's interest in bringing a Ritz Carlton hotel to the island, based on the plaintiff's specialty in developing resorts in under-developed parts of the world. Day 1 PM at 11:7-12:14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff was interested and as a result purchased the exclusive option to develop the hotel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341544\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341544\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/168/1/#p22\">\n    at 12:15-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Day 2 AM at 41:9-15.

Pl.'s Trial Ex. 18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Day 1 PM at 27:21-28:4. Stipa, on behalf of Aerohotelco, contacted Bazarian about the request for proposals (\"RFP\") because Bazarian, on behalf of the plaintiff, already had commissioned studies relevant to building the beachfront hotel. Day 1 PM at 31:8-19. Aerohotelco intended to\n   bid, and on February 5, 2007, the plaintiff executed the Agreement with Aerohotelco \"and/or its successor companies or any related entities which intend to invest in and/or develop the Project.\" Pl.

Though Stipa entered the agreement on behalf of Aerohotelco, Aerohotelco was a Venezuelan company and Stipa testified that he was aware that if Aerohotelco's bid succeeded, \"it would have to be a company in Aruba\" that held the option on the beachfront property. Day 2 AM at 123:25-124:6. Vera, who worked alongside Stipa in negotiating the Agreement on behalf of Aerohotelco, also knew at the time of executing the Agreement that should Aerohotelco's bid prevail Aerohotelco would need to structure an Aruban entity to receive the leasehold. Day 3 PM at 52:19-53:11; Day 4 AM at 25:22-26:4. At his deposition, Stipa was asked, \"[D]id you intend for, at the time you signed [the Agreement], if the project were successful, for that Aruban entity to also be bound by this agreement?\" Day 2 AM at 124:16-19.

The jury heard that the Aruban government issued Hotelco C.A. a letter of intent selecting Hotelco C.A. to develop the hotel but conditioning this valuable exclusive development right on Hotelco C.A. \"structur[ing] and incorporat[ing] a local [Aruban] company ... to hold the option right and lease hold.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 65 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Day 1 PM at 111:6-21. Shortly thereafter, Vera led an effort to structure two new companies, DHC, which was incorporated in Aruba, and Hotelco Curacao, which was incorporated in Curacao. Day 3 PM at 49:11-16, 53:12-54:4. DHC is 100% owned by a non-defendant intermediate entity that itself is 100% owned by Hotelco Curacao.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:16-19, 57:14-20, 58:6-15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Trial Ex. 121.

As Vera testified, once these wholly-owned subsidiaries were set up, Hotelco C.A. transferred to DHC, for no compensation, the \"right to exercise the option and assume the leasehold interest granted by the Government of Aruba.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:23-52:2;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 50:20-24, 58:7-8.

While the letter of intent granting the exclusive option to Hotelco C.A. had little value until the conditions for exercising the option were met, as the Court explained when denying the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law as to DHC and Hotelco Curacao, the option's value grew exponentially upon transfer of the option to an Aruban company and compliance with the conditions for exercise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Day 5 AM at 36:16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nonetheless, the defendants focus only on the exclusive option granted to Hotelco C.A., contending that \"nothing was 'transferred' from Hotelco C.A to DHC or Hotelco Curacao\" because \"DHC was formed and obtained the lease pursuant to the Aruban government's condition and requirement that a local Aruban corporation hold the lease.\" Defs.'

The trial evidence supports that the Aruban government awarded the leasehold to Hotelco C.A. The requirement that Hotelco C.A. incorporate a local corporation to exercise control over the leasehold is immaterial in evaluating the liability of the local corporation as an alter ego of its ultimate wholly-owned parent. DHC did not acquire the lease through an arms-length transaction. Vera incorporated DHC and Hotelco Curacao to receive the exclusive leasehold interest and then Hotelco C.A. designated DHC as the entity to receive the leasehold from the government of Aruba. Indeed, once DHC came into existence, it received the leasehold in the beachfront property. Any independence DHC and Hotelco Curacao had from Hotelco C.A. was entirely notional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The defendants press that Hotelco C.A. could not sell, assign, or hold the leasehold itself because the letter of intent required Hotelco C.A. to incorporate a separate Aruban company to hold the leasehold.

These facts, far from aiding the defendants, only emphasize Hotelco C.A.'s, DHC's, and Hotelco Curacao's common identity by underscoring the extent to which all participants in this transaction, including the government of Aruba and Hotelco C.A., understood that Hotelco C.A., DHC, and Hotelco Curacao were in substance entities owned and operated by the same individuals with the single purpose of developing the beachfront luxury hotel for which the Aruban government had granted Hotelco C.A. the exclusive option.

The defendants seem to treat the Agreement as limiting the plaintiff's recovery to the amount of loans secured by entities with\n   which the plaintiff directly interacted. That simply is not what the Agreement says, and the jury, relying on the plain language, reasonably found that the plaintiff was entitled to a larger fee than the defendants acknowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The defendants raise two arguments to dispute that the plaintiff arranged the full amount loaned to the project, but neither is persuasive.

Mot. Rem. at 5 (citing Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.C). This is beside the point. Even if the plaintiff expended time, effort, and resources on lenders that turned out to be dead-ends, the relevant question is whether the plaintiff directly or indirectly arranged the project's financing by facilitating AIB's efforts to secure loans. The trial record supports an affirmative answer. The jury heard ample testimony that the plaintiff did not focus its work, efforts, and negotiations solely on Scotiabank.

The defendants identify an email Zorella sent Stipa, which said \"[T]here are three things we need to discuss: ... Fees of the amount of AIB's participation .... [A]ccording to your last e-mail to us, you said you did not believe we would not be entitled to a fee for the amount of AIB's financing. It is important to clarify that, according to our contract, we would earn a fee for the amount of AIB's loan.\" Defs.' Trial Ex. 62. Zorella, who by the time of trial was no longer employed by the plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Day 4 AM at 78:2-7, testified that the term \"fees for the amount of AIB's participation,\" as used in the email, meant \"[t]he AIB loan amount, as in the amount of the loan we were discussing with AIB at the time. The full amount, excluding whatever amounts they may not end up taking to their own balance sheets because of syndication.\" Day 4 PM at 74:18-25. This email shows that Zorella believed the plaintiff to be due at least a fee based on the amount AIB lent the project; it does not follow that Zorella believed the plaintiff to be due a fee based only on the amount AIB lent the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Moreover, Zorella explained at trial that in writing his email, he intended to claim entitlement to a fee based on the entire amount of the syndicated loan, not just AIB's contribution to the loan, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Our agreement is very clear that our fee is predicated on the gross amount of financing provided by the institution .... [A]t every instance where we've had banks that have subsequently syndicated the loan, the fee paid to us has been the total amount of funding provided. And [the] same thing when I was on the banking side. Whenever there was a syndicated loan, the intermediary received a fee based on the total amount of the financing provided.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Day 4 PM at 72:12-20. Likewise, Bazarian testified that he understood the plaintiff to be entitled to \"2 percent of the gross amount of the AIB arrangement,\" Day 2 AM at 34:21- 23,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the entire amount of the syndicated loan. The jury, as trier of fact, was entitled to credit Zorella's and Bazarian's explanatory testimony over the defendants' understanding of statements Zorella made in his email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, the defendants argue that the jury's verdict was excessive because the syndicate had leant only $78,500,000 to\n   finance the project by the first drawdown of funds, and that the amount loaned would not rise to $110,000,000 for several years. Defs.' Mot. Rem. at 8. The Agreement provided that the debt fee shall be \"based upon the amount of financing arranged for the Project\" and \"based on a flat two percent (2%) of the gross amount of the debt financing provided to the Project.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.C. The Facility Agreement, meanwhile, provides that the amount to be loaned to the project is $78,500,000, \"conditionally to be increased to USD $110,000,000.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 99 at 1. While the lending syndicate had provided only $78,500,000 at the time of the first draw down of funds, the Facility Agreement clearly contemplated, albeit conditionally, that this amount would be increased to $110,000,000 in the future. The defendants fail to explain why these terms do not suffice to show that \"the amount of financing arranged for the Project,\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.C, was $110,000,000, and the jury thus was entitled to find that the plaintiff \"arranged,\" $110,000,000 in financing for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For these reasons, the jury's verdict warrants neither remittitur nor a new trial on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

First, the defendants argue that \"[t]he amount of the Debt Fee, if any, has always been in dispute and is not specifically set forth in the Agreement.\" Defs.' Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Interest &amp; Fees (\"Defs.' Opp'n\") at 9, ECF No. 138. To the contrary, the Agreement specifically provides that the debt fee shall be \"a flat two percent (2%) of the gross amount of the debt financing provided to the Project.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.C. The Agreement could not provide a more specific figure because the parties could not know in advance the amount of debt financing that would be provided to the project. The Agreement provides a simple multiplicative function to determine the amount of the debt fee based on the amount of debt financing provided to the project. That the defendants have disputed the debt fee is irrelevant, as a defendant's recalcitrance in paying a debt owed by disputing the debt obligation or amount, cannot render unliquidated an otherwise liquidated debt, and thereby foreclose prejudgment interest's availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Second, the defendants point out that \"the total amount of credit facilities or financing available was unknown at the time the Agreement was executed, was never definitively capped, and was always subject to change, and did in fact fluctuate throughout the course of this litigation.\" Defs.' Opp'n at 9. According to the defendants, \"[t]he exact dates, amounts and the participating lender(s) of the increase in financing from $78,500,000 to $110,000,000 was ... never established by the evidence presented at trial,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, thereby undercutting characterization of the debt as liquidated, which requires that the debt be\n   an easily ascertainable sum certain \"at the time it arose.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

Contrary to the defendants' strained reasoning, the Agreement specified exactly when the debt fee would be due-\"upon the earlier of the first draw-down of funds and/or first infusion of equity capital, provided that financing has been committed to the Project as a result of the [plaintiff's] efforts.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.D.

The plaintiff points to this testimony to contend that \"the latest the debt fee became due was November 1, 2013.\" Pl.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Interest &amp; Fees (\"Pl.'s Reply\") at 11, ECF No. 141. If the debt fee became due before November 2013, it seems the latest the debt fee became due was October 31, 2013, but the plaintiff does not make this argument, waiving any claim to one additional day of prejudgment interest. In any event, the trial record, coupled with the plaintiff's waiver of one day of prejudgment interest, supports that the latest the debt fee could have become due was November 1, 2013, and, as explained above, by this date, the $110,000,000 in \"debt financing\" already had been \"provided to the Project.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debt thus was an easily ascertainable sum certain at the time it became due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The defendants argue that the jury, not the Court, was required to make a finding as to the date the debt fee became due. Defs.' Opp'n at 12.

R. CIV. P. 49(a)(3). If the date the debt fee came due must be found as a matter of fact, the job is left to the Court, which is persuaded, for the reasons given above, that November 1, 2013 is the latest the debt fee could have become due, and would so find if necessary. Regardless, the defendants cite no authority suggesting that the date a debt fee comes due must be found as a matter of fact. At this stage, the question instead is whether \"a reasonable jury [had] a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1). Here, the jury certainly did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The defendants also argue that \"the Debt Fee became due and payable in stages over time\" rather than all at once. Defs.' Opp'n at 10. This argument cannot square with Section 2.D of the Agreement, which made the entire debt fee due \"upon the earlier of the first draw-down of funds and/or first infusion of equity capital, provided that financing has been committed to the Project as a result of the [plaintiff's] efforts.\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 2.D.

The plaintiff has submitted detailed declarations, as well as supporting receipts, identifying with particularity the costs and expenses, above and beyond those included in the plaintiff's bill of costs, that the plaintiff incurred in litigating this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heyer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; Invoices, ECF No 134-2; Decl. of Carl J. Bazarian (\"Bazarian Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-11, ECF No. 134-3; Bazarian Decl., Attachs., Supporting Documents, ECF No. 134-3. These include court reporter and trial transcript fees, interpreter fees, translation fees, airfare, lodging, meals, ground transportation, parking, postage and FedEx expenses, photocopier charges, legal research charges, PACER access charges, offsite telephone charges, e-discovery vendor charges, courier charges, trial supply costs, and the expert witness fees of Williston H. Clover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heyer Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; Invoices, ECF No 134-2; Bazarian Decl \u00b6\u00b6 4-11; Bazarian Decl., Attachs., Supporting Documents, ECF No. 134-3. Review of these affidavits and receipts reveals that the costs and expenses the plaintiff seeks to recover are of the sort that ordinarily arise in the course of a complex, long-running commercial dispute, and therefore are reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The defendants argue that plaintiff's requested costs and expenses are not recoverable under\n   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(d)(1) and Local Civil Rule 54.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 20-22. The plaintiff, however, does not invoke either rule for its entitlement to recover these costs and expenses. Instead, the plaintiff argues that Section 6 of the Agreement provides an independent, freestanding basis to recover costs and expenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 13; Pl.'s Reply at 16-19. By allowing a prevailing party to recover \"costs\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   expenses,\" Pl.'s Trial Ex. 17 \u00a7 6 (emphasis added), the Agreement entitles a prevailing party to recover those limited costs recoverable under its bill of costs, while the term \"including attorney's fees\" signals that these additional expenses are not limited to attorney's fees. Indeed, the defendants do not contest this construction of the Agreement, and thus waive any argument that the Agreement limits recovery to costs recoverable under Rule 54(d)(1) or Local Rule 54.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
