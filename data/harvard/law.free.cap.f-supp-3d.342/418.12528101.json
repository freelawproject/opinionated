(collectively \"Tiversa\") and against Robert Boback, a former Tiversa executive. The defendants have moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") for lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1); for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6); and for failure to state fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b). For the reasons given below, the motions are granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1996, Daugherty founded a urology health center, LabMD, Inc. (\"LabMD\"). Tiversa uses peer-to-peer file sharing applications to find leaked files, and offers cybersecurity services to prevent leaks. Daugherty claims that the defendants targeted LabMD and that, when LabMD declined to pay for Tiversa's services, the defendants caused an FTC administrative action against LabMD that resulted in LabMD shutting down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the FAC and documents attached to it. Broadly, the FAC alleges that Tiversa found digital files with sensitive information on domestic computers through Internet file-sharing applications, doctored those files to make them appear to have been found on computers in foreign countries, falsely claimed to the Government that the files were found on foreign computers, and thereby obtained (1) a contract from the Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\") for cybersecurity protection services, and (2) grant payments from the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. The TSA Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FAC alleges that in 2011, Tiversa found sensitive information related to aircraft computers on a computer of a TSA employee in Denver, Colorado. Boback instructed an employee of Tiversa to create a report falsely making it \"appear that the sensitive information was spreading through peer-to-peer networks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late spring or summer of 2011, Boback met with representatives of DHS and TSA in Arlington, Virginia. The FAC pleads \"[o]n information and belief\" that \"one of the individuals with whom Boback met was Greg Maier, Chief Information Technology Security Operations for DHS.\" \"Boback showed Maier and others\" the false report and stated falsely that \"sensitive search procedures for aircraft computers had been found on computers in foreign countries.\" The defendants then entered into a contract between Tiversa and TSA for \"a monitoring service to detect sensitive information inadvertently or intentionally disclosed or posted on a network\" (the \"TSA Contract\"). The contract was signed on August 3, 2011 and provided for payment of $324,000 to Tiversa for services over one year. The contract was extended for another year in August 2012, with an additional payment to Tiversa of $324,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. The DHS Grant\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2006, DHS awarded a grant (the \"DHS Grant\") to Dartmouth College (\"Dartmouth\"). Professor M. Eric Johnson, then a director of a center at Dartmouth's business school, engaged Tiversa to partner with him in implementing Dartmouth's work on the DHS Grant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Johnson published a paper in February 2009 using money from the DHS Grant (the \"Johnson Paper\"). The FAC alleges that the Johnson Paper falsely states that a LabMD file was found on a computer where Johnson \"had found other dangerous data\" (the \"LabMD File\"). On April 29, 2008, Johnson sent an email (the \"April 2008 Email\") to a Tiversa employee that included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We are coming well on the medical files -- finished going through all the files. We are working on the report now. We turned up some interesting stuff -- not as rich as the banks, but I guess that could be expected. Any chance you could share a couple other of your recent medical finds that we could use to spice up the report? You told me about the one database you[ ] found that could really boost the impact of the report. Certainly\n   will coordinate with you on the report and release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In response to Johnson's request\" in the April 2008 Email, Tiversa sent Johnson the LabMD File. Johnson and Dartmouth did not notify DHS that the Johnson Paper included false statements about the source of the LabMD File.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dartmouth received $29,650,000 from the DHS Grant between 2006 and 2014. Recipients of grant money from DHS are required to submit \"timely, complete and accurate quarterly progress reports to DHS.\" Dartmouth and Johnson submitted progress reports without disclosing the false statements regarding the LabMD File.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Procedural History\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Complaint in this action was filed under seal on June 24, 2014.

The United States declined to intervene by notice dated March 20, 2018. The docket and the Complaint were unsealed in April 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Complaint on July 3, 2018. An Order filed July 5 directed Daugherty to file an amended complaint or to oppose the motions to dismiss by July 27, and noted that \"[i]t is unlikely that [Daugherty] will have a further opportunity to amend.\" Daugherty responded to the motions to dismiss by filing the FAC on July 27. New motions to dismiss were filed on August 10, and became fully submitted on September 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint \"must plead sufficient factual content to allow a factfinder to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The TSA Contract Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Counts Three and Four of the FAC assert that the defendants violated the FCA when they obtained the TSA Contract. The defendants have moved to dismiss these claims for a variety of reasons. For the following reasons, the motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A. The Elements of an FCA Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The FCA imposes liability on \"any person who,\"\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or\n   fraudulent claim for payment or approval; [or] knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)-(B). To state a claim under the FCA, a relator must allege that the \"defendants (1) made a claim, (2) to the United States government, (3) that is false or fraudulent, (4) knowing of its falsity, and (5) seeking payment from the federal treasury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

The FAC contains adequate allegations of a factual falsity in the defendants' procurement of the TSA Contract. The FAC alleges that Boback sought to obtain money from the Government in exchange for Tiversa's services. The FAC further alleges that Boback presented a document to the TSA that he knew was false, namely a report prepared at Boback's direction that misrepresented the IP address associated with a TSA file found on a peer-to-peer file sharing application. These allegations plausibly allege a violation of the FCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The FAC also pleads fraud with particularity. The FAC specifies that the fraudulent statement was a Tiversa report that falsified the IP address at which a TSA file was found. The specific false statements in the report were (1) that the TSA file was \"spreading through peer-to-peer networks\" and (2) that the TSA file had been \"found on computers in foreign countries.\" The speaker is identified as Boback. The statement was conveyed to TSA employees at a meeting that occurred in Arlington, Virginia in \"late spring or summer of 2011.\" These allegations are specific enough to pass muster under Rule 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendants principally argue that, because the identity of the TSA officials with whom Boback met is not specifically alleged, the fraud claims fail to plead fraud with particularity. Not so. Daugherty has pleaded that Boback met with TSA officials during a specified period, has specifically described the allegedly false statements made by Boback to the TSA, and has attached the resulting TSA Contract for Tiversa's cybersecurity services to the FAC. These allegations are sufficient to plead fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. The Public Disclosure Bar\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FCA claims may not be brought if the allegations or transactions underlying the suit were previously disclosed publicly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4).

Nor do these sources disclose the essential elements of Daughtery's allegation of fraud. \"Fraud requires recognition of two elements: a misrepresented state of facts\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a true state of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817555,10527319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/645/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817555,10527319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/645/\">\n    at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The defendants have not shown that the true state of facts -- that Tiversa falsified a TSA file's IP address -- was made public before 2014. Accordingly, at least one critical element of the fraudulent transaction was not publicly disclosed. As a result, the motions to dismiss are denied as to Counts Three and Four of the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II. The DHS Grant Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss Counts One and Two of the FAC, premised on the DHS Grant, for lack of jurisdiction, contending that the pre-2010 public disclosure bar applies to those claims. The defendants also move to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for failure to plead fraud with particularity. For the reasons that follow, Counts One and Two are dismissed in part with prejudice and in part without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Public Disclosure Bar\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The parties dispute whether the current or pre-2010 version of the public disclosure bar applies to the DHS Grant claims. For the following reasons, the pre-2010 version applies to the portion of these claims where payment was made by the Government before March 23, 2010, the effective date of the 2010 FCA amendment. In addition, the motions to dismiss the pre-March 2010 portions of Counts One and Two for lack of jurisdiction are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The DHS Grant claims are premised on a grant that was paid by DHS from 2006 to 2014. Beginning in 2009, Dartmouth and Johnson submitted quarterly progress reports to DHS which falsely represented the research methodology being used. The FAC thus alleges a scheme that did not conclude until well after the 2010 amendment to the public disclosure bar. This presents the problem of which public disclosure bar applies to the claims in the FAC. Neither the Second Circuit nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether the 2010 amendment to the FCA is retroactive. Relevant precedent, however, dictates that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel.

A motion filed by LabMD in 2014 in an FTC action against it contains the following allegation: The LabMD File \"was stolen by Tiversa from a LabMD computer, given to Dartmouth College to spice up its report, and then given to the\n   FTC ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This constitutes a public disclosure in an administrative proceeding of the \"true\" state of facts on which the DHS Grant claims are based -- that Tiversa and Johnson lied when they claimed that the LabMD File was found in accordance with the DHS Grant search protocol. Accordingly, the Court only has jurisdiction over the pre-March 2010 portions of the DHS Grant claims if Daugherty was an original source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To be an original source, Daugherty must have \"(1) had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based, (2) voluntarily provided such information to the government prior to filing suit, and (3) directly or indirectly been a source to the entity that publicly disclosed the allegations on which the suit is based.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Daugherty's opposition brief states that \"LabMD ... would not learn about Tiversa's fraudulent representations before April 2, 2014, when Richard Wallace, a former Tiversa employee, blew the whistle on Tiversa.\" This statement indicates that Wallace informed LabMD that Tiversa had made false statements to the Government about the source of the LabMD File. Accordingly, Daugherty is not an original source. The portions of Counts One and Two that allege false claims prior to March 23, 2010 are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   B. Materiality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the current public disclosure bar is non-jurisdictional, the defendants' arguments for dismissing the post-March 2010 portions of the DHS Grant claims may be considered in any order. For the reasons that follow, Counts One and Two are dismissed in their entirety with prejudice for failure to plead materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Materiality is defined in the FCA as \"having a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4).

The FAC cites general policies of the United States Government stating that compliance with grant conditions is important to the Government. Under\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , this is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Further, it is implausible that the false statement -- the source of the LabMD File -- would have been material to the grant. DHS paid over $29 million to Dartmouth over an 8-year period. The Johnson Paper, published in 2009, analyzed \"1,654 documents\" found on peer-to-peer file sharing applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DHS Grant and the Johnson Paper were both significantly wider ranging than the LabMD File. It is implausible that falsifying a single IP address would materially affect the Government's decision to pay Dartmouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   III. The FCA Conspiracy Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The FAC also alleges that the defendants conspired to violate the FCA. Defendants solely attack this claim on the ground that Daugherty's other claims fail. Because Counts Three and Four of the FAC survive, the motions to dismiss are denied as to the FCA conspiracy claim in Count Five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The August 10 motions to dismiss are granted as to Counts One and Two, in part without prejudice and in part with prejudice, as explained above.
