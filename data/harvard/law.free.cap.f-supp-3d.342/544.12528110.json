(\"MedImmune\") alleging violations of the New York False Claims Act and a variety of other New York state laws stemming from MedImmune's participation in a kickback scheme designed to boost sales of MedImmune's neonatal respiratory drug, Synagis. (Doc. No. 49 (the \"Complaint-in-Intervention\" or \"Compl.\") at \u00b6 1.) Now before the Court is MedImmune's motion to dismiss the Complaint-in-Intervention for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b). (Doc. No. 123.) For the reasons discussed below, MedImmune's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case begins not with the New York Attorney General, but with Dr. Susan Vierczhalek (\"Relator\"), a licensed pediatrician and attending physician at Bellevue Hospital Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 102 \u00b6 44.) On April 17, 2009, Vierczhalek filed a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   complaint (Doc. No. 70 (the \"Original Complaint\" or \"Original Compl.\") ), on behalf of the United States and 19 states (the\n   \"States\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   against MedImmune, Trinity Homecare LLC (\"Trinity\"), and OptionCare (\"OptionCare\") - for violation of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the States' FCA equivalents. (Original Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-23.) The theory underlying Vierczhalek's Original Complaint was that MedImmune, Trinity, and OptionCare violated the FCA by promoting so-called \"off-label\" uses of Synagis. (Original Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3,4.) In other words, \"the conditions that prompted the prescriptions of Synagis were not the FDA-approved indications, but rather a much more lenient set of broad criteria.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) According to Vierczhalek, the alleged off-label promotion \"illegally influenced physicians to prescribe ... Synagis when they otherwise would not have prescribed [it].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vierczhalek's case was stayed for a number of years as the States and the United States decided whether or not to intervene in the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20190\">\n    N.Y. State Fin. Law \u00a7 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b). On June 19, 2015, New York filed a notice of election to intervene, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Finance%20Law%20%C2%A7%20190\">\n    N.Y. State Finance Law \u00a7 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(b), as to Defendants Trinity and OptionCare. Concurrently with that notice, New York filed a proposed stipulation and order of dismissal, whereby Trinity and OptionCare jointly agreed to pay $22.4 million dollars. (Doc. No. 34 at 8.) All claims against Trinity and OptionCare were thereafter dismissed. (Doc. Nos. 35, 36.) Pursuant to whistleblower provisions of New York state law, Vierczhalek herself received $4,040,808.84 as part of the settlement. (Doc. No. 34 at 9.) Nevertheless, New York continued its examination of Vierczhalek's allegations with respect to MedImmune.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, on March 31, 2017, New York elected to intervene and filed the Complaint-in-Intervention against MedImmune. (Doc. No. 49.) New York seeks to recover treble damages and civil penalties under the New York State False Claims Act, and to obtain a variety of other relief under related New York state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The theory of New York's Complaint-in-Intervention differs notably from the theory underpinning Vierczhalek's Original Complaint. Instead of focusing on off-label promotion, New York alleges that MedImmune engaged in a kickback scheme with Trinity, which resulted in Trinity presenting \"false claims to Medicaid for Synagis from January 2007 through March 2011.\" (Compl. \u00b6 3.) The gist of the scheme, as alleged, can be summarized as follows. Synagis is used to prevent the onset of lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (\"RSV\"). (Compl. \u00b6 69.) Synagis was approved by the FDA in 1998, and is prescribed to infants who are at risk of contracting RSV - ordinarily, babies who are born prematurely or who have heart or lung diseases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Trinity is a specialized pharmacy that \"dispenses and delivers drugs to patient homes [and] provides or arranges for homecare services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) It also \"controlled the Medicaid business for Synagis in New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thus, according to the Complaint-in-Intervention, MedImmune salespersons - dubbed the \"Synagis people\" by hospital staff (Compl. \u00b6 132) - would curry favor with hospital administrators, including nurses and doctors, in order to gain access to the neo-natal intensive care unit (\"NICU\"). (Compl. \u00b6 43.) That access allowed\n   MedImmune to obtain \"confidential personal information about specific babies from NICU logbooks and hospital records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) This information, otherwise known as protected health information (\"PHI\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12), typically included an infant's name, gender, date of birth, medical record number, gestational birth weight, and hospital notes, as well as the mother's name, address, insurance information, and phone number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Of particular interest to MedImmune (and to Trinity) was the PHI of babies born prematurely, as these infants would be prime candidates for Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) Once in possession of the PHI, MedImmune would pass the information along to Trinity so that Trinity could use it as \"leads\" for its pharmaceutical representatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) In other words, Trinity used the PHI to pursue patients who would potentially need Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving the PHI, Trinity would contact the infant's pediatrician or parents and attempt to secure a prescription for Synagis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) The end goal was to turn these PHI-leads into \"Trinity customers for outpatient Synagis prescriptions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) Trinity would then present Synagis claims for reimbursement through New York's Medicaid program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) New York alleges that this scheme, which ran from 2007 to 2011 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187), resulted in \"millions of dollars of Synagis Medicaid claims presented by Trinity\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120). MedImmune benefited as sales of Synagis increased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 22, 2018, MedImmune moved to dismiss the Complaint-in-Intervention. (Doc. No. 124.) Specifically, MedImmune argues that New York has not adequately pleaded a violation of the state or federal anti-kickback statutes. MedImmune also argues that New York has failed to sufficiently demonstrate a violation of the New York False Claims Act or its other state law claims. The motion was fully briefed on June 4, 2018.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Complaint-in-Intervention sets forth six causes of action. Counts 1 and 2 allege violations of the New York State False Claims Act (\"NYFCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Finance%20Law%20%C2%A7%20189\">\n    N.Y.

The Court will address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. New York False Claims Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The NYFCA makes liable any person who: \"(a) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented[,] a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval [or] (b) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20189\">\n    N.Y.

(Compl. \u00b6 194.) These certifications were allegedly false because while they represented that Trinity furnished Synagis in \"compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations,\" Trinity and MedImmune were actually in violation of state and federal anti-kickback prohibitions. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017468\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/120/370/#p381\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues that New York has failed to make out a claim for breach of the NYFCA on three grounds. First, MedImmune insists that New York has not pleaded a violation of New York State's anti-kickback statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Soc.%20Serv.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20366\">\n    N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -f(1)(b), or the federal anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(1)(A). Second, MedImmune asserts that the representations contained in Trinity's Medicaid billing certifications were too generic to constitute a false statement. And finally, MedImmune argues that the allegedly false statements were not material. The Court will address each of the three arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The federal anti-kickback statute proscribes \"knowingly and willfully offer[ing] or pay[ing] any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) ... to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made ... under a Federal health care program.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A), (B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under New York's theory of liability, MedImmune is the entity \"offer[ing] or pay[ing] any remuneration,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2), and the \"remuneration\" is the PHI. The entity that \"purchase[s], lease[s] or order[s] any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Soc.%20Serv.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20366\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , is Trinity. And the \"good\" that is \"purchase[d]\" - or that one \"recommend[s] purchasing\" - is Synagis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MedImmune argues that it did not violate the federal anti-kickback statute because the term \"remuneration\" does not encompass PHI. (Doc. No. 124 at 9, 10.) The statute, however, is not so narrow, and the Court sees no reason to read the word \"remuneration,\" at least at this early stage in the litigation, to exclude PHI. Remuneration is defined under the federal statute as \"transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value.\" 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1320a-7a(i)(6). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (\"HHS-OIG\") has explained that remuneration may include \"the offer or payment of anything of value for patient referrals.\"\n   <em>\n    OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2023731\">\n    68 Fed.

Even if \"fair market value\" is the proper lodestar for assessing whether or not a given item amounts to \"remuneration\" - and the Court is doubtful of that premise - New York adequately pleads that PHI had such market value. Given that PHI revealed a host of proprietary data about infants in the NICU, it is obvious that PHI retained more than just \"nominal value\" since it was instrumental in developing leads targeting particular doctors and patients.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

In sum, the Court is satisfied that New York has adequately pleaded that the sharing of PHI with specialty pharmacies could plausibly constitute \"remuneration\" in violation of the federal anti-kickback statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   MedImmune also argues that New York has not alleged the existence of a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   between MedImmune and Trinity, since \"Trinity provided nothing to MedImmune in return that can fairly be characterized as a 'referral of services' or the 'purchase, lease or order' of anything.\" (Doc.

And New York explicitly, and repeatedly, points out that MedImmune provided \"remuneration to Trinity [in the form of PHI] to induce referrals of Synagis.\" (Compl. \u00b6 92.) Indeed, the \"more than 1250 baby leads and/or referrals\" to Trinity \"resulted in millions of dollars in Synagis Medicaid claims ... presented [to New York].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Complaint-in-Intervention clearly alleges that MedImmune sought to induce Trinity to \"recommend Synagis\" to patients and doctors.

The\n   <em>\n    quo\n   </em>\n   , according to the Complaint-in-Intervention, is obvious: Trinity would recommend Synagis to patients and doctors, thereby \"increas[ing] sales of Synagis for MedImmune paid for with public funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120.) For all these reasons, the Court is persuaded that the Complaint-in-Intervention has adequately alleged a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.

Mass. 2011). Against this backdrop, New York has plausibly alleged that the purported violations were material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B. Remaining Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In addition to its NYFCA claim, New York also brings claims alleging violations of New York Social Services Law \u00a7 145-b, New York Executive Laws \u00a7\u00a7 63(12) and 63-c, and unjust enrichment. MedImmune moves to dismiss those claims as well. (Doc. No. 124 at 18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   New York Social Services Law \u00a7 145-b makes it \"unlawful for any person ... knowingly by means of a false statement or representation, or by deliberate concealment of any material fact[,] ... to attempt to obtain or to obtain payment from public funds for services or supplies furnished.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Soc.%20Serv.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20145\">\n    N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   MedImmune argues that this claim should be dismissed because the \"Social Services Law does not impose liability for\n   <em>\n    causing another\n   </em>\n   to make a misrepresentation.\" (Doc. No. 124 at 18-19.) But Section 145-b clearly provides that \"[w]here public welfare benefits are obtained fraudulently by an entity ... the individual supervising, overseeing, performing or conspiring to effectuate the fraudulent acts can be held personally responsible, and is liable for treble damages.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Brooklyn Psychosocial Rehab. Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1093295\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/185/230/#p234\">\n    185 A.D.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20N.Y.S.2d%20776\">\n    585 N.Y.S.2d 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Dep't 1992). Here, New York has expressly alleged that MedImmune conspired to target Medicaid patients through the use of improperly obtained PHI. The Complaint-in-Intervention clearly alleges that this was a sophisticated scheme carried out by industry leaders who understood what they were doing. Therefore, New York has adequately pleaded a violation of Section \u00a7 145-b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   New York's claims under New York Executive Laws \u00a7\u00a7 63(12) and 63-c are also sufficiently pleaded. MedImmune recognizes that these provisions do not \"create a new cause of action, but rather give[ ] an additional remedy upon which the State can recover.\" (Doc. No. 124 at 19). Therefore, MedImmune's arguments for dismissal are premised on the contention there is no valid NYFCA or Section 145-b claim to permit recovery under Sections 63(12) and 63-c. However, since the Court has denied MedImmune's motion to dismiss the NYFCA and Section 145-b claims, it necessarily follows that this derivative motion must also be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects MedImmune's motion to dismiss the state's unjust enrichment claim. Under New York law, unjust enrichment requires (1) that the defendant was enriched, (2) at the plaintiff's expense, and (3) it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit.\n   <em>\n    Phillips Int'l Inv. LLC v. Pektor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297584\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/117/1/#p4\">\n    117 A.D.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297584\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/117/1/#p4\">\n    982 N.Y.S.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dep't 2014). As the discussion above makes clear, New York plausibly alleges that MedImmune engaged in a scheme designed to present false claims to the state for reimbursement, which had the end purpose of enriching MedImmune by \"increasing sales of Synagis.\" (Compl. \u00b6 12.) Moreover, MedImmune only argues that the claim should be dismissed because \"the State has failed to otherwise plead a viable cause of action.\" (Doc. No. 124 at 20.) But given the Court's rulings with respect to the NYFCA and Section 145-b claims, MedImmune's motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim on this ground must also be denied.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Bilotta v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4051638\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/50/497/#p539\">\n    50 F.Supp.3d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (rejecting motion to dismiss Section 145-b, Sections 63(12) and 63-c, and unjust enrichment claims because underlying FCA violation was well-pleaded).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, MedImmune's motion to dismiss the Complaint-in-Intervention is DENIED.
