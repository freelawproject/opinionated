Defendant Xavier Becerra filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss three of those claims: Claim 1 alleging a violation of U.S. Const.

This motion to dismiss does not address the Plaintiffs' other six claims alleging violations of the Second Amendment. Defendant also asks the Court to take judicial notice of two exhibits, the Proposition 63 ballot measure and his web page titled Certificate of Eligibility. The motion to dismiss is denied as to Claim 1 (Commerce Clause), granted as to Claim 8 (Equal Protection Clause), and denied as to Claim 9 (Federal Preemption).

Def. Mem. of P.A. in Supp., 14. But unlike the shark fin prohibition in\n   <em>\n    Chinatown\n   </em>\n   , Proposition 63's reach goes beyond California's borders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285466\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/794/1136/#p1139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"California's 'Shark Fin Law' makes it 'unlawful for any person to possess, sell, offer for sale, trade, or distribute a shark fin'\n   <em>\n    in the state.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Proposition 63 now prohibits a seller of ammunition physically located outside of the state from selling directly to customers in California.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30312(b). Thus, prior to January 1, 2018, any merchant physically located outside California was permitted to sell ammunition directly to a customer in California, whether the transaction was accomplished\n   by U.S. Mail, email, an internet web store, telephone text message, or telephone. Shipping arrangements were left up to the seller and buyer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since January 1, 2018, Proposition 63 criminalizes all of those transactions with merchants conducting business in other states, for example: Plaintiff Able's Sporting, Inc. (Texas), Plaintiff AMDEP Holdings, LLC (Florida), and Plaintiff R &amp; S Firearms, Inc. (Arizona). These direct transactions are permitted now only if the out-of-state merchant opens a physical store in California and obtains,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a California ammunition vendor license. Def. Mem. of P. &amp; A.,11 (\"And an out-of-state ammunition vendor that has a physical store in California may obtain a license and sell ammunition in California.\"). The only alternative appears to be if a third-party California-based and California-licensed intermediary is hired to complete the delivery. Even then, the out-of-state product must be delivered to the customer in a face-to-face hand-off. Unless shippers like United Parcel Service, FedEx, and DHL obtain ammunition vendor licenses, a California consumer will no longer be able to receive ammunition products from out-of-state sellers at their home. Consumers will have to travel from their homes to a California-licensed ammunition vendor - whether the vendor does business one mile away or one hundred miles away. As a result, out-of-state businesses who want to continue to sell directly to their California customers will have to open not just one store front inside California, but store fronts in every local market inside California in which they seek to sell ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Proposition 63's restrictions on out-of-state business firms are similar to the constraint on interstate commerce struck down in\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Biweekly\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Biweekly\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, California's statute does precisely what the Supreme Court says cannot be done except in the \"narrowest circumstances,\" it requires any corporation that wants to engage in a certain kind of business within the state to become a resident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   If states were allowed to require local incorporation as a condition of engaging in interstate commerce, then national corporations could be required to incorporate in all 50 states in order to do business-either by creating an individual subsidiary for each state or by some similar means.

Defendant says that both must complete a sale through a third-party ammunition vendor and that therefore, the regulation is even handed. But how a state disfavors its resident online sellers compared to its resident brick-and-mortar sellers is of no moment for commerce clause analysis. What is important is that California's resident businesses are the only businesses that may sell directly to ammunition consumers. Sales of any quantity, by all other sellers, anywhere else in the country, must be funneled through a California resident vendor licensed to sell ammunition.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Biweekly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265795\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/716/#p736\">\n    873 F.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The correct comparison, however, is between California corporations that are organized for the purpose of being [insurance] proraters and out-of-state corporations that are organized for the purpose of being proraters....

To the extent that the burden is not specifically described by the Complaint, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court draws inferences in the non-movant's favor. Certainly in this case, there is a reasonable inference to be drawn in Plaintiffs' favor that Proposition 63 significantly burdens interstate commerce. Moreover, the degree of burden and how it compares to the benefits of Proposition 63 are predominantly fact questions that are not ripe for a motion to dismiss. As the U.S. Supreme Court teaches, \"[w]e generally leave the courtroom door open to plaintiffs invoking the rule in\n   <em>\n    Pike\n   </em>\n   , that even nondiscriminatory burdens on commerce may be struck down on a showing that those burdens clearly outweigh the benefits of a state or local practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue of Kentucky v.

Specifically, \u00a7 926A provides a safe harbor,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting,\n   shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any\n   <em>\n    ammunition\n   </em>\n   being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: Provided, That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver's compartment the firearm or\n   <em>\n    ammunition\n   </em>\n   shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 926A (emphasis added).

In fact, \u00a7 30314 says nothing about simple possession of ammunition.

Thus, \u00a7 926A only preempts state law where \"there is a direct and positive conflict between [ \u00a7 926A ] and the law of the State so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20927\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because California prohibits a resident from bringing foreign-bought ammunition back into the state, while federal law entitles a person to transport a firearm (and its ammunition) for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm, there appears to be a direct and positive conflict between the two laws. The direct conflict is at the point of coming into the state. Section 30314 prohibits travel (or bringing) into the state foreign-bought ammunition; \u00a7 926A affirmatively entitles a person to transport into the state a firearm and ammunition - regardless of where it is obtained.
