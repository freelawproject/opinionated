Graff brings this suit to recover three paintings that his wife pawned to Defendant Biltmore Loan and Jewelry Scottsdale LLC (\"Biltmore\"), and of which Biltmore then sold two at auction after Graff's wife defaulted on her loan. In his second amended complaint, Graff brings claims against Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, Inc. (\"Leslie Hindman\"), Biltmore, and The Owings Gallery, Inc. (the \"Owings Gallery\"), Nathaniel O. Owings,\n   Ray Harvey, Zaplin-Lampert Gallery, Inc., and Jim Parks (collectively, the \"Owings Defendants\"). He alleges claims for conversion, unjust enrichment, replevin, detinue, promissory estoppel, promissory fraud, and civil conspiracy. Biltmore moves to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) or, alternatively, to transfer the case to the District of Arizona pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Court agrees that Graff has not sufficiently established Biltmore's contacts with Illinois to subject it to jurisdiction in this Court with respect to the claims Graff brings against it. Leslie Hindman and the Owings Defendants also move to dismiss the claims against them pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because Graff has not sufficiently pleaded that the paintings are his separate property, and Texas law only allows him to seek recovery from his wife for disposition of community property, and not against third parties, the Court dismisses the claims against Leslie Hindman and the Owings Defendants, disposing of the entirety of the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Graff, who lives in Dallas, Texas, owned three pieces of Western American art. First, on May 18, 2002, he purchased\n   <em>\n    Taos Indians and the Sangre de Cristos\n   </em>\n   , an oil painting by Oscar Edmund Berninghaus (the \"Berninghaus painting\"). On May 13, 2006, he purchased\n   <em>\n    Snow Capped Mountains\n   </em>\n   , also referred to as\n   <em>\n    Meadow with Cattle\n   </em>\n   , an oil painting by William Victor Higgins (the \"Higgins painting\"). On July 29, 2009, he purchased\n   <em>\n    By the Light of the Moon\n   </em>\n   , an oil painting by Frank B. Hoffman (the \"Hoffman painting\"). Graff claims to have been the sole owner of these paintings, with them remaining his separate property since the date of purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 28, 2003, Graff married Deborah Graff. In January 2013, Deborah filed for divorce in Dallas, Texas. The Dallas County District Courts have a standing order applicable to all divorce proceedings, which provides that, during the pendency of the suit, both parties to the proceeding are to refrain from \"[s]elling, transferring, assigning, mortgaging, encumbering, or in any other manner alienating any of the property of either party, whether personal property or real property, and whether separate or community, except as specifically authorized by this order.\" Doc. 81 at 43. But while the divorce proceeding was ongoing, Deborah took the Berninghaus, Higgins, and Hoffman paintings from the Graffs' marital home in Dallas without Graff's permission and pawned them to Biltmore, located in Arizona. She thereafter defaulted on her loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Once Deborah defaulted, Biltmore contracted with Leslie Hindman, located in Chicago, Illinois, to sell the three paintings\n   at auction. Biltmore sent the three paintings to Chicago, and Leslie Hindman received them around September 25, 2015. At the Leslie Hindman-organized auction, Biltmore sold the Berninghaus painting to an individual living in Dallas, Texas. Biltmore also sold the Higgins painting to the Owings Defendants. Owings organized this group to purchase the Higgins painting at the auction. The Hoffman painting did not sell at the auction and currently remains in Biltmore's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after the auction, in November 2015, Graff learned for the first time that Deborah had removed the Higgins painting from his home and that the Owings Defendants had it in their possession. He learned of this by searching Leslie Hindman's sale records after he found out that Leslie Hindman had auctioned off the Berninghaus painting. Graff also discovered that the Hoffman painting had not sold during auction. Graff then called Harvey for advice and help locating a lawyer to aid in getting back his three paintings. Graff did not know that Harvey belonged to the group that had purchased the Higgins painting, but Harvey realized this when speaking to Graff. Harvey informed Graff the next day and told him that he could not help Graff and that he had spoken to Owings, who told Harvey that the Owings Defendants had title to the Higgins painting, which would be sold. Graff then contacted Owings, telling him that the Higgins painting had been wrongly taken from him and that he wanted it back. Owings indicated that he still had the Higgins painting, he would not sell it, and he would contact Leslie Hindman about it. But despite this conversation, the Owings Defendants sold the Higgins painting. The sale has since been reversed, and the Owings Gallery has possession of the Higgins painting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Graff has regained possession of the Berninghaus painting. He has demanded the return of the Higgins painting from the Owings Defendants and the Hoffman painting from the Biltmore. But these Defendants have refused to return these two paintings to Graff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges whether the Court has jurisdiction over a party.

It, along with a related business, Biltmore Loan and Jewelry-Chandler, LLC, maintains websites at www.biltmoreloanandjewelry.com and www.biltmoreloan.com. Biltmore's website states that its service areas are all in Arizona, specifically, Mesa, Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, and Chandler. To enter into a pawn transaction with Biltmore, a customer must appear in person at Biltmore's Scottsdale or Chandler location. As relevant to this case, Deborah learned of Biltmore through one of Biltmore's associates in Dallas. After Deborah made initial contact with Biltmore, David Goldstein, one of Biltmore's members, flew to Dallas and inspected the three paintings at issue. Deborah then flew to Scottsdale with the paintings and entered into two transactions with Biltmore on October 31, 2014 and December 16, 2014. The pawn tickets Deborah signed, which list the paintings at issue in this case as pledged goods, state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   All information in this report is complete and accurate.

Specifically, Marc Israel, Biltmore's manager of business operations, worked with Leslie Hindman's Zachary Wirsum and entered into a consignment agreement dated April 28, 2015. The consignment agreement provides that Leslie Hindman would act as Biltmore's agent to sell the paintings. Pursuant to the consignment agreement, Biltmore agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Illinois courts \"for any suit or proceeding seeking equitable or injunctive relief arising from [the] agreement.\" Doc. 49-1 at 21. Israel communicated with Wirsum by phone and email from Arizona, with the knowledge that Wirsum was located in Illinois. Biltmore then sent the paintings to Leslie Hindman in Chicago by UPS. No one from Biltmore attended the auctions of the paintings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Biltmore argues that Graff's claims against it have no significant relation with Illinois, focusing on the fact that Deborah took the paintings from Graff in Texas and pawned them to Biltmore in Arizona. Biltmore therefore argues that to the extent any conversion took place, it occurred before the paintings reached Leslie Hindman for the auction in Illinois. Biltmore also contends that Graff's claims of unjust enrichment, replevin, and detinue do not amount to separate claims but rather are remedies, with the wrongful conduct for which Graff seeks these remedies again not occurring in Illinois but rather in Texas or Arizona.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Graff responds that the\n   conduct underlying his claims took place in Illinois, focusing on the fact that Biltmore sold the paintings through Leslie Hindman at auction.

Ill. Mar. 20, 2017) (finding that plaintiffs could not establish personal jurisdiction for tort claims where no evidence existed that defendants had knowledge that plaintiffs would be injured in Illinois). Indeed, the purchasers of the two sold paintings did not reside in Illinois, with Illinois instead only the location of a prominent auction house Biltmore decided to use to sell the paintings. And Graff's argument of injury in Illinois rings especially hollow because one of the paintings did not sell at auction and instead was returned to Biltmore in Arizona, meaning that Graff's argument for personal jurisdiction over the conversion claim for that painting fails. Therefore, because the conversion at issue occurred prior to the auction that took place in Illinois, any connections between Biltmore and Leslie Hindman related to the subsequent auction of the paintings do not aid Graff in establishing personal jurisdiction over Biltmore for the conversion claims. His conversion claims therefore cannot proceed in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, the Court does not find that Biltmore has sufficient contacts with\n   Illinois with respect to Graff's other claims against it to subject Biltmore to personal jurisdiction on those claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The underlying conduct-Biltmore's receipt of the paintings from Deborah in Arizona and its subsequent assumption of possession of those paintings once she defaulted on her loans from Biltmore-has no connection to Illinois.

Sufficiency of the Claims against Leslie Hindman and the Owings Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   All of Graff's claims rely on his allegation that the paintings were his separate property. Leslie Hindman and the Owings Defendants argue, however, that this allegation is merely an unsupported legal conclusion and that, under Texas law, the paintings are presumed to be community property. Treating the paintings as community property, these Defendants contend that Graff may not maintain any of his claims against them. Graff does not dispute that Texas law governs the characterization of the paintings as either separate or community property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 62 at 9 n.2. Instead, he contends that he has properly pleaded that the paintings constitute separate property and that the Court should not apply any presumptions concerning their treatment as community property at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under Texas law, \"[c]ommunity property consists of the property, other than separate property, acquired by either spouse during marriage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.002\">\n    Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7 3.002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Separate property consists of: \"(1) the property owned or claimed by the spouse before marriage; (2) the property acquired by the spouse during marriage by gift, devise, or descent; and (3) the recovery for personal injuries sustained by the spouse during marriage, except any recovery for loss of earning capacity during marriage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.001\">\n    Tex. Fam. Code Ann. \u00a7 3.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Graff pleads that he purchased the Berninghaus painting before his marriage but the Higgins and Hoffman paintings while married to Deborah. He does not include any facts to suggest that the Higgins and Hoffman paintings meet the definition of separate property under \u00a7 3.001. Additionally, \"[p]roperty possessed by either spouse during or on dissolution of marriage is presumed to be community property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%203.003\">\n    Tex.

Despite pleading in conclusory fashion that all the paintings were his own separate property, Graff also acknowledges that during the divorce proceedings, Deborah had possession of the three paintings, taking them from their marital home in Dallas and pawning them to Biltmore. This then gives rise to the presumption that all three, including the Berninghaus\n   painting purchased prior to Graff and Deborah's marriage, were community property. Graff's second amended complaint fails to overcome this presumption with his pleading of the bare legal conclusion that he was the \"sole owner\" of the paintings.
