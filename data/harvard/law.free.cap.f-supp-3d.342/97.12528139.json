After Norris's age discrimination claim was dismissed in February 2017, WMATA now moves for summary judgment on the four remaining claims. Having reviewed the parties' filings, the Court grants in part and denies in part WMATA's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

WMATA employs Service Operations Managers (\"SOMs\") in different geographic regions in the Washington, D.C. service area to oversee and provide direction to its 2,500 bus operators.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The service area is divided into four principal regions, including, as relevant to this suit, the Four Mile Region, which covers routes serving Virginia and the Shepherd Parkway area of Southeast D.C.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Norris joined WMATA in 1990 and became a SOM between 2000 and 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 9:1-9:12, Pl.'s Ex. 1, ECF No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. December 2013 Promotion and January 2014 Demotion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 1, 2013, Norris was promoted from SOM to Assistant Superintendent of Street Operations, with a six-month probationary period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 18, ECF No. 19. As Assistant Superintendent, Norris was in charge of ensuring SOMs performed their duties, handling administrative and HR requests or issues concerning SOMs, responding to accidents, and overseeing departments in the Bus Operation Control Center.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 12:18-13:12. She was assigned to the Four Mile Division and typically oversaw between 20 and 25 SOMs on her daily shift.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:15-14:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As an Assistant Superintendent, Norris's supervisors were Darlene Harrington, the Superintendent of Street Operations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 6; Norris Dep. 38:10-38:15, and Dana Baker, the Director, Operations Control Center of Bus Transportation, Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 3; Walker Dep. 43:9-44:6, Pl.'s Ex. 3, ECF No. 19. Like Norris, both Harrington and Baker are African-American females.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5. Norris sought approval from Harrington, sometimes copying Baker, for a variety of communications to SOMs during her time as Assistant Superintendent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris SOM Communications, Pl.'s Ex. 6, ECF No. 19. On one occasion, Norris was told by Baker that she was \"documenting[,]\" when Baker needed \"somebody [she] [could] trust.\" Norris Dep. 76:16-77:13. Baker told Norris on another occasion that she did not like working with women,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 11, Pl.'s Ex. 19, ECF No. 19, and another WMATA employee who worked with Baker when she was Director also heard her state on multiple occasions that she did not like working with women,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Collins Sr. Decl. \u00b6 2, Pl.'s Ex. 18, ECF No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between December 2013 and January 2014, Norris was the subject of a formal harassment complaint by a SOM, Sharron Young.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 26:21-27:13. Young's complaint was eventually dismissed after WMATA investigated her claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Norris Dep. 28:16-29:10, Pl.'s Ex. 1, ECF No. 21. Norris had a difficult relationship with two other SOMs,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:2-36:14, 38:19-39:3, including\n   Claire Fenelus, a SOM who ultimately took part in a meeting with Norris, Harrington, and Baker on January 11, 2014 to resolve her issues with Norris,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:1-37:17, 84:5-84:9; Fenelus Letter, Pl.'s Ex. 7, ECF No. 19. It is unclear whether Fenelus's issues were actually resolved at the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   WMATA Demotion Memo. 1, Pl.'s Ex. 10, ECF No. 19,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Fenelus Letter. Norris also made her own complaints of harassment against Baker and Harrington, first to Harrington and another WMATA employee, Romaino Parahoo, on or around January 14, 2014, and then directly to both Baker and Harrington at a January 27, 2014 meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 12-13. At the meeting, Norris informed Baker and Harrington that she planned to file a harassment complaint with the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 30, 2014, three days after the January 27 meeting and two months after her promotion, Norris was demoted back to SOM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 19. Norris attended a meeting with Harrington, Baker, and another WMATA employee, Ray Alfred, where Harrington read to Norris a demotion memorandum stating the reasons for her demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resps. To Pl.'s Interrogs. \u00b6 13, Pl.'s Ex. 11, ECF No. 19. The memorandum, addressed from Harrington to Norris and copying Baker, listed multiple issues with Norris's behavior that had allegedly led to her demotion: first, Norris had been repeatedly communicating with staff without first clearing the communications with Harrington, despite Harrington giving Norris a verbal warning on the issue following a December 2, 2013 communication; second, two complaints of harassment had been filed by two separate SOMs against Norris in the past few weeks; third, Norris had provided verbal approval to cover expenses for overnight hotel accommodations for six SOMs on January 21, 2014 without first obtaining authorization; and finally fourth, Norris had been involved in a \"hostile, overly argumentative, and inappropriate conversation with Linda Pinkard, Assistant Superintendent of Street Operations[,] ...\" on January 22, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Demotion Memo., Pl.'s Ex. 10, ECF No. 19. Following her demotion, Norris went on leave around March 2014 and resumed working as a SOM around April 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. July 2014 Assignment Selection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to 2013, SOMs had been selecting their work assignments and shifts at WMATA based on seniority, in a process known as \"the pick[.]\" Baker Aff. \u00b6 10, Def.'s Ex. 1, ECF No. 17. Baker eliminated the pick in June 2013, and between June 2013 and July 2014 SOMs were assigned to shifts and assignments based on their skills, experience, and on WMATA's operational needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Statement of Facts \u00b6 8-9. During that time, Assistant Superintendents worked together with the Superintendent of Bus Services to identify and recommend work assignments for each SOM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Baker had final say as to the assignments.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Starting in July 2014, SOMs were allowed to submit their preferred work assignment choices for consideration by WMATA as part of the work assignment process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because she had been demoted back to a SOM in January 2014, Norris participated in the July 2014 work assignment process and submitted her work assignment preferences\n   for consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Norris submitted six choices for consideration.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   She indicated on her work selection form that \"if possible, [she] would like to remain at FMTR Region[,]\" and only selected assignments located in the Four Mile Region, Work Selection Choices, Pl.'s Ex. 13, ECF No. 19, in order to avoid working in another region under the supervision of one of Baker's friends at WMATA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 22. Of the six work assignment preferences, at least four involved \"early straight\" schedules, starting in the early morning and ending in the early afternoon every day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Work Selection Choices; Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet, Pl.'s Ex. 15, ECF No. 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Norris prefers an early straight schedule and the majority of her shifts in the latter part of her career have been early straights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 14:5-14:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Norris received her sixth preferred choice in the July 2014 work assignment, a \"swing shift\" from 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM and 03:00 PM to 07:00 PM daily.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Work Selection Choices; Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet. The work assignment was located in the Four Mile Region.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Non-Selection to Metro Way\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   One of the assignments Norris expressed an interest in as part of the July 2014 work assignment process was Metro Way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 20; Work Selection Choices; Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet. Metro Way was a new type of bus service operating exclusive routes between Alexandria and Arlington, VA, developed by Assistant Superintendent William Proctor in conjunction with WMATA's Planning Department and Virginia transportation officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WMATA Position Statement at 7. Metro Way offered early straight shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Norris was not given a Metro Way assignment, despite selecting a Metro Way route as her second choice on her work selection form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Work Selection Choices; Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet. She reached out to Harrington after assignments were given out to ask \"[w]hy ... Metro Way [was] not offered to [her][.]\" July 29, 2018 Harrington E-mail, Pl.'s Ex. 16, ECF No. 19. Harrington replied on July 29, 2014 that she was not selected for the position because \"[o]ther candidate(s) were found to be better suited[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Metro Way assignment went to two men and two women, all of whom had significantly less experience as SOMs than Norris.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet; October 20, 2014 Pick Spreadsheet, Pl.'s Ex. 12, ECF No. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Non-Selection to the Accident Investigation Team\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Another assignment Norris sought to obtain in July 2014 was a slot on WMATA's Accident Investigation Team (\"AIT\"), a newly created unit where SOMs would exclusively focus on investigating accidents across all regions in which WMATA operated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walker Dep. 124:13-125:1; Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 14. The AIT assignment process operated similarly to others in that Assistant Superintendents and the Superintendent made recommendations to Baker, who had ultimate say over the assignments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 14-15. However, SOMs did not have the opportunity to elect a preference for the assignment on their work selection form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 135:1-135:13. Rather,\n   Norris was first told that she was qualified to join the AIT in June 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   August 14, 2014 WMATA Formal Discrimination Complaint, Def.'s Ex. 5, ECF No. 17; June 26, 2014 Pinkard E-mail, Pl.'s Ex. 14, Ex. 19. On June 26, Norris was included in an e-mail to 17 SOMs informing them that they had \"been identified by [their] Asst. Supt. has [sic] a candidate for the New Accident Investigation Team[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 26, 2014 Pinkard E-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shortly after she learned about the AIT opportunity, Norris had a conversation about the assignment with Assistant Superintendent Alphonso Walton.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 26. Walton was Norris's supervisor, prepared her 2014 evaluation plan, and conducted her mid-year evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Norris 2014 Performance Management Form 3, Pl.'s Ex. 17, ECF No. 19. It is alleged that Walton was also a known sexual harasser in the office,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Walker Dep. 166:4-166:19; Sept. 16, 2014 EEOC Charge, Def.'s Ex. 7, ECF No. 17, who regularly made inappropriate and sexually explicit comments when talking to Norris,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sept. 16, 2014 EEOC Charge, and who was at some point disciplined for sexually harassing another WMATA employee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Walker Dep. 108:15-109:4. During the conversation between Norris and Walton, Norris alleges that Walton told her to \"trust him\" and asked if she could \"keep a secret from [her] husband[.]\" Norris Decl. \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sept. 16, 2014 EEOC Charge. Norris further alleges that Walton pointed to her vagina and asked her to \"give [him] some of that[,]\" stating that he would \"make sure you get that assignment[.]\" Norris Decl. \u00b6 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sept. 16, 2014 EEOC Charge. Norris refused his advances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Norris was ultimately not selected for the AIT. When she reached out to Harrington in July to ask about the Metro Way assignment, she also asked \"why ... the accident investigation team [was] offered to me by Mr. Walton and Ms. Pinkard then retrieved by Mr. Walton[.]\" July 29, 2014 Harrington E-mail. Harrington replied: \"[b]ased on your comment given to Mr. Walton your preference was to remain in Virginia, therefore you were granted your pervious [sic] assignment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    E. July 2014 EEOC Intake Questionnaire\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On July 25, 2014, Norris complained about discrimination she allegedly suffered at WMATA. As part of that process, Norris filled out an intake questionnaire with the EEOC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 25, 2014 Intake Questionnaire at 1. On the portion of the questionnaire asking the basis for her claim of employment discrimination, Norris checked the boxes for race, age, and discrimination, but circled the box for sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. She checked a box on the last page indicating that she wanted to file a charge of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In an attachment filed a few days later on July 29, 2014, Norris indicated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she was \"demoted without training, corrective action, disciplinary action, written notification or a thorough investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. She pointed out that \"through out [sic] [her] career [she] ha[d] been informed that [she was] different in reference to [her] afrocentric style\" and that \"Dana Baker never wanted [her] to be hired, therefore used false information for [sic] demotion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also suggested that \"[w]orking a shift at another division could possibility [sic] result in retaliation since I was demoted on January 27, 2014, after working as an Assistant Superintendent for 7 weeks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After discussing potential age discrimination in the failure to assign her to Metro Way, Norris noted in the penultimate paragraph of the attachment: \"in addition to this age discrimination, I also experienced sexual harassment but I refused to\n   support the claim at this time because victims of sexual harassment are victimized[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Norris did not otherwise mention sexual harassment in the attachment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 16, 2014, Norris filed an official charge of discrimination with the EEOC, alleging discrimination on the basis of age and sex as well as retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September 16, 2014 EEOC Charge. She filed her complaint with this Court on October 24, 2016, alleging quid pro quo sexual harassment, hostile work environment, gender discrimination, age discrimination, and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 102-71. After WMATA moved to dismiss the age discrimination claim for lack of jurisdiction and Norris consented, the Court dismissed the age discrimination claim on February 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 6, 2017 Minute Order; Def.'s Mot.

Norris argues in her opposition that she suffered an adverse action because both the Metro Way and the AIT assignments offered the opportunity for overtime,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 38-39, but only offers evidence to support her argument as to the Metro Way assignment. The sum total of the evidence Norris provides in support of her overtime claim can be summarized in a few sentences. The excerpts from Norris's deposition do not mention overtime.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. In her deposition, Walker noted that SOMs did not use to receive overtime but now do,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Walker Dep. 173:16-174:7, and that \"SOMs assigned to [Metro Way] received no additional compensation or benefits than [sic] SOMs working in other service areas[,]\" Walker Dep. 132:7-132:10. Norris stated in her declaration that the Metro Way assignment offered the opportunity for overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 20. The record before the Court is thus devoid of any evidence supporting the claim that the AIT assignment was overtime-eligible, while it contains conflicting statements as to whether the Metro Way assignment was. Similarly, Norris argues in her opposition that she \"has established that she was interested in the [AIT] because of ... comp overtime eligibility[.]\" Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 39. This is also unsupported by any of the evidence Norris provided in support for her opposition, including in statements she made in her deposition and declaration. The only reference to Norris's interest in overtime work is in Norris's declaration, and it concerns the Metro Way assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is axiomatic that conclusory assertions offered without any evidentiary support at the summary judgment stage do not establish a genuine issue for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene v.

Because Norris does not provide any evidence to support her assertion that the AIT assignment was eligible for overtime or that she was interested in the assignment because of the opportunity for overtime it offered, the Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the denial of the AIT assignment was not an adverse action. On the other hand, although skimpy, Norris did provide some evidence supporting her argument that the denial of the Metro Way assignment was adverse because of her interest in the overtime opportunity it offered, and WMATA did not address the overtime argument in its reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court thus declines to find that the failure to assign her to Metro Way was not adverse as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    b.

WMATA asserts a legitimate,\n   non-discriminatory reason for the failure to assign, and the Court must therefore \"resolve [the] central question\" of whether Norris \"produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the actual reason and that [WMATA] intentionally discriminated against [her][.]\"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Def.'s Reply at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   WMATA does not explain in any way how the individuals selected were better skilled than Norris or better fit WMATA's operational needs.

But Norris also states that she followed the directive,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3432760,9154774\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/872/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and provides e-mails sent between December 2013 and January 2014 showing that she requested approval on a variety of communications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Approval E-mails, Pl.'s Ex. 6, ECF No. 19. Norris also asserts that she followed the directive in her declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 16. WMATA argues that Norris's evidence is unconvincing but provides no contrary evidence in its reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   WMATA further supports the demotion by pointing to complaints for harassment made by two SOMs against Norris in January 2014, \"which [WMATA] ... concluded as having merit.\" Demotion Memo at 1. Norris first rebuts this assertion by pointing to a letter written by one of the complaining SOMs, Claire Fenelus, indicating that her complaint was resolved at a meeting prior to Norris's demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fenelus Letter. WMATA notes in its reply that Fenelus's letter \"uses hindsight to rationalize Ms. Fenelus' filing of her ... claim\" but \"does not invalidate that a ... claim was filed.\" Def.'s Reply at 5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, WMATA does not contest that the letter contradicts the demotion memo's assertion that WMATA found Fenelus's harassment claim to have merit after the meeting. With respect to the complaint by the other SOM, Sharron Young, WMATA supports the demotion by reference to a meeting held with WMATA's Office of Equal Employment and Employee Relations (\"EEOR\") where Norris allegedly declined\n   to discuss the matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Demotion Memo at 2. But Norris states in her deposition that Young's harassment charge was dropped at the conclusion of the meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Norris Dep. 29:7-29:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, WMATA justifies the demotion by arguing that Norris verbally approved hotel stays for SOMs without authorization on January 21, 2014 and was involved in a dispute with Pinkard on January 22, 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Demotion Memo at 2, both of which Norris denies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 16. Again, WMATA provides no supporting evidence in reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Several courts have found that an employee who challenges an asserted legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason only by providing evidence in the form of subjective, \"self-serving and conclusory statement[s]\" denying the asserted reason does not establish a genuine issue of material fact that can survive summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hastie v.

Norris similarly backs her statements with copies of e-mails and with a letter by one of the employees involved in the events alleged to form the basis for her termination.

In addition to the extremely short period of time between the time she raised her complaints and her demotion, Norris further alleges that Baker told her during her time as an Assistant Superintendent that she was \"documenting\" and therefore could not be trusted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Dep. 76:16-77:13. None of this is rebutted by WMATA in its reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Given that WMATA's asserted legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Norris's demotion is supported solely by the demotion memo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 4, and that Norris has put forward evidence both rebutting the asserted reason and suggesting a retaliatory motive, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to the reason for the demotion and a reasonable juror could conclude that retaliation was the actual motive. Consequently, the Court denies summary judgment on the retaliation claim as to the January 30, 2014 demotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2. July 2014 Shift Change and Failure to Assign to Metro Way or the AIT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As with Norris's gender discrimination claim, WMATA argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the July 2014 shift change was not an adverse action supporting a claim for retaliation under Title VII, and because it has a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for Norris's non-selections. In response, Norris again claims that the lost opportunity for overtime created by the AIT and MetroWay assignments is sufficient for the shift change to be adverse, and argues that the proffered legitimate, non-retaliatory reason is a pretext for retaliation. The Court denies summary judgment as to the failure to assign to Metro Way but otherwise grants it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"In the retaliation context, an 'adverse action' has a broader meaning than in a discrimination context.\"\n   <em>\n    Boone v.

Norris fails to meet even this more permissive standard with regards to the failure to assign her to the AIT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As discussed in part IV.A.2., Norris only supports her argument that the failure to assign her to the AIT or Metro Way was sufficiently adverse by arguing that her non-selection to these two positions denied her the opportunity to earn overtime. This argument is supported only by two sentences in her declaration, noting 1) that Metro Way was overtime-eligible, and 2) that she was interested in Metro Way because of that overtime eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Norris Decl. \u00b6 20. Absent any evidence regarding the availability or desirability of overtime for the AIT, the Court finds that Norris's non-selection to the AIT was not adverse. Because Norris did support her argument that her non-selection to Metro Way was adverse, the Court turns to\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   's burden-shifting framework. The Court accordingly considers whether Norris has provided sufficient\n   evidence to reasonably suggest that the stated reason for her non-selection to Metro Way was a pretext concealing retaliation, considering both the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, evidence that the stated reason is incorrect, and any other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3432760,9154774\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/872/\">\n    387 F.3d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As an initial matter, it is unclear whether Norris has established her prima facie case of retaliation.

WMATA argues that work assignments were distributed based on skills, experience, and the needs of the business during the July 2014 assignment process, Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 11, but Norris points out that she had vastly more experience than the four employees selected for the Metro Way assignment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n. at 40. In July 2014, Norris had over a decade of experience as a SOM, while the four employees selected all had very low seniority at WMATA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   October 20, 2014 Pick Spreadsheet. One of the selected employees, Shikeara DeCruise, had been a SOM for less than a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Walker Dep. 134:2-134:6. WMATA summarily argues that the four employees were more qualified\n   in its reply but does not explain why, or provide any evidence to support its argument that they provided a \"better fit[ ].\" Def.'s Reply at 6. When challenging an asserted legitimate, non-retaliatory reason based on qualifications, a qualifications gap between the Plaintiff and the employee selected can justify an inference of retaliation when it is \"great enough to be inherently indicative\" of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

WMATA fails to respond to the argument in its reply, or to point to any evidence of the selected employees' better qualifications. The evidence on the record thus indicates that there is a dispute of material fact as to whether WMATA's professed legitimate, non-retaliatory reason was a pretext for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   WMATA alternatively argues that Norris cannot prevail on her retaliation claim because there is \"no evidence that the manager who made the selection, Mr. William Proctor, had any idea that [she] was engaging in protected activity.\" Def.'s Reply at 6. The evidence on the record contradicts WMATA's assertion as to who was responsible for the Metro Way selection. WMATA does provide evidence that Proctor was solely responsible for assigning employees to Metro Way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Baker Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. However, one of the facts the parties indicated was not in dispute is that \"Assistant Superintendents worked collaboratively with the Superintendent of Bus Services to identify and recommend the work assignment for each SOM. Recommendations were then submitted to Director Baker for review and approval.\" Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6 10. This supposedly undisputed fact suggests that Baker, who was aware of multiple instances of protected activity by Norris, was the one with ultimate approval authority for Metro Way. There is therefore a dispute of material fact as to who had final say with regards to the Metro Way assignment, and WMATA's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Because there is sufficient dispute with respect to WMATA's asserted legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the Metro Way non-selection for a jury to reasonably find it to be false and a pretext for retaliation, the Court denies summary judgment as to retaliation based on the failure to assign Norris to Metro Way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Quid Pro Quo\n    </em>\n    Sexual Harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Norris brought a claim for quid pro quo sexual harassment based on Walton's alleged June 2014 statements offering to get her a spot on the AIT in exchange for sexual favors and her subsequent non-selection to the AIT.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   WMATA contends\n   that Walton's lack of ultimate control over the AIT assignment process entitles it to summary judgment.

WMATA notes that \"[a]fter being interviewed for a different sexual harassment investigation, Plaintiff ... filed her own claim of sexual harassment[.]\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 4. WMATA also points out that it \"promptly conducted its investigation ... and concluded there was no evidence to support ... sexual harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. But while the timing of Norris's sexual harassment claim and the results of WMATA's subsequent investigation may be relevant to the veracity of that claim, the Court cannot make credibility determinations on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Czekalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n    475 F.3d at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . WMATA's argument as to element 2 of the prima facie case is essentially an attack on Norris's credibility, because it is her word against Walton's. The Court will not address it at the summary judgment stage, and will leave the credibility determination for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Second, WMATA contends that Walton did not have the authority to appoint Norris to the AIT, because the assistant superintendents worked together to recommend candidates for Baker's final approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 5. However, while Norris does not dispute the process through which AIT assignments were made,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Facts \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, she notes that 1) Walton was one of the employees involved in making the recommendations for the AIT assignment, and 2) she has evidence indicating that Walton played a role in her not receiving the assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. Opp'n at 41-42. In the July 29, 2014 e-mail, Harrington told Norris that she was not selected \"based on [her] comments given to Mr. Walton\" about her preference to stay in Virginia. July 29, 2014 Harrington E-mail. Taking all inferences in Norris's favor, it would not be unreasonable for a jury to believe that Walton was directly responsible for Norris not being recommended for the AIT assignment, by making comments to others involved in the selection process to ensure that she would not be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   WMATA does not provide a legitimate reason for Norris's non-selection in response to her retaliation claim, but since it did so in response to her gender discrimination claim based on the same event, the Court briefly addresses it. In its motion, WMATA argues that it selected SOMs for the AIT \"based on the operational needs of the department and in consideration of [Norris's] written choices.\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 11. WMATA notes that \"[n]one of the AIT assignments were located in the Four Mile Region,\" when Norris \"expressed a desire in her written choices to remain in the Four Mile Region.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It concludes that \"an appointment to the AIT would have been inconsistent with Plaintiff's written preferences\" and that Norris ultimately received an assignment from her list of preferences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753162,3561423\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/475/360/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   WMATA supports its claims regarding the AIT assignment's availability with a spreadsheet of July 2014 work assignments, showing no AIT assignment in the Four Mile Region.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Work Assignment Spreadsheet, Def.'s Ex. 3, ECF No. 17. But Norris retorts in her opposition that there\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   AIT assignments in the Four Mile Region, and supports her allegations with a version of the very same spreadsheet containing additional pages showing that two employees assigned to the AIT in July 2014 worked out of the Four Mile Region.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Work Assignment Sheet. Because Norris provides evidence that directly contradicts the asserted legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, a reasonable juror could find that the asserted reason is a pretext covering up\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   sexual harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Def.'s Mem. Supp. at 6-7. Norris retorts that the claim is supported not just by Walton's actions and her non-selection to the AIT, but also by a multitude of other incidents between January and July 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem.

However, when considering all the evidence, Norris points to multiple instances of conduct that together could be reasonably construed as pervasive enough to support a claim for hostile work environment.

Norris mentioned in her EEOC charge that \"Walton would regularly, when speaking to her, make inappropriate and sexually explicit and offensive comments[,]\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EEOC Charge at 3, and in her WMATA complaint she noted that the June 2014 advances were \"not the first time Mr. Walton made sexual advances towards [her][,]\" WMATA Formal Discrimination Complaint at 2. In the complaint in this case, Norris similarly stated that Walton had made inappropriate comments to her starting in May 2014, including that her and her husband \"ain't doing nothing\" and she \"ought to give [him] some.\" Compl. \u00b6 67. She stated that Walton had placed his hand on her knee on several occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 78. And WMATA itself noted in October 2014 that Norris had reported that \"after [she] began reporting to Mr. Walton, he began asking [her] for sexual favors[,] ... frequently talked about sex[,] ... [and] would sometimes put his hand on [her] knee[ ] during conversations.\" October 21, 2014 WMATA Findings Letter, Def.'s Ex. 6, ECF No. 17. WMATA also acknowledged that Walton was disciplined for sexually harassing another SOM. Walker Dep. 108:15-108:21. In the course of that investigation, WMATA \"heard from other female witnesses about how Mr. Walton spoke to women, flirted, [and] was very unprofessional[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166:4-166:14. Walton received a fifteen day suspension and a 6-month suspension of his supervisory duties, but WMATA's EEOR did not recommend a demotion-and Walton was not demoted-in part due to the fact that \"within ... the bus department, there's a lot of fraternization\" that the EEOR had to take into consideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109:1-109:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Taking all inferences in Norris's favor, the record thus points to 1) one instance of sexual advances by Walton in June 2014, the rejection of which may have caused Norris to lose a position on the AIT team, and 2) multiple instances of harassing verbal and physical conduct by Walton over the prior months, including sexual advances and touching Norris on the knee on several occasions. This goes well beyond the \"single proposition by an assistant superintendent\" that WMATA contends forms the basis for Norris's claim. Pl's Mem. Supp. at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In this circuit, \"even multiple instances of physical contact and sexual advances may not be sufficient\" to sustain a hostile work environment claim, and \"incidents involving only verbal comments ... must generally be quite pervasive and severe to be actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Bergbauer v.
