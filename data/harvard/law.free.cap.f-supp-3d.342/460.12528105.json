Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated \u00a7 1692c under Count 1, \u00a7 1692e under Count 2 and \u00a7 1692g under Count 3. Presently before the Court is Defendant Safeguard's motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (the \"Defendant's Motion\"). For the following reasons the Defendant's Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   All facts are taken from the Amended Complaint (the \"Am. Compl.\"), ECF. No 17, Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def. 56.1\"), ECF No. 83, Plaintiff's Response to Safeguard's Statement of Material Facts (\"Plf. Resp.\") and Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts (\"Plf. Add. Resp.\"), both at ECF No. 88, and Safeguard's Response to Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Material Facts (\"Def. Resp.\"), ECF No. 86, are uncontested except where indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Safeguard is a mortgage field services company that inspects, preserves and protects properties on behalf of their client, which are servicers, mortgage companies, investors, credit unions and land banks. (Plf. Resp., \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff has a residential mortgage loan on his home serviced by Ditech. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2015, doing business as Green Tree Servicing LLC, Ditech commenced a foreclosure filing, claiming that Plaintiff's loan had been in default since 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ditech retained Safeguard to conduct a \"contact inspection\" of Plaintiff's home (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.) According to Green Tree, the purpose of the contact inspection is to verify who is occupying the property and to verify the condition and status of the collateral (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27). Safeguard performed some 3,000 inspections in the year and 20 days after Plaintiff filed this action. (Def. Resp., \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly before August 12, 2015, Safeguard left a door hanger on Plaintiff's door (Plf. Resp., \u00b6 2) which advised Plaintiff to call Green Tree Mortgage at a specific number, to be prepared to give his account number, and said: \"WE ARE EXPECTING YOUR CALL TODAY.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The door hanger was left as part of the contact inspection on Plaintiff's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26.) The door hanger had no indication that it was a communication from Safeguard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) Plaintiff admitted that \"he could not recall if he ever called the number on the door hanger.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71.) Plaintiff stated that he could not recall \"ever having a conversation with anyone at Safeguard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72.) Based on this record, Plaintiff did not have any other form of communication with Safeguard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Safeguard conducted the work at Plaintiff's property on behalf of Ditech pursuant to a Master Property Services Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12.) Safeguard is required to perform all services in compliance with applicable FHA, VA, HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, GNMA, private investor and private mortgage insurer regulations, guidelines and requirements as stipulated in its agreement with Ditech. (Def. Resp., \u00b6 10.) When Safeguard receives an order from a client, Safeguard receives the loan number, the mortgagor information, the type of loan and the type of inspection that Safeguard is to complete. (Plf. Resp., \u00b6 16.) The order file for Plaintiff's property from Green Tree did not include the unpaid principal balance or the amount of the mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 47.) Safeguard does not collect debt nor does it collect any money for Ditech. (Def. 56.1, \u00b6 48, \u00b6 49.) Safeguard does not have infrastructure in place to collect a debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 51.) Safeguard does not hold or collect any funds for Green Tree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.) Safeguard does not hold title to property for Green Tree at any point. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 55.) Safeguard is not authorized by Green Tree to discuss the debt with the borrower (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 64.) Plaintiff admits Safeguard does not hold or collect any funds for Green Tree (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff states that Defendant is aware that a contact attempt inspection is being made to contact delinquent borrowers as part of the servicer's debt collection efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 56.) Plaintiff points to evidence that Defendant advertises its services for contacting \"delinquent borrowers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As further evidence of this disputed fact, Plaintiff submits that the door hanger left during the contact inspection makes no mention of occupancy and does nothing to direct the recipient to provide information about the status of the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff further submits the phone number on the doorhanger does nothing to assist Ditech in learning about the status of the collateral. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, Plaintiff states that calls to the number on the doorhanger are routed to Ditech's general customer service line, where Ditech attempts to collect the outstanding mortgage debt. (Plf. Add. Resp., \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff points to evidence that Safeguard inspectors are directed to personally tell debtors to call their mortgage company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff also points to language on Safeguard's website, describing the contact inspection (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant replies that the contact inspection is only one of many services provided. (\n   <em>\n    Def. Resp.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2.) Defendant denies that the phone number on the door hanger directs the recipient to a specific line from which Ditech specifically attempted to collect an outstanding mortgage debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2). Furthermore, Safeguard's compensation is not\n   contingent on whether the debt is ultimately paid or how much, if any of the debt is paid. (Plf. Resp., \u00b6 61.) Safeguard is paid a single, flat fee for a contact attempt inspection. (Plf. \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgement is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Violation of the FDCPA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff has three main positions. First, Plaintiff argues that in placing the doorhanger on behalf of Ditech on plaintiff's door, Safeguard was attempting to collect a debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5). (Plaintiff's Response to Safeguard's Motion for Summary Judgement (\"Plf. Mem. Resp. to MSJ\"), ECF No. 85, at 2-3.)

Third, Plaintiff argues that Safeguard violated the FDCPA because it did not provide the disclosures required of debt collectors pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g, \u00a7 1692e(11) and \u00a7 1692e(14).

In this case, there is no genuine dispute that Safeguard is not a debt collector. Safeguard placed a door hanger on the plaintiff's front door. There was no direct contact of any kind between Safeguard and the plaintiff. Safeguard did not know how much was owed in unpaid principal balance or the amount of the mortgage from Green Tree pertaining to Plaintiff's property. Safeguard did not discuss the debt with the borrower. Safeguard did not collect any money or attempt to collect any money from the plaintiff. Safeguard's compensation was not contingent on whether the debt is ultimately paid. Leaving a doorhanger on Plaintiff's doorknob was in and of itself not invasive enough that Defendant should be regarded a debt collector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Safeguard's activities simply do not rise to the level of \"debt collecting\" under the FDCPA, which requires a greater degree of contact with debtors, a more forceful and clear purpose to recoup the money owed on behalf of the creditor as well as more intimate knowledge of the debtors' financial situation. Plaintiff argues that Safeguard's advertising of its contact inspection service suggests it knows it is conducting an inspection on delinquent borrowers on behalf of creditors, and betrays the real purpose of the inspection. But, assuming the source of the website advertisement is Safeguard (Defendant points out that the source of the advertisement is not verified), the advertisement expresses only very generalized information. The advertisement may suggest Defendant knows Green Tree clients are in default, but does not suggest much beyond that or that Safeguard has any baseline knowledge or role in collection of the debt, as our case law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff also raises the issue of whether placing the doorhanger is indirect debt collection.

The\n   <em>\n    Schlaf\n   </em>\n   court\n   acknowledged that in \"a very broad, theoretical sense, it is possible to characterize facilitating the reestablishment of communication between homeowner and Green Tree as a preliminary step in Green Tree's own debt-collection process.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518087\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/459/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, it \"is difficult to say, however, that such limited and very limited action even indirectly implicates the specific statutory concerns set forth in the language.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518087\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/459/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Of particular important, the leaving of a doorhanger did not include a demand for payment, and made no specific reference to the debt other than to give Green Tree's name and phone number.

That single act is not as a matter of law enough needed to hold Safeguard liable for a violation of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to the fact that Safeguard is not a debt collector.
