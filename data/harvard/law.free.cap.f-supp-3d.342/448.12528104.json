However, like\n   <em>\n    Kleimar\n   </em>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Ayyash\n   </em>\n   was not asked to analyze jurisdiction in light of\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gucci America\n   </em>\n   , and thus concluded that two foreign companies were \"found\" in the District merely because they have offices here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201871087\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, like the respondents in\n   <em>\n    Alghanim\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Ayyash\n   </em>\n   respondents never contested that they were \"found\" here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201871087\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Court finds Petitioners' reliance on this case unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Specific Jurisdiction over Santander\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Petitioners, in a final effort, make what can only be described as an argument for the exercise of\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   personal jurisdiction. Even without general personal jurisdiction, the Court may obtain specific personal jurisdiction over Santander.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gucci Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264793\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/122/#p141\">\n    768 F.3d at 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Second Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Gucci America\n   </em>\n   , courts undertake a two-step analysis to ascertain specific personal jurisdiction: \"First, the court must decide if the defendant has purposely directed his activities at the forum and the litigation arises out of or relates to those activities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264793\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/122/#p141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). \"Second, once the court has established these minimum contacts, it determines whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264793\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/122/#p141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burger King Corp. v.

In support of this argument, Petitioners claim that (1) Santander executives met with analysts and investors in New York City in the days following the \"resolution\" and subsequent acquisition of Banco Popular to raise capital needed to help facilitate the acquisition; (2) Santander's private counsel wrote letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission to request exemptive relief from certain securities law requirements concomitant with the acquisition of Banco Popular; and (3) Santander allegedly retained investment banks in New York, prior to the sale of Banco Popular, to explore financing options for its acquisition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Del Valle Ruiz Pet'rs' Mem. at 15-16; PIMCO Pet'rs' Mem. at 21-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds none of these alleged activities sufficient to exercise specific personal jurisdiction. With respect to specific jurisdiction over a\n   <em>\n    nonparty\n   </em>\n   , as is the case here, generally courts in this District \"first assess the connection between the nonparty's contacts with the forum and the [discovery] order at issue, and then decide whether exercising jurisdiction for the purposes of the order would comport with fair play ad substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Gucci Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264793\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/122/#p141\">\n    768 F.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Santander points out, however, in this case all of Santander's alleged New York activities took place \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Resolution had already been adopted,\" and thus, the activities \"shed[ ] no light on the regulators' decision to effect the Resolution\"-the specific focus of all of Petitioners' foreign proceedings. Santander's Mem. at 14-15.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rubinstein Decl. Exs. 1-2 (applications for litigation against the Single Resolution Board, the European Commission, and Spain involving decisions leading up to and including the Resolution and resultant sale of Banco Popular); Calamari Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-49 (detailing same). Accordingly, the litigation abroad cannot be said to arise out of or relate to Santander's activities in the forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The overwhelming majority of courts that have wrestled with the evolving interpretation of Section 1782 have concluded that, at the very least, a corporation is not \"found\" in a district merely because it maintains offices or conducts business in the district. The Court agrees with this view. The threshold inquiry to establish jurisdiction \"is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether a\n   foreign corporation's in-forum contacts can be said to be in some sense continuous and systematic, it is whether that corporation's affiliations with the State are\n   <em>\n    so continuous and systematic\n   </em>\n   as to render it essentially\n   <em>\n    at home\n   </em>\n   in the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at 138-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lockheed Martin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143530\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/814/619/#p641\">\n    814 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a corporation is neither incorporated nor maintains its principal place of business in a state, mere contacts, no matter how 'systematic and continuous,' are\n   <em>\n    extraordinarily unlikely\n   </em>\n   to add up to an 'exceptional case.' \"). Here, Petitioners have failed to establish that Santander conducts anything other than some level of systematic and continuous business in its offices in the District. This is insufficient to satisfy personal jurisdiction here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Discovery from Santander Investment Securities Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   PIMCO Petitioners also seek discovery from Santander Investment Securities Inc. (hereinafter, \"SIS\"). Santander concedes that SIS maintains its principal place of business within the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PIMCO Pet'rs' Mem. at 5. Consequently, the Court finds that constitutional due process principles and Section 1782's \"resides or is found\" requirement are satisfied as to SIS. Moreover, at oral argument, Santander conceded, and the Court is independently satisfied, that Petitioners have established Section 1782's other statutory requirements-i.e., that the discovery sought is for use in a proceeding before a foreign tribunal, and that the application for discovery was made by interested persons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201782\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Therefore, the Court concludes that it has statutory authority to grant discovery from SIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court also finds that discovery against SIS is appropriate. In so finding, the Court has considered the \"twin aims\" of Section 1782 : providing efficient means of assistance to participants in international litigation in our federal courts and encouraging foreign countries by example to provide similar means of assistance to our courts.\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517604\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/238/#p244\">\n    895 F.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court is satisfied that, based on the circumstances present in this case and consideration of\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   's discretionary factors, both aims are furthered by this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, the Court credits Petitioners' arguments that the documents they seek are currently beyond the reach of the foreign tribunals. While Santander has been ordered to produce documents in at least one foreign proceeding,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PIMCO Pet'rs' Reply at 7 (noting that the Spanish Central Criminal Court has ordered Santander to produce certain documents), Santander is not a party in any of the foreign proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is Santander an especially\n   <em>\n    active\n   </em>\n   participant in the criminal proceeding in which it has produced documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Santander's July 19, 2018 Letter to the Court, Case No.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1300549\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc/18/127/\">\n    18 Misc. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Doc. 52 (stating that it has produced only twelve documents related to the Spanish Central Criminal Court's order to produce documents). This fact generally weighs in favor of granting Petitioners Section 1782 aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, insofar as Santander argues that this Court cannot compel it to produce documents located abroad, or that producing documents located abroad would be unduly burdensome and intrusive, the Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Delight Int'l Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1294230\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc/16/125/\">\n    16 Misc. 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (JMF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202849724\">\n    2018 WL 2849724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2018) (surveying case law on the question whether Section 1782 authorizes discovery of documents outside the United States and concluding that \"the Eleventh Circuit and the district judges who have held that Section 1782 can reach documents abroad have the better of the argument\" in light of the plain language of the statute and legislative history). Accordingly, PIMCO Petitioners' application will be granted as to SIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Del Valle Ruiz Petitioners' application for an Order to conduct discovery against Santander for use in foreign proceedings is DENIED. PIMCO Petitioners' application for an Order to conduct discovery is DENIED insofar as it requests discovery from Santander, and GRANTED insofar as it requests discovery from SIS. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the open motion in Case No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Misc.%2085\">\n    18 Misc. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Doc. 1, and to close that case.

Prior to\n    <em>\n     Daimler\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit, in passing, has observed that \"a person who is subjected to\n    <em>\n     liability\n    </em>\n    by service of process far from home may have better cause to complain of an outrage to fair play than one similarly situated who is merely called upon to supply documents or testimony.\"\n    <em>\n     First Am.

However, in the subsequent decades since that observation, neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit (nor any other Circuit that the Court is aware of) has held that fewer contacts with a forum may be sufficient to exercise personal jurisdiction over an entity who faces the threat of discovery as a nonparty rather than liability as a party-defendant. Accordingly, the Court will not so find here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Petitioners also cite to several out-of-district cases in which courts have found personal jurisdiction over corporate entities proper based solely on the presence of a company's office or business activities in the district.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re Qualcomm Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331175\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/162/1029/#p1036\">\n     162 F.Supp.3d 1029\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1036 (N.D.
