He concluded that Zoraida D\u00edaz suffered from TTP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs aver that the \"administration of platelets to a patient with TTP is contraindicated because it causes thrombi or blood clots, which can be life threatening.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8. The standard TTP treatment includes a \"plasmapheresis or, in the alternative, a plasma transfusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 11. The Doctors' Center Hospital did not administer a plasmapheresis or a plasma transfusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If left untreated, TTP \"can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or stroke.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Zoraida D\u00edaz transferred to another hospital in Puerto Rico, where she received a plasmapheresis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that Zoraida D\u00edaz sustained \"permanent ischemic damage,\" after which point her family transported her to Texas for additional medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz visited Zoraida D\u00edaz in Texas daily, at times as her attending physician.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 16.

On June 5, 2017, the Clerk entered default against Hashida. (Docket Nos. 33 and 34.) Accordingly, Doctors' Center Hospital and Pesquera are the only remaining defendants in this litigation. The parties filed four motions\n   <em>\n    in limine.\n   </em>\n   (Docket Nos. 53, 65, 66 and 67.) The Court continued trial to adjudicate these motions.

Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, Olga D\u00edaz and Ramos argue that \"[n]either defendant announced any ... experts and provided no reports in a timely fashion and must, thus, be precluded from using any expert witnesses at trial in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3. In their opposition to the plaintiffs' motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , the Doctors' Center Hospital and Pesquera clarify that \"there is no designation by either defendant that they would be using an expert in this case.\" (Docket No. 76 at p. 2.) Accordingly, the plaintiffs' motion to preclude the defendants from calling expert witnesses at trial is\n   <strong>\n    MOOT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Miller is a hematologist and will \"testify regarding the breaches in [the] standard of medical care by Co-Defendants, as described in his expert report and explained in his deposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants deposed Miller on May 16, 2018.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(e)(2). The Doctors' Center Hospital and Pesquera assert that the plaintiffs received the transcript on August 22, 2018, more than thirty days ago. (Docket No. 77 at p. 3.) It bears emphasis that in seeking to preclude the Doctors' Center Hospital and Pesquera from using Miller's deposition transcript, the defendants do not identify any errors in form or substance. (Docket No. 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   plaintiffs' motion to preclude the Doctors' Center Hospital and Pesquera from using Miller's deposition transcript.

(Docket No. 67.) The defendants deposed D\u00e1vila on November 14, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 1. The parties stipulated that \"Ms. Katia D\u00e1vila would have thirty (30) days to examine his [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] deposition, make any corrections to it, after which term it would be deemed correct and signature waived.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, Olga D\u00edaz and Ramos fail to specify\n   when the court reporter provided notice that the transcript was available, or whether the plaintiffs received the transcript. The absence of this information prevents the Court from considering the merits of the plaintiffs' Rule 30 motion. Tellingly, Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, Olga D\u00edaz and Ramos fail to specify any errors in Davila's deposition transcript. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the plaintiffs' motion to preclude the defendants from using D\u00e1vila's deposition transcript.

Because the plaintiffs failed to designate Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz as an expert witness in violation of Rule 26, the defendants argue that preclusion is proper pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 (\" Rule 37\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz's designation as a fact witness, an expert witness, or a hybrid of the two will determine whether the plaintiffs complied with Rule 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz sat for his deposition on January 26, 2018, a year after the plaintiffs filed the complaint. (Docket No. 68, Ex. 1).

Second, the defendants maintain that D\u00e1vila's proposed testimony \"is an attempt by plaintiff to bring forth to the jury the damages of Zoraida that certainly, if heard by the jury, will certainly confuse the jury at the time of assessing the award for damages of the federal plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The parties need not detail with specificity the testimony of potential fact witnesses pursuant to Rule 26.
