(ECF # 93). The supporting invoices show that these charges include $50,123.10 in \"user licensing\" and \"data hosting\" expenses. (ECF # 90-4, Ex. C.1-C.11). Another $3,453.40 is attributed to expenses for loading and exporting data into \"Relativity,\" \"volume creation,\" processing, and \"Audio File Transcription.\" (ECF # 90-4, Ex. C.1-C.4, C.6).

The Sixth Circuit has not addressed these specific types of costs in reviewing and award of costs, however, it has allowed reimbursement of costs for imaging a hard drive. The Sixth Circuit's decision was predicated solely on the premise that the imaging costs, which were the only costs requested in that case, fell within the plain meaning of \"copying,\" and were, therefore, subsumed by Subsection 4 of Section 1920.\n   <em>\n    Colosi v.

Defendant also cites two other Texas cases giving similar reasons for assessing costs associated with electronic storage when paper production would have been more costly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case is distinguishable from those cited by Defendant. There is no evidence or argument that the need for the electronic discovery system was caused by the Plaintiff, or that it was more cost effective than copying and distributing information in a more traditional manner. There were not multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants, which would have exponentially increased the copying costs required. In addition, Defendant has submitted no affidavit or other information that would allow this Court to determine which portions of these costs were necessary to the case, and which were merely for the convenience of the attorneys. Finally, there is no indication in the Bill of Costs or the supporting documents filed by the Defendant that the costs for \"user licensing\" and \"data hosting\" were incurred for the actual copying or imaging of any papers or other form of discovery materials necessarily obtained for use in the case, which is required by the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and was the determining factor considered by the\n   <em>\n    Colosi\n   </em>\n   court in awarding costs. Rather, Defendant states\n   that these costs were incurred to maintain a database used for storage and to assist Defendant's review of the materials, neither of which is a recoverable cost under the statute. (ECF # 90-1 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the information contained in the system was undoubtedly necessary for use in this case, there is nothing to support a finding that the licensing and hosting costs included, or were limited to, the actual copying of materials necessary to the litigation of the case. The summaries provided do not sufficiently explain the purpose and scope of the licensing and data hosting fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants do not claim that this electronic information management system was less costly than traditional paper discovery would have been under the circumstances of this case. They also do not provide any explanation as to why, in this type of case, electronic document management was necessary, rather simply a permissible means of facilitating attorney review. As electronic document management becomes more prevalent, and the benefits of such a system become more widely accepted, Congress might well consider re-visiting the restrictions set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to permit recovery of costs associated with more modern means of case management. At this juncture, however, this Court is bound to follow the plain language of the current statute and the dictates of the Sixth Circuit, both of which lead to a denial of the $50,123.10 in charges for \"user licensing\" and \"data hosting\" sought by Defendant in this case. This result also comports with the United States Supreme Court's reminder in\n   <em>\n    Tanaguchi\n   </em>\n   , that \"[t]axable costs are limited to relatively minor, incidental expenses\" and should be applied narrowly.\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/\">\n    566 U.S. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Another $3,453.40 sought under Section 1920(4) is attributed to expenses for loading and exporting data into \"Relativity,\" \"volume creation,\" processing, and \"Audio File Transcription.\" (ECF # 90-4, Ex. C.1-C.4, C.6). Although Defendant did not explain or itemize these costs as clearly as the Court would prefer, it is reasonable to infer, based on the services described in the invoices and Defendant's limited explanation, that these charges qualify as copying or transcriptions costs that are recoverable under Section 1920(2) and (4). Data conversion, audio transcription, and export of data, all suggest a replication of data that would fit the broader definition of electronic \"copying\" adopted by the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Colosi\n   </em>\n   . The Court, therefore, finds that $3,453.40 of the costs sought under Section 1920(4) is reasonably attributed to electronic copying and/or transcription costs necessary for use in the case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Transcription of Audio Recordings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff also challenges Defendant, Weltman's request for costs associated with the transcription of \"audio recordings of consumer telephone calls.\" Plaintiff claims these costs and others used for trial preparation, but not at trial, are not \"necessarily obtained for use in the case.\" Plaintiff further argues that the audio recordings, themselves, could have been used as evidence at trial, and, therefore, the transcriptions were not necessary, but rather, merely an unnecessary convenience or aid for Defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohus v. Toys R Us, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476086\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/1355/\">\n    282 F.3d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Defendant's explanation of costs indicates that the transcriptions at issue were limited to about 140 consumer calls identified by Plaintiff as violations of the FDCPA. As these calls were given by Plaintiff as examples of the violations charged in the Complaint, review of the\n   calls was necessary for use in the case, and the transcribing the calls was a reasonable and necessary cost to incur. Transcribing calls that are central to the charges in the case is may be necessary in order to have the content of those calls on hand for use in examination, cross-examination, and impeachment attempts, as well as for preparation of trial questions and arguments, and other trial preparation needs. Counsel is not required to sift through and play audio recordings of essential telephone conversations each time the content of the call becomes relevant at trial or during trial preparation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montano v. Orange Cty., Texas\n   </em>\n   , NO. 1:13-CV-611,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2011110595\">\n    2015 WL 11110595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.

Ga. May 5, 2011). It is not necessary, for recovery under Section 1920 that the transcriptions, themselves, actually be used at trial.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sutter v. Gen. Motors Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1296194\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/100/472/#p475\">\n    100 F. App'x 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 (6th Cir. 2004). Further, the reason the transcripts were not utilized at trial was because Plaintiff dropped the claims related to the calls on the eve of trial, after Defendant had already incurred these costs in preparation of their defense of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Transcription of Bitterman Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff challenges the costs incurred by Defendant in the transcription of the pre-complaint investigative hearing of Eileen Bitterman. Plaintiff argues that investigation expenses are not chargeable as costs, and these costs were not reasonably necessary for the litigation. Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Hill v. BASF Wyandotte Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684551\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/547/348/#p352\">\n    547 F.Supp. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (E.D. Mich. 1982) for the proposition that the cost of transcribing proceedings for trial preparation, but not for use at trial, are not recoverable as costs under Section 1920(4). This runs counter to the Sixth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Sutter v. General Motors\n   </em>\n   , in which that court held that the cost of transcriptions may be recovered under Section 1920, even if not introduced at trial.\n   <em>\n    Sutter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1296194\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/100/472/#p475\">\n    100 F. App'x at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff also points out that Defendant ordered and was invoiced for the cost of this transcription before the Complaint in this cases was even filed, suggesting that this timing proves that they were ordered as part of an investigation and not specifically for use at trial. Trial use and preparation does not have to be the sole reason that a cost was incurred, however. Nothing in the statute limits recovery to materials prepared exclusively for trial. Rather, the statute allows fees for transcripts \"necessarily obtained for use in the case.\" There can be no question that the transcript of Ms. Bitterman's investigation hearing was necessary for the Defense to use in the case. Plaintiff relied on the investigative hearing of Ms. Bitterman during summary judgment briefing, and Defendant should well have expected that it would, therefore, also raise the hearing at trial. It was necessary that the defense in this case be prepared to address the content of the investigative hearing during summary judgment and at trial. Having the hearing transcribed was a reasonable means of accomplishing this. Courts regularly tax costs for items such as this, when they are made necessary to the case through references in briefing or when their content can be reasonably expected to be addressed at trial.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golembiewski v.
