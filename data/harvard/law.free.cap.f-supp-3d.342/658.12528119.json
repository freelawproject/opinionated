(ECF No. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 24, 95.) Since its formation in 1996, Under Armour's market share has grown to compete with the leaders in the sector, Nike and Adidas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 93.) By 2014, Under Armour surpassed Adidas and became the number two sportswear brand by revenue in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By capitalizing on its premium brand image and reputation for state-of-the-art fabrics, Under Armour reported 26 consecutive quarters of 20% or more compounded annual growth between 2010 and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Led by its founder, Plank, who also serves as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Chairman of the Board, Under Armour had an aggressive growth strategy, declaring its intent to become the \"No. 1\" brand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 94-96.) During the Company's Investor Day on September 16, 2015, Plank boasted that \"demand for our brand has never been stronger,\" and Under Armour's net revenue was projected to grow 25% in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, Plaintiffs allege that by the fall of 2015, customer demand for Under Armour's apparel products was declining, partly due to the Company's failure to compete early in the athletic leisure apparel trend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98.) Excess inventory in Under Armour's basic sports apparel, which had historically provided the majority of sales, led the Company to begin competing on price rather than brand strength as it had done in the past. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 99-103, 106.) At the same time, the trend away from consumer sports-apparel purchases at traditional sporting goods stores towards online shopping and large discount chains led to bankruptcies for some of Under Armour's traditional sporting goods customers, which put further pressure on sales and margins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 104-112.) Under Armour expanded its footwear and international sales, but with lower margins and high promotional expenses, overall margins declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 113-115.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 10, 2016, Morgan Stanley issued a detailed report with point-of-sale data from Under Armour's retail customers illustrating declines in the Company's growth, average sales price (\"ASP\"), and market share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117.) The next month, February 2016, Under Armour's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Dickerson left the Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.) However, the Company's first quarter 2016 financial results, announced in an April 21, 2016 press release, were positive: \"For the past 24 consecutive quarters or six years, we have driven net revenue growth above 20% and we are incredibly proud of our start to 2016 with first quarter net revenue growth\n   of 30%. The strong results posted this quarter truly demonstrate the balanced growth of our brand across product categories, channels and geographies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188 (quoting the April 21, 2016 press release announcing the Company's first quarter results for 2016).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2016, the Company's Chief Merchandising Officer, Henry Stafford (\"Stafford\"), and the Chief Digital Officer, Robin Thurston (\"Thurston\"), abruptly departed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Under Armour's sales problems became publicly known, stock prices declined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.) On June 1, 2016, the Company announced a reduced expectation of 2016 revenues related to the bankruptcy of one of its major sporting goods customers, the Sports Authority,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which triggered further stock price declines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 6, 2016, Under Armour filed the Registration Statement with the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") in connection with its Bond offering (\"Bond Offering\" or \"the Offering\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 210.) Under Armour offered the Bonds pursuant to the Offering materials, which incorporated Under Armour's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and first quarter 2016 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) The Offering was completed on June 8, 2016 with the Company receiving $593.6 million in total net proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 141.) Each of the Underwriter Defendants allegedly acted as an underwriter of the Offering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 26, 2016, Under Armour reported growth below 20% for the first time in more than seven years and forecast the slowest quarterly growth in over six years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 120.) On October 25, 2016, Under Armour revealed a further slowdown in growth in the third quarter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 31, 2017, Under Armour revealed that the 2016 slowdown was more severe than previously reported and also announced the sudden departure of Molloy, who served as CFO after Dickerson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57, 89, 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next day, on February 1, 2017, S&amp;P Global Ratings (\"S &amp; P\") downgraded the Company's Bonds to junk status, and Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") changed Under Armour's rating outlook from stable to negative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.) The Bond price fell in response and slid further in August 2017 when the Company revealed slow North American growth, reduced its 2017 guidance, and announced a massive restructuring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The initial Complaints alleging violations of federal securities law were filed in February and March 2017 and were consolidated on March 23, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on August 9, 2017. (ECF No. 30.) Plaintiffs claim four causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Count I - For Violation of Section 11 of the Securities Act Against All of the Securities Act Defendants\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Count II - For Violation of Section 15 of the Securities Act Against Plank, Molloy, and the Director Defendants\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Count III - Violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder Against All of the Exchange Act Defendants\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Count IV - For Violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act Against the Individual Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Consol. Am. Compl., ECF No. 30. The Exchange Act Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons or entities that purchased or acquired publicly traded securities of Under Armour between September 16, 2015 to January 30, 2017, inclusive (\"Class Period\"), and who were damaged thereby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). The Securities Act Plaintiff purports to represent all persons or entities that purchased or acquired 3.250% senior unsecured notes of Under Armour due June 15, 2026 pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement filed with the SEC on June 6, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants concealed their sales and revenue problems during the Class Period, making false claims of explosive growth and strong customer demand while downplaying the ballooning inventory, liquidations, and gross margin compression. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) They also allege that Plank personally cashed in on the artificial inflation by selling shares of his Company stock for total proceeds of $138.2 million during the Class Period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants raised nearly $600 million from the sale of then-investment grade Bonds by making various untrue and misleading statements in the materials provided to the SEC on June 6-9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13, 27, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By the instant motion, ECF No. 51, the Under Armour Defendants seek dismissal with prejudice of all claims pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Procedure, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\"). The Underwriter Defendants join in the motion, and separately move this Court to dismiss the claims against them under Section 11 of the Securities Act for the additional reason that the claims are barred by the Securities Act one-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

(ECF No. 52-2 at 15.) Securities Act Plaintiff, however, contends that the disclosure events occurring on January 31, 2017, resulting in the February 1, 2017 Bonds' rating downgrade, triggered the earliest possible running of limitations. (ECF No. 56 at 18.) Securities Act Plaintiff notes that the Bond price was trading above the Offering price on July 26, 2016, and October 26, 2016 was the first date that the Bonds ever closed below their Offering price, so Securities Act Plaintiff could not have alleged damages until that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Securities Act Plaintiff's focus is misplaced. To state a claim under Section 11, plaintiffs must allege only that they purchased securities for which the registration statement contained a material misstatement or omission. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). Securities Act Plaintiff alleges that it purchased the Bonds on July 19, 2016, which is before August 4, 2016. (ECF No. 30-1 at 4.) Therefore, if Securities Act Plaintiff should have discovered facts sufficient to allege that the registration statement contained untrue statements or omissions before August 4, 2016, the claim is untimely. Securities Act Plaintiff's allegations point directly to information that was publicly available prior to August 4, 2016. For example, Securities Act Plaintiff alleges that \"Under Armour's apparel products, which account for most of the Company's sales,\n   suffered from reduced customer appeal and demand (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-100).\" (ECF No. 30 at \u00b6 55(a).) Paragraphs 98-100 specifically reference the Morgan Stanley Report, attached as Exhibit C and incorporated by reference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 n.4.) The date on the Morgan Stanley Report is January 10, 2016. (ECF No. 30-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Securities Act Plaintiff asserts that Under Armour's \"countervailing narrative\" downplayed the Morgan Stanley Report and related articles, which undercut any questions raised. (ECF No. 56 at 19 (citing cases for support that a ratings downgrade may be an appropriate triggering event for statute of limitations).) Of course, a ratings downgrade may well be a sufficient triggering event, and Under Armour's ratings downgrade is cited in Securities Act Plaintiff's Complaint as additional support for their claim, but that does not mean it is a necessary or sole triggering event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Importantly, Under Armour's July 26, 2016 announcement of \"second quarter decreases in operating and net income and a drop in apparel sales growth below 20% for the first time in more than seven years, and forecast [of] the slowest quarterly growth in over six years\" (ECF No. 30 at \u00b6 120.) undercuts any earlier Under Armour comments downplaying the negative reports. As part of its factual allegations, Securities Act Plaintiff also cited the negative effect on Under Armour securities prices as a result of the \"surprising\" news from Morgan Stanley on January 10, 2016, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117.), the \"suspicious\" departures of executives in February and May 2016 causing prices to decline on May 4, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118.), and the June 1, 2016 revelations of \"a reduced expectation of 2016 revenues and operating income and an impairment charge related to the Sports Authority bankruptcy, triggering additional securities price declines\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.). These earlier disclosures, especially taken in their entirety, were sufficient triggers to allow Securities Act Plaintiff to have investigated, and to reasonably have discovered, prior to August 4, 2016, facts adequate for pleading a Section 11 cause of action against the Underwriter Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, the relation-back doctrine does not save the claim with regard to the Underwriter Defendants because they had no notice of the action prior to the filing of the Consolidated Amended Complaint against them on August 4, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1). Therefore, this Court holds that the Section 11 claims against the Underwriter Defendants, as set forth in Count I, are time-barred and shall be dismissed WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Securities Act Plaintiff also argues that Under Armour, Plank, and Molloy were on notice of the fact that the initial complaints alleged the falsity of statements made in Under Armour's Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2016, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. (ECF No. 56 at 28.) However, the initial complaints made only Exchange Act claims related to the decline in stock prices, the factual allegations regarded statements made in press releases and conference calls with analysts, and there is no mention of Form 10-Q filings or the Bond Offering. Further, the Securities Act Plaintiff was not a plaintiff in the original complaints. Although these Defendants did not formally\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   join the motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds, this Court holds that the relation-back doctrine would not apply to save the claim against them from also being time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Accordingly, this Court holds that the Section 11 claims against\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the Securities Defendants are time-barred and\n   shall be dismissed WITH PREJUDICE. Section 15 claims \"are derivative of the other claims and thus subject to the same time limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub. Employees' Ret. Sys. of Mississippi v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.

For example, the statement \"our ability to improve margins in Apparel is not only possible, but it's happening right now as we speak,\" and various statements regarding inventory, such as \"retail is pretty good and inventories are clean,\" are alleged to be inconsistent with the underlying data in Exchange Act Defendants' possession. Plaintiffs have alleged that Exchange Act Defendants omitted purported material information that was in their possession and were obligated to provide in order to give a truthful picture of the Company's health. For example, Plaintiffs allege that Exchange Act Defendants failed to explain departures of key personnel, and failed to relay facts about lower ASPs, loss in market share, excess inventory, and impact of wholesale customers' bankruptcies.

Plaintiffs allege that Exchange Act Defendants had detailed data available to them through their existing SAP platform, which gives rise to a strong inference that they knew facts or had access to information that would suggest that their public statements were not accurate. (ECF No. 55 at 35-36.) However, Plaintiffs provide no corroborating factual allegations to support the allegation that Exchange Act Defendants were in possession of conflicting facts; Plaintiffs simply state the allegation, point to the Morgan Stanley Report for support that inconsistent data was available, and assume that the corporate data was the same. Exchange Act Defendants' statements about the data used by the Morgan Stanley Report question the validity of the data that Morgan Stanley relied upon. The Morgan Stanley Report, itself, acknowledged that \"no industry data source is perfectly correlated to a company's results.\" (ECF No. 30-3 at 16.) While it is certainly possible that Exchange Act Defendants had corporate data that reflected dying demand for the brand as early as 2015, it is also possible that the reports that were reviewed by the Individual Defendants from corporate data supported their statements at the time they made them. Without more, this Court does not find the inference persuasive that Exchange\n   Act Defendants engaged in conscious or reckless behavior with an intent to deceive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the repeated misrepresentations about core operations over the course of a year suggest a strong inference of scienter.

(ECF No. 55 at 38 (citing allegations by paragraph number).) This Court also finds relevant that the statements made by the Individual Defendants, as alleged, were not simply overt optimism but were modified over time with added caveats and cautions, accepting as true that these statements were only partial disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the departure of key personnel, especially Molloy, and the timing of the departures, bolsters the inference of scienter.

However, without factual allegations that provide explanations that support any suspicion related to the departures or the timing, the inference is weak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the close proximity of misrepresentations in late 2016 and the contradictory disclosures in early 2017 also bolsters the inference of scienter. (ECF No. 55 at 41-42.) Plaintiffs add that the magnitude\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the miss in Under Armour's failure to achieve its fourth quarter 2016 projections further supports the inference. It is also possible, however, that Exchange Act Defendants' failure to achieve their projections is attributable to a number of external forces rather than fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Failure to achieve projections, even within a short period of time, without more, does not support a strong inference of fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Plaintiffs make an effort to demonstrate scienter by showing that the Exchange Act Defendants had a motive to commit securities fraud.

Additionally, Plaintiffs allegations are not sufficiently particular as to the Individual Defendants for this Court to parse whether any one of them may be found to have made a material misrepresentation or omission with scienter. Plaintiffs frequently group Defendants together, especially when pleading knowledge or recklessness,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   which fails to satisfy the PSLRA's heightened pleading standard applicable to the first two elements of the Section 10(b) cause of action.
