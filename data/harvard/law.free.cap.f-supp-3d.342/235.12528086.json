Sirois filed this action in state court against their homeowner's insurance provider, USAA Casualty Insurance Company (\"USAA\"), for failure to pay for damages to the basement walls of their home caused by cracking and deterioration in the concrete. USAA removed the case to this court on July 13, 2016. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs brought claims for breach of contract (Count One) and unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-816\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CUIPA\") and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -110a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"CUTPA\") (Count Two). (ECF No. 23.) USAA has moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, arguing that the insurance policy at issue did not cover the alleged damage. It also argues that it cannot be held liable under CUIPA/CUTPA because there was no breach of contract, or, in the alternative, because its liability was not reasonably clear. (ECF No. 49.) For the reasons set forth below, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim but denied with respect to the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, which are taken from the parties' Local Rule 56(a) Statements and the exhibits, are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Damage to the Plaintiffs' Home\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs bought their home in Tolland, Connecticut, in June of 2010. (ECF No. 51, Defendant's Local Rule 56(a)1 Statement (\"Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1; ECF No. 56-1, Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement (\"Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1.) The home was built in 1985. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 2; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 2.) Since 2010, USAA has provided the plaintiffs with homeowners' insurance for the property, under consecutive policies, each providing coverage for one year. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 3; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2015, Mr. Sirois noticed a crack in the basement walls of his home. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Mr. Sirois noted that the crack \"didn't seem concerning\" at the time and that \"there was nothing that would indicate that something further had to be done.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 5; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 5.) In April 2016, however, Mr. Sirois read an article about the defective concrete problem affecting homeowners in Connecticut, and, after doing so, asked an inspector, Dean Soucy, to inspect the Property. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 6; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 6.) The inspector pointed out \"a variety of faults [and] cracks\" in the foundation walls to Mr. Sirois. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 7; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 7.) Mr. Sirois then pointed out the cracks to Ms. Sirois. Ms. Sirois had not previously noticed any cracks in the foundation walls. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 8; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 8.) On April 16, 2016, the plaintiffs submitted a claim for coverage to USAA. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 9; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 9.) Following investigation of the claim, USAA denied the claim by letter dated June 1, 2016. (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 10; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50-1 at 269 (2014 policy includes the following endorsement: \"The SECTION I - LOSSES WE DO NOT COVER apply to these coverages unless otherwise stated\"), 374 (2015 policy contains\n   the same endorsement), 439 (2016 policy contains the same endorsement).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he condition of the plaintiffs' basement walls constitutes a collapse as defined by the homeowners' policies issued by the defendant\" and that \"[t]he grounds offered by the defendant for the denial of coverage are contrary to the express provisions of the Homeowners Policy.\" (ECF No. 23 (\"Complaint\") at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Based upon these allegations, the plaintiffs set out a claim for breach of contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) The amended complaint also alleges that USAA participates in the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (\"ISO\"), an organization that collects data about insurance claims and drafts policy provisions. (ECF No. 23 at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) The plaintiffs allege that, through participation in the ISO, USAA had knowledge of many claims in northeastern Connecticut resulting from similar concrete decay, the strategies other insurers had used to deny such claims, and cases such as\n   <em>\n    Bacewicz v. NGM Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:08-CV-1530 (JCH), in which claimants were awarded judgment against an insurer for concrete decay based on \"nearly identical\" policy language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.) The plaintiffs allege that in its denial letter USAA \"gave the insured a knowingly false and misleading reason for the denial of coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) Further, Plaintiffs allege that USAA is \"regularly engaged\" in refusing to resolve concrete decay claims in good faith, citing five similar cases in Connecticut Superior Court in which USAA is a defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) The plaintiffs allege that these practices constitute a violation of CUIPA resulting in a subsidiary violation of CUTPA.

For the following reasons, I conclude that the plaintiffs' definition of \"caving in,\" which is otherwise undefined in the policies, presents a reasonable interpretation of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As an initial matter, the plaintiffs' usage of a dictionary to interpret the term \"caving in\" is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buell Indus., Inc. v.

USAA contests this definition, claiming that the plaintiffs' definition \"is inapposite, referring to, a colloquial definition of 'cave in' ....\" (ECF No. 59 at 4.) But I need not resort to a battle of the dictionaries to resolve the parties' dispute. As noted above, \"a provision in an insurance policy is ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Medical Ins.

Here, the term \"caving in\" is ambiguous, because both parties' interpretations are reasonable. If USAA wished to limit \"caving in\" to the alternative definition it urges, it could have put such a limitation in the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beach v. Middlesex Mut.

In particular, it contends that there would be no need for subpart \"b\"-and in particular its requirement for a \"sudden breaking apart or deformation such that the building or part of a building is in imminent peril of falling or caving in and is not fit for its intended use\"-if a minor \"breaking apart or deformation\" could be construed to constitute a \"caving in\" under subpart \"a.\" (ECF No. 50 at 14.) USAA's interpretation is reasonable but not required. Not every crack necessarily involves a \"yielding to pressure.\" There could be a \"sudden breaking apart or deformation\" such that the building is in \"imminent peril\" of submitting to pressure or yielding such that the building is not fit for its intended use. For example, a crack in the ceiling of a room would not necessarily involve a submitting to pressure or\n   yielding but could render the room in imminent danger of such. Thus, USAA's argument merely stacks one ambiguity upon another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   USAA also argues that the plaintiffs' proposed definition of \"caving in\" would render the exclusion for \"settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging, or expansion\" in the definition of \"collapse\" meaningless. (ECF No. 59 at 5.) \"Under plaintiffs' reading of 'caving in,' \" USAA avers, \"nearly\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   instance of cracking or bulging ... would be a 'caving in' of the foundation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even this statement admits, however, that there could be incidents of cracking or bulging that did not constitute a \"caving in\" under plaintiffs' definition. Thus, the language USAA cites would not be rendered meaningless; indeed, that language recognizes that some instances of pure \"cracking\"-those resulting from a \"caving in\"-will be covered, while others will not be. Further, the extent to which any incident of settling, bulging, or cracking of walls constitutes a yielding or submitting to pressure is a question of fact in each individual case. USAA may not merely assert that any incident of settling, bulging, or cracking constitutes a yielding or submitting to pressure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, USAA cites a plethora of cases precluding coverage in cases with similar facts to the one at bar; all of these cases, however, concern insurance policies containing definitions of \"collapse\" that differ from the one here.

Most of my analysis above applies to the definition of \"collapse\" in the 2014-2016 policies. Thus, the term \"caving in\" within these provisions is ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   USAA contends that the 2014-2016 policies separately preclude coverage because the exclusions they contain \"for loss caused by deterioration, cracking, bulging, etc., and for loss caused by a faulty or defective material (concrete) are plainly applicable to the 'Collapse' coverage.\" (ECF No. 50 at 23.) As noted above, the policy exclusions USAA cites state, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   2. ... [W]e do not insure for damage consisting of or caused directly or indirectly by any of the following, regardless of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (v) The cause of the excluded event or damage that; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (vi) Other causes of the loss that; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (vii) Whether the event or damage occurs suddenly or gradually, involves isolated or widespread damage, or occurs as a result of any combination of these [two]; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (viii) Whether other causes or events act concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   f. ... deterioration;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   h. ... rust, electrolysis or other corrosion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   k.

If this provision were interpreted to preclude coverage for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   damage consisting or resulting from cracking, shrinking, and bulging, however, it would contradict the \"collapse\" provision. For example, if cracking caused a \"falling in,\" it would constitute a covered \"collapse\" under the policy\n   <em>\n    and fall within the exclusion noted above.\n   </em>\n   USAA offers an interpretation of the policies that it contends harmonizes these provisions, averring that \"[the provisions] essentially mean that if a loss caused by [damage of a type noted in the exclusion above] is not a 'collapse,' as defined in the policy, then it may be subject to the [exclusions listed above].\" (ECF No. 59 at 12.) That interpretation does not help USAA, however, because the plaintiffs have identified a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the damage to their property-i.e., the settling, cracking, and bulging of the concrete in their foundation walls-constitutes a \"collapse\" under the policies. As such, they have presented a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether their losses are covered under the post-2014 policies under USAA's proffered interpretation of the policy exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   USAA cites several cases in support of the conclusion that \"this Court and other courts in this district, in defective concrete cases, have consistently enforced exclusions for cracking, deterioration and corrosion absent a covered 'collapse.' \" (ECF No. 59 at 12 n. 11.) The cases USAA cites, however, concerned an exclusion for cracking\n   <em>\n    within the definition of \"collapse,\"\n   </em>\n   as opposed to the general \"cracking\" exclusion on which USAA relies in the 2014-2016 policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    England v.

Application to the Plaintiffs' Losses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   I now turn to whether the evidence in the record shows that the plaintiffs' losses could fall within their proposed definition of \"caving in,\" and conclude that it does. The plaintiffs' expert, David Grandpre, repeatedly described the damage to the plaintiffs' home in terms of the submission to pressure and yielding of the concrete and the walls generally. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 56-6, Affidavit of David Grandpre (\"Grandpre Aff.\") at \u00b6 23 (\"The map pattern cracking is a failure mechanism which indicate[s] that the original concrete basement walls had yielded and succumbed to the internal pressure exerted by the expansion of the reactive aggregate.\"); ECF No. 56-4, Report of David Grandpre (\"Grandpre Report\") at 3 (\"The concrete used at the Sirois residence contained a compound, most likely within the aggregate, which was subjected to a chemical reaction. As the chemical reaction took place, a chemical compound larger than the original elements formed, resulting in internal expansion that caused the concrete to fracture and expand.... [T]his expansion causes the concrete to fracture internally.\"); Grandpre Depo. at 57 (\"It's an iterative process. So there is [a] chemical reaction that takes place when the aggregate gets wet, and the byproduct, which is the increase in volume, pushes against the concrete until a moment where it exceeds the tensile strength of the concrete and then there's a release, and you have a crack created, and then it repeats again and again.\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Further, Grandpre described the damage to plaintiffs' home as a \"substantial impairment to the structural integrity\" of the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Grandpre Depo. at 47-48.) In setting out this description, Grandpre distinguished between homes with mere \"cracking\" damage and those where the cracking had caused a \"substantial impairment to the structural integrity\" of the property. He noted that, for example, a property containing \"only ... a small area\n   of cracking\" did not contain a \"substantial impairment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63.) This further underscores the fact that there can be \"cracking\" that does not rise to the level of a \"collapse\" under the policy. Thus, the plaintiffs have identified a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether their home was subject to a \"caving in\" that fell within the ambit of the \"collapse\" coverage in USAA's policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For these reasons, I deny USAA's motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    B. CUTPA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   USAA contends that the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim fails for two reasons: (1) the alleged failure of the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim; and (2) the issues of law and fact regarding the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim are not \"so clear-cut that USAA's liability was reasonably clear\" such as to trigger CUTPA liability. (ECF No. 50 at 23-24 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The first of these grounds fails because I have concluded that the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim remains. USAA's second argument, however, presents a more complex question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   To set out a CUTPA claim based upon a violation of CUIPA, \"a plaintiff must show that the defendant engaged in an act prohibited by CUIPA's substantive provisions, and that the act proximately caused the harm alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Belz v.

The plaintiffs' citation does not help their case, because the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy even the standard employed by the\n   <em>\n    Bohn\n   </em>\n   court. They have failed to present evidence that a reasonable person, \"with knowledge of the relevant facts and law, would probably have concluded that the insurer was liable.\" Indeed, as shown in the discussion of the breach of contract claim, the policy language is ambiguous in key respects, and it is thus a jump ball as to whether \"the insurer [is] liable.\" There is no evidence in the record suggesting that USAA's liability under the policies was obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I therefore grant USAA summary judgment on the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the defendant's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 49) is granted in part and denied in part.

In that same footnote, however, I noted that \"when reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that their home experienced gradual decay and that, at some point, some small part it unexpectedly 'caved in,' or 'yielded to pressure'-an event that could have occurred in a short time.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In any event, my remarks in the footnote were dicta-indeed, I noted that the two definitions merely \"appear[ed] at odds\"-and, addressed only subpart \"b\" of the definition of \"collapse.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    USAA also cites\n    <em>\n     Kim\n    </em>\n    in favor of this proposition.
