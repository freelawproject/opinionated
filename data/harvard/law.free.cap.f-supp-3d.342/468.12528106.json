KARAS, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Mark A. Guterman (\"Plaintiff\"), individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, brings this putative class action against Costco Wholesale Corporation (\"Costco\" or \"Defendant\"), alleging a private right of action under New York Tax Law \u00a7 1139, and asserting claims for violations of New York General Business Law (\"GBL\") \u00a7 349 and for unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") (Dkt. No. 20).) Plaintiff alleges that Costco has illegally charged its New York customers sales tax on the full price rather than the reduced price of their coupon-related warehouse purchases, and thus required its New York customers to reimburse Costco for its liability for sales tax on the difference between the reduced price and the full price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Before the Court is Costco's Motion To Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) (the \"Motion\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion (Dkt. No. 16).) For the reasons to follow, the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") and are taken as true for the purpose of resolving the instant Motion. (SAC.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff, a Costco customer, alleges that he improperly paid sales tax to Costco at a New York warehouse on the full price, rather than the reduced price, of taxable items purchased, when the price reduction\n   was based on a coupon issued by Costco in its monthly coupon booklet that was not labeled as a manufacturer's coupon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Plaintiff brings this Action individually and on behalf of the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All Costco customers who, for the period beginning three years prior to the commencement of this action and continuing up to and including the present (the \"Class Period\"), paid New York State Sales Tax to Costco for their purchases at Costco's New York warehouses on the full price rather than the reduced price of taxable items when the price reduction was based on a coupon issued by Costco in its monthly coupon booklet (the \"Class\"). Excluded from the Class are Costco and Costco's directors, officers, parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and successors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to Plaintiff, Costco's monthly coupon booklets valid during the Class Period did not indicate \"by 'mfr' or some other code\" that they are \"manufacturers' coupons,\" and did not disclose that the reduced price is the result of a \"manufacturer's reimbursement\" to Costco. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Plaintiff thus avers that under New York Tax Law, Costco's customers making coupon-related purchases subject to sales tax at Costco's New York warehouses were liable only for the sales tax on the reduced price, and Costco itself is liable for the sales tax on the difference between the reduced price and the full price before the price reduction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts an implied private right of action under New York Tax Law \u00a7 1139(a)(ii) and New York Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. (\"NYCRR\") tit. 20, \u00a7\u00a7 526.5(c)(4), 534.2, and 534.8 to require Costco to repay to Plaintiff and Costco's other New York customers the amount of its sales tax liability that Costco has illegally required them to reimburse Costco for. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff also brings claims for violation of GBL \u00a7 349 and for unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    1. Costco's Coupon Booklets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Costco distributes standard form, monthly coupon mailers (\"coupon booklets\"), which include store-issued coupons entitling Costco customers to reduced prices for their purchases in Costco's warehouse facilities of the products identified on the coupons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Each coupon booklet is valid for a prescribed date range. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The form of these booklets has changed over the years,\n   and Plaintiff describes each of these changes in detail in the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; 27-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to August 8, 2013, the coupon booklets included store-issued coupons providing reduced prices for customers' purchases in Costco's warehouses on certain products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Generally, the offers were identified on the coupon itself or elsewhere in the booklet as a \"manufacturer's coupon\" or as providing \"manufacturer's savings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) More specifically, the coupon booklets included offers marked as \"instant savings\" and \"no coupon necessary,\" with an asterisk to \"[s]ee inside cover for terms and conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29(a).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other offers were expressly identified as a \"manufacturer's coupon\" and noted that the \"[o]riginal coupon must be presented at checkout.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29(b).) Finally, there were offers marked as \"online-only offer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, the coupon booklet included \"terms and conditions\" and disclosures regarding the coupons and tax liability, stating \"[t]he coupons in this Booklet are Manufacturers' coupons. When redeemed, state sales tax may be due on the pre-discounted price. These taxes, if any, are in addition to the amount you are paying for the product,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(a) ), and \"[s]tate and local laws may require sales tax to be charged on the pre-discounted price if the product is subject to sales tax. These taxes, if any, are in addition to the amount that you are paying for the product,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(b) ). A separate disclosure, for \"online-only offers,\" stated that \"[m]ost online coupons at Costco.com are manufacturers' coupons. State sales tax may be due on the pre-discounted price of the item when purchased using an online coupon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, after August 8, 2013, Costco's coupon booklets changed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 31.) Most notably, the booklets no longer contained any indication that the offers not marked \"online-only\" were \"manufacturers' coupons\" and that the reduced price was the result of a \"manufacturer's reimbursement\" to Costco. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Additionally, the coupon booklet provided a new form for getting discounts, noting: \"NEW No more clipping coupons!\" and \"Streamlined Savings! No more clipping coupons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c).) Instead, the front cover had a scannable \"Master Bar Code,\" and customers were instructed to \"[b]ring this savings book or the Costco app on your smartphone when you visit Costco and present it to the cashier. Additional books will not be available at the warehouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31(b).) Most of the offers had a picture of the product with the dollar amount discounted listed (i.e. \"$[X] off\"); however, some of the offers had an equation with the original price, then a line item underneath labeled \"Instant Savings\" showing the price reduction, and a line below that listing the customer's reduced price labeled \"your cost.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31(d).) Some of those offers also had a blue arrow pointing at the price and stating \"Book Or App Required.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31(e).) Again, there were offers marked as \"online-only offer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31(f).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The post-August 8, 2013 coupon booklet also included terms and conditions and disclosures regarding the coupons and tax liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32.) However for the offers\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   marked \"online-only,\" the language stating the offers were manufacturers' coupons was removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(b).) The new language in the terms and conditions said: \"When redeemed, state and local\n   laws may require sales tax to be charged on the pre-discounted price.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32(b).) As with the prior offers, a separate disclosure for \"online-only offers\" stated that \"[m]ost online coupons at Costco.com are manufacturers' coupons. State sales tax may be due on the pre-discounted price of the item when purchased using an online coupon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32(c).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Beginning October 3, 2013, the coupon booklets also included an \"Instant Savings\" label on the coupons above the advertised dollar amount discounted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) However, unlike the pre-August 8, 2013 format, there was no asterisked message below the \"Instant Savings\" notation stating \"[s]ee inside cover for terms and conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The \"instant savings\" notation was not added to the coupons that included a blue arrow pointing at the price and stating \"Book Or App Required,\" or to the \"online-only offer\" coupons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, no other changes were made to the coupon booklets prior to the beginning of the class period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The format of the coupon booklets changed again beginning May 8, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The coupons with the blue arrow pointing at the price and stating \"Book Or App Required\" were eliminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36(a).) Thus, except for certain special items like tires, glasses, and ink refills, customers no longer needed to bring the coupon booklet or app to get the price reduction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, the price reduction was applied automatically at checkout. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As with the post-August 8, 2013 coupon booklets, the offers not marked \"online-only\" had no language stating the offers were \"manufacturers' coupons\" or involved a \"manufacturer's reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36(b).) And, the \"online-only offers\" continued to have a separate disclosure stating that \"[m]ost online coupons at Costco.com are manufacturers' coupons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36(c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Beginning May 5, 2016, the \"instant savings\" notation added to the offers starting October 3, 2013 was eliminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37(a).) Some of the coupons for electronics and certain other products still depicted an equation showing the \"Warehouse Price\" on one line, a line stating \"Instant Savings\" with the amount of the price reduction below that, and a line stating \"your cost\" with the reduced price below that. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Again, offers not marked \"online-only\" did not include any reference to \"manufacturers' coupons\" or a \"manufacturer's reimbursement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2. Costco's Sales Receipts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Costco issues customers receipts for their purchases in a standard, computer-generated, structured data format that lists the assigned identifying item number, a brief textual description of the product such as a name abbreviation, and the full price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For taxable items, the receipt includes a letter code to the right of the price which corresponds with the rate at which the sales tax is charged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) For example,\n   an \"A\" indicates that sales tax was charged at the full rate imposed by New York, 4 percent, while an \"F\" indicates that the product is an item of clothing, which, if priced at less than $110 per item, is exempt from New York state sales tax but may still be subject to county sales tax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.) Toward the bottom of the receipt below the total amount paid is an entry for the total sales tax charged on all of the taxable items at each individual rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) The receipt shows an \"A\" for fully taxable items, the rate charged, and the total sales tax charged, which includes but does not separately break out both the New York state sales tax and any additional sales tax imposed by counties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The receipt shows an \"F\" for clothing, the rate charged, and the total county sales tax charged. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that only by manually adding the full price of all \"A\" taxable items on the receipt and applying the stated sales tax rate shown on the receipt can customers determine that Costco has charged sales tax on the full price rather than the reduced price of purchased items involving the coupons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) And even then, the customers would have to subtract the total coupon related price reductions for all \"A\" taxable items to calculate the amount of Costco's sales tax liability that Costco has charged the customers based on the full price, rather than the reduced price, of their coupon-related warehouse purchases subject to sales tax. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For items purchased involving coupon price reductions, the coupon number, the notation \"CPN/[Item number],\" and the amount of the coupon's price reduction is listed on a line immediately below the line for the item whose price is reduced by that coupon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Additionally, the receipt also includes a line near the bottom showing the total amount of \"coupons tendered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    3. Costco's SEC Filings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to Plaintiff, Costco referred to its coupon booklets as \"coupon mailers\" in every Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the ten-year period beginning in 2007 through fiscal year ending August 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) While Costco's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 3, 2017 does not use the term \"coupon mailers,\" the audited, certified financial statements for that fiscal year state in Note 1 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"), under the subheading \"Receivables, Net,\" state that \"[v]endor receivables include coupons, volume rebates and other purchase discounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, under the subheading \"Vendor Consideration,\" Note 1 states that \"[Costco] has agreements to receive funds from vendors for coupons and a variety of other programs. These programs are evidenced by signed agreements....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    4. Costco's Taxing Practices In Other States\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Costco does not charge sales tax on the full price of items in its coupon booklets in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, but only the reduced price, because the tax laws of those states provide that the sales tax should be charged on the reduced price for coupon-related sales regardless of whether the coupons are \"manufacturers' coupons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Plaintiff believes that Costco employs individuals who analyze the coupon-related sales tax laws of each state to determine whether sales tax should be charged on the full or reduced price for sales involving \"manufacturers' coupons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) Thus, Costco must have been aware that it was liable under New York Tax Law for the sales tax on the difference between the full price and the reduced price of items in its coupon booklets not marked as \"manufacturers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   coupons\" purchased in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June 26, 2017. (Dkt. No. 1.) On July 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint. (Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 6).) On August 9, 2017, Defendant requested a conference to discuss a proposed motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 9.) On August 14, 2018, Plaintiff filed his opposition to the pre-motion letter. (Dkt. No. 11.) During the pre-motion conference on October 19, 2017, the Court adopted a briefing schedule for the instnat Motion. (Dkt. No. 15.) In accordance with the Scheduling Order, Defendant filed the Motion and accompanying memorandum of law on November 17, 2017. (Notice of Motion; Def.'s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. To Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 17).) On December 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendant's Motion, (Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Mot. To Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 18) ), and on January 12, 2017, Defendant filed its reply, (Def.'s Reply Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. To. Dismiss (\"Def.'s Reply Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 19) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed the SAC. (Dkt. No. 20.) Plaintiff also filed a letter on behalf of both Parties requesting that the Court consider the pending Motion to be directed at the SAC. (Letter from William R. Weinstein, Esq. to Court (Mar. 7, 2018) (\"Mar. 7, 2018 Pl.'s Letter\") (Dkt. No. 21).) Pursuant to a memo endorsement, the Court granted the request. (Dkt.

Here, Plaintiff does not allege that Costco failed to remit the tax charged on the difference between the reduced price and the full price to the state of New York. In fact, Plaintiff claims the excess funds collected from customers were remitted to the state of New York to pay Costco's own tax liability on that difference. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAC \u00b6 7 (\"[T]he total Sales Tax remitted by Costco to the State of New York on the full price is the correct amount, and not an overpayment of Sales Tax as might be the case in connection with the remittance by Costco of Sales Tax charged customers for items excluded from Sales Tax under New York law. Thus, Costco's liability for Sales Tax under \u00a7 526.5(c)(4) has been discharged, while Costco has been fully reimbursed for its liability by the amounts illegally collected from its New York customers.\").)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    It is unclear what refund Defendant would even seek from the Tax Commission.
