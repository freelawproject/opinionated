BLM argues it reasonably considered a no development scenario, yet that scenario considers the plan area at whole and is succinctly discarded. AR 184701, 223539. However, Plaintiffs argue that BLM should have considered \"an alternative eliminating oil and gas leasing in areas determined to have only moderate or low potential for oil and gas development.\" ECF No. 24 at 37.

The basis of BLM's argument here is that it was not required to consider the latter option because such a low percentage of the low and medium potential areas were projected to be developed. ECF No. 27 at 14-15. But if those areas were open for leasing, even if there is a minimal chance for development, it would detract from BLM designating that land for other uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   As such, \"the principle of multiple use does not require BLM to prioritize development over other uses.\"\n   <em>\n    New Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643558\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/683/\">\n    565 F.3d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since a \"parcel of land cannot both be preserved in its natural\n   character and mined\" it seems a reasonable alternative would be to consider what else may be done with the low and medium potential lands if they are not held open for leasing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3643558\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/683/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mtn.

However, this does not excuse the fact that BLM did not closely study an alternative that closes low and medium potential lands when it admits there is an exceedingly small chance of them being leased.
