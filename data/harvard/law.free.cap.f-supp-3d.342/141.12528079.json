[ECF No. 1] \u00b6 28. Although his right to possess a firearm has been restored under the laws of his home state of Montana, he alleges that the government's interpretation and application of the federal felon-in-possession statute effectively prevents him from purchasing a firearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29-34. Because the government instructs firearms dealers not to sell to anyone who has \"been convicted in any court of a felony, or any other crime for which the judge could have imprisoned [him] for more than one year,\" Reyes asserts that sellers are unable to provide him with a firearm.

In the alternative, he asserts two claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment, alleging that the statute creates two impermissible distinctions: first, between federal offenders convicted, like him, of securities and accounting offenses who are barred from possessing firearms and federal offenders convicted of \"business practices\" offenses who are excepted from the felon-in-possession statute (Count II),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 5, 39-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and second, between citizens convicted of non-violent crimes who do not \"pose[ ] any greater risk to public safety[ ] than a typical law-abiding citizen\" but are disqualified from firearm possession and other citizens not subject to \u00a7 922(d)(1) and (g)(1) (Count III),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6, 43-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The government disputes only whether Reyes has suffered a cognizable injury from the application of \u00a7 922(d)(1), arguing that only an individual transferring or selling a firearm--not a would-be purchaser or recipient-suffers a potential injury in fact from the application of the seller provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mot. at 9-10.

Following rampant abuses in the sales of securities and the subsequent crash of the stock market in 1929, Congress enacted the first federal laws specifically regulating securities. The Securities Act of 1933 was enacted \"[t]o provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce, and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof, and for other purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%2074\">\n    48 Stat. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (1933). One year later, Congress enacted the Exchange Act, which established the SEC and was intended \"[t]o provide for the regulation of securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets operating in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and unfair practices on such exchanges and markets, and for other purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Stat.%20881\">\n    48 Stat. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (1934). Together, these Acts regulated the business practices that had led to financial ruin for thousands of investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This new statutory scheme was intended not only to redress actual economic harm to investors, but also proactively to prevent the occurrence of such harm in the future. To do so, the Exchange Act imposed disclosure requirements, which\n   serve as prophylactic measures to protect investors from incomplete market information.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(b)(2) (requiring securities issuers to maintain reasonably detailed records). \"The theory behind th[is] federal regulatory framework is that investors are adequately protected if all aspects of the securities being marketed are fully and fairly disclosed[.]\" 3 James D.

The Exchange Act therefore regulates not only conduct that has caused or could cause consumer harm but also conduct that may in the aggregate lead to increased risk of economic loss by investors. Thus, like the statutes referenced in the business practices exception, the Exchange Act \"lay[s] down a scheme of acceptable and unacceptable behavior by imposing direct restraints against certain business procedures[ ] and requirements and regulations for the carrying out of a business enterprise\" for \"the purpose of protecting the consumer while promoting appropriate competitive business and pricing practices.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The text of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) provides that regulations under that provision are limited to those made \"\n   <em>\n    for the protection of investors\n   </em>\n   \" or \"in the public interest.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (emphasis added). To the extent that provisions \"made 'in the public interest' \" could, in theory, be distinguishable from those made \"for the protection of investors,\" the Court need not and does not express an opinion; here, the materiality element of SEC Rule 10b--5 confirms that the regulation Reyes violated was made \"for the protection of investors.\" A fact is only \"material if there is a substantial likelihood that a\n   <em>\n    reasonable investor would consider it important\n   </em>\n   in making a decision\" by \"alter[ing] the 'total mix' of information made available.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843846\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/660/454/#p459\">\n    660 F.3d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). A Rule 10b--5 offense is therefore explicitly tied to protecting the investor's interest in having complete information to minimize economic risk. Thus, even though a Rule 10b--5 conviction does not require the government to prove as an element that any investor in fact \"was affected\" by relying on the information, or that the misrepresentation resulted in economic loss-a prerequisite of satisfying a strict application of the elements test-the language of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and of the Rule 10b-5 offense's materiality element confirm that the predicate securities fraud and false filing offenses have the requisite primary purpose of preventing adverse effects on securities purchasers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Similarly, Reyes's convictions for making false statements to auditors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .13b2--2 required proof that he knowingly made a \"materially false or misleading statement to an accountant.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Like the other offenses, this requirement supports the Exchange Act's disclosure system, which is \"based on the premise that 'No investor can safely buy or sell securities without having an intelligent basis for forming his judgment as to the value of the securities he buys or sells.' \" Promotion of the Reliability of Financial Information and Prevention of the Concealment of Questionable or Illegal Corporate Payments and Practices, Exchange Act Release No. 15570,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1979%20WL%20173674\">\n    1979 WL 173674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (Feb. 15, 1979) (citation omitted). As such, the SEC determined that the bookkeeping provision was \" 'necessary or appropriate' in the public interest,\n   <em>\n    for the protection of investors\n   </em>\n   and to insure fair dealing in securities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1979%20WL%20173674\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To provide even greater protection to investors, the SEC rejected the imposition of a materiality standard for the bookkeeping provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9 (noting the SEC's \"concern that a limitation concerning 'material' falsity would unduly narrow the scope of the rule and result in an unwarranted diminution of investor protection\"). Thus, issuers are required to provide all information in reasonable detail, even if such information would not be considered important by a reasonable investor. Because violations of the bookkeeping provision could lead \"to the concealment of material information that should be disclosed in periodic reports or to purchasers and sellers of the issuer's securities,\" the SEC imposed the bookkeeping requirement as a separate, antecedent measure to ensure that investors remained fully informed and able to minimize the economic risks associated with overvalued stock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Hence, it is clear that the primary purpose of the bookkeeping provision was to protect investors from economic harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Each of Reyes's predicate business practices offenses, then, possesses the requisite primary purpose under the business practices exception. There may be instances in which a statutory provision's primary purpose is not so easily divined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sissel v.

Here, it is clear that the violated provisions regulate business practices by securities issuers to prevent deceptive half-truths or affirmatively misleading statements regarding the stability of a company or the value of its stock. Such laws and regulations primarily ensure that investors have sufficient information to make informed decisions to minimize their risk of economic loss-i.e., they are primarily concerned with protecting securities purchasers through the regulation of business practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court concludes that each of Reyes's predicate offenses satisfies the primary purpose prong of the business practices exception test and therefore is excluded from the definition of \"crime[s] punishable by imprisonment for a term\n   exceeding one year.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The business practices exception in \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A) excludes from the felon-in-possession statute only predicate offenses relating to the regulation of business practices that are designed to address economic harm to competition or consumers. An offense relating to the regulation of business practices qualifies under the exception if either its primary purpose or the elements of the violation demonstrate that it was primarily intended to address such harm. While none of Reyes's predicate convictions required the government to prove as an element of the offense direct harm to competition or consumers, the text and history of the Exchange Act generally, and an examination of each of Reyes's predicate offenses specifically, evince that those offenses regulate business practices primarily to protect securities purchasers from economic harm. Hence, each of Reyes's predicate offenses \"pertain[s] to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices\" under \u00a7 921(a)(20)(A) and thus does not trigger the application of the felon-in-possession statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because the Court concludes that \u00a7 922(d)(1) and (g)(1) are not applicable to Reyes, the Court will not consider the constitutional challenges he raises in the alternative.

Hence, a separate examination of whether Reyes's securities offenses are \"unfair trade practices\" is unnecessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The United States Code is prepared and published by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives, not by Congress.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Preface, United States Code, at v.
