The court can readily see, for example, that disclosure of the internal deliberations between General Kelly and high-ranking DOD officials about \"a possible new detention operation in the continental United States\" could result in reasonably foreseeable harm to future \"honest and frank communication within the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

In reviewing these documents, the court noted DOD's inconsistent redactions across these records. For example, in Record 320, the government left unredacted General Kelly's opinion that the slow progress of the military commission in addressing the ruling barring female guards from touching certain detainees rivaled the lengthy deliberations required to reach the \"complicated\" \"Dred Scott decision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Because the responsive emails and attachments comprise routine updates sent by General Kelly to DOD senior officials, General Kelly often addressed the same subject matter in his emails-usually, \"Camps, Behavioral Health Unit/Detainee Hospital, Facilities, Detainee Movement Orders (DMO), Upcoming Events, and Final Comments\"-and provided updates to senior officials on any developments to these categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In their briefing, the parties identified the disputed categories of operational information covered by DOD's section 1.4(a) withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-21; Pls.'

To begin with, the government-issued charts detailing the height and weight of specific detainees between the years 2002 and 2006 pertain to a time period outside of the scope of the responsive records, and therefore cannot \"match\" any of the information withheld by DOD.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Langford Decl., Exs.

Additionally, Plaintiffs have not shown that General Craddock's official acknowledgement of the use of \"restraint chairs\" to impose enteral feeding, nor the first-hand account of a JTF-GTMO detainee describing force-feeding, \"officially acknowledge\" the specific, redacted details withheld by DOD here. The mere existence of some public information about the enteral feeding program does not suffice to overcome DOD's invocation of Exemption 1 to protect the specific withheld information.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Azmy v.

Harm to the National Security\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court easily rejects Plaintiffs' related assertion that the release of similar information to that withheld here somehow lessens the risk of harm to the national security resulting from disclosure of information relating to detainee health and the controversial enteral feeding program. \"[T]he fact that information resides in the public domain does not eliminate the possibility that further disclosures can cause harm to intelligence sources, methods and operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon v.

As the agency avers, \"releasing sensitive deliberative materials related to hunger strikes would create a powerful propaganda tool for hostile parties seeking to recruit and inflame forces against the United States military and personnel abroad.\" McCubbin Decl. \u00b6 26. This statement readily satisfies the standard for a plausible and logical explanation for classification and is therefore sufficient to invoke Exemption 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Detainee Movements to Third Countries\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   DOD withheld information relating to detainee movement to third countries, including General Kelly's discussions as to \"whether a detainee movement is authorized,\" \"the measures that need to be taken to execute the mission,\" \"the logistical requirements necessary to conduct the mission,\" \"the required approval and coordination with the receiving nation,\" \"the reactions of the detainees upon learning\n   of their transfer,\" as well as \"information regarding the receiving nation,\" including \"when and how the transfer will occur\" and \"details regarding preliminary discussions with the receiving nation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. According to the agency, releasing information about detainee movements \"create[s] significant national security risks by publicizing sensitive operational details about how these orders are executed, including the logistical details that could enable interference in future or similar operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Moreover, because the information concerns the U.S. government's cooperation with foreign governments to move detainees, releasing that information \"would have a significant detrimental effect on the government's ability to continue cooperating with foreign governments in these operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenge to these withholdings is limited to the government's withholding of information detailing the \"reactions of the detainees upon learning of their transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 28-29. Plaintiffs argue that the release of such information \"do[es] not implicate governmental operations, logistics, procedures, or the United States' relationship with foreign governments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. The court agrees with Plaintiffs-the connection between releasing information about the \"reactions of detainees\" upon learning of their movements from JTF-GTMO and a risk of \"enabl[ing] interference in future or similar\" detainee movements is tenuous at best. Information about a detainee's feelings or thoughts about his impending transfer would not seem to pose the same security risk as, say, information regarding how or when the detainees are being transferred, or the name of the receiving nation. If, as DOD appears to assert,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 11, the redacted information about the reactions of detainees is too intertwined with other withheld information-the identity of the receiving nation or questions of timing, for example-then DOD may assert as much in a supplemental declaration. On the present record, however, the court cannot discern, even affording due deference to the agency on national security matters as required, a logical connection between the disclosure of detainees' reactions to transfer orders and a risk to the national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally assert that the government has officially acknowledged and disclosed the country of destination for detainee transfers and must therefore disclose this information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

And, again, the court rejects Plaintiffs' argument; it is more than logical and plausible that the sensitive nature of this information is such that its release could \"permit[ ] the details of [the detainees'] detention to become widely known to hostile forces abroad that are still engaged with deployed forces.\" McCubbin Decl. \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Congressional Matters\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs' final challenge to the government's section 1.4(a) withholdings involves redactions in Records 272 and 304 that \"contain discussions of congressional matters related to JTF-GTMO operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.

According to the agency's declaration, Record 273 \"discusses a detainee movement operation that was postponed due to the receiving nation no longer being willing or able or both to accept the detainee.\" McCubbin Decl. \u00b6 35. According to DOD, disclosure of this information \"would negatively impact our ability to deal with foreign nations on sensitive matters\" and \"protect and advance U.S. national interests\" because \"[f]oreign governments would no longer trust us to deal with foreign nations on sensitive matters.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The court agrees with Plaintiffs that DOD has failed to show that the information in Record 273 pertains to \"foreign government information\" within the meaning of section 1.4(b) of EO 13,526. The Executive Order defines \"foreign government information,\" as relevant here, as \"information provided to the United States Government by a foreign government ... with the expectation that the information, the source of the information, or both,\n   <em>\n    are to be held in confidence\n   </em>\n   ,\" or, conversely, \"information produced by the United States Government pursuant to or as a result of a joint arrangement with a foreign government ... requiring that the information ...\n   <em>\n    be held in confidence\n   </em>\n   .\" EO 13,526 \u00a7 6.1(s) (emphases added).

As in\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   , the information redacted from Record 257 falls within Exemption 7(E)'s ambit because its disclosure would raise significant security concerns for those guards implementing the enteral feeding procedures, thus rendering the \"law enforcement techniques and procedures\" and \"guidelines\" spelled out in the document ineffective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   DOD has also sufficiently shown that the information in Record 257 is \"not generally known to the public\" and that its disclosure would pose a reasonable risk of circumvention of the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, Plaintiffs suggest that because BOP policies for managing hunger strikers and enteral feeders are available to the public, the redacted information in Record 257 is effectively public as well because DOD's \"hunger strike policy and procedures mirrors those followed by [BOP] to the maximum extent possible.\" Pls.'
