MARTINEZ, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff Maxum Indemnity Company (\"Maxum\")'s Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF Nos. 45] and Defendant Maria Del Carmen Solis, Personal Representative of the Estate of Pedro Jose Sanchez (\"the Estate\")'s Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 46]. The Court has reviewed the motions, related briefing [ECF Nos. 58, 57, 60, 61], the record, and is otherwise duly advised in the premises. For reasons set forth below, the Court determines that Maxum is entitled to summary judgment in its favor. The Estate's motion is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Accident and State Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At all relevant times, James Massaro (\"Massaro\") was the president, secretary and sole director of 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation Plumbing, Inc. (\"3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation\"), a plumbing contractor with principal place of business in Monroe County, Florida. Maxum issued a commercial general liability policy (Policy No. BDG-0080104-02) that named 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation as the insured and covered the period from February 21, 2015 through February 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 15, 2015, Pedro Jose Sanchez (\"Sanchez\"), a laborer for 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation, was crushed by a backhoe on a job site and died as a result. It is undisputed that 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation maintained workers' compensation insurance and that its workers' compensation insurance carrier paid benefits to the Estate of Pedro Jose Sanchez. The Estate thereafter filed a wrongful death action in the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Monroe County against 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation and James Massaro, contending, in its original pleading, that the Defendants failed to provide and maintain a reasonably safe workplace in conformity with all applicable governmental safety standards and engaged in misconduct which was \"substantially and virtually certain to result in injury or death to the decedent.\" On this premise, the Estate contended the defendants forfeited their ability to invoke workers' compensation immunity under the intentional tort exception of the Florida Workers' Compensation Act set forth at \u00a7 440.11(b) (2), Fla. Stat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation was dismissed as a defendant from the state court suit, the Estate filed a Second Amended Complaint which named Massaro as sole defendant and dropped the \"virtually certain\" language previously pled to circumvent workers' compensation immunity. In this pleading, the Estate alleged that Massaro's negligent conduct (including his alleged alteration of equipment to bypass safety features which would have prevented Mr. Sanchez's death)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   constituted a willful violation\n   of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a provision of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), applicable only to \"employers,\" which criminalizes willful violations of any OSHA standard that results in the death of an employee. The Estate alleged that Massaro is liable for violating \u00a7 666(e) as an \"employer,\" because of the \"pervasive and total\" control he exerted as a principal in the corporation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cusack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405514\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/806/47/\">\n    806 F.Supp. 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. N.J. 1992) (officer or director's role in corporation may be so pervasive and total that he is deemed to be the corporation and therefore an \"employer\" subject to criminal liability for OSHA violations). Consequently, the Estate alleged that Massaro forfeited the protections of workers' compensation immunity by failing to avoid the commission of criminal law violations in the course of his managerial and policy-making duties undertaken on behalf of the corporation pursuant to \u00a7 440.11(1) (b) (2), Fla. Stat. [ECF No. 44-3, \u00b6 15]. This exception to the Florida Workers' Compensation Act's exclusivity provision provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The same immunity provisions enjoyed by an employer shall also apply to any sole proprietor, partner, corporate officer or director, supervisor, or other person who in the course and scope of his or her duties acts in a managerial or policymaking capacity and the conduct which caused the alleged injury arose within the course and scope of said managerial or policymaking duties and was not a violation of law, whether or not a violation was charged, for which the maximum penalty which may be imposed does not exceed 60 days' imprisonment as set forth in s. 775.082.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00a7 440.11(1) (b) (2), Fla. Stat. Put another way, the Estate claimed that Massaro, acting in the course and scope of his managerial and policy-making duties as an executive officer of 3d Generation, became criminally liable for the commission of OSHA violations resulting in Mr. Sanchez's death and thereby forfeited workers' compensation immunity under operation of \u00a7 440.11(1)(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Federal Declaratory Judgment Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Maxum assumed the defense of 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation and Massaro in the underlying tort action under a reservation of rights [ECF No. 1, \u00b6 19], and then proceeded to file this declaratory judgment action to determine whether it is obligated to defend and indemnify Massaro and 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation in that proceeding. Maxum's initial complaint identifies various exclusions, definitions and conditions which it contends preclude coverage under the Policy for the claims asserted against Massaro in the underlying state court action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The relevant exclusions invoked in Maxum's instant motion for summary judgment are the Employer's Liability Exclusion and the Workers' Compensation Law Exclusion. Under the Employer's Liability Exclusion, the insurer is generally not liable for injuries that occur to employees while they are performing duties related to the insured's business. Under the Workers Compensation Law Exclusion, coverage does not extend to \"any obligation of the insured under a workers' compensation ... law or similar law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The CGL Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Maxum issued a policy extending commercial general liability coverage to 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation subject to certain terms, conditions, limitations, definitions, and exclusions (\"the Policy\"). The Policy provides limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence, subject to a $2500 per claim deductible for bodily injury. The relevant policy sections implicated in this summary judgment proceeding are found at Section I, Coverage A, \"Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability,\" Section II, \"Who is an Insured,\" and Section IV, \"Commercial General Liability Conditions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Insuring Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Coverage A of the Policy sets forth the essential \"Insuring Agreement\" between the parties, and recites Maxum's undertaking \"to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies.\" [Section I, Coverage A, \u00b6 1.a] [ECF 44-6 p. 17]. The insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" only if it is caused by an \"occurrence\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that takes place in the defined coverage territory and during the policy period. [Section I, Coverage A, \u00b6 1.b.]. By this agreement, Maxum further undertook \"the right and duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking those damages,\" but assumed \"no duty to defend the insured against any 'suit' seeking damages for 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance does not apply.\" [Section I, Coverage A, \u00b6 1.a].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Who is an Insured\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At Section II (\"Who Is An Insured\"), the Policy defines who is eligible to claim the coverages extended under the Policy. Section II, \u00b6 1, recites that the person or entity designated in the Declarations is an insured, in addition to certain categories of individuals associated with the operation of the named insured's particular form of business organization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As relevant here, the Policy provides at Section II, \u00b6 1.d:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1. If you are designated in the Declarations as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   d. An organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, you are an insured. Your \"executive officers\" and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors. Your stockholders are also insureds,\n   but only with respect to their liability as stockholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Section II, \u00b6 2 sets forth categories of additional insureds, and provides in material part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   2. Each of the following is also an insured:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a. ....[Y]our \"employees,\" other than either your 'executive officers'\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (if you are an organization other than a partnership joint venture or limited liability company) or your managers (if you are a limited liability company), but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business. However, none of these \"employees\" ....... are insureds for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) \"Bodily injury\" or \"personal and advertising injury\":\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) To you.... or to a co-\"employee\" while in the course of his or her employment or performing duties related to the conduct of your business;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Exclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section I, Coverage A, Paragraph 2, of the Policy states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   2. Exclusions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   d. Workers' Compensation and Similar Laws\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Any obligation of the insured under a workers' compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   e.

Conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section IV (\"Commercial General Liability Conditions\"), \u00b6 7 of the Policy recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Separation of Insureds\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this insurance applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   a. As if each Named Insured were the only Named insured; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   b.

Workers' Compensation Law Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The underlying state court complaint alleges that Massaro acted, relative to the misconduct alleged, in the course and scope of his employment as executive officer and sole director of 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation, and that he is liable in tort to the Estate for criminal violations committed in the exercise of his managerial and policy-making duties on behalf of the corporation. These allegations bring Massaro within the definition of an \"insured\" as set forth at Section II, \u00b6 1.d. of the Policy, which, in addition to a designated or named insured consisting of an organization \"other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company,\" subsumes the following categories of individuals: \"Your 'executive officers' and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors.\" Maxum acknowledges that Massaro qualifies as an insured under this provision and that that Maxum has a duty to defend him in the underlying lawsuit unless liability coverage for Sanchez's death is excluded under the CGL Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted, 3\n   <sup>\n    rd\n   </sup>\n   Generation's CGL Policy excludes from bodily injury and property damage liability coverage payable under \"Coverage A,\" \"any obligation of the insured under a workers' compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law.\" (Policy, Part A, 2.d.). From here, the central question presented is whether the \"Workers' Compensation and Similar Laws\" exclusion of the Policy applies to Massaro, as \"the insured,\" within the meaning of this clause, on rationale that his tort liability in the\n   underlying wrongful death claim constitutes an \"obligation\" of Massaro under a workers compensation law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Estate argues that Maxum cannot avoid coverage of the wrongful death claim through the Policy's Workers' Compensation Law exclusion because its tort claim is tantamount to a duty to pay imposed by tort law, not an \"obligation ... under a workers compensation law.\" Maxum, in turn, contends that Massaro's liability in the wrongful death case exists purely due to operation of \u00a7 440(1)(b)(2) of the Florida Workers Compensation Law, and that his \"obligation\" to the Estate is therefore one \"under\" a workers' compensation law for purposes of triggering the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although neither Florida nor the Eleventh Circuit has addressed the interpretation of this specific exclusion as applied to a corporate officer of an insured corporation, the interpretation advanced by Maxum is fully consistent with Florida case law interpreting and applying this exclusion to employer-insureds, and is adopted here as a natural and logical outgrowth of that precedent.

As to the workers' compensation exclusion, the Third District reasoned that because \"[t]he 'employer's liability' is pursuant to section 440.11(1) of the Workers' Compensation Law [deriving from a statutory exception to tort immunity], the employer's \"obligation to [the employee] is one 'under a workers' compensation ... law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916085\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/890/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916085\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/890/\">\n    at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Like the negligence-based claims in\n   <em>\n    Indian Harbor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Revoredo\n   </em>\n   , this Court concludes that Massaro's tort liability to the Estate is a creature of the Florida Workers' Compensation Law, and therefore constitutes an \"obligation\" of Massaro to an employee \"under a workers' compensation ...law.\" That the insured in this case is a corporate officer, as opposed to an employer, does not compel a different result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oppenheim v.

Kan. 2013) (same). The Court agrees with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Oppenheim\n   </em>\n   . A CGL Policy is designed to protect the insured from liability for injuries to the public and is not designed to protect it from lawsuits for bodily injuries to its own employees. Because Mr. Sanchez's death was covered by\n   the Florida Workers Compensation Act, and the tort liability of Massaro exists under a statutory exception to immunity under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act, the tort claim of the Estate is plainly an \"obligation\" of \"the insured\" \"under a workers compensation ... law\" for purposes of triggering this exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Advancing a contrary result, the Estate argues, unlike\n   <em>\n    Indian Harbor\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Revoredo\n   </em>\n   , that this case does not involve a tort claim against an employer charged with a statutory duty to obtain workers' compensation insurance; instead, it notes Massaro is a corporate executive who is not personally charged with an obligation to maintain such insurance, such that the underlying tort claim against him is not properly viewed as an \"obligation\" attaching to him \"under\" a workers' compensation law. It contends this interpretation is driven by the Policy's \"separation of insureds\" clause, which states that Coverage A applies, \"as if each named insured were the only named insured\" and \"separately to each insured against whom claim is made or \"suit is brought.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In support of this proposition, it relies primarily upon\n   <em>\n    Tri-S Corp. v. Western World Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/\">\n    110 Hawai'i 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/\">\n    135 P.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Interpreting similar policy language, the Hawaiian Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Tri-S\n   </em>\n   concluded, as a threshold matter, that an executive officer of the insured corporation qualified as an insured by definition of the Policy, which - like the Maxum Policy - provided that executive officers of the named insured are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as corporate officers. It next addressed the two policy exclusions invoked as a coverage bar to the claim against the executive officer-insured. As relevant here, it addressed the workers' compensation exclusion, which excluded coverage for \"[a]ny obligation of the insured under a workers compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or similar law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The claimant in\n   <em>\n    Tri-S\n   </em>\n   contended that the named insured corporation - not its corporate officer - was the only entity charged with an \"obligation\" under a workers' compensation law to provide workers' compensation insurance, and that the exclusion therefore had no application to the officer-insured. The Hawaiian Supreme Court agreed. It held, first, that the phrase \"the insured,\" in the context of this exclusion, must be read to mean the party seeking coverage as opposed to the named insured (i.e. corporation-employer), or \"any insured,\" in analyzing whether the workers' compensation exclusion applies. Therefore, it found the phrase \"obligation of the insured\" properly read to mean an \"obligation of [the officer].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the officer-insured was not an \"employer\" charged with a duty to provide workers' compensation insurance under Hawai'i's workers compensation law, the court found the exclusion inapplicable to him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/\">\n    at 492-493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12262558\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/110/473/\">\n    135 P.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although this Court agrees that the phrase \"obligation of the insured\" in the context of the instant policy exclusion may properly be read to mean an \"obligation of Massaro\" as an officer-insured by definition, it respectfully disagrees with the remainder of the\n   <em>\n    Tri-S\n   </em>\n   court's analysis on\n   this issue, finding it inconsistent with the plain language of the exclusion and Florida case law precedent holding that an \"obligation\" of an employer-insured in this context includes a tort obligation based on a statutory exception to workers' compensation immunity.\n   <em>\n    See Indian Harbor,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Revoredo,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916085\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/698/890/\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Drawing from these authorities, the Policy's Workers' Compensation Law exclusion in this case is logically interpreted to subsume tort obligations chargeable to a corporate officer-insured which exist as a creature of a statutory exception to tort immunity under Florida's Workers' Compensation Act. Massaro's tort liability to the Estate is a product of alleged criminal law violations committed in the discharge of his managerial and policy-making duties on behalf of 3rd Generation. The instant claim, hinging on such violations, necessarily derives from an \"obligation\" of Massaro under the Florida statute. Hence, the Policy's Workers Compensation Law exclusion plainly applies to the underlying tort claim, and Massaro is not covered under the Maxum Policy for this claim as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Maxum has no obligation to defend or indemnify Massaro in the underlying tort action under operation of the Policy's Workers' Compensation Exclusion as a matter of law.
