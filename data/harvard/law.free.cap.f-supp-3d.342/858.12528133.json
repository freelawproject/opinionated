ECF No. 48. Plaintiffs Marc Pia and Jerry Oppat filed a resistance to Defendants' Motion on October 23, 2017. ECF No. 54. Defendants filed a reply on November 2, 2017. ECF No. 65. This Court heard oral arguments on the motion on December 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 75. Following oral argument, this Court entered an Order staying the case pending a decision by the Iowa Supreme Court. ECF No. 76. On June 22, 2018, the parties submitted a Joint Status Report, notifying the Court that the Iowa Supreme Court had issued its decision. ECF No. 79. After the stay was lifted, the parties filed supplemental briefs supporting their positions. ECF Nos. 82, 89, 90. The matter is fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Pia is a resident of Georgia, and Plaintiff Oppat is a resident of Montana. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4. Both are employed as pipefitters and are members of United Association of Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters (UA) Local 364 in Colton, California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Plaintiff Pia has worked as a union journeyman pipefitter since 2000. ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 1. Plaintiff Oppat has worked as a union journeyman pipefitter for over twenty-five years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs receive referrals for work from local unions throughout the country and travel around working on various projects for extended periods of time. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 5. In 2014, Plaintiffs received a referral from UA Local 125 in Keokuk, Iowa, to work for Defendant URS, a subcontractor on a project constructing the Iowa Fertilizer Plant in nearby Wever, Iowa (the Project).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6. On October 22, 2014, Plaintiffs began working for Defendant URS on the Project in the Wachs Tooling group, which required them to use a Wachs machine to cut industrial pipe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12. For the\n   majority of their employment with Defendant URS, Plaintiff Oppat worked as a pipe foreman and Plaintiff Pia worked as a pipefitter on Oppat's crew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Plaintiffs trained other employees on the jobsite on how to operate the Wachs machines. ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant AECOM acquired Defendant URS effective October 17, 2014. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs' employment with URS was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) called the National Construction Agreement (NCA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs deny ever receiving copies of the NCA. ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 16; 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5. Article 13 of the NCA provides a procedure through which union employees can grieve disputes arising under the NCA, including decisions to terminate employment. ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 15, 48-3 at 194-95. Article 19 of the NCA governs safety on the jobsite, providing that employees are \"bound by the safety rules and regulations as established by the Employer in accordance with the Construction Safety Act and [the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ],\" and that employers are responsible for \"assur[ing] safe working conditions for [their] employees.\" ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 16, 48-3 at 198. Article 20 provides in part that \"[a]ny employee who participates in or encourages any activities which interfere with the normal operation of the project shall be subject to disciplinary action, including discharge, and if justifiably discharged for the above reasons, shall not be eligible for rehire on the same project for a period of not less than ninety (90) days.\" ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 17, 48-3 at 198-200.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant URS published and disseminated the Project Job Rules and Regulations that applied to all URS employees on the Project. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 18. Plaintiffs both signed forms acknowledging they had received copies of the Project Job Rules and Regulations and agreed to comply with them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 48-3 at 104-12, 114-22. Category 1 of the Project Job Rules and Regulations is entitled \"Zero Tolerance Offenses.\" ECF No. 48-3 at 110, 120. That section provides, \"Category 1 violations will result in immediate termination of employment and employee will not be eligible for re-hire on the project\" by Defendant URS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110, 120. Such Zero Tolerance Offenses include \"[w]illful or gross negligence of Security, Safety or Fitness for Duty Rules and Regulations\" and \"[v]erbal abuse, violence or threats of violence to other employees or fellow workers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110-11, 120-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both Plaintiffs acknowledge that, as union employees covered by the NCA, they could challenge Defendant URS's termination of their employment through the grievance process detailed in the NCA. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs allege they had never filed a grievance prior to their respective terminations from employment with URS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Pia alleges he attempted to file a grievance following his termination but the local union hall refused to help him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge that had they brought grievances pursuant to the NCA, they would have alleged the same facts alleged in this action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants conducted daily safety meetings on the work site, which both Plaintiffs attended. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs repeatedly\n   raised safety concerns during the meetings regarding the work site, including concerns relating to the workers' parking lot, which Defendant URS did not own or control but said it would take care of any issues involving the lot because its employees parked there. ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 25, 54-2 \u00b6 13. Plaintiff Pia accused Defendants of violating safety standards established by OSHA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 22. Plaintiff Oppat, as Pia's foreman, actively voiced his support for Pia in raising the safety issues.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31-32. Plaintiffs allege that at meetings on February 13 and 14, 2015, Steve Newman, a general foreman on the project and union member, threatened to fire any employee who continued to raise concerns that the jobsite parking lot was unsafe. ECF Nos. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-20, 29; 48-2 \u00b6 24; 54-2 \u00b6 13. Newman was a pipefitter who worked on the Project from August 18, 2014 through March 12, 2015. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 27. Newman did not have any authority to fire anyone because he was not an employee of either Defendant and he was not involved in or consulted about the decisions to terminate Plaintiffs' employment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; ECF No. 66 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14; however, Plaintiffs assert they both understood that Newman, as their general foreman, had the power to terminate their employment, ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 28. Plaintiffs also allege they raised safety concerns to Newman relating to a large, unbarricaded hole in the ground at the jobsite and a heavy pipe that they were unable to safely cut while it was suspended at an angle in a pipe rack, and Newman again threatened their jobs. ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 26; 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 28, 2015, during the morning safety meeting, Newman cut off any discussions about safety concerns relating to the jobsite parking lot. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 29. Thereafter, Newman went to Plaintiff Oppat's crew's tent, where Plaintiff Pia \"called [Newman] out on his lack of attention to safety on the jobsite.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 14. In response, Newman threatened Pia's job and left the tent. ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 29, 54-2 \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs then turned to Mike Mitchell, who was the safety manager for Defendant URS. ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 29, 54-1 \u00b6 29, 54-2 \u00b6 17. Newman later admitted he was upset that Plaintiffs had gone directly to jobsite safety representatives rather than going through him. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 24. Pia told Mitchell about his various safety concerns and conveyed his heightened concern for everyone on the jobsite due to the fact that he believed Newman was generally not concerned with safety. ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 29, 54-2 \u00b6 17. Defendant URS then held a meeting to discuss Pia's safety concerns. ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 29, 54-2 \u00b6 17. Present at the meeting were Plaintiffs; Mitchell; Mitch Wisenor, who was Assistant Director of Labor Relations for Defendant URS; Brad Peterson, who was a project supervisor for Defendant URS; and a union representative from Local 125. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 29. During the meeting, Pia felt Peterson was threatening his job for again bringing up safety issues. ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 33. Following the meeting, Pia was escorted off the jobsite and did not return to work because he was terminated the following Monday, March 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 2, 2015, Business Agents for Local 125, Pat Ellison and Bruce Beckman; project superintendents for Defendant URS Keith Williams and Chris Laney; and Assistant Director of Labor Relations Wisenor met with other employees, including Plaintiff Oppat, Jason Gorlewski, Kasey Minton, Scott Stewart, and Mike Pulley, to discuss safety concerns on the jobsite. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 30. Plaintiff Oppat denies any involvement in this meeting. ECF No. 54-1\n   \u00b6 30. That same day, Wisenor called Plaintiff Pia on the phone. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 31. Defendants assert Wisenor asked Pia to provide specific safety concerns that he wanted addressed in order for him to feel safe enough to return to work on the site, but Pia either could not or would not provide any detailed concerns for Defendant URS to address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs deny Defendants' claim and assert Pia was never unwilling to provide specific details of safety concerns for URS to remedy. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 31. Plaintiffs assert that in the phone call on March 2, Pia was not asked about specific safety concerns that he had, and instead his employment was terminated when he reiterated that he would return to work when his safety concerns had been addressed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants assert that because Pia was unable to articulate any specific safety concerns that URS could remedy to make Pia feel safe on the job, Wisenor decided to terminate Pia's employment on the grounds that he was unable to perform his duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF Nos. 48-2 \u00b6 32, 54-2 \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following his termination, Pia went to Local 125 to file a grievance regarding his termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33; ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 10. Defendants assert that, because Pia was unable to tell union Business Agent Ellison any specific safety concerns he had, Ellison informed Pia that Local 125 would not pursue a grievance. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 33. Plaintiff Pia asserts Ellison told him that Local 125 would not file a grievance because it was lucky to have a project of that size so close and it viewed him as a \"problem child.\" ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 33; 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also on March 2, Norm Miller, while looking through the trash, found all of the manuals and several tool bits used to make cuts with the Wachs machines; Oppat told Miller that he had thrown the manuals and tool bits away. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 34. Oppat asserts that while he did throw these items in the trash, the only tools he threw out were broken and no longer usable and the manuals were just promotional material. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 34. Oppat further asserts that, over the course of his career as a pipefitter, he has made the decision to throw out tooling used with \"WACHS machines on thousands of occasions,\" and no one has ever told him that he should not throw the tooling away or that he was not doing his job properly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 4, 2015, Wisenor met with Plaintiff Oppat to discuss the matter after an area supervisor told Wisenor that Oppat had thrown out new and used tools and manuals. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 \u00b6 35, 36. Wisenor also planned to meet with Miller to discuss his knowledge of the incident, but as Miller made his way into Wisenor's office, Oppat threatened Miller, calling Miller a \"piece of shit\" and telling Miller that he was going to fight him in the parking lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Defendants assert Wisenor terminated Oppat's employment because of his threat of violence toward Miller.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Oppat acknowledges he met with Wisenor on\n   March 4, but asserts he does not know the purpose of that meeting because his employment had been terminated prior to it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 36. Oppat also acknowledges he threatened Miller because he was angry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Oppat asserts he had been friends with Miller for a long time and had helped him get the job working on Oppat's crew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Oppat also asserts that, prior to March 4, he had been demoted from foreman of his crew and had learned during the meeting with Wisenor on March 4 that Miller would succeed Oppat as foreman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 18. Thus, Oppat felt angry and betrayed by Miller because he agreed to take Oppat's place as foreman. ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 18. Oppat admits he did not attempt to bring a grievance against Defendant URS because he believed doing so would be a waste of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39; ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants assert that other employees, including Gorlewski, Minton, and Pulley, also brought up safety concerns on the jobsite and were not fired as a result. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6\u00b6 41, 42. Plaintiffs acknowledge that although this is true, none of these other employees were involved in the decision to bring the safety concerns directly to Mitchell nor did they participate in the February 28, 2015 meeting during which Peterson threatened to discharge Pia. ECF No. 54-1 \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs Pia and Oppat filed separate Complaints with this Court on June 1 and 2, 2016, respectively, alleging state-law claims of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Case No. 3:16-cv-00045; ECF No. 1; Case No. 3:16-cv-00046, ECF No. 1. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim Defendants wrongfully discharged them from employment after they engaged in the protected activity of raising complaints of safety violations on the jobsite. On January 4, 2017, this Court denied Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 23. On June 15, 2017, the Court consolidated the cases for all purposes, including trial. ECF No. 39. On October 2, 2017, Defendants filed the present Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 48. Following oral argument, the Court stayed the proceedings in this case pending a decision by the Iowa Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ackerman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12556833\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/913/610/#p613\">\n    913 N.W.2d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (Iowa 2018). ECF No. 76. On June 27, 2018, the Court lifted the stay and allowed the parties' to file supplemental briefs in support of their positions on the present motion. ECF No. 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The term \"summary judgment\" is something of a misnomer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.

Plaintiffs' Employer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant AECOM contends it was not Plaintiffs' employer but rather simply the parent company of Plaintiffs' actual employer, Defendant URS; thus, the Court should grant summary judgment in its favor. \"There is a 'strong presumption that a parent company is not the employer of its subsidiary's employees, and the courts have found otherwise only in extraordinary circumstances.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Plaintiff Oppat testified in his deposition that he was an employee of URS and he did not know whether he had even brought suit against AECOM. Plaintiff Pia testified he worked for URS, not AECOM, and it was URS's name that appeared on his hardhat and all of his employment paperwork. Additionally, Defendants have presented evidence it was URS that issued employment-related documents to Plaintiffs and each management-level employee who Plaintiffs claim was involved in the decision to terminate their employment was an employee of URS and not AECOM. Based upon this record, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue for trial that AECOM \"so dominate[d] [URS]'s operations\" or \"control[led] 'individual employment decisions' \" such that a reasonable jury could find that AECOM was Plaintiffs' employer. Therefore, the Court concludes Defendant AECOM is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    B. LMRA Preemption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants claim that because the Court must interpret the NCA in order to determine whether Defendant URS wrongfully discharged Plaintiffs in retaliation for raising safety concerns on the jobsite, Plaintiffs' claims for wrongful termination in violation of public policy are preempted under the LMRA. Specifically, Defendants argue this Court must analyze the NCA's safety provision that required URS to provide a safe workplace for its employees to determine (1) what steps URS needed to take to ensure a safe workplace and whether it took those steps, (2) whether Plaintiffs raised valid safety complaints regarding issues that URS was responsible for under the NCA, and (3) whether URS violated the NCA by failing to address Plaintiffs' safety concerns. Defendants also point to Article 19 of the NCA, which provides a process through which Plaintiffs could have sought protection from URS's actions through union representation and the grievance procedure described therein. Additionally, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' claims are also barred by the six-month statute of limitations of LMRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In their response, Plaintiffs argue that their claims do not require interpretation of the NCA. Instead, they contend their claims require the Court to interpret state and federal safety regulations and the laws that have adopted these regulations rather than any provision of the NCA requiring URS to provide a safe workplace for its\n   employees; thus, their claims are not preempted by the LMRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Both parties' arguments are misguided. This Court does not need to interpret the safety provision of the NCA or the relevant federal and state workplace safety laws in order to analyze Plaintiffs' claims. Nor does this Court need to determine whether Plaintiffs' safety complaints were valid. Rather, in determining whether Plaintiffs' claims are preempted by the LMRA, this Court must determine whether Plaintiffs' claims for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are rooted in the NCA or whether there are state-law rights to assert a claim of retaliatory discharge that are independent of the NCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 301(a) of the LMRA provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20185\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The Supreme Court has held that federal law exclusively governs suits for breach of a CBA and 'that the pre-emptive force of [section] 301 extends beyond state-law contract actions.' \"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Instead, Defendants contend Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the third element-a causal connection between their complaints of safety violations and their termination from employment with URS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants argue the facts are undisputed that Plaintiffs' complaints of safety violations were not the determining factor in URS's decision to terminate their employment. First, Defendants contend that Newman, the person who allegedly threatened Plaintiffs' jobs after they raised safety concerns, did not have the authority to make employment decisions. Second, Defendants argue they had meetings with Plaintiffs and local union representatives were present to discuss the safety concerns raised by Plaintiffs and to try to resolve them, but even after these meetings Pia was unable to point to any specific safety concerns that URS could remedy in order for Pia to safely return to work. Defendants claim it was Pia's failure to articulate particular safety concerns and\n   his subsequent refusal to return to work until these unspecified concerns were addressed that was the determining factor in his termination, not simply because he raised safety complaints. Thus, Defendants claim they rightfully fired Pia for failing to perform his job duties pursuant to the Project Job Rules and Regulations. With regard to Plaintiff Oppat's termination, Defendants claim the determinative factor in Oppat's discharge from employment was the fact that he called a coworker a \"piece of shit\" and threatened to beat him up in the parking lot, a violation of the Project Job Rules and Regulations-not that Oppat complained about safety violations on the jobsite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs assert Defendants' reasons for their termination are pretextual and there are genuine issues of material fact to be decided by the factfinder at trial. Plaintiffs contend \"Defendants have a serious problem with regard to the timing of the termination of Pia and Oppat.\" ECF No. 54 at 19. Plaintiffs note it is undisputed that safety meetings occurred on February 28, 2015, and that Pia was terminated the first working day thereafter on March 2, and Oppat was demoted two working days after those meetings and then terminated on March 4, the day after his demotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   It is true that \"[t]he mere fact that an employee's termination follows his engaging in protected conduct is not sufficient to generate a jury question on causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Salah v.

It is undisputed that Plaintiffs repeatedly raised concerns about safety violations on the jobsite and in the parking lot where they were required to park. For purposes of summary judgment, the Court accepts as true, as it must, Plaintiff Pia's testimony and finds that Pia provided specific safety concerns that he wanted addressed in order for him to feel safe enough to return to work on the jobsite and Defendant URS fired him in retaliation as a result. Plaintiff further testified that during one of the meetings on February 28, Peterson threatened Pia's employment because he raised safety complaints and that after the meeting, Pia was escorted off of the jobsite. The Court must also accept as true Pia's testimony that following his termination, he went to the local union hall to file a grievance and union Business Agent Ellison-who had been present during the February 28 meeting with URS management-refused, telling Pia that the union would not file a grievance for him because they were lucky to even have the Project to work on and Pia was a \"problem child\" anyway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Likewise, although Plaintiff Oppat admits he angrily threatened violence toward Miller on March 4, 2015, his assertion that he was discharged from his employment before he went to the meeting with Wisenor on March 4 to discuss the manuals and tools he had thrown out must be taken as true. Additionally, although Defendants offer evidence that other employees also complained of safety violations and were not terminated as a result, Plaintiffs point out that these other employees were not involved in the decision to go over Newman's head and directly go to Mitchell with their complaints; thus, they are not similarly situated to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is not this Court's role to determine the credibility of the witnesses in this case, but rather, that is the role of the factfinder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Plains Real Estate Dev., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5762445\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/939/#p944\">\n    536 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   944 ;\n   <em>\n    Waldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511603\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/24/918/#p920\">\n    24 F.3d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that any back pay Plaintiffs might receive in pursuit of their claims is limited as a matter of law. Specifically, Defendants contend any awards for back pay should be limited because even if Plaintiffs had not been discharged in early March 2015, their employment with Defendant URS would have ended shortly thereafter anyway. Defendants also contend any back pay Plaintiff Pia may be entitled to must be limited because he cannot recover back pay for the time period he was disabled following his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   1. Defendant URS's Subcontract Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On April 17, 2015, Defendant URS's subcontract, under which it provided services to the Project, was terminated, and URS laid off approximately 1200 to 1300 union employees, including the pipefitters in the Wachs tooling group who had the same experience and positions as Plaintiffs. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 27. When a new subcontractor began work on the Project shortly thereafter, several former pipefitters for URS with whom Plaintiffs had worked were hired by the new subcontractor to work on the Project. ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 25. Hiring for the new subcontractor was accomplished, at least in part, through referrals from the local union hall. ECF No. 54-3 at 108. Thus, Defendants argue, even if they are found liable for wrongfully discharging Plaintiffs, their liability it limited to the period between their respective discharge dates and when URS's subcontract on the Project was terminated because URS cannot be held liable for any failure by Local 125 to refer Plaintiffs to work on the Project for a new subcontractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that, following their terminations, they were contacted by representatives of the new subcontractor and were asked to return to work on the Project, but were later told that they would not be returning to the jobsite because they had been blackballed by Local 125. ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 40; 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21. Pia testified at his deposition that, when he spoke to the representative of the new subcontractor, Pia informed him that Pia \"had previously been terminated over a safety issue\" and the representative \"assured [Pia] that that was not a problem, that we could still move forward.\" ECF No. 54-3 at 23. Pia further testified he called the new subcontractor back before he booked his travel to Iowa to confirm that the local union hall would not have a problem with him returning to work on the Project and Pia was told there was no problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Pia testified that it was not until he was supposed to return to Iowa to restart work on the Project that the new subcontractor called the local union hall, who told the new subcontractor \"they would no longer employ [Pia], that [he] would no longer work out of Local 125 ever.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. However, Pia testified it was simply his belief that the local union hall did not want him back on the job because of URS-not that anyone told him that.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Plaintiff Oppat also testified that he was told he was blackballed by the local union hall and would never work out of their local hall again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150. Plaintiffs contend that URS's termination of\n   their employment tainted the local union hall's view of them and caused it to blackball them, otherwise they would have been hired by the new subcontractor given their special skills and experiences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54-2 \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Several courts have held that back pay may be limited to the period between when the plaintiff suffered the adverse employment action and the date \"when he or she would not have been on the job in any event, for a reason unrelated to the illegal conduct of the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Mennen v.

Plaintiffs claim they \"will offer evidence that the conduct of URS in terminating Pia and Oppat did influence the willingness of the local union to approve their return to the Iowa Fertilizer plant project.\" ECF No. 54 at 16.

Similarly, it is not enough that Pia merely believed URS had something to do with the local union hall not wanting him to come back to work on the Project. The only evidence in the record that Plaintiffs point to for support that URS possibly had a hand in Plaintiffs not being hired by the new subcontractor is that union Business Agent Ellison participated in meetings with URS management prior to URS's decision to terminate Pia's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 14.

Thus, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue and, as a matter of law, Defendant URS cannot be held liable for the period following the termination of its subcontract on the Project on April 17, 2015. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   2. Plaintiff Pia's Back Injury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants claim any back pay to which Plaintiff Pia may be entitled should also be limited due to his disability status as a result of an injury following his termination. On April 15, 2015, Pia injured his back in a non-work-related accident and did not return to work until April 2016. ECF No. 48-2 \u00b6 43. During the time he was unable to work due to his back injury, Pia collected $57,408 in disability benefits that he received through the State of California from contributions he had made into\n   the fund while working on projects in California through his local union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 44, 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pia asserts he was injured carrying boxes down the stairs during his relocation from Iowa to California following his alleged wrongful termination, and that, had his employment not been terminated, he would not have relocated and consequently injured his back. ECF Nos. 54-1 \u00b6 43; 54-2 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34. Plaintiffs argue a jury could reasonably find that but for his wrongful termination, Pia would never have been injured. Although Pia concedes that the disability benefits he received during the time he was unable to work should be offset from any back-pay award he receives, he nevertheless contends that the amount he received in disability benefits was far less than what he would have received for his work on the Project. ECF No. 54 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The remedy in a retaliatory discharge action is intended to make a plaintiff whole and compensate him for any losses he suffered as a result of his employer's wrongful conduct. Courts have held, however, that it \"does not extend to granting back pay for a period when a plaintiff would have been unable, due to an intervening disability, to continue employment.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Thornley v.

The Court concludes a jury could not reasonably infer that Defendant URS's alleged wrongful termination of Plaintiff Pia caused his injury and therefore URS would still be liable for back pay during the period of time he was not working due to his disability. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   IV.
