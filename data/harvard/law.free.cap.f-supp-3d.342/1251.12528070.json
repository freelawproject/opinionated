The Commission simultaneously promulgated Amendment 788, making Amendment 782 retroactive. This court established a Retroactivity Screening Panel to determine whether defendants such as Davenport might be eligible for a sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Davenport's case was submitted for review, but the Panel was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation due to a disagreement over the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2012, the court sentenced Davenport on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The sentence was entered pursuant to a binding Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement (\"Type-C agreement\"), which permits the parties to \"agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case\" and \"binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\" At the time of sentencing, after adjustments for minor role and acceptance of responsibility, Davenport's initial Guidelines range was 87 to 108 months, based on an offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of III. However, a mandatory-minimum sentence of 120 months applied. The plea agreement recommended a sentence of 63 months. The court granted the government's motion for a three-level downward departure for substantial assistance, which both reduced Davenport's total offense level to 24 and authorized the court to give a sentence below the mandatory minimum. The adjusted Guidelines range, starting from the original range of 87 to 108 months, was 63 to 78 months. Davenport was sentenced to 63 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite having been sentenced pursuant to a binding plea agreement, Davenport is eligible for a sentence reduction now only if he was sentenced \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Recently, in\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court concluded that defendants sentenced pursuant to a Type-C agreement are nonetheless eligible for a sentence reduction \"so long as that range was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.\" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612221\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1765/#p1775\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1775,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612221\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1765/#p1775\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That is not Davenport's only hurdle to receiving a sentence reduction. When he was originally sentenced, he was subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence of 120 months, which was entirely above his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range. He was sentenced below the mandatory minimum solely because the court granted the government's motion for a downward departure of three levels on the basis of substantial assistance, pursuant to United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (Nov. 2016) (USSG) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). In 2014, the Commission, weighing in on a circuit split, promulgated Amendment 780, which states that the defendant's Guidelines range should be calculated without regard to the mandatory minimum when the court departed below the minimum based on a substantial-assistance motion. On its face, the amendment, if applied, makes defendants in Davenport's shoes eligible for retroactive sentencing relief, because, in general, it asks courts on resentencing to look solely to the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, not the mandatory minimum, when determining statutory eligibility for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Koons v. United States\n   </em>\n   , released the same day as\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that where five defendants were subject to mandatory-minimum sentences that exceeded their otherwise-applicable Guidelines ranges, and where the district court \"scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and never considered the ranges again,\" the sentences were not \"based on\" the otherwise-applicable Guidelines ranges. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612235\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1783/#p1789\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1789,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612235\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1783/#p1789\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). However,\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   specifically declined to reach the issue of whether a defendant subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence \"can never be sentenced 'based on a sentencing range' that the Commission has lowered,\" because, as the opinion repeatedly emphasized, in none of the five consolidated cases before it \"did the [district] court consider the original drug Guidelines ranges that it had earlier discarded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612235\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1783/#p1789\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612235\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1783/#p1789\">\n    at 1787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1788 n.1 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As discussed later, however, the district court in Davenport's case did not simply discard the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range. Accordingly, this case poses the next logical question that the Supreme Court avoided in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   : whether a defendant subject to a mandatory minimum that exceeds his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range was sentenced \"based on\" that range for the purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), where that range was in fact \"part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties were ordered to brief the two issues necessary to rule on Davenport's eligibility for retroactive sentencing relief, albeit prior to the Supreme Court's rulings in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   : (1) whether Davenport is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), although he was sentenced pursuant to a binding plea agreement; and (2) whether he is eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 780, although he was originally subject to a\n   mandatory minimum that exceeded his Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The court concludes that Davenport is eligible for a sentence reduction. Davenport's original sentence was \"based on\" a subsequently lowered sentencing range,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), despite the existence of a Type-C plea agreement, because the court's acceptance of that agreement was based on its determination that the recommended sentence was compatible with the Guidelines, as explained in more detail later. Further, the court finds that the mandatory minimum does not impede his eligibility for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). After careful consideration of the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , and related cases; the law in this circuit; the recent decisions in other circuits; and the record of sentencing in this case, this court concludes that the Sentencing Commission did not exceed its authority in promulgating Amendment 780 with regard to cases such as Davenport's, and that he is eligible for a reduction because he was in fact sentenced \"based on\" his applicable Guidelines range rather than the mandatory minimum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, the court finds that a sentence reduction is warranted in Davenport's case. Accordingly, the sentence of imprisonment of 63 months previously imposed on him (as reflected in the last judgment issued) is reduced to 51 months, or, in the event that he has served longer than he would have served on a 51-month sentence factoring in good-time credit and any other factors relevant to the Bureau of Prisons' calculation, to a sentence of time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. TYPE-C AGREEMENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court first discusses Davenport's eligibility for a sentence reduction in light of the court's adoption of a binding plea agreement. Federal courts are forbidden to \"modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), subject to a few narrow exceptions. The relevant exception here permits defendants whose Guidelines sentencing range has been lowered by a retroactive amendment, such as Amendment 782, to move for a sentence reduction.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [ 18 U.S.C.] section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At sentencing, the court accepted the parties' plea agreement pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C), which permits the parties to \"agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, ... [a request which] binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). Because binding plea agreements allow the parties themselves to set the sentence (subject to the court's approval), the question is raised whether a defendant sentenced pursuant to such an agreement may be said to have been sentenced \"based on\" a Guidelines sentencing range such that he is eligible for retroactive relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Supreme Court first answered that question in\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Indeed, the Court observed, the intervening decisions between\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   \"confirm that the Guidelines remain a basis for almost all federal sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Applying this framework, the Court noted that the district court there accepted the Type-C agreement after concluding that the recommended sentence was consistent with the Guidelines and then calculated Hughes's sentencing range and imposed a sentence that it deemed \"compatible\" with the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1778.

Specifically, the parties initially represented that the recommended sentence of 63 months, in light of Davenport's criminal history category of III, constituted a downward departure of four offense levels after factoring in acceptance of responsibility and a minor role adjustment. The court then brought the parties back in chambers and heard extensive argument as to whether that level of departure was appropriate based on Davenport's cooperation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Tr. at ___ (pin cite unavailable because transcript in draft form). After a pause for deliberation, the court announced that it would grant a reduction of four offense levels--the\n   amount that all parties believed at that time was necessary to square the plea agreement with Davenport's Guidelines range--and explained its reasons for doing so in terms of his cooperation. It then stated it would accept the plea agreement, resumed the proceedings in open court, and then asked the U.S. Probation Office to calculate Davenport's Guidelines range after the downward departure, which Probation stated was 63-78 months. Finally, the court imposed the recommended sentence of 63 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To be sure, as discussed in more detail later, the court later indicated in open court, and the final judgment reflected, a downward departure of three, not four, offense levels was correct. In any case, however, the court's efforts to ensure that a departure required by the plea agreement would be consistent with the Guidelines makes abundantly clear that its exercise of discretion in accepting the agreement was framed by the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450497,5925227\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/522/\">\n    564 U.S. at 525, 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450497,5925227\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/522/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In other words, the court verified at length that Davenport's recommended sentence was justified in reference to the Guidelines, calculated the Guidelines sentencing range, and imposed the recommended sentence that fell at the bottom of the Guidelines range.

MANDATORY MINIMUM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The conclusion on the plea agreement issue does not end the court's inquiry into Davenport's statutory eligibility for retroactive sentencing relief. Davenport was originally subject to a 120-month mandatory-minimum sentence, which exceeded his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range of 87 to 108 months. However, the court was authorized to sentence Davenport below the mandatory minimum because the government moved for a downward departure to reward Davenport for his substantial assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Motion for Downward Departure (doc. no. 304);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (\"Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence\n   so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, as stated, the Sentencing Commission, in 2014 and weighing in on a circuit split, promulgated Amendment 780, which states that the defendant's Guidelines range should be calculated without regard to the mandatory minimum when the court departed below the minimum based on a substantial-assistance motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , in cases like this one--where the defendant was originally subject to a mandatory minimum that exceeded his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range but became eligible for a sentence below the minimum on account of a government motion for substantial assistance--lower courts had grappled with at least two issues. First, to be eligible for a sentencing reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), even though the defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum, he must have been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

That is, the Court declined to reach whether a defendant subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence \"can never be sentenced 'based on a sentencing range' that the Commission has lowered,\" because, as it repeatedly emphasized, in none of the five consolidated cases before it \"did the [district] court consider the original drug Guidelines ranges that it had earlier discarded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1787, 1788 n.1 (quoting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ). In other words, it declined to hold that, by operation of law, the otherwise-applicable Guidelines\n   range is \"trumped\" by the mandatory minimum, such that a defendant's sentence cannot then be \"based on\" the former. Rather, as in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , the Court looked to what the district court\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   considered in deciding on the ultimate sentence and found that in the cases before it the Guidelines range had been fully \"discarded\": \"[Petitioners'] sentences were not 'based on' the lowered Guidelines ranges because the District Court did not consider those ranges in imposing its ultimate sentences. On the contrary, the court scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and never considered the ranges again; as the court explained, the ranges dropped out of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1788.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   An analysis of the sentencing transcripts in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   further elucidates the nature of the district court's actions described by the Court. There, after calculating each defendant's otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, the court explained that the ranges were trumped by the mandatory minimum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , App. at 148 (\"[T]he advisory guideline range would be 168 to 210 months. However, there's a mandatory minimum [of 240 months]. So we start at a sentence of 240 months.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 197 (\"The advisory guideline range of 70 to 87 months is trumped by the mandatory minimum.... I'm going to start at the mandatory minimum of 120 months.\"). It then framed the sentencing discussion in terms of the appropriate percentage of downward departure from the mandatory minimum, based on the substantial assistance factors, and without reference to the discarded ranges. Indeed, the parties argued in terms of such percentages and not in terms of \"offense levels\" or Guidelines ranges. Ultimately, the court imposed sentences of 25 % to 45 % below the mandatory minimums.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 116 (\"I'm going to grant a 25 percent reduction and reduce the sentence from 240 months down to 180 months.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 153 (\"I'm going to impose a sentence of 132 months which is a 45 percent reduction.\"). In other words, as the Supreme Court stated, \"the [district] court scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and never considered the ranges again.\"\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1788. Indeed, there was a \"clear demonstration, based on the record as a whole, that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1776.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Here, as already discussed in relation to the Type-C agreement, Davenport's otherwise-applicable sentencing range did not wholly \"drop out\" of consideration but, in fact, played a relevant part in the court's acceptance of the plea agreement and imposition of a sentence. To use the construction analogy in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , it is as if a builder began by considering one design (the initial Guidelines range), and was given a different design (the mandatory minimum and substantial assistance factors), but rather than fully discarding the first design, the builder still ended up using it to lay the foundation. To determine whether a defendant in such circumstances is eligible for sentencing relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court must wade into the above fray, and reach the issue that the Supreme Court reserved in\n   <em>\n    Koons.\n   </em>\n   The court concludes that a defendant whose otherwise-applicable Guideline range is exceeded by a mandatory-minimum sentence, and who receives a downward departure based on substantial assistance, is eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range was \"part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting [an] agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1775. Moreover, the court concludes that Amendment 780 does not exceed the authority of the Sentencing Commission as applied to such a defendant. Because Davenport was indeed sentenced based on his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, he is eligible for sentencing relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Whether the Mandatory Minimum Precludes a Sentence \"Based On\" the Otherwise-Applicable Guidelines Range\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The first issue is whether, by operation of law, Davenport's mandatory minimum \"trumped\" or replaced his otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, such that his sentence could not have been \"based on\" that range regardless of what the district court in fact considered in imposing the sentence. Interrelated with this issue is whether district courts must, when confronted with a defendant whose initial Guidelines range is below an applicable mandatory minimum, depart downward\n   <em>\n    starting from\n   </em>\n   the mandatory minimum rather than the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range.

First, according to the waiver theory discussed earlier, the government's \u00a7 3553(e) motion \"waives\" the application of a mandatory minimum.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A. Although any downward departure must then be based on the defendant's cooperation and the substantial-assistance factors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Amendment 780 concerns only those defendants who have received downward departures based on a \u00a7 3553(e) substantial-assistance motion. The amendment does not \"supplant a statutory mandatory minimum,\"\n   <em>\n    Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270731\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/225/1314/#p1325\">\n    225 F.Supp.3d at 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the simple reason that, due to the government's \u00a7 3553(e) motion, the mandatory minimum is no longer in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, even if the waiver theory is incorrect--meaning that the district court erred at the original sentencing by disregarding the mandatory minimum to depart downward starting from the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range--Amendment 780 does not contradict statutory mandatory minimums, because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings authorize an adjustment, albeit \"only a limited [one] to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    560 U.S. at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A. So long as a defendant was sentenced \"based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\" \u00a7 3582(c)(2) empowers courts to reduce the sentence \"after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). This section does not authorize courts to modify sentences only if they were lawful as originally imposed, or to impose amended sentences only if they would have been lawful if initially imposed. If that were true, then the application of this section would be limited by a kind of general collateral review. The limited statutory grant of power in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) --which asks only that courts resentence defendants as if the amended Guidelines were in place, and with consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to the extent applicable--supersedes and removes any potential conflict between Amendment 780 and congressionally mandated minimum sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , the Court confronted whether \u00a7 3582(c)(2), not the mandatory minimums, was a statutory barrier to the amendment. The Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"[T]he Commission's policy statement cannot alter \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which applies only when a sentence was 'based on' a subsequently lowered range.

In short, because petitioners do not satisfy \u00a7 3582(c)(2)'s threshold 'based on' requirement, the Commission had no power to enable their sentence reductions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   138 S.Ct. at 1790.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, however, the fact that a defendant was actually sentenced \"based on\" the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range once more makes all the difference. As discussed earlier, when a defendant was sentenced based on that range, \u00a7 3582(c)(2)'s initial \"based on\" requirement poses no problem to the application of Amendment 780. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   suggests that the Commission did not have the authority to promulgate Amendment 780, assuming it would be properly applied to sentences \"based on\" a subsequently lowered range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 1790. The fact that the statute restricted the amendment's range of application did not mean that the statute rendered the amendment invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition, Amendment 780 is also consistent with Congress's goal of promoting defendants' cooperation with the government by \"ensur[ing] that defendants who provide substantial assistance to the government\n   in the investigation and prosecution of others have the opportunity to receive the full benefit of a reduction that accounts for that assistance.\" USSG App. C, Amdt. 780 (Supp. Nov. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit has observed, a contrary result would create a sentencing disparity that favors cooperating defendants with Guidelines ranges above their statutory minimums due to such factors as extensive criminal histories or severe offense conduct. Those defendants would be eligible for sentence reductions while those with Guidelines ranges entirely below their minimums would be ineligible for a reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4367207\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/253/\">\n    808 F.3d at 261-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a disparity is inconsistent with Congress's purpose of punishing defendants with higher Guidelines ranges more severely than those with lower ranges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   C. Other Considerations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The case law of this circuit suggests one additional way in which Amendment 780 might exceed the Sentencing Commission's authority by contradicting a statute. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Aponte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529547\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1050/\">\n    36 F.3d 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1994) (per curiam), the court held that a \u00a7 3553(e) downward departure must be based on a defendant's substantial assistance and not on any other mitigating factors. One might contend that a downward departure in a \u00a7 3582(c) sentence reduction is based on the Commission's lowering of the applicable Guidelines range and not based on a defendant's substantial assistance. Yet because the court's authority and impetus for the downward departure remains the defendant's substantial assistance, so as to give the defendant \"the same sentence he would have received if the guidelines that applied at the time of his sentencing had been the same as the guidelines that applied after the amendment,\"\n   <em>\n    Glover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051193\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1203/#p1208\">\n    686 F.3d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the reduced sentence is necessarily based on the defendant's assistance to the government, adjusted to reflect a change in the Guidelines. Indeed, as the Sentencing Commission explained, the purpose of granting such a reduction is to \"ensure[ ] that defendants who provide substantial assistance to the government in the investigation and prosecution of others have the opportunity to receive the full benefit of a reduction that accounts for that assistance.\" USSG App. C, Amdt. 780 (Supp. Nov. 2014). The defendant's reduced sentence is not based on any other mitigating factor or characteristic of the defendant, such as the factors enumerated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), about which the court in\n   <em>\n    Aponte\n   </em>\n   was concerned.\n   <em>\n    Aponte\n   </em>\n   therefore poses no problem for Amendment 780.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, the court notes that the above holding, unlike the Fourth Circuit's position of categorical eligibility that was rejected by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , creates no undue \"windfall\" for defendants seeking a sentence reduction. In cases such as\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , where the district court did not in fact consider the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, sentencing a defendant \"as if the retroactively changed guideline was in place at the time of the defendant's original sentencing,\"\n   <em>\n    Tolliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143317\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/659/560/\">\n    659 F. App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   563 n.2, requires imposing\n   <em>\n    the same sentence.\n   </em>\n   That is, if the court truly disregarded the Guidelines range and considered only the mandatory minimum and substantial assistance factors--for instance, if the court decided to give the defendant a 25 % reduction from the mandatory minimum--then a difference in the Guidelines range would have made no difference in the ultimate sentence. Granting a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under such circumstances, as several courts strenuously resisted even prior to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , would therefore in some sense grant a gratuitous \"windfall\" to the defendant. However, where a defendant's sentence was in fact based on the otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, then a difference\n   in the Guidelines range would have made a difference, and there is no windfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   D. Davenport Was Sentenced Based On His Otherwise-Applicable Guidelines Range\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Having concluded that defendants who were subject to a mandatory minimum that exceeded their otherwise-applicable Guidelines range may be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentencing relief if they were in fact sentenced based on that range, the court now turns to whether, under\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , Davenport was sentenced based on his Guidelines range--that is, whether \"[that] range was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the [plea] agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612221\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1765/#p1775\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the court has already concluded with regard to the plea agreement that Davenport was sentenced based on his Guidelines range, it now emphasizes that conclusion with regard to the mandatory minimum issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , as discussed above, the district court calculated each defendant's otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, but then fully discarded those ranges. It then framed the sentencing discussion in terms of the appropriate percentage of downward departure from the mandatory minimum--not in terms of \"offense levels\" or Guidelines ranges. Ultimately, the court imposed sentences of 25 % to 45 % below the mandatory minimums. In sum, \"the [district] court scrapped the ranges in favor of the mandatory minimums, and never considered the ranges again....\"\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1788.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   By contrast, as previously discussed, the bulk of Davenport's sentencing proceeding was spent discussing the appropriate amount of downward departure--\n   <em>\n    in terms of offense levels\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    starting from Davenport's otherwise-applicable Guidelines range\n   </em>\n   --in order to ensure that the recommended sentence of 63 months was consistent with the Guidelines; even government counsel at sentencing stated that the recommendation for a 63-month sentence was tied to the Guidelines. The court never spoke, much less exclusively spoke, of the downward departure in terms of a certain percentage from the mandatory minimum. Indeed, the only reference made to such a percentage was defense counsel's offhand remark that a sentence of 63 months was equivalent to about one-half of the 120-month mandatory minimum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although there was some confusion at sentencing as to whether a departure of three or four levels was necessary in order to reach the parties' recommended sentence of 63 months--apparently due to some miscounting of adjustments for minor role and acceptance of responsibility--the court in announcing the sentence, as well as in the final judgment, made clear that the court departed downward from Davenport's otherwise-applicable Guidelines range and not\n   from his mandatory minimum. That is, the court calculated his criminal history category as III and the offense level, after other adjustments, as 27; the resulting sentence range was 87-108 months, entirely below the 120-month mandatory minimum. It then granted a reduction of three offense levels, which resulted in an offense level of 24 and a Guidelines range of 63-78 months, to reflect substantial assistance. The court then imposed a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range, and in accordance with the plea agreement, of 63 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Davenport's sentencing therefore stands in stark contrast to\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , which the Court in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   recognized is a \"narrow exception to the general rule that, in most cases, a defendant's sentence will be 'based on' his Guidelines range.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1776. Here, the court departed down three offense levels from Davenport's otherwise-applicable Guidelines range based on his cooperation in order to arrive at a sentencing range that was consistent with the recommended sentence of 63 months. The otherwise-applicable Guidelines range, far from fully \"dropping out\" of the picture, was clearly \"part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1775.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1776 (a defendant's sentence is \"based on\" the since-amended Guidelines range \"absent clear demonstration, based on the record as a whole, that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Moreover, as stated, the record also reflects that the parties considered and applied the Guidelines in fashioning the 63-month recommendation. Government counsel at the sentencing hearing expressly stated that the recommendation was \"tied to the guidelines.\" Sentencing Tr. at ___ (pin cite unavailable because transcript in draft form). And again, as stated, looking at the 63-month sentence from different angles, the court concludes that it was a product of the Guidelines. The court would not have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1776 (a defendant's sentence is \"based on\" the since-amended Guidelines range \"absent clear demonstration, based on the record as a whole, that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Accordingly, the court concludes that, even though Davenport was originally subject to a mandatory minimum, he was nonetheless sentenced \"based on\" the Guidelines range applicable to his offense for the purpose of statutory eligibility under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   IV. CALCULATION OF AMENDED SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Davenport's original base offense level under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 was 32. According to the Statement of Reasons (doc. no. 315), after a two-level decrease for his role in the offense pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 and a three-level decrease for his acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, his total offense level was 27. Davenport's criminal history category was III. The applicable Guidelines range was 87 to 108 months; however, because a mandatory minimum of 120 months applied, his Guidelines range was 120 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). The court granted the government's motion for a three-level downward departure for substantial assistance pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e), which both reduced Davenport's total offense level to 24 and authorized the court to give a sentence below the mandatory minimum. The adjusted Guidelines range, starting from the original range of 87 to 108 months, was 63 to 78 months. Davenport was sentenced to 63 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Under Amendment 782, Davenport's amended base offense level is 30. After the adjustments for role and acceptance of responsibility are applied, his amended total offense level is 25. Because Davenport originally received a three-level downward departure for substantial assistance, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) authorizes the court to reduce Davenport's sentence to one \"comparably less\" than the amended Guidelines range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   After this departure, the resulting offense level is 22. Davenport's criminal history category is III, so the final amended Guidelines range is 51 to 63 months. Originally, Davenport received a sentence at the bottom of the range; hence, his amended sentence on the drug-trafficking charge should be 51 months. However, in the event that he has served longer than he would have served on a 51-month sentence, factoring in good-time credit and any other factors relevant to the Bureau of Prisons' calculation, then his sentence should be time served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG 1B1.10(b)(2)(C) (\"In no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   V. PUBLIC SAFETY AND POST-SENTENCING CONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In considering whether and by how much to reduce an eligible defendant's sentence, the court must consider any concerns regarding public safety or post-sentencing conduct, as well as the factors enumerated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The government and the U.S. Probation Office agree with Davenport that no concerns regarding public safety or Davenport's post-sentencing conduct exist in this case.

The original guideline range at the time of sentencing (as calculated on the Sentencing Table) was 108 to 135 months, which was restricted by operation of \u00a7 5G1.1 to a range of 120 to 135 months.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). The court imposed a sentence of 90 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant's substantial assistance to authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 87 to 108 months. Ordinarily, \u00a7 5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to precisely 120 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(b). For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended guideline range is considered to be 87 to 108 months (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , unrestricted by operation of \u00a7 5G1.1 and the statutory minimum of 120 months).\" USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) cmt. n. 4(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Indeed, Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in\n    <em>\n     Freeman\n    </em>\n    , which was later overruled in\n    <em>\n     Hughes\n    </em>\n    , also interpreted \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in terms of the actual, historical reasons for a given sentence, except that it would have instructed courts to scrutinize the plea agreement for the parties' reasons in arriving at that sentence rather than the sentencing judge's reasons in accepting the agreement and imposing the sentence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Freeman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450497,5925227\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/522/\">\n     564 U.S. at 534-39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450497,5925227\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/522/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2685\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Sotomayor, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Similarly, in the case in which the Tenth Circuit concluded that defendants subject to a mandatory minimum that exceeded their otherwise-applicable Guidelines range could never be eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentencing relief, the court noted: \"the district court never relied on Defendants'\n    <em>\n     applicable\n    </em>\n    guideline ranges in determining the amount of departure from their 20-year mandatory minimum sentences.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
