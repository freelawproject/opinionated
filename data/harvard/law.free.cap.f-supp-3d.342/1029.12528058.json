For their part, Fergerstrom and the Kaiamas move for certification of the proposed class, and three subclasses, of consumers who were subjected to notices of foreclosure sale under HRS \u00a7 667-5, prepared by the law firms of Routh Crabtree Olsen, P.S. or RCO Hawai'i LLC (together, \"RCO\") on behalf of PNC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because Plaintiffs were required to assert their claims alleging defects in their particular foreclosure proceedings, and seeking to void the foreclosure sales, prior to the entry of new Transfer Certificates of Title by the Land Court, and did not do so, both Fergerstrom's and the Kaiamas' individual claims are barred. As a matter of Hawai'i law, the Land Court's entry of Certificates of Title is conclusive and unimpeachable evidence of the subsequent owners' title to the properties, and Plaintiffs' claims, which seek to impeach the foreclosure proceedings, and demand damages to compensate for the loss of title and possession, are statutorily precluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aames Funding Corp. v.

Ex. C (Kaiama Mortgage). PNC business records reflect that the Kaiama loan became delinquent in June 2009 and was never brought current. Thomas Decl. \u00b6 10; Ex. E, Dkt. No. 101-7. PNC commenced foreclosure proceedings pursuant to the power of sale provision contained in the mortgage, and on October 27, 2009, PNC published a Notice of Sale. Ex. N (Aff. of Foreclosure), Dkt.

Plaintiffs' claims against PNC are predicated on certain defects contained in the Notice of Sale, and on PNC's alleged failure to properly publish the Notice of Sale. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 30-33, 39-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The FAC asserts claims on behalf of Plaintiffs and all others similarly situated under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. Plaintiffs allege that PNC \"breached its duties to act in good faith to sell the properties to the owners' best advantage and to use reasonable diligence to secure the best possible price, because [it] adopted foreclosure policies and practices designed and intended to deter public participation and 'chill' bid prices at non-judicial auctions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Count I asserts a wrongful foreclosure claim based upon PNC's practice of advertising\n   that the property would be sold only by quitclaim deed, FAC \u00b6 45, but conveying the property in certain instances to third-party bidders by limited warranty deed, FAC \u00b6 46, contrary to a foreclosing mortgagee's duties under the power of sale and HRS \u00a7\u00a7 667-5 and 667-7. FAC \u00b6 48. Plaintiffs also allege that PNC violated publication notice and postponement requirements contained in the power of sale clauses in the mortgages and statutes. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 51-64. Plaintiffs assert that the foreclosure sales of the Fergerstrom Property, Kaiama Property, and \"the sales of all properties of the Class members were void, or at the very least voidable\" under the common law and by statute, and that \"Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to appropriate damages remedies as a result, including restitution and/or rescissory damages designed to restore the equivalent of the Properties to Plaintiffs and the Class.\" FAC \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Count II alleges both unfair and deceptive trade practices (\"UDAP\") and unfair methods of competition (\"UMOC\") claims under HRS \u00a7 480-2. Plaintiffs contend that PNC's conduct violated HRS \u00a7 480-2 in the following manner-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) it violated a clear and established public policies [sic]: (1) against \"chilling the bidding\", (2) in favor of the \"widest publicity,\" (3) that the provisions of H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 667-5\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and the terms and conditions of mortgage contracts were to be strictly followed by foreclosing mortgagees and that said mortgagees sell the property pledged in a manner calculated to give the best advantage to the owner of the property and use reasonable efforts to secure the \"best possible price\"; (2) [sic] it was immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, and/or (3) it was substantially injurious to consumers, and constituted representations, omissions, or practices that were objectively material and misleading to the detriment of consumers such as Plaintiff, and to other consumers, who were discouraged from bidding at public auctions based on the purported terms of sale therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   FAC \u00b6 82. PNC also allegedly violated HRS \u00a7 480-2\"by advertising ... the Properties for sale without covenants or warranties as to title or encumbrances,\" because such \"terms of sale were false, deceptive, and misleading, inasmuch as successful third party bidders almost always received limited warranty deeds, and not quitclaims as advertised in the Class's notices of sale.\" FAC \u00b6 83. Further, Plaintiffs allege injury based upon \"unfair and deceptive terms of sale,\" including advertising in the Notices of Sale that the successful\n   bidders must close their sales within 30 days of the auctions, FAC \u00b6 84, retaining the 10% down payment as liquidated damages for any delay in the purchaser's closing, FAC \u00b6 85, and that if the foreclosing mortgagee should fail to convey title to a successful bidder for any reason \"other than Purchaser's own failure to perform,\" the bidder would have \"no further recourse\" against the foreclosing mortgagee or its agents other than a return of its bid. FAC \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs seek treble damages under HRS \u00a7 480-13, FAC \u00b6 84, because PNC \"violated a clear and established public policy that the provisions of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 667-5\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and the terms and conditions of mortgage contracts were to be strictly followed by foreclosing mortgagees and that said mortgagees sell the property pledged in a manner calculated to give the best advantage to the owner of the property and use reasonable efforts to secure the 'best possible price.' \" FAC \u00b6 95. In addition to damages, Count II also seeks redress for \"all such sales and sales contracts [that] are void under H.R.S. Section 480-12 [,]\" FAC \u00b6 96, and \"to receive all proceeds and profits that PNC made or received by virtue of its conduct, and to [sic] a declaration that each such sale was void.\" FAC \u00b6 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Pending Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 1, 2018, PNC filed a Motion to Dismiss, Dkt.

On summary judgment, PNC presents the TCTs entered following the Fergerstrom and Kaiama foreclosure sales as conclusive and unimpeachable evidence of title to the Land Court registered properties. Fergerstrom TCT No. 981,816 was entered on May 13, 2010, vesting title in Fannie Mae, Ex. K, and when the Fergerstrom Property was sold to the current owners, the new TCT No. 1,005,710 was entered on December 3, 2010. Ex. M.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 15, 2010, the Land Court entered TCT No. 978,781 affecting the Kaiama Property. Ex. P.

Because Plaintiffs filed their respective claims after the entry of new certificates of title, and because no exception applies, their claims are barred by HRS \u00a7 501-118, as applied by\n   <em>\n    Aames.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under applicable case law, Plaintiffs' claims, which seek to void their respective foreclosures and restore title and possession or, alternatively, to plead around\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   by requesting equitable damages\n   equivalent to restoring title, are precluded because they seek to impeach the foreclosure proceedings. The titles issued pursuant to the foreclosure auctions, and thereafter to the subsequent purchasers, are \"conclusive and unimpeachable\" in light of the entry of the new TCTs. Based upon the entire summary judgment record, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   rule-as interpreted by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Tilley\n   </em>\n   , which applied HRS \u00a7 501-118 to wrongful foreclosure claims seeking the return of possession, and in\n   <em>\n    Seegers\n   </em>\n   , which expressly covered claims for monetary damages-bars Plaintiffs' wrongful foreclosure and HRS \u00a7 480-2 claims. Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, Plaintiffs challenge the sufficiency of the TCTs in light of the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Omiya.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Omiya\n   </em>\n   , there is no question in the present matter that the new certificates of title, in the requisite form, were issued, entered, and certified by the Assistant Registrar. The TCTs, accordingly, are conclusive and unimpeachable evidence of title now held by the subsequent purchasers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omiya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=142%20Haw.%20439\">\n    142 Hawai'i at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   451 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568033\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/420/370/#p377\">\n    420 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   382 n.23 (\"The transfer is not made unimpeachable under HRS \u00a7 501-118, however, until a new certificate of title is issued.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that\n   <em>\n    Aames\n   </em>\n   cannot serve as a bar to their tort claims in light of HRS \u00a7 501-212, which provides, in part, that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to deprive the plaintiff of any tort claim which the plaintiff may have against any person for loss or damage, or deprivation of land, or of any estate or interest therein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument fails for at least two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, the quoted portion of HRS \u00a7 501-212, on its face, does not touch HRS \u00a7 501-118, which provides that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in interest from directly impeaching by action or otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, prior to the entry of a new certificate of title.\" Whereas the former provision preserves pre-existing tort claims, the latter provision does not deprive a plaintiff of any tort claim-it simply reinforces the conclusive and impeachable nature of Land Court certificates of title after entry. Second, the statute cited by Plaintiffs creates a cause of action relating to the registering of title in Land Court and is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   triggered by Plaintiffs' earlier foreclosure: \" HRS \u00a7 501-212 provides a statutory remedy to any person who, without negligence on the person's part, sustains loss as a result of the registration of any other person as owner of such land through fraud, 'or in consequence of any error, omission, mistake, or misdescription in any certificate of title ... in the registration book.'
