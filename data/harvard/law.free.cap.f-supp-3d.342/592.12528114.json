Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff Woods Services, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") has moved, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), to dismiss counterclaims filed by Defendant Disability Advocates, Inc. d/b/a Disability Rights New York (\"Defendant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons described below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As discussed in a prior opinion of this Court (ECF 26), Plaintiff's complaint (ECF 1, \"Compl.\"), filed on January 24, 2018, alleges that Defendant issued a public report (the \"DRNY Report\") regarding purported abuse and neglect of New York residents in the care of Plaintiff, a provider of residential, educational, and clinical services to children and adults with developmental disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). According to Plaintiff's complaint, all investigations and inquiries have generally found no basis for the DRNY Report's allegations of abuse and neglect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). Plaintiff's complaint brings causes of action for defamation, commercial disparagement, intentional interference with contractual relationships, and intentional interference with prospective contractual relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 15, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint (ECF 8), which this Court denied on May 9, 2018. (ECF 26). In the Court's opinion, the Court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) The Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Pennsylvania law applies to Plaintiff's claim for defamation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (3) Whether Plaintiff is a public figure is a question of fact inappropriate for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4) The complaint satisfies Plaintiff's obligations to plead actual malice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 4, 2018, Defendant timely answered Plaintiff's complaint and brought counterclaims. (ECF 32). On June 25, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant's counterclaims. (ECF 40). On July 16, 2018, Defendant amended its counterclaims as a matter of course, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). (ECF 42, \"AC\" or \"Amended Counterclaims\"). Thereafter, on July 30, 2018, Plaintiff timely filed the subject of this Memorandum: a motion to dismiss Defendant's Amended Counterclaims. (ECF 43, \"Mot.\"). Defendant filed a response on August 13, 2018 (ECF 47, \"Opp'n\"), and Plaintiff filed a reply on August 20, 2018. (ECF 51, \"Reply\"). This Court held oral argument on the motion, as well as on two discovery motions, on September 20, 2018. (ECF 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Amended Counterclaims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant's Amended Counterclaims allege that, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , any State that accepts federal financial assistance for services for individuals with developmental disabilities is required to have a system to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental\n   disabilities. (AC \u00b6\u00b6 3-4). Such a system is allegedly referred to as a Protection &amp; Advocacy System (\"P &amp; A System\"), and Defendant alleges that it serves as the designated P &amp; A System for New York State. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1). Defendant alleges that it receives eight federal grants, and, pursuant to its mandate under federal law, investigates allegations of abuse and neglect, engages in individual advocacy, and pursues systemic litigation on behalf of persons with disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant alleges that on or about October 26, 2017, it provided a copy of the DRNY Report-titled \"Abuse &amp; Neglect of New York State Residents at Woods Services in Pennsylvania\"-to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Thereafter, according to Defendant's Amended Counterclaims, on October 30, 2017, Defendant released the report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16). Also on October 30, 2017, Defendant alleges, Plaintiff posted to its website a document entitled \"Wood's Response to the DRNY Report,\" which Defendant alleges contained false, misleading, and defamatory statements about Defendant and its staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19). Although Plaintiff has attached that response to its Motion, this Memorandum will limit its analysis to the allegations of Defendant's Amended Counterclaims. Those allegations include, but are not limited to, statements by Plaintiff that Defendant had an \"extremist agenda,\" that Defendant reported certain findings that it knew or should have known were \"specious\" and \"completely false,\" that Defendant \"misuses\" taxpayer funds, and that Defendant engaged in harassment and disparagement of Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 20-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant also asserts that, in addition to the statements contained in the October 30, 2017 document described above, Plaintiff made other false statements to the New York State Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities, and engaged in conduct to undermine and restrict Defendant's access to its clients such as by failing to provide residents with a phone in a private setting so they could speak to Defendant's attorneys in confidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant further alleges that Plaintiff's sought-after relief in this litigation, as evidenced by its complaint and settlement demands, violates federal law and is made for the purposes of intimidation. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51, 53-55, 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant also alleges that Plaintiff has retaliated and discriminated against Defendant, its lawyer, Michael Fiske, its staff, and Plaintiff's own patients and residents by interfering with Defendant's rights under federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2015001\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 101, 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Therefore, Defendant brings the following counterclaims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Count I: Defamation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Count II: Retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"ADA\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Count III: Retaliation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Count IV: Common Law Abuse of Legal Process\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Count V: Violation of New York Anti-SLAPP Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Civ.%20Rts.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2070\">\n    N.Y.

Defendant's Standing on Behalf of its Employees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although Defendant argues that it has special standing to assert claims on behalf of its employees, the cases it cites in support of that proposition all involve claims for injunctive relief.
