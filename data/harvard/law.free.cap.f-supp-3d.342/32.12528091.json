COLLYER, United States District Judge\n   Charles Hutchins and Joyce Subhi sue their former employer DynCorp International, Inc., and related entities under the False Claims Act, alleging that DynCorp falsified invoices; billed at unreasonable rates; charged the federal government for services not performed; provided sub-par goods and services, or failed to provide them at all; hired unqualified individuals; and otherwise submitted unwarranted claims for payment for providing logistical and operational support to the United States Army. Plaintiffs also allege retaliation. After the United States declined to intervene, DynCorp moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and a lack of sufficient particularity in alleging fraud. Having reviewed the record carefully, the Court finds that only one of Plaintiffs' many alleged claims states a plausible violation of the False Claims Act. Plaintiffs' other claims allege possible contract breaches but not fraud. Finally, because Plaintiffs did not engage in protected activities prior to their separations from DynCorp, there is no evidence of retaliation. The motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The United States Army administers the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) through which it contracts with private-sector companies to provide \"contingency support to augment the Army force structure\" in various military operations, including active combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Am. Compl. [Dkt. 24] \u00b6 26. Defendant DynCorp International Inc. is a global government services provider, which provides base operations, supply chain management, and infrastructure support. Defendant DynCorp International LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DynCorp International Inc. and provides operational support to U.S. forces in combat, peacekeeping, humanitarian, and training missions around the world, including Afghanistan. Referred to herein as \"DynCorp,\" the DynCorp International companies were awarded an Army contract in April 2008, known as LOGCAP IV, to \"provide[ ] logistic and other support services via a mission focused task order for a designated geographical or operational area region,\" including providing goods and services to camps and forward operating bases in Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32, 34. This contractual relationship between DynCorp and the U.S. Army was governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 C.F.R. 1.000\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), 48 C.F.R. 201\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Charles T. Hutchins and Joyce Subhi are former employees of DynCorp. Mr. Hutchins was hired by DynCorp in September 2010 as a senior manager of subcontracts (\"subcontracts senior manager\") at Kandahar Air Field and Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Ms. Subhi was hired in May 2011 as a subcontracts senior manager primarily in Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. A subcontracts senior manager is responsible for \"managing complex procurement and administrative activities for major government subcontracts consistent with customer requirements, government regulations, and company policies and procedures,\" which includes ensuring \"that DynCorp International complies with contract requirements so that DynCorp International can represent to the United States that it is in compliance with the\n   United States' regulatory and contractual requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16. Mr. Hutchins and Ms. Subhi were terminated from employment with DynCorp in 2012 and 2013, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 177, 280.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they have personal knowledge of the alleged facts, unless otherwise noted in the Amended Complaint. Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n (Opp'n) [Dkt. 42] at 3. They also assert that they \"are experts in the areas about which they complain and worked,\" and, finally, that each of them is an attorney with \"training in how to construe statutory language, regulations and contractual provisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Terms of DynCorp's LOGCAP IV Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The LOGCAP IV contract between DynCorp and the U.S. Army specified that DynCorp would provide services and equipment to support the Army's operations in Afghanistan. In this lawsuit, Mr. Hutchins and Ms. Subhi allege that DynCorp failed to provide the services required under the contract, failed to furnish equipment that met the standards required by the contract, and otherwise fell short of contractual requirements, but, nonetheless, submitted claims for, and received, the corresponding contractual payments from the Army.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1. Waste Management\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that DynCorp improperly billed the Army for waste management and related services that were not approved, were duplicative, or were otherwise improper. DynCorp has provided waste management services at over 20 bases in Afghanistan since August 2009 under the LOGCAP IV contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 64. This work was initially subcontracted to various non-DynCorp contractors that supplied their own vehicles, equipment, and personnel; each subcontractor billed DynCorp monthly and, after paying the subcontractors, DynCorp sought reimbursement from the Army.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DynCorp began taking steps to perform these waste management services itself, instead of using subcontractors, in September 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. About that time, it leased and shipped waste management equipment and vehicles to Kandahar Air Field.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that DynCorp employees discussed its intention to self-perform waste management services in that month and that DynCorp \"hoped to make more money by self-performing these services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. The Amended Complaint additionally alleges that Ms. Subhi attended a cost-analysis meeting sometime in late 2011 and that one analysis indicated an additional cost to the Army of $1,200,000/year for DynCorp waste management services at one base and an additional $1,000,000/year for similar DynCorp services at another base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-72. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp intended to perform waste management services for at least 27 bases in Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to perform such services itself, DynCorp allegedly executed leases for hundreds of waste management and water delivery vehicles, \"worth millions of dollars,\" and had them shipped to Kandahar Air Field before DynCorp notified the Army of its intention to self-perform, and without requesting prior approval from the\n   Army's Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77. Plaintiffs identify multiple purchase orders that allegedly pertain to these activities but identify relevant leased goods on only two of them: purchase order LG40032418 for $1,385,226 and approved on November 2, 2011, to lease numerous vehicles, including some at Spin Boldak, a base in Afghanistan; and purchase order LG40030861 for $101,400, to lease one trash truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DynCorp notes that Plaintiffs allege that the waste management vehicles and equipment were flown on C-130 military aircraft to U.S. military bases in Afghanistan from subcontractors in South Carolina and Dubai.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 105. It asserts that such transport would have been well-known to the Army, because it would require military coordination and authorization. DynCorp Mem. at 12. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp failed to get prior approval from the \"Administrative Contracting Officer\n   <em>\n    in Houston, Texas.\" Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. DynCorp argues that Plaintiffs do not, and cannot, allege that there was no government approval, from either the Administrative Contracting Officer in Afghanistan or another official.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, Mr. Hutchins learned from an unidentified member of the Projects Control Department at Camp Leatherneck in March 2012 that DynCorp was using a generic equipment billing code for the leased waste management vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. At the same time, DynCorp was allegedly billing the Army-using specific \"Waste Management and Water Delivery services billing codes\"-for the same services performed by subcontractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113. Ms. Subhi later learned of this alleged double billing in early 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, when DynCorp Project Management at Kandahar Air Field learned that an Administrative Contracting Officer was asking about the additional vehicles in the Spring of 2012, DynCorp attempted to conceal the fact that the vehicles were not being used \"by directing workers to drive the vehicles around the bases to add miles to the odometers to make it look like the vehicles were being used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. Allegedly, DynCorp management was aware of these efforts, as they were discussed in\n   several conference calls in April or May of 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Plaintiffs also allege, however, that DynCorp was asked by the Administrative Contracting Officer about \"all these vehicles sitting idle at all the bases and camps\" and DynCorp responded that they were brought to Afghanistan so that DynCorp itself could perform waste management and water delivery services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Amended Complaint recounts two instances of subcontractor workers driving the vehicles leased for self-performance by DynCorp in April or May 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-100. It alleges that the subcontractor should have, but did not, reimburse DynCorp for use of the DynCorp-leased vehicles and that, ultimately, the Army paid twice for the necessary vehicles, because it reimbursed DynCorp for leased vehicles and for subcontractor services that should have included payment for necessary vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-02. Plaintiffs allege that permitting subcontractors to drive the DynCorp-leased vehicles served to conceal the fact that the DynCorp vehicles were a duplicative and unwarranted cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In or about August 2013, DynCorp billed the Army for costs associated with returning the vehicles, which included import and export taxes that were passed on to the United States, even though the Army had denied DynCorp's request to self-perform in May 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73, 105-06. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp had no authority to invoice the Army for these duplicative vehicles and equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Amended Complaint further alleges that these additional vehicles and equipment cost the Army \"more than $20,000,000 in addition to the cost of utilizing existing DynCorp's subcontractors to perform the same work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Plaintiffs also allege that DynCorp billed the Army an extra $38,000,000 for DynCorp to maintain a \"duplicative fleet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. \"For 23 waste management and water delivery purchase orders for the period of November 2011 through 31 July 2012,\" Plaintiffs allege the Army paid DynCorp $14,311,560.60.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116. When those contracts were extended through July 31, 2013, the charges exceed $19,000,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs conclude that \"the false claims submitted by DynCorp International to the United States for unauthorized duplicate waste management and water delivery vehicles exceeded $33,393,541.40.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    2. Vehicles and Equipment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   a. Bus Leases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By way of a Work Performance Statement issued for August 1, 2011, to July 31, 2012, the Army directed DynCorp to lease seven 50-seat passenger buses for transporting military personnel at Camp Leatherneck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153. DynCorp leased the seven 50-seat passenger buses from Nasseb Trading Company on September 20, 2011, and they arrived at Camp Leatherneck beginning in October 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154-56. However, the buses lacked fire extinguishers and had to be reconfigured to \"accommodate the size and weight\" of military personnel and their equipment, leaving them with 43 seats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158. Mr. Hutchins sent photographs of the first reconfigured bus to Mario Galiouras, Subcontracts Senior Manager, who ordered the remaining buses reconfigured in the same fashion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Hutchins also informed Mr. Galiouras sometime after March 14, 2012 that \"the purchase order lease price needed to be adjusted downwards to reflect the reduced capacity of the seven buses,\" but such an adjustment was never made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs allege, DynCorp billed the Army as if the buses had 50 useable seats and had arrived with fire extinguishers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 160. Dejan Lorvic, Fleet Management Maintenance Supervisor at Kandahar Air Field, and Keith Browning, Deputy\n   Regional Manager at Camp Leatherneck, allegedly signed Service Received Reports, which reported the buses as mission capable, without first-hand knowledge of the buses' operating status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 164-65. In 2012, DynCorp Project Management directed Mr. Hutchins to \"investigat[e] the circumstances of the seven 50 seat buses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 167, 171. Mr. Hutchins then sent a memorandum\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Jim DeLong, DynCorp LOGCAP IV Project Manager; Mo Young, Deputy Project Manager; J.D. McCoy, Hub Leatherneck Regional Manager; and Sam Clear, Leatherneck Site Manager, on August 18, 2012, that \"detailed the improprieties related to the DynCorp International LG40029880 related to the seven 50 seat buses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 23 and 26, 2012, Mr. Hutchins asked DynCorp for additional information and documents regarding other purchase orders for leased vehicles and equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174. He was terminated before he received that information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   b. Vehicles and Equipment That Were Not Mission Capable\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As required, DynCorp created records for each piece of equipment or vehicle, including Service Received Reports, maintenance records, and the maintenance manager's certification of mission capable status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125-29. Defects that could cause a piece of equipment to be downgraded to \"Not Mission Capable\" include \"a cracked windshield, transmission problems, flat tire, missing side mirror, worn out brakes, non-functional seat belts, burned out head-lights, malfunctioning turn signals, or inoperable stop lights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120. Plaintiffs allege that \"[b]eginning in 2011\" and continuing, DynCorp billed the Army for leased material handling equipment, construction equipment, SUVs, pick-up trucks, buses, and other equipment and vehicles that were not mission capable for at least a portion of the preceding month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119, 125. These records were relied upon by the Administrative Contracting Officer to approve or deny DynCorp leases of specific vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp representations on \"purchase orders and other contract documents\" were \"false and were relied upon by the United States in the Administrative Contracting Officer's approval determination and in the United States [sic] decision to pay invoices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp managers failed to review maintenance records to determine if vehicles or pieces of equipment were actually mission capable, and did not complete the required Service Received Report, so that the DynCorp accounting department did not reduce contractors' invoices for vehicles or equipment that were Not Mission Capable during all or part of the prior month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This scheme is alleged to have begun as early as 2011 at more than 20 camps and forward operating bases throughout the south and southwestern portions of Afghanistan and to have involved Mr. Galiouras, Oldirch Valceus,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Dejan Lovric, Fleet Management Maintenance Supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121, 125. Through this alleged subterfuge, Plaintiffs contend that DynCorp billed the Army for \"leased SUVs, pick-up trucks, flatbed trucks, buses, construction equipment, material handling equipment and other leased vehicles as fully mission capable that were not fully\n   mission capable\" because they were \"not up to specification, violated safety codes, and falsified Service Received Reports were created to justify billing the equipment and vehicles as fully mission capable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   DynCorp responds that Plaintiffs provide no specific references during their unstated time period as to what vehicles or equipment were not mission ready or \"exactly what that means in a war zone, where equipment is highly likely to be expected to suffer some damage without being rendered unsatisfactory.\" DynCorp Mem. at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   c. Older Vehicles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In order to obtain approval of vehicle leases by the Administrative Contracting Officer, DynCorp provided a \"package of documents\" with details about the specific vehicles and equipment to be leased, including their age.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142-43. In a conference call in February or March 2012 on which Mr. Hutchins participated, unnamed personnel were \"questioned about acceptance of vehicles and material-handling equipment that did not meet the specifications listed on the purchase orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. Mr. Galiouras is alleged to have responded that he knew that some vehicles were older than shown on the purchase order but that \"the year indicated on the purchase order was actually more of a general guideline rather than a hard and fast requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. Plaintiffs broadly allege that there were at least 67 vehicles that were manufactured in a different year from the year that was detailed on the purchase order; they specifically identify ten such purchase orders for a total value of $1,785,822.75.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. Plaintiffs specify two discrepancies among the ten: Purchase Order LG4007361 for a 2011 Toyota Hilux that was leased for $1,773.27 per month in July 2011 but was actually a 2007 model; and a 2005 forklift leased from November 29, 2011 to April 28, 2012 that was actually a 2001 model.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    3. Medical\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   a. Physicals and Vaccines\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An Order of the Central Command-the CENTCOM Individual Protection and Individual/Unit Deployment Policy (\"MOD 11\")-required that \"[g]overnment civilian employees, volunteers, and DoD contractor personnel ... must be reevaluated for fitness to deploy.... An examination with all medical issues and requirements addressed will remain valid for 15 months from the date of the physical.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 246 (capitalization and emphasis omitted). Beginning in September 2012 and continuing through February 2013, DynCorp stopped all personnel traveling through Dubai for an annual physical if their most recent physical examination was 9 months or older.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 247-49. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp management was aware that this was contrary to the 15-month window specified in MOD 11, as it was discussed in meetings, phone calls, and emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248. DynCorp billed the Army for these physical examinations, for the billable time employees spent being examined, and for any hotels and meals they required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 249-50, 255-56. Ms. Subhi was \"held up\" in Dubai for a physical and was paid for that time even though she was unable to work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 257. Plaintiffs allege that these physicals could have been conducted, at lower cost, by physicians on base in Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DynCorp responds that it needed to ensure that every employee in theatre had had a physical examination within the past 15 months and that, to comply, it required those employees who traveled through Dubai and whose last physical examination was nine months or more before that trip, to undergo a physical examination. DynCorp\n   argues that its practical policy applied only to those persons entering Afghanistan from Dubai, not all employees, and that Plaintiffs do not allege any misrepresentation by DynCorp to the government. DynCorp Mem. at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   MOD 11 also requires that certain inoculations and vaccines be administered, including vaccines for hepatitis and chicken pox. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 258-59. DynCorp provides these services at processing facilities in India and Dubai.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 259. Plaintiffs allege that beginning \"as early as 2011,\" these processing facilities administered \"hundreds of inoculations and vaccines that were expired or were for pediatric doses,\" and, therefore, not in compliance with MOD 11.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 261-63. Local medical personnel allegedly justified pediatric doses \"by stating that the Indian workers were very small people\" and that the expired vaccines were \"still good.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 265-66. These employees were subsequently re-vaccinated, which Plaintiffs assert cost \"many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 264. Plaintiffs do not allege that the Army was misled by this situation but, rather, that it should have received a refund.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   b.

An X-ray machine was purchased with these funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 216.

Plaintiffs allege the dental equipment was removed from the material requisition form, but the $130,000 was not subtracted and was used to pay other invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 217-19. Plaintiffs also allege that Project Management was aware that both requests for funds had been approved, but that no equipment was provided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 220-21.

In addition, the Amended Complaint alleges that DynCorp created a separate purchase order for the X-ray and Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation /First Aid Training, which was approved by the Administrative Contracting Officer and used to pay a DynCorp subcontractor, Onsite Occupational Health and Safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   DynCorp rejects these allegations, pointing out that the central purpose of LOGCAP is to \"reduce the contracting activity burden, especially in large scale operations with multiple and often related service requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DynCorp Mem. at 18.

Billing for Unauthorized Services\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   DynCorp contracted with Onsite Occupational Health and Safety to provide medical services to bases and camps throughout Afghanistan, but that subcontract did not include medics at the smallest sites, denoted \"Band 5\" sites. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 226-27. However, the Amended Complaint alleges that DynCorp's Project Manager for Afghanistan directed Onsite Occupational to provide medics at those Band 5 sites that had dining facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Salaries for such personnel were included in monthly invoices submitted to, and paid by, DynCorp.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On several occasions, DynCorp attempted to \"add additional funding to the current Purchase Order\" for these services but was unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 228. Plaintiffs allege that Fire Medics were sent to some of the Band 5 sites as early as 2011 but \"the Onsite Occupational subcontract purchase order was not revised to include medics at Band 5 sites with dining facilities until March 2013.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 234. Therefore, the Amended Complaint alleges, Onsite Occupational \"deployed medics to sites in [sic] which DynCorp International knew they were not authorized or funded to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 235. \"DynCorp ... paid those invoices and submitted the invoice to the United States for payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, \"the military requested as many as 12 Fire Medics but did not authorize additional funds for those services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 237. DynCorp agreed to provide the 12 Fire Medics at no cost to the Army but it allegedly \"did, in fact, add costs and billed the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, Onsite Occupational provided emergency medical services at additional multiple camps, from September 2011 through April 2013, but DynCorp is alleged to have never requested additional funding and merely invoiced the Army without authorization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 239-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that \"[a]ll of these charges involved invoicing the United States for services that had not been authorized .... DynCorp International had paid for such unauthorized services from funds approved by the United States for other purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 244. It also alleges that \"DynCorp International Sourcing eventually requested additional funds for unspecified costs ...

The change was not submitted for approval to the Administrative Contracting Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 180, 186. Mr. Hutchins, who was \"acting Procurement and Subcontracts Director ... at Kandahar Air Field\" at the time, alleges that he was repeatedly told by Vice President Robinson that the LOGCAP IV contract had not been changed and that the Administrative Contracting Officer had been informed of the change in practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 193, 191. Mr. Hutchins objected, telling Ms. Robinson that the Administrative Contracting Officer did not have the authority to change the terms of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192. Plaintiffs allege that DynCorp made \"tens of millions of dollars more since it received the extra one and a half percent commission on multiple contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 189. Specifically, \"excess commission\n   charges ... exceeded $21,000,000\" for (a) dining and facility contracts, (b) labor services, (c) construction services, (d) miscellaneous, (e) waste management services, and (f) vehicles and construction leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   DynCorp responds that Plaintiffs \"acknowledge that the alleged change in commissions invoicing was brought to the attention of the Administrative Contracting Officer by a [DynCorp] employee (thereby defeating scienter) and that the bills were paid by the government (thereby defeating materiality).\" DynCorp Mem. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    5.

On August 28, 2012, the day he was terminated, Mr. Hutchins alleges that Ms. Wrubbel informed him that his name was on a \"trouble-maker list\" and that DynCorp personnel were directed by email not to respond to his request for information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ms. Subhi was terminated in April 2013 and was told that it was because her son worked in the same department as she did, an alleged ethics violation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 284. She contends that this reason was a pretext to hide retaliation, since other relatives worked in the same departments, and that the real reason for her termination was her complaints related to \"the hiring of personnel who were clearly not qualified for positions that DynCorp International hired them to fill and the issues related to medical care provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 280, 284.

Am. Compl. \u00b6 286. Numerous allegations throughout the Amended Complaint relate to the insufficiency of vehicles for which DynCorp allegedly billed the Army. The Court considers each in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    First, Plaintiff-Relators allege that DynCorp knowingly billed the Army for seven 50-seat buses, despite the fact that the buses had to be reconfigured to accommodate the size and weight of Army personnel and their gear so that the buses only had 43 seats per bus. The Amended Complaint also alleges that the buses were delivered without required fire extinguishers. DynCorp responds that Plaintiff-Relators' complaint about buses is financially immaterial to its contract with the Army and thus fails to make out a claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DynCorp Mem. at 32. While Plaintiff-Relators provide specificity and knowledge of the buses, the modifications described do not rise to the level of a \"material\" false claim; it is also implausible that the Army did not know of the buses' reconfigurations, considering that Army soldiers could not, and then could, use them; and there is no allegation that DynCorp attempted to conceal the reconfigurations. To the contrary, Plaintiff-Relators do not deny that 50 soldiers and gear could not fit into a normal 50-person bus or that adjustments were not necessary to permit the use of the buses as intended.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Plaintiff-Relators further allege that DynCorp \"repeatedly billed the United States for material handling equipment, construction equipment, SUVs, pick-up trucks, buses and other equipment and vehicles that was [sic] not mission capable for a portion of or for the entire preceding month\" beginning in 2011\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    at more than 20 camps and forward operating bases throughout the south and southwestern portions of Afghanistan. Am. Compl. \u00b6 125. DynCorp counters that these allegations are insufficiently particular to satisfy Rule 9(b) or to advise DynCorp of the alleged errors in billing. Plaintiff-Relators broadly allege:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    [t]he Administrative Contracting Officer had to rely on the DynCorp International records in making an approval determination as no other record was submitted.... Such statements [in DynCorp orders and other documents] were false and were relied upon [by] the United States in the Administrative Contracting\n    Officer's approval determination and in the United States['] decision to pay invoices from DynCorp International....

Plaintiff-Relators do not support these broad assertions with corresponding factual specifics, and, remembering that this contract was performed in a war zone, destroy their own allegation by the last highlighted phrase. They also allege that DynCorp failed to abide by an established practice of submitting \"Service Received Reports\" from subcontractors that would show whether vehicles were mission capable, but Plaintiff-Relators again fail to provide factual details, fail to cite the LOGCAP IV contract to show that such reports were required prior to payment, and fail to allege facts that support the allegation that the failure to submit Service Received Reports constituted a false claim.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 134-36.

The allegations do not make clear that DynCorp knew at the time it submitted the purchase orders and billed the Army that the vehicles, provided by subcontractors, would be older than stated.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 149 (\"Upon inspection, the vehicle was really a 2007 model.\").

Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 170-71. Plaintiff-Relators specify that falsified Service Received Reports were prepared in connection with the reconfigured buses addressed in Count 1(D), but give no further factual information as to other false reports that might have been\n    submitted to the Army. DynCorp responds that Plaintiff-Relators' allegation regarding a \"widespread problem\" of falsified reports is insufficiently particular to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b). DynCorp Mem. at 32-33.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The claim concerning false Service Received Reports related to the seven buses will be dismissed for the same reason that Count 1(D) was dismissed: based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint, DynCorp did not conceal the reconfiguration and there was no Army protest that the buses could transport 43 soldiers with gear, rather than 50 soldiers without. There is, thus, no evidence of materiality to the contract performance by DynCorp. As to other \"heavy equipment and leased vehicles,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff-Relators do not identify what vehicles at which camps were not mission capable, much less the condition(s) that made them not mission capable. False Claims Act allegations must be supported by sufficient facts to support the inference that a violation of the law has occurred. Plaintiff-Relators broad claim is insufficient for this purpose. Plaintiff-Relators essentially argue that any submission for payment by DynCorp would have been false, but their allegations present only broad and speculative assertions that unnamed maintenance and service managers did not consult maintenance records and did not submit Service Received Reports for the vehicles.

Although they acknowledge that the Administrative Contracting Officer knew of this change, they allege that he was not authorized to change pay rates under the LOGCAP IV contract. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 185, 190-92. DynCorp responds that Plaintiff-Relators fail to identify any provision of the LOGCAP IV contract that would make purchase order claims false and that it is \"highly\n    relevant\" that the Administrative Contracting Officer knew of the change and did not object. DynCorp Mem. at 33-34.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Plaintiff-Relators allege that Administrative Contracting Officers do not have unilateral authority to amend the LOGCAP IV contract and DynCorp does not disagree.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 188. Plaintiff-Relators further contend that DynCorp \"should have gone to the United States Army Sustainment Command\" to secure a change in its contract rates.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 187.

Thus, Plaintiff-Relators admit that DynCorp did not violate the LOGCAP IV or the False Claims Act when it informed the Administrative Contracting Officer that it was changing its billing\n    <em>\n     practices\n    </em>\n    , but not the contract rates or any language in the contract. Plaintiff-Relators conflate changing billing practices with changing the actual contract rates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Further, Plaintiff-Relators do not allege that this change in billing caused DynCorp to charge the Army for goods and services that it did not receive. While it is possible the Army could have paid less, without falsity there is no factual basis to make out a claim under the False Claims Act. To the contrary, Plaintiff-Relators allege conduct that was \"not allowed under the contract\" and may have constituted a breach of contract, but not a false claim.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kellogg Brown &amp; Root\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155738\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/143/#p152\">\n     800 F.Supp.2d at 155\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Certainly, the Court does not read MOD 11 to require DynCorp to examine each employee exactly at 15 months. It's possible that another policy would have saved the government money, but Plaintiff-Relators do not allege that the Army was unaware of DynCorp's policy, that DynCorp misrepresented its policy, or that DynCorp submitted any false statements to the government. The Army may yet determine that DynCorp's policy was a breach of contract, but there is no indication of fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Plaintiff-Relators' allegations regarding the immunization program fail for similar reasons. First, Plaintiff-Relators do not allege that DynCorp had prior knowledge of the vaccine quality or intended that its employees receive deficient immunization.

DynCorp may have still charged the Army for the ineffective vaccines and the Army may have incurred additional costs for medical issues arising from this mistake, but, as with the claim above, whether the Army should be reimbursed is a question of breach of contract, not fraud.

Assuming the truth of the first allegation-that there were identified \"trouble-makers\" and he was so identified-the allegation does not support an inference that this list described potential False Claims Act litigants. As to the second, the actual fact-employees were instructed not to provide operational information to an exiting colleague-allows only a smidgen of an inference that the reason behind this direction was to retaliate against Mr. Hutchins rather than to protect corporate information. The Court does not find that DynCorp was put on notice that \"litigation was a reasonable possibility,\" which is necessary to support a claim for retaliation.\n    <em>\n     Williams,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9151912,3432885\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/1251/\">\n     389 F.3d at 1261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Claim 2(B): Retaliation Against Ms. Subhi\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Ms. Subhi had the same title and general responsibilities as Mr. Hutchins.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. She was terminated by DynCorp in April 13 for \"an alleged ethics violation,\" to wit working in the same department as her son.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 284. Like Mr. Hutchins, Ms. Subhi's argument in the Amended Complaint is that performance of her normal job responsibilities constituted protected activity. Consistent with that argument, and also like Mr. Hutchins, Ms. Subhi did not allege fraud to her managers; did not step outside the usual chain of command; did not inform the Army of the alleged fraud until after she was terminated; and otherwise took no other steps to indicate to DynCorp that litigation was a reasonable possibility. Thus, for the same reasons as with Mr. Hutchins, the Amended Complaint does not support a reasonable inference that DynCorp knew enough to intend to retaliate against Ms. Subhi.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Ms. Subhi focuses on the alleged pretext behind her termination: \"it is not unusual for family members to work together at DynCorp.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Assuming this to be true, it fails to substitute for evidence that DynCorp knew she had engaged in protected activities and fired her because of them. The Court makes all reasonable inferences in favor of Ms. Subhi but finds that she has not yet made out a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case of retaliation. Claim 2(B) will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Rule 10(b)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    While the Amended Complaint is hardly clear and concise, it is not \"too confusing to require [DynCorp] to respond.\"\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rogler v.

At the very least, it is not\n    too confusing to determine that dismissal is largely appropriate. However, if Plaintiff-Relators successfully move to file a second amended complaint, they are strongly encouraged to describe each claim as a separate count so that the Court and DynCorp can better follow along.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
