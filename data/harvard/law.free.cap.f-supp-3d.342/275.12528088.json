Inzerillo (\"Inzerillo\") (together, the \"Individual Defendants\"), and the Town of Smithtown (the \"Town\") (together with the Individual Defendants, the \"Defendants\"), in response to her arrest in March of 2017. The Plaintiff alleges numerous causes of action, namely abuse of process under both federal and state law, malicious prosecution, and violation of her First Amendment right to Freedom of Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by the Defendants, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\" FED.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the Plaintiff's complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, are construed in favor of the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Town's shelter (the \"Shelter\" or \"Animal Shelter\") is located at 410 Middle Country Road, Smithtown, New York and houses dogs and cats. The Shelter is open seven days a week to make its animals available for adoption by members of the public. The Shelter is operated by the Town through a separate agency (the \"Agency\" or \"Department\"). The Town has direct authority over the Agency and controls daily operations, employment decisions, and control over its policies and procedures. Complaint (\"Compl.\"), Docket Entry (\"DE\") 1, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hansen is a self-proclaimed animal welfare advocate and has volunteered at the Southold Animal Shelter, the Riverhead Animal Shelter, the Town of Brookhaven Animal Shelter and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as well as numerous animal rescue groups, including Responsible Solutions for Valued Pets. She also founded and ran a non-profit organization focused on improving Long Island's animal shelters. On August 5, 2015, the Town hired Hansen as the supervisor of the Department. The complaint alleges that Hansen inherited a Department\n   that had been the subject of numerous complaints that critiqued the Agency's operations and accused its employees of animal cruelty. Hansen became responsible for managing the overall operations of the Department, including managing personnel issues. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-28. Early in her tenure, the Plaintiff began to implement organizational and procedural changes with the goal of improving the Shelter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early 2016, Inzerillo, a newly installed councilwoman on the Town board, and Lynne Nowick, a fellow councilwoman, were appointed as Co-Liaisons to the Department. Inzerillo and Nowick became responsible for overseeing the Agency and its operations. For reasons not specified in the complaint, the Plaintiff alleges that almost immediately, Inzerillo became hostile to Hansen. For example, on February 11, 2016, Inzerillo, along with McPadden and a small group of Town employees visited the Shelter and toured the facility. During that visit, Inzerillo criticized Hansen's management style in the presence of the other visitors. A couple of days later, Inzerillo sent Hansen an email, which accused her of improperly using the Shelter for meetings of volunteers, donors, and elected officials. About this time, Inzerillo also placed a report in Hansen's personnel file, which allegedly accused Hansen of mismanagement. Hansen was not informed of this, which purportedly violated the collective bargaining agreement between Hansen's union and the Town. Shortly thereafter, Inzerillo relinquished her responsibilities as Co-Liaison to the Department. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2016, Inzerillo, who was no longer Co-Liaison to the Department, emailed Hansen to ask her a series of questions regarding the Shelter's volunteers. Hansen complained about this email to her union and to Nowick. Nowick responded that she would discuss it with the Town Supervisor. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 26, 2016, DeSanti, an Education Specialist at the Shelter, quit her job. She subsequently called Inzerillo to complain about Hansen. A few weeks later, Inzerillo convened a meeting with Hansen, her union representative, Nowick, the Director of Personnel, and the Town Attorney to discuss the Department. At that time, Hansen expressed her concerns about DeSanti and memorialized them in an email to the meeting attendees. Inzerillo responded to Hansen's email, defending DeSanti. Ultimately, DeSanti retained her position with the Shelter. Hansen again reported her issues with Inzerillo to Nowick. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 18, 2017, Hansen's attorney sent a letter to the Town Supervisor regarding Inzerillo's actions. Four days later, Hansen terminated DeSanti's employment. DeSanti reportedly responded, \"I don't think so. I'm going to call [Inzerillo],\" and on her way out of the building, repeated \"God help you\" while making the sign of a cross. On January 27, 2017, five days after being terminated, DeSanti reported back to work. DeSanti did not do so with Hansen's knowledge or permission. Hansen reported this development to Nowick. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 7, 2017, Hansen was served with a letter of suspension by three individuals from the Town's Public Safety Department. The letter informed Hansen that she was suspended with pay for 30 days and that the town was filing charges against her pursuant to Section 75 of the New York Civil Service Law. Hansen was also required to provide Public Safety with her keys to the Shelter. She complied with the directive and left the premises without incident. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the winter of 2017, the Agency advertised a volunteer orientation at the Shelter\n   that was to take place on February 18, 2017. The advertisement noted that the Shelter was \"in need of volunteers\" and invited the public to bring proper identification. Throughout the timeframe relevant to this case, the Department has had volunteers from the general public. These individuals receive various assignments, from walking dogs to fostering animals. They must be at least 16 years old and comply with the Agency's Policy and Procedure Manual, which sets forth the rules of the program. Volunteers are not required to be residents of the Town. Employees are allowed to volunteer, provided that any volunteer activity is outside the scope of their employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 18, 2017, during the course of her suspension, Hansen attended the advertised volunteer orientation at the Shelter with the alleged intention of volunteering. After taking a volunteer application, Garcia, who was employed by the Town as an Investigator, approached Hansen and informed her that he did not believe she was allowed at the Shelter. Garcia then called McPadden, the Deputy Chief of the Town's Public Safety Department, who informed him that Hansen was not allowed to be at the Shelter. At that time, Garcia asked Hansen to leave and she complied without incident. While leaving the property, the Plaintiff noticed Valentine, the Public Safety Director Chief at the Shelter, and inquired as to the situation. Valentine indicated that he supported whatever Garcia told Hansen. In a subsequent report, Garcia indicated that Hansen left the Shelter and he considered the matter closed. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Approximately three weeks later, DeSanti provided a statement to the Suffolk County Police Department stating that she observed Hansen at the Shelter for the volunteer training and that the purpose of Hansen's attendance was \"to harass [her].\" DeSanti also purportedly stated that Hansen was previously told that she could not visit the Shelter. DeHoyos, a Kennel Attendent at the Shelter, Sylvester, an Investigator with the Town, and Lee, a Senior Investigator with the Town, all also provided statements to the police department that stated that Hansen had been told that during her 30-day suspension she was not allowed at the Shelter. Valentine provided a statement to police that specified that he did not give Hansen permission to visit the Shelter. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 10, 2017, the Plaintiff was arrested outside her home for criminal trespass. She was handcuffed, brought to the precinct and was issued a desk appearance ticket. About that time, Inzerillo allegedly instructed DeSanti to ask a Shelter volunteer to call a Newsday photographer to photograph Hansen's arrest. Inzerillo told DeSanti to erase the message that contained the instruction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 97-102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April 2017, the Town began a disciplinary hearing against Hansen, which subsequently resulted in her termination. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106-10. On December 22, 2017, the criminal charges against Hansen were dismissed on a motion from the Assistant District Attorney assigned to the case. Compl. \u00b6 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. STANDARD OF REVIEW: FED. R. CIV.

After her brief tenure as Co-Liaison, she stepped aside, leaving Nowick as the sole Liaison. Although she was no\n   longer formally responsible for the Animal Shelter, the complaint details a continued meddling in its affairs. For example, in May 2016, Inzerillo wrote Hansen to demand answers to a series of questions regarding the Shelter's operations. Later in the year, Inzerillo convened a meeting with Hansen, Nowick, the Director of Personnel for the Town and the Town Attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This conduct is not illustrative of the kind of authority required for\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.

While she certainly continued to intrude into the Shelter's affairs after her removal as Co-Liaison, the activity alleged in the complaint does not contend that she made any final decision or established any official policy at the time of the relevant conduct alleged in this suit.

Custom\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Plaintiff also asserts that the Town's practice of unlawfully removing citizens from public facilities is so persistent and widespread, that it constitutes a policy or custom.

Contrary to the Plaintiff's contention, even reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, she does not plead that she was there for any purpose outside of joining the Shelter's volunteer program, which consisted of activities such as walking dogs or fostering pets. Hansen notes that she \"considers herself an animal welfare advocate\" and has volunteered with various organizations to further that goal, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. She even created her own nonprofit with the aim of improving regional animal shelters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the complaint details Hansen's extensive past activities related to animal rights, her prior experience or personal views do not alter the nature of the activity that occurred at the Shelter that day.

While it is possible that volunteers at a local animal shelter would have uniform views on \"public questions\" involving animal welfare, there is nothing in the complaint that alleges that\n   <em>\n    these volunteers\n   </em>\n   had such organized positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Plaintiff argues that she intended to become a volunteer to further her animal welfare advocacy.

Contrary to the depiction of her motivations in the Plaintiff's opposition brief, there is nothing in the complaint that permits the Court to conclude that her desire to volunteer was connected to her viewpoints on animal rights or welfare. However, even if she added her reasons for volunteering to the complaint, the Plaintiff's individual motivations are irrelevant. \"It is possible to find some kernel of expression in almost every activity a person undertakes-for example, walking down the street or meeting one's friends at a shopping mall-but such a kernel is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection of the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Stanglin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605928\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/19/#p24\">\n    490 U.S. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605928\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/19/#p24\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Hansen has not pled that the volunteers took a collective position on animal welfare. There is nothing inherent in the activities performed by volunteers such as, walking dogs or fostering animals, that advances animal rights. Just as volunteers at a local nursing home likely have differing opinions on suitable eldercare or the propriety of Social Security, Medicare or the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is entirely conceivable that volunteers at local animal shelters have diverse opinions on animal rights or welfare. The Court will not dissect the assignments given to the\n   Shelter's volunteers to \"find some kernel of expression.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The facts at-issue are somewhat analogous to\n   <em>\n    Stanglin\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court ruled that the ability of dance-hall patrons to engage in recreational dancing in a local roller-skating rink did not qualify as \"expressive association.\" In\n   <em>\n    Stanglin\n   </em>\n   , the Court noted that the dancers, like shelter volunteers, are not part of any organized association and the majority are strangers to one another.

Both involve a diverse group of people who attend their respective events for a common activity. While Hansen attended the training for an activity that is ostensibly more than just a social activity, the Court finds no practical difference under the current framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Plaintiff argues that volunteering at an animal shelter is more akin to attending a local school sporting event, as was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . There, the Second Circuit determined that fans attending school basketball games were engaging in a form of \"expressive association.\" Judge Kearse noted that \"persons attending the [basketball] game are expected to engage in expressive activity, chanting and cheering for whichever team they favor. Indeed, they are encouraged to do so; many schools even have at the games groups of students whose function is to lead the audience in boisterous expressions of encouragement and partisanship.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276298\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/156/#p172\">\n    859 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the spectators in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   were encouraged to express their uniform viewpoint, which was demonstrated by cheering for a particular sports team, the volunteers here did not necessarily have a uniform viewpoint. The activity itself, walking dogs or fostering animals, was not a manifestation of a united belief or opinion. Accordingly, the activities in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court recognizes that there are categories of volunteers in our society that may partake in a form of \"expressive association.\" Volunteers for various levels of campaigns or advocacy groups are engaged in a form of expression. These groups \"take positions on public questions,\"\n   <em>\n    Stanglin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605928\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/19/#p24\">\n    490 U.S. at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605928\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/19/#p24\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rotary Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217993\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/537/#p548\">\n    481 U.S. at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217993\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/537/#p548\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), and it is likely that their volunteers would be understood to convey those messages when performing their work. This is not the case for Hansen or her fellow volunteers. The Court does not believe that the Constitution recognizes volunteer work at a local animal shelter as an \"expressive activity\" that merits First Amendment protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, even if the activity constitutes an \"expressive activity,\" precluding a suspended employee from volunteering for her own Agency is both reasonable and viewpoint neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City v.
