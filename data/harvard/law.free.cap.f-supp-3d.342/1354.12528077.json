For the reasons below, the Court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 48) in part and denies it in part. The Court also denies Plaintiff's Motion to Amend Complaint as moot. (Dkt. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff suffered from chronic knee pain in his left knee. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 1-2; Dkt. 51 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. His left leg was deformed, the result of a gunshot wound sustained in 1978. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 3; Dkt. 51 at \u00b6 1. His femur bowed forward and to the outside. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 4. His left leg was also 1.5 centimeters shorter than his right leg and rotated twenty degrees externally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He walked with a gait.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2007, he decided to have his knee replaced. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 6; Dkt. 51 at \u00b6 8. He was obese. Dkt. 48-2 at 2. Plaintiff's surgeon, Dr. Diehl, chose to implant a Zimmer Biomet NexGen Complete Knee Solution LPS-Flex Prolong System replacement knee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Dr. Diehl performed the knee-replacement surgery in June 2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Plaintiff recovered well and regained movement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Seven years later, Plaintiff's pain returned. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 51 at \u00b6 10-13. Dr. Diehl examined him and recommended another surgery to diagnose the problem. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 13; Dkt. 51 at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During that surgery, Dr. Diehl found that the polyethene tibial post of the replacement knee - that is, the portion of the artificial knee attached to the tibia - had broken. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. 51 \u00b6 14. Dr. Diehl replaced the polyethylene liner, still using the Zimmer product. Dkt. 48-2 at \u00b6 14. No one kept the broken component after surgery. Dkt. 51 at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff filed this action asserting design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure-to-warn claims arising from the broken tibial post. After discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims. (Dkt. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The court held that, without expert testimony, a plaintiff must present circumstantial evidence sufficient to allow the jury to infer that the \"plaintiff's theory [of a defect] is the only plausible explanation for the [injury].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875357\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/310/298/#p306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875357\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/310/298/#p306\">\n    at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As the Eleventh Circuit has done, this Court must consider whether Plaintiff has presented enough circumstantial evidence to avoid summary judgment without expert testimony. Plaintiff argues that an affidavit executed by Dr. Mark Diehl - his surgeon - is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51-8. Dr. Diehl provided the affidavit before litigation began. In it, he stated that he implanted the knee in the condition he received it from Defendants \"without any modification\" and that the surgery \"went as planned.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. Dr. Diehl also stated that \"in all [his] years as an orthopedic surgeon performing hundreds of knee surgeries, [he] had not seen such a fracture or failure of this polyethylene insert in this manner, and the insert is not supposed to fail as it did.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. He stated that it was his opinion \"to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that Plaintiff's weight and femoral deformity did not cause the fracture. Dkt. 51-8 at \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. Finally, he said the implant should have lasted more than fifteen years and \"did not perform as [he] would have expected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dr. Diehl is not an expert on the design and performance of polyethylene components in replacement knees and was not offered as an expert. As the Eleventh Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Mast Biosurgery\n   </em>\n   , the testimony of a treating physician cannot be\n   enough to show how a manufacturer intended a complicated device to operate when that treating physician is not qualified as an expert in the design and production of the product.\n   <em>\n    Mast Biosurgery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648268\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1312/#p1319\">\n    644 F.3d at 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So Dr. Diehl's affidavit is insufficient circumstantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But this case involves something else. In support of his claim, Plaintiff points to an internal document, called a complaint-handling form, that Defendants used to gather information about the failure of Plaintiff's replacement knee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51-16. One of Defendants' employees completed the form. Dkt. 51-19 at 2. A question on the form asked: \"Does the available information suggest that the device/product has malfunctioned or failed to perform as intended?\" Dkt. 51-16 at 26. The employee checked the box for the answer \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648268\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1312/#p1319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The form then stated: \"If yes, explain circumstance below.\" The employee wrote: \"The articular surface post broke while implanted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648268\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1312/#p1319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a deposition, a Zimmer employee was asked about the question. He explained that \"[t]he articular surface post was not designed to fracture under normal loading and conditions; therefore, a post fracture would be checked off as a yes.\" Dkt. 51-19 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The complaint-handling form then asked \"Were there any contributing conditions related to the event? (Ex: trauma, illness, previous injury, related non-compliance, patient anatomy).\" The employee checked the box for the answer \"No.\" Dkt. 51-16 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the complaint-handling form creates a genuine issue of material fact about whether the device suffered from a manufacturing defect that caused it to break. The Court agrees. Put together, the answer to these questions establish an admission by Defendants that the knee \"malfunctioned or failed to perform as intended\" and that there were no other \"contributing conditions\" like Plaintiff's weight or gait.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648268\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1312/#p1319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The admission provides both evidence of a defect and evidence that the defect was the most likely cause of the failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   During oral argument, counsel for Defendants argued that the employee who completed the form had no knowledge of the facts at issue and thus the form has little evidentiary value. That may be true. But no evidence in the record supports this contention. Indeed, each of these two critical answers allowed Defendants' employee four possible choices: \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No Information\", or \"N/A\" (not applicable). The employee chose to answer the questions with \"Yes\" and \"No\" answers rather than stating that he or she did not have the necessary information. When asked if the device malfunctioned or failed to perform as intended, for example, the employee could have answered \"No Information\" but said \"Yes.\" Likewise, when asked whether there were any contributing factors (like Plaintiff's anatomy), the employee could have said \"No Information\" but said \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The very next section of the complaint-handling form also includes the following supplemental information: \"it was noted that the patient had a verus flexion femoral deformity, but this was corrected by the distal femoral cut.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. This seems like a reference to Plaintiff's preexisting condition that caused his uneven gait, an indication Defendants' employee was aware of these issues when he or she wrote there were no contributing factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With this one form Plaintiff has accomplished what the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Mast Biosurgery\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graff\n   </em>\n   failed to do: produce evidence that at once shows that the device did not operate as intended and that - if believed by the jury - would eliminate other plausible explanations for the product's failure. The Court recognizes that Plaintiff's evidence is thin. Defendants may well present evidence to prevent the complaint-handling form from being considered a knowing admission. So Defendants may ultimately obtain judgment as a matter of law. Even so, on this record, Plaintiff has \"provide[d] evidence that would permit a jury to select her explanation, that of a manufacturing defect, as the most likely.\"\n   <em>\n    Mast Biosurgery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648268\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1312/#p1319\">\n    644 F.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's manufacturing-defect claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
