Fillin' Station responds that it sufficiently disclosed its claims against MS LZ Delta in its schedule of assets filed with the bankruptcy court; that its claims against MS LZ Delta were disclosed in a motion to employ counsel in Fill It Up's bankruptcy proceedings; and that the bankruptcy court's order granting Fill It Up's motion to employ counsel disclosed Fillin' Station's claims against MS LZ Delta such that MS LZ Delta cannot invoke judicial estoppel here. In reply, MS LZ Delta argues that Fillin' Station misconstrues the applicable standard and that Fillin' Station's purported disclosures are insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Judicial estoppel is a common law doctrine that prevents a party from assuming inconsistent positions in litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Superior Crewboats, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9201119,9233183\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/374/330/\">\n    374 F.3d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (5th Cir. 2004). \"The purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process, by preventing parties from playing fast and loose with the courts to suit the exigencies of self interest.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Coastal Plains, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n    179 F.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (5th Cir. 1999) (quotation marks and alterations omitted). \"Against the backdrop of the bankruptcy system judicial estoppel must be applied in such a way as to deter dishonest debtors, whose failure to fully and honestly disclose all their assets undermines the integrity of the bankruptcy system.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

MS LZ Delta argues that Fillin' Station's affirmative statement that a sister company held a claim against MS LZ Delta is insufficient to disclose Fillin' Station's claim against MS LZ Delta, and that by filing this action, Fillin' Station has taken a position inconsistent with its July 2017 schedule of assets. Fillin' Station contends that its statement regarding its sister company's claim sufficiently disclosed \"what [Fillin' Station] knew at the time of filing of the schedules on July 25, 2017,\" and thus, it\n   disclosed the lawsuit and did not willfully conceal a potential claim. Doc. # 14 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Fifth Circuit requires that in bankruptcy, \"[a]ny claim with potential must be disclosed, even if it is contingent, dependent, or conditional.\"\n   <em>\n    Coastal Plains\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n    179 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). An affirmative statement that an entity other than Fillin' Station holds a claim against MS LZ Delta cannot be reasonably construed as sufficiently disclosing Fillin' Station's claim against MS LZ Delta, especially in light of the Fifth Circuit's guidance that \"the importance of th[e] disclosure duty cannot be overemphasized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844432,11662465\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/197/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the filing of this lawsuit against MS LZ Delta is inconsistent with Fillin' Station's prior position in its bankruptcy statement of assets that a sister company held a claim against MS LZ Delta.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Whalen\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-14639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203092289\">\n    2013 WL 3092289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (Bankr. D. Md. June 18, 2013) (denying discharge because debtor's statement that he held \"only a couple of thousand dollars\" in cash-when he held $8,300-did not satisfy \"full disclosure\" requirements demanded in bankruptcy proceedings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Alternatively, Fillin' Station argues that its claim was sufficiently disclosed when Fill It Up filed a motion to employ counsel in its bankruptcy proceedings. This argument also fails because the motion to employ was made by Fill It Up in a separate bankruptcy proceeding-not by Fillin' Station in its bankruptcy proceedings. That Fill It Up, in its motion to employ, named Fillin' Station as the lessee of the restaurant does not establish that Fillin' Station holds a claim against MS LZ Delta. Moreover, Fill It Up's motion to employ was filed in March 2017, and Fillin' Station filed its schedule of assets in June 2017. To the extent Fillin' Station contends that its claim was disclosed in Fill It Up's motion to employ, Fillin' Station surely had knowledge of such claim and, therefore, should have listed it in its schedule of assets filed three months after Fill It Up filed its motion to employ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Similarly, the bankruptcy court's order granting Fill It Up's motion to employ does not disclose Fillin' Station's claim against MS LZ Delta. For a number of reasons, a court order authorizing Fill It Up to retain and employ counsel to represent its interest in this action and \"any other issues related thereto\" cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Fillin' Station had a claim against MS LZ Delta. First, the bankruptcy court order is not a disclosure by a party. Moreover, the bankruptcy court order was entered in Fill It Up's bankruptcy proceeding-not Fillin' Station's. Finally, the bankruptcy court's order granting Fill It Up's motion to employ was entered on April 17, 2017. Doc. # 5-5 at 1. As Fillin' Station contends the order clearly disclosed its claim against MS LZ Delta, surely Fillin' Station should have disclosed its claim against MS LZ Delta in its schedule of assets filed two months after the order was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that, by filing this action, Fillin' Station has taken a position inconsistent with its prior position in its bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prior position accepted by court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its response to MS LZ Delta's motion to dismiss, Fillin' Station does not argue that the second element of the judicial estoppel analysis-that a court accepted a party's prior position-is not met. The Court finds that Fillin' Station's prior position was accepted by a court because Fillin' Station was granted an automatic stay in its bankruptcy proceedings and because the bankruptcy court subsequently entered an agreed order abandoning certain bankruptcy estate property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

Given the timeline here, Fillin' Station clearly had knowledge of the facts giving rise to this action as of the date it filed its July 2017 schedule of assets. Although Fillin' Station argues that Fill It Up's motion to employ counsel in its bankruptcy proceeding suffices as adequate disclosure of its claim against MS LZ Delta, Fill It Up's motion to employ counsel was filed on March 16, 2017, Doc. # 5-4; while Fillin' Station filed its schedule of assets stating that any claim belonged to a sister company in July of 2017, Doc. # 5-6 at 6. Further, Fillin' Station contends that in Fill It Up's motion to employ counsel, \"the nature of the claim was disclosed and Fillin' Station Grill, LLC, Fill It Up, LLC and Steve Beene's relationship to the claim against [MS LZ Delta] herein and its violation of the restrictive covenants were all disclosed.\" Doc. # 14 at 6.

By not disclosing its claim to the bankruptcy court, Fillin' Station's motivation for concealment is self-evident-it stood to gain a potential financial benefit from keeping any recovery on its claim against MS LZ Delta out of the hands of its creditors.

First, any potential recovery awarded to Beene individually would fall outside Fill It Up's or Fillin' Station's bankruptcy proceedings, so invoking the\n   <em>\n    Derouen\n   </em>\n   exception could prejudice Fill It Up or Fillin' Station's creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505031\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/604/1086/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (derivative actions may be treated as direct actions if doing so will \"not materially prejudice the interest of creditors of the corporation\"). Further, the Supreme Court of Mississippi has not extended the\n   <em>\n    Derouen\n   </em>\n   exception to apply outside of intracorporate disputes. Indeed, the Mississippi Supreme Court has questioned whether the\n   <em>\n    Derouen\n   </em>\n   exception applies in circumstances beyond intracorporate disputes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v.

First, in his June 16, 2016, schedule of assets, Beene stated that he had no claims against third parties; thus, his filing of this action is inconsistent with that prior position. Doc. # 5-7 at 5.

Third, Beene's prior position was not inadvertent because as the sole member of Fill It Up and Fillin' Station, he certainly had knowledge of the events that gave rise to this action. And, as discussed above, motive to conceal claims by not disclosing them in bankruptcy proceedings is self-evident. Accordingly, Beene had a motive to conceal his claim against MS LZ Delta because he stood to benefit from keeping any potential recovery against MS LZ Delta beyond the reach of his creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

There is a clear difference between the relevant statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bryant\n   </em>\n   and the statute at issue in this case. Specifically, \u00a7 27-13-27 explicitly provides that a reinstated corporation \"be restored to all rights\" of which it is was deprived while \u00a7 79-29-825 does not include such a statement. Rather, subsection (b) of \u00a7 79-29-825 provides that reinstated LLCs should only be treated as if they had never been dissolved only for liabilities incurred during dissolution. \"Where a statute enumerates and specifies the subject or things upon which it is to operate, it is to be construed as excluding from its effect all those not expressly mentioned or under a general clause, those not of the like kind of classification as those enumerated.\"\n   <em>\n    S.W.
