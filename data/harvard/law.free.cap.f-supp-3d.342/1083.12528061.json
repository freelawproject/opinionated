ECF No. 42-1 at 4-5. IV testified that YAF threatened to kill him quite a bit, beginning in 6th grade, ECF No. 42-1 at 20, and that YAF would call him names every day, including calling him \"fat\", \"faggot\", and \"man boobs.\" ECF No. 42-1 at 15. A fellow student and friend of IV (\"student 1\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that YAF verbally abused IV during the 6th grade, including calling him \"fat,\" \"fag,\" \"gay,\" and \"bitch.\" ECF No. 51-4 at 4-5. Another student and friend of IV (\"student 2\") testified that, beginning in sixth grade, YAF called IV \"pig and stuff like that because he was - he was chubby\" and that YAF would pinch IV's sides where he had extra skin or fat. ECF No. 51-7 at 4. Student 2 testified that this pinching was the only physical abuse in the sixth grade and that this is \"how it all started.\" ECF No. 51-7 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime in sixth grade, student 2 told Taunya Brown, principal at Orchard Middle School, that IV is getting \"bullied\" by YAF. ECF No. 51-7 at 5-6. Ms. Brown told student 2 she \"will see into it.\" ECF No. 51-7 at 6. Student 2 also recalled telling special education assistant Teri Self that IV was getting \"picked on\" (and may have also used the term \"bullied\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 51-7 at 10. According to student 2, Ms. Self spoke with YAF and told him to stop, telling him his conduct \"wasn't cool.\" ECF No. 51-7 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Seventh Grade (2014-15): bullying gets more physical; IV hospitalized\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Student 1 testified the bullying became more physical in the 7th grade: YAF \"[b]arely start[ed] to get physical.... Like punching [IV] once in a while like in the arm or something like that.\" ECF No. 51-4 at 6. Student 2 testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [I]t got a little bit worse in seventh grade.... [YAF] started grabbing [IV's] boobs ... and pinching them. Just pushing him around.

Ms. Self recalled that, sometime during the year, an unidentified student told her that IV was being bullied for his weight and was receiving \"titty twisters\" in the locker room; Ms. Self relayed the report to Ronda Brender, the school counselor at Orchard Middle\n   School. ECF No. 51-6 at 6. Ms. Self was not aware of who the perpetrator was, although she was generally aware that YAF was frequently disciplined for bullying behaviors in classrooms. ECF No. 51-7 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   IV testified that YAF would \"twist [his] nipples\" and kick, punch, trip, and push him. ECF No. 42-1 at 17. IV also testified that YAF extended his efforts to social media, where YAF would post things on Snapchat and other \"apps\" (including calling IV fat and posting demeaning and offensive drawings of IV) and then tell IV to look at the posts. ECF No. 42-1 at 18. He would also send IV texts telling him he was fat and ugly and that he should kill himself. ECF No. 42-1 at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sometime in January 2015, IV was admitted to the hospital as a result of him becoming anorexic. At this time, IV finally told his mother he was being bullied at school. ECF Nos. 41 at 3, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10; 43 at 2, \u00b6 5. IV told his mother he was being called \"fat\", a \"faggot\", and that his nipples are being twisted, but IV did not name the bully because \"he was really scared and he didn't want to be labeled as a snitch and be bullied by others.\" ECF Nos. 41 at 4, \u00b6 13; 42-3 at 6, 9. Soon after, IV's mother informed Ms. Brender that IV was being bullied during physical education class (\"PE\") and in the locker room and that it included someone calling IV \"fat\" and a \"faggot\" and twisting his nipples. ECF Nos. 41 at 3, \u00b6 11; 42-3 at 9. Ms. Brender then contacted the PE teacher (Steve Donaldson) and asked him if he had observed any bullying of IV. ECF Nos. 41 at 4, \u00b6 17; 43 at 2, \u00b6 9. Mr. Donaldson reported that he had not seen any bullying and told Ms. Brender he would keep an eye on IV to look out for IV to make sure he was not being bullied. ECF Nos. 41 at 4, \u00b6 18; 43 at 3, \u00b6 10. IV's schedule was later changed so IV would not attend PE, although the parties dispute why it was changed. ECF Nos. 41 at 4, \u00b6 19; 43 at 3, \u00b6 11; 49 at 4, \u00b6 11. Principal Brown testified that she was aware of the eating disorder, but was not aware it was related to bullying until January of the next year. ECF No. 51-2 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   IV did not return to school that year until June.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF Nos. 41 at 4, \u00b6 20; 43 at 3, \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Eighth Grade (2015-16): IV loses weight; bullying worse; YAF expelled\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Student 1 testified that, in eighth grade, \"[i]t just started getting like a little bit more, like, too, like, extreme.\" ECF No. 51-4 at 7. Student 1 explained: \"Like he kept saying like -- it was almost like almost every single day he kept ... just telling him, like, bad words. And like sometimes, just like, the same thing, like, punching him and stuff or pinching\" IV's nipples. ECF No. 51-4 at 7. According to Student 1, YAF would do \"something physical\" to IV in the classroom almost every other day, and that YAF also targeted IV in the halls and during lunch break. ECF No. 51-4 at 8. Student 1 noted that YAF would \"like start[ ] laughing and stuff like that\" after YAF pinched others (including IV) on the chest. ECF No. 51-4 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Student 2 also testified that in the eighth grade things changed: \"that's when -- well, [IV] came back. He was -- he was\n   different.... He got skinnier.... It affected him more. And then that's when [YAF] was still bullying him. He was called -- well, [YAF] was still calling [IV] the same names and he -- well, he still pushed him around.\" ECF No. 51-7 at 8. Student 2 went \"a few time\" to Ms. Brown's office and told her IV is getting \"bullied\" and that \"[i]t's been over three years and you haven't done anything.\" ECF No. 51-7 at 8. Ms. Brown said she would talk to YAF. ECF No. 51-7 at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IV had not told his mother the bullying continued after his hospitalization-IV's mother would ask IV if he was still getting bullied, but IV would tell her \"no\" and to \"mind [her] own business\", and then IV would \"shut down.\" ECF No. 42-3 at 7. However, on January 3, 2016, ECF No. 42-3 at 7, IV told his mother that he was being bullied still and finally and for the first time told her YAF was the perpetrator. ECF Nos. 42-3 at 3. IV explained that he revealed the identity of YAF because he \"had enough\" after YAF threatened to kill him again. ECF No. 42-1 at 10. Before this, IV had not told anyone else that YAF was bullying him, although his friends were present during such and he talked with them about it. ECF No. 42-1 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IV's mother contacted Ms. Brown and the police on January 4, 2016. ECF No. 41 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. That same day, IV's mother and father met with Ms. Brown at 1:00 in the afternoon. ECF No. 42-3 at 5. A police report documented an incident that occurred that very day between IV and YAF. According to the report, students were playing basketball in the gym during lunch when IV told YAF to stay away because he was mean. ECF No. 51-11 at 2-3. YAF got in IV's face and was yelling \"what's up\" and then told him \"lad[ies] first\" when he let IV leave the gym before him. ECF No. 51-11 at 3. The police report also details how YAF told IV: \"I'm gonna kick your ass\" and \"you're dead bro ... you're dead\" sometime in the hallway. ECF No. 51-11 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 5, 2017, Defendant emergency expelled YAF. ECF No. 41 at 5, \u00b6 25. Defendant transferred YAF to another school after determining YAF's conduct was not a result of a disability and after learning IV obtained an order of protection that precluded YAF from attending Orchard Middle School. ECF No. 41 at 5-6 \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    YAF conduct towards peers and authority; discipline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   YAF did not exclusively target IV. Rather, IV testified that YAF bullied \"a lot of people.\" ECF No. 57-5 at 4-5. IV specifically testified that YAF would bully him and his friends (a group of at least two to three other students) over the course of middle school (6th, 7th, and 8th grade), which only ended after YAF was expelled in January, 2016. ECF No. 42-1 at 5-8. Student 1 testified that YAF bullied \"[p]retty much like all our friends.... He used to like, come in, and, like, just say stuff to us and stuff.\" ECF No. 57-1 at 5. Student 1 recounted personal attacks: \"you know, like, [YAF would say:] 'You're a faggot' and stuff like that [to me]. He used to pinch me too like [IV.]\" ECF No. 57-1 at 6. Student 2 also recounted personal bullying, stating YAF \"did the same thing\" as he did to IV. ECF No. 57-2 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Self testified that she had seen YAF mocking people, making fun of them verbally, and physically moving his body in an inappropriate manner to intimidate people. ECF No. 57-4 at 5. She testified that she\n   would classify YAF as a \"bully. Old-fashioned term: A needler.... Provoker is a good word.\" ECF No. 57-4 at 6. Other testimony shows YAF targeted another student, calling him \"ballsack boy\", ECF No. 57-3 at 5, and also targeted another female student, who he was \"mean to since school started[,]\" telling her she \"looked like a cow\" and a \"potato\" and made faces at her \"like eww get away from me.\" ECF No. 57-6 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   YAF had a long history of inappropriate behavior - toward both his peers and authority - and corresponding discipline.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    School Year 2010-2011\n   </em>\n   : YAF was written up for lying on April 22, 2011; a parent conference was held.

Ms. Strauss opines that YAF \"may not have been using the terms 'gay' or 'faggot' to call [IV's] sexual orientation into question, but rather as a way to demean him for his failure to fit into the 'box of masculinity' \" because IV \"didn't physically appear, to [YAF], to fit into the masculine norm which is a form of gender-based sexual harassment\". ECF No. 50 at \u00b6 5. Ms. Strauss also opines that the bullying IV experienced \"was unquestionably sexually driven\". ECF No. 50 at \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The opinion of Ms. Straus as to YAF's motivation will be excluded.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Straus's opinion is not based on adequate information. Ms. Strauss did not interview YAF and there was no deposition of YAF to review. Ms. Strauss does not identify what YAF's view of masculinity is or provide any support for her belief that YAF has such a view or that YAF targeted IV based on such. Further, although Strauss stressed the need to look at all of the circumstances for determining one's motivation, Strauss testified that she did not know if YAF called every other boy \"gay\" or \"fag\" and that she did not know whether YAF pushed, kicked, or hit other kids in the class. ECF No. 63-1 at 9. This shows she does not consider the full constellation of facts, as is required for the issue at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Strauss failed to set down any principles connecting the data and her conclusion. Rather, it is clear the opinion rests upon her own\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit.\n   </em>\n   This extends to her assumptions about YAF's view of masculinity and assumptions that YAF bullied IV because IV failed to fit YAF's view of masculinity. In other words, Ms. Strauss rests her position based on a mere recitation of some facts, which is far from helpful in aiding the fact-finder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 50 at \u00b6 5.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Strauss's statements, in and of themselves, demonstrate the speculative nature of her opinion. Ms. Strauss opines \"YAF\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   have been using the terms 'gay' or 'faggot' to call [IV's] sexual orientation in to question, but rather as a way to demean him for his failure to fit into the 'box of masculinity'.\" ECF No. 50 at 2-3, \u00b6 5. This ambivalence demonstrates the unreliability of Ms. Strauss's opinion and highlights the speculative nature of her opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Notably, Ms. Strauss often resorted to rhetorical questions in defending her position at her deposition and otherwise relied on unsubstantiated generalizations to reach her conclusion. ECF No. 63-1 at 9. For example, at her deposition, Ms. Strauss was asked how she knew YAF did not believe IV fit the stereotype of masculinity, but she was only able to answer with a rhetorical question: \"Well, why would he be making those comments to him about his, quote, man boobs? ... Have I talked to [YAF] about that? No. But that's how it appears to me.\" ECF No. 63-1 at 9. This shows she has no support for her contention other than it is how it appears to her. Also, when questioned about whether comments\n   about IV having \"man boobs\" referred to him simply being overweight as opposed to not fitting some stereotype of masculinity, she replied: \"I think that if he was overweight, there were other names that he could have called him other than targeting his breasts.\" ECF No. 63-1 at 9. Notably, YAF did call IV other names, such as \"fat\", and Strauss does not deny the slur \"man boobs\" could simply refer to IV's weight at the time. This shows Ms. Strauss is resting on pure speculation, rather than applying reliable principles in reaching her opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Moreover, when asked whether the term \"man boobs\" is something that fits in the definition of sexual harassment, ECF No. 63-1 at 4, Ms. Strauss testified that she does not \"think the motivation matters so much as how it impacts the target.\" ECF No. 63-1 at 7. She later states that motivation \"plays a role\" but she \"think[s] as well, there could be boys -- in this case, [YAF] -- who would target IV and not even be aware of why he's targeting him and making those comments to him.\" ECF No. 63-1 at 7. Given Strauss' misplaced view that (1) one may not even be aware of his/her motivation under Title IX and (2) motivation does not matter as much as how it impacts the target\n   <em>\n    in determining whether YAF's conduct was because of sex\n   </em>\n   , the opinion is beyond reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because the expert opinion (as to the motivation behind YAF's conduct toward IV) is purely speculative, based on inadequate data, and based on an apparently erroneous view of what is required under Title IX, the opinion is not admissible and is not considered in the analysis for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     April Olivares\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant takes issues with several portions of Ms. Olivares' declaration.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Defendant take issue with the Ms. Olivares statement that YAF was at Orchard Middle School on February 1st \"because [IV] saw him ... that day\". ECF No. 59 at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 2, \u00b6 4.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Defendant takes issue with Ms. Olivares' statements regarding Ms. Brender's knowledge or intent: \"She knew that this was an ongoing problem, and is trying to paint it as a single incident.\" ECF No. 59 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 3, \u00b6 9. Defendants are correct that Ms. Olivares does not have personal knowledge with respect to these claims, so the assertions are stricken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 602 (\"A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Defendant argues Ms. Olivares' statements about whether Ms. Brown informed School Resource Officer Miller about YAF bullying IV should be stricken because it does not dispute Ms. Brown's statement that she did, in fact, relay the information to Miller. ECF No. 59 at 9-10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Similarly, Defendant argues Ms. Olivares' statement that she \"was never informed of this conversation and didn't know that the PE teacher was involved at all\" does not create a factual dispute and should be stricken. ECF No. 59 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 4, \u00b6 10. For both of these complaints, Defendant is correct that the statement do not create a genuine dispute as to the underlying assertion, but this is not a valid reason to strike the complained of portions, as they merely relate what Ms. Olivares was aware of, believed, or witnessed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 2-4, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 10 (\"To my knowledge, she did not contact Officer Miller\"; \"he did not mention that any law enforcement had been contacted\"; \"I was never informed of this conversation and didn't know that the PE teacher was involved at all.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   B.\n   <strong>\n    MSJ\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant argues the complained of conduct, while not acceptable, does not give\n   rise to liability under Title IX because Plaintiffs have failed to bring forth competent evidence that YAF bullied IV \"because of sex\".

This suggests Plaintiffs are abandoning their argument that YAF's conduct is actionable as discrimination based on sexual orientation; however, Plaintiffs later argue the actual sexual orientation of the plaintiff is not relevant. ECF No. 47 at 16. Even if Plaintiffs are correct, and even assuming Title IX covers discrimination based on sexual orientation, Plaintiffs would still need to show YAF perceived IV as having another sexual orientation and that the conduct was because of such. However, Plaintiffs have presented no such evidence. Importantly, neither IV nor the other students that were deposed mentioned IV was being picked on because IV was homosexual, or that YAF perceived IV as being homosexual; Plaintiffs did not even depose YAF. Although the language was arguably tinged with sexual connotation, the record demonstrates YAF directed this type of abusive language to a number of his victims as a way to insult them generally. As Defendant's expert, Sherryll Kraizer, PH.D., notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   In my educational experience, working with students in elementary and middle school, there is no question that the terms, \"fag,\" \"faggot,\" \"bitch\" and \"gay\" are ubiquitous. They are used with high frequency by boys too young to initially know that the terms have any sexual connotation and later as a freeflowing\n   insult. While it may have a gender or sexual orientation meaning in some contexts, that interpretation is not consistent with the history of [YAF] generally, or specifically regarding his bullying of [IV].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   ECF No. 58 at 4, \u00b6 10. The Court agrees with Dr. Kraizer's observation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that YAF targeted IV's weight because IV did not fit YAF's view of masculinity, but there is simply no support for this contention. As noted above, Plaintiffs' expert opinion on this point rests merely on conjecture and her own\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   , and so do Plaintiffs in their briefing. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence as to what YAF's perception of masculinity is, or that his conduct was even remotely related to such. None of the testimony even mentions masculinity, and Plaintiffs never made related allegations in their Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs did not even depose YAF and their expert did not interview him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Rather, the evidence demonstrates YAF targeted IV because YAF was a bully, and, as bullies tend to do,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   he targeted a weaker student,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   identified a source of humiliation, and capitalized on it. As Dr. Kraizer explains: \"[b]ullies are very adept at identifying things about a victim that can be exploited and that will embarrass the victim\" and \"one of the most common things a bully will pick on is weight.\" ECF No. 58 at 8, \u00b6 18. This is consistent with the record, which demonstrates YAF bullied many students in the same or similar manner as YAF bullied IV. Moreover, Plaintiffs rely on the presumed connection between being overweight and not falling in line with YAF's view of masculinity, but it is undisputed that YAF continued to bully IV even after IV lost weight (thus falling back in line with what Plaintiffs assume is YAF's view of masculinity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Considering the \"constellation\" of facts, including the context, age, and surrounding events, informed by common sense, the Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden that YAF's conduct was \"because of sex\". Rather, the evidence submitted demonstrates YAF was a bully that targeted many in his class, regardless of gender, alleged sexual orientation (whether actual or perceived), and regardless of whether they were overweight (or otherwise did not conform with YAF's supposed view of masculinity). Although some of the complained of conduct is arguably \"tinged\" with sexual connotation, Plaintiffs have simply failed to demonstrate YAF's conduct was outside of common-place insults used by bullies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 63-1 at 8; 58 at 4, \u00b6 10 (experts recognizing conduct is common in middle school), in their simple quest to demean and subjugate others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Actual knowledge; Deliberate indifference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To maintain his Title IX cause of action, IV must establish that \"an official of the school district who at a minimum has authority to institute corrective measures on the district's behalf has actual notice of, and is deliberately indifferent to, the ... misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gebser v.

The reports that IV was being bullied for his weight, being called \"fat\" and \"faggot\", and receiving \"titty twisters\" is also insufficient because the conduct, although reprehensible, is common-place bullying amongst middle school boys; as such, without more detail, this does not give Defendant notice that the bullying is because of IV's sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At most, Defendant was alerted to intense bullying that\n   <em>\n    could have constituted sexual harassment\n   </em>\n   , but this is not actual knowledge of harassment; nor is it actual knowledge of a significant risk of abuse based on sex given the context where the complained of names are used as a freeflowing insult. Notably, the nub of Plaintiffs' argument is that YAF targeted IV because of IV's (perceived) sexual orientation or failure to fit YAF's view of masculinity, but no one reported IV was being harassed because of his sexual orientation (whether actual or perceived) or his lack of masculinity. Plaintiffs also argue Defendant was put on notice because the school had reprimanded YAF for alleged sexual harassment, but this was directed at female students and does not put Defendant on notice that YAF is sexually harassing boys like IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Moreover, the record shows Defendant acted reasonably in addressing the complaints about YAF. First, the record shows\n   the District reasonably addressed YAF's conduct toward others besides IV, as the District held numerous parent conferences and suspended YAF multiple times for his conduct aimed at others. Second, the record shows the District reasonably addressed YAF's conduct toward IV to the extent they were aware of YAF's conduct. Although early complaints only led to YAF being talked to about the incident, these complaints were only generalized complaints of being picked on and bullied-again, something the Court recognizes is relatively commonplace in middle school. Once IV's mother informed Ms. Brender about bullying, the PE teacher was contacted and asked to watch out for bullying and IV's class schedule was altered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later, when Ms. Brown became aware of more details and YAF's involvement in January, 2016, the District took steps to expel YAF and actually expelled and transferred him to another school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the context, including the age of the parties involved, Defendant's response to the complaints was not \"clearly unreasonable\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendants have demonstrated there is no genuine issue of material fact and that they are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Title IX claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   1.
