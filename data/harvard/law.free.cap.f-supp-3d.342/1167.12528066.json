As for the domicile, residency, and place of business of the parties, this factor weighs in favor of Colorado. Although the parties are domiciled in Maryland (plaintiff), Colorado (Surefire), and Georgia (Arepally), Colorado is both Surefire's place of domicile as well as the state in which Arepally regularly conducts business relevant to the claims asserted in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff argues that \"it is not clear from what location [Arepally] performed the services [for which he received compensation] or if the benefits were conferred to him in Georgia.\" Docket No. 19 at 5.

Docket No. 19 at 11. However, plaintiff's argument that the claim did not accrue until Arepally received payment for the consulting services he provided in connection with the catheter design conflates Arepally's improperly retained \"benefit\" with the profits\n   he received as a result of that benefit.

Plaintiff cites no authority indicating that defendants were obligated to either disclose Arepally's alleged personal liability or engage in discussions to resolve the parties' dispute.
