(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29) After Bytemark disclosed its trade secrets, however, the Xerox Entities cut Bytemark out of the bidding process and used Bytemark's trade secrets and intellectual property to secure a contract with NJ Transit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33) Conduent allegedly has assisted the Xerox Entities in utilizing Bytemark's proprietary technology, and worked together with the Xerox Entities and NJ Transit to sell Bytemark's proprietary technology to prospective customers.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 10-11) Xerox Corp. acquired ACS Transport's parent company - Affiliated Computer Services, LLC - in February 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8) Prior to the acquisition, Xerox Corp. operated primarily as a technology company.

(FAC (Dkt.

Agreements (\"NDAs\") and Teaming Agreements (collectively, \"the Confidentiality Agreements\") with ACS Transport and Xerox Transport for the purpose of developing joint proposals and bids to provide mobile ticketing solutions to clients in the mass transit industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29) The NDAs and Teaming Agreements between Bytemark and ACS Transport identify ACS Transport as \"A Xerox Company,\" and the NDAs between Bytemark and Xerox Transport feature the \"Xerox\" logo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the Confidentiality Agreements, ACS Transport, Xerox Transport, and Bytemark agreed that \"no title, license, intellectual property rights, or any other right of ownership or use shall be granted (expressly, by implication, or by estoppel) to the receiving party under any patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret owned or controlled by the disclosing party by the disclosure of proprietary information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreements, Bytemark disclosed its trade secrets and confidential information to the Xerox Entities on numerous occasions between 2012 and 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31) During this period, Bytemark continued to refine and develop its mobile ticketing technology and systems, as well as the management and support services for its technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32) Bytemark disclosed these improvements to the Xerox Entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Bytemark asserts that after it disclosed its proprietary information to the Xerox Entities, the Xerox Entities cut Bytemark out of a joint bidding effort aimed at NJ Transit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33) The Xerox Entities then \"used and/or disclosed\" Bytemark's patents and trade secrets to bid for, and secure, a contract with NJ Transit without Bytemark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Xerox Entities incorporated Bytemark's proprietary information into their visual validation applications - such as their MyTix mobile application - and then sold this infringing mobile technology to NJ Transit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35) On or about January 2015, Bytemark notified the Xerox Entities and NJ Transit of their infringement and misappropriation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Since its formation in 2017, Conduent has participated in the servicing, maintenance, and continued utilization and implementation of Bytemark's proprietary information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35) Bytemark alleges that Conduent also \"had knowledge\" of the infringement of Bytemark's proprietary technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 52, 66)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At some point after the Xerox Entities sold their infringing mobile technology application\n   to NJ Transit, NJ Transit - \"in collaboration with the Xerox Entities and Conduent[ ]\" - offered to provide the infringing visual validation software to New York Waterway as a part of an integrated transportation contract, under which NJ Transit and New York Waterway would offer integrated bus and ferry services to transportation passengers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 41-42) At all relevant times, NJ Transit knew that Plaintiff's mobile ticketing software was \"proprietary, trade-secret, and patent-protected property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a result of Defendants' actions, New York Waterway declined to extend its existing contract with Bytemark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42) New York Waterway explained that it had received a better offer from Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Bytemark initiated this action, New York Waterway agreed to a temporary short-term extension of its contract with Bytemark.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 44-156) Defendants have moved to dismiss Counts Eight, Nine, and Ten of the First Amended Complaint. (Mot. (Dkt. No. 51) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Count Eight - which alleges a claim of unfair competition under New York law against all Defendants, Plaintiff asserts that \"Defendants' practicing of the claims of the Patents-in-Suit and their unlawful use of Plaintiff's trade secrets in Defendants' applications that also have substantially the same look and feel [as Plaintiff's applications] is likely to cause confusion among consumers as to the origin of the technology.\" (FAC (Dkt. No. 40) \u00b6\u00b6 134-39) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants acted in bad faith by leading Plaintiff to disclose its intellectual property, trade secrets, and other confidential information \"[u]nder the guise of forming a partnership with Plaintiff,\" and then cutting Plaintiff out of the joint bidding effort and using Plaintiff's proprietary information to secure their own contracts, including an integrated transportation contract with New York Waterway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Counts Nine and Ten set forth claims for unjust enrichment under New York and New Jersey law, against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 140-56) Plaintiff alleges that by infringing and misappropriating its patents and trade secrets, Defendants have avoided the significant time and cost of developing their own mobile ticketing platform and have diverted substantial revenues from Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141-43, 149-52) As a result, Defendants have been unjustly enriched at Plaintiff's expense.
