MOORE, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Thomasz Sobolewski is a former employee who worked at Defendants' McDonald's restaurants in Colorado. Plaintiff seeks, on behalf of himself and as class representative, damages against Defendants for alleged meal and rest period violations. Defendants have filed two motions for partial summary judgment seeking resolution of four issues: (1) whether Colorado's Minimum Wage Order grants Plaintiff a private right of action for violations of its meal period and rest period requirements; (2) whether, based on the undisputed facts, Plaintiff's claim for violation of the Wage Order's meal period requirements fail as a matter of law; (3) whether Plaintiff's breach of contract claim must be dismissed for lack of consideration; and (4) whether the statute of limitations provision contained in the Wage Order applies to Plaintiff's claims for meal period and rest period violations. (ECF Nos. 39 and 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court denies in part and grants in part Defendants' first motion for partial summary judgment. (ECF No. 39.) Defendants' second motion for partial summary judgment is denied. (ECF No. 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%208-6-101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Two motions for partial summary judgment are before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Defendants' [First] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (the \"First Motion\") seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's third claim under the Wage Order for meal period and rest period violations. (ECF No. 39 at 2.) The underlying facts supporting Plaintiff's third claim are almost entirely undisputed. Defendants had a policy that required its employees to clock in and out of a computer system for 10-minute rest periods and 30-minute meal periods. (ECF No. 49-1, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) Employees were required to punch in when they arrived for their shift, punch out for their 30-minute unpaid meal periods, and then punch back\n   in to the system when they returned from their 30-minute meal period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 5.) The employees are paid based on the time punches recorded by Defendants' computer system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 6.) The heart of Plaintiff's meal period claim is that Defendants' management was very strict about making sure that employees clocked back into the system no later than 30 minutes after their lunch break started. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 8.) As a result, employees \"often went to the timeclock to clock back in a few minutes before 30 minutes had passed to make sure [they] clocked in no late[r] than the 30 minute deadline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 9.) Stated differently: \"Many employees just waited around the timeclock until exactly 30 minutes had passed so they could clock in exactly on time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 10.) Defendants' First Motion argues that the Wage Order does not provide a private cause of action for Plaintiff's alleged meal period and rest period violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39.) And, even if Plaintiff may maintain a private right of action, no meal period violation has occurred under these undisputed facts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Second Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   (the \"Second Motion\") does not rely on any additional facts. (ECF No. 83.) Instead, the Second Motion seeks resolution of two legal questions: (1) whether Plaintiff has stated a valid breach of contract claim; and (2) assuming that Plaintiff can maintain a private action under the Wage Order, whether the statute of limitations provided in Section 15 the Wage Order applies to such a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Plaintiff opposes the relief sought in both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants first contend that \"the only circumstance in which a person may assert a private cause of action under the Wage Order is where the 'employee is receiving less than the legal minimum wage.' \" (ECF No. 39 at 6.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Plaintiff responds that the meal and rest period violations resulted in him not being paid the minimum wage for all of the hours he worked. (ECF No. 45 at 6.) In other words, Plaintiff's claims fall within the plain language of Section 18's authorization of a private civil action for failure to pay the \"legal minimum wage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Interpretation and application of Colorado's Wage Order is governed by Colorado law.\n   <em>\n    Deherrera v.

Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Plaintiff's claims fall within the plain language of the Wage Order. He claims that he was not paid for meal breaks and rest breaks, but should have been. Had his hours been properly calculated, he would have been entitled to receive minimum wage for the time worked. Stated differently, Plaintiff claims that he is an employee \"receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to such employee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A18\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And Plaintiff has filed this \"civil action [for] the unpaid balance of the full amount of such minimum wage[.]\" Therefore, Plaintiff may maintain a private right of action for the unpaid balance of any minimum wage amounts owed to him by reason of Defendants' alleged meal and rest break violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, Defendants read Section 18 to mean that a private right of action is limited to a scenario where the employer is paying an employee an hourly rate that is less than $10.20 per hour (the minimum wage as of January 1, 2018). In other words, Defendants rewrite the statute to read as follows: \"An employee [being paid an hourly rate that is] less than [$10.20 per hour] is entitled to recover in a civil action....\" But that is not what the text of the statute says. The text provides for a civil action in any circumstance where an employee is \"receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to such employee,\" which encompasses more than Defendants' narrow reading. By way of example, an employer could pay an hourly employee $12.00 per hour (an hourly rate above the required minimum), but not pay that employee for meal and rest breaks that are required to be compensated under the Wage Order. In such a case, the hypothetical employee is ultimately receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to such employee for all hours worked, even though his hourly rate of compensation is more than the minimum set forth by the Wage Order. Such a narrow reading of the Wage Order is not supported, nor is it consistent with its purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third, nothing in Section 18 defines legal minimum wage. One must look to other provisions within the Wage Order to give meaning to when an employee is receiving less than the legal minimum wage applicable to such employee. Section 3 states that employees \"shall be paid not less than $10.20\n   <em>\n    for all hours worked\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A3\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The meal and rest period provisions elaborate on what time must be compensated and included in \"hours worked.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A7\">\n    7 Colo.

Such rest periods shall not be deducted from the employee's wages.\"). Those provisions explain when an employee must be compensated for breaks and what is required of a meal period for it to be an uncompensated period of time. If the Court were to read the statute as Defendants suggest, it would mean that a plaintiff could bring a private civil action under Section 18 to enforce Section 3, but not Sections 7 or 8-even though Section 3, 7, and 8 are related. The Wage Order does not say as much and Defendants offer no explanation for such a disparate result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Defendants offer no caselaw where a court has ascribed to the proposed interpretation of Section 18.

Colo. April 15, 2015) (implicitly finding a private right of action for alleged rest period violations). Accordingly, the Court finds that an employee-plaintiff may bring a private civil action for violations of the Wage Order's meal and rest period regulations. Having found that a private civil action may be asserted, it must now be decided whether such a violation has been established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Meal Period Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants contend that Plaintiff's meal period claims fail as a matter of law. (ECF No. 39 at 8-11.) Plaintiff claims that Defendants violated the Wage Order's requirement that meal periods be at least 30-uninterrupted-minutes or such a meal period is treated as \"on-duty\" and must be paid. (ECF No. 45 at 4.) Because of Defendants' strict policy of not allowing any more than 30 minutes for a meal period, Plaintiff, and others, would often end their meal periods early and wait by the time clock to ensure they did not clock back in late. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants advance three arguments for dismissal of Plaintiff's meal period claims: (1) employees were entitled to a 30-minute meal break and an employee's decision to clock back in a few minutes early to comply with the policy does not violate the Wage Order; (2) under the \"predominant benefit test,\" Plaintiff was not engaged in work activities so the meal periods were bona fide; and (3) employees were paid for all time that was entered into the computer system-even under those circumstances where an employee chose to clock in from lunch a few minutes before his or her 30-minute meal period expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court will again start with the text of the Wage Order. Section 7 governing meal periods states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Employees shall be entitled to an uninterrupted and 'duty free' meal period of at least a thirty minute duration when the scheduled work shift exceeds five consecutive hours of work. The employees must be completely relieved of all duties and permitted to pursue personal activities to qualify as a non-work, uncompensated period of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A7\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the undisputed facts are that employees were required to punch out from their 30-minute unpaid meal periods and punch back in when they returned from their meal periods. (ECF No. 49-1, Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 5.) Management was very strict about making sure that workers clocked in no later than 30 minutes after their lunch started. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 8.) Employees would either return to the timeclock to punch in early or wait around the timeclock until exactly 30 minutes had passed so they could clock back in exactly on time and not violate Defendants' policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these facts, Defendants have not violated the Wage Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, an employee must be completely relieved of all duties for a meal period to qualify as an uncompensated period of time.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A7\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In deciding whether a meal break is \"bona fide\" and, therefore, can be treated as uncompensated time, Defendants urge application of the predominant benefit test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Castaneda v. JBS USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253707\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/1237/#p1253\">\n    819 F.3d 1237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (10th Cir. 2016) (deciding what constitutes a bona fide meal period under the FLSA). Plaintiff proposes application of the completely-relieved-from-duty test suggested in\n   <em>\n    Brennan v. Elmer's Disposal Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"147127\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/510/84/#p88\">\n    510 F.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (9th Cir. 1975). Here, the Wage Order provides the applicable standard (\"completely relieved of all duties\"); Defendants have complied with that standard; and Plaintiff offers no evidence to suggest otherwise. The crux of Plaintiff's meal period claim is that Defendants' strict policy resulted in lost meal period time because Plaintiff could not clock in late because \"[e]ven being a couple of minutes late\n   could result in a reprimand from a manager.\" (ECF No. 39-2, Sobolewski Decl. \u00b6 3.) The Court finds nothing illegal about reprimanding an employee for returning from lunch a couple of minutes late. Moreover, there is no allegation, argument, or evidence to suggest, let alone conclude, that Plaintiff was required to perform any work-related duties on his meal break. Thus, Plaintiff was completely relieved of all duties and Defendants were permitted to treat meal periods as an uncompensated period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the real question becomes whether strict enforcement of a meal policy violates Section 7. In essence, Plaintiff claims that the strict policy of requiring employees to clock back in from lunch on time, and no later, resulted in a \"net meal period\" of less than 30 minutes. The Court again starts with the text of the Wage Order, which entitles employees \"to an uninterrupted and 'duty free' meal period of\n   <strong>\n    at least\n   </strong>\n   a thirty minute duration[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A7\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Section 7 undoubtedly entitles employees to a meal period of at least 30 minutes. But the regulation does not provide additional time to walk, drive, or travel to and from the location an employee chooses for his or her meal break; nor does the regulation allow additional time for the employee to clock in and out for lunch. The Court will not read such a requirement into the regulations. Some portion of a 30-minute meal period will necessarily include time to log out of and back into a time-keeping system, prepare, eat, or purchase a meal, and return to the employee's work station. Although the Court understands the time pressure this places on hourly employees, it is what Colorado law requires-even if the result is a \"net meal period\" of slightly less than 30 minutes. To be clear, there are no facts before the Court to suggest that Defendants are exerting control over an employee during a meal period or requiring the employees to wait by the time clock. And there is no evidence that Plaintiff, or other employees, were not allowed at least 30 minutes-even if the policy was 30 minutes and no more-for their meal period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, an employee's decision to clock in early or wait by the time clock to comply with Defendants' meal break policy cannot be considered a violation of the Wage Order. Based on the facts before the Court in this case, an employee cannot trigger a violation of the Wage Order by deciding to clock in early from lunch. Whether Defendants' policy is to be considered strict, very strict, or extremely strict, the method in which an employee chooses to comply with the policy does not create a violation of the Wage Order. This is not a case where the employer is accused of coercing or ridiculing its employees for taking a meal break. Defendants merely have a meal policy, that policy is enforced, and employees are reprimanded for failing to comply with the policy. Such facts do not amount to a violation of the Wage Order. Therefore, summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendants with respect to Plaintiff's alleged meal break violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's breach of contract claim fails, as a matter of law, because any agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants lacks consideration, which is a necessary element of establishing a contract. (ECF No. 83 at 4-6.) Specifically, any agreement lacks consideration because \"Defendants had a pre-existing legal duty to pay their employee in accordance with federal and state wage and hour laws[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Plaintiff responds that the employment relationship gave rise to a unilateral contract-Defendants offered work and Plaintiff accepted by performing the offered work. (ECF No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   86 at 2.) Plaintiff contends that he can maintain a breach of contract claim because the wage and hour laws are merely incorporated into the terms of the contract. (ECF No. 86 at 2-3.) The Court agrees with Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Parties are presumed to contract with reference to existing principles of law, and in the absence of clear contractual language the relationship is governed by the rules mandated by law.\"\n   <em>\n    Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v.

App. 2001) (\"The existing law at the time and place of the making of the contract ... becomes a part of the contract.\"). Here, Plaintiff had no legal obligation to work for Defendants and Defendants owed no legal obligation to employ Plaintiff. Defendants' offer of employment, along with Plaintiff's promise or performance of such employment, can be consideration that will support the formation of a contract.\n   <em>\n    DeJean v. United Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10378402\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/839/1153/#p1159\">\n    839 P.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1159 (Colo. 1992) (stating that an \"offer of employment would have amounted to adequate consideration for a release of [a group of 570 pilot's] state law claims\" where the pilots argued that airline had a pre-existing obligation to employ them based on pre-employment promises or Colorado statutory labor provisions). The FLSA and Colorado state law merely impose minimum rules on an employer-employee relationship once such a legal relationship is formed. In other words, the FLSA and Wage Order presume the existence of the very employer-employee contract that Plaintiff asserts-and those rules only apply after the employer-employee relationship is formed, whether by contract or otherwise. Moreover, the existence of a contract is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.\n   <em>\n    Jaeco Pump Co. v. Inject-O-Meter Mfg.

Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-4311,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202326577\">\n    2010 WL 2326577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 (D. N.J. June 7, 2010). Therefore, summary judgment as to this issue must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Applicable Statute of Limitations to Wage Order Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the two or three-year statute of limitations contained in Section 15 of the Wage Order applies to Plaintiff's meal and rest period claims brought under the private right of action provision in the Wage Order. (ECF No. 88 at 5-8.) Plaintiff responds that the Wage Order's private right of action section does not contain a specific statute of limitations; therefore, Colorado's general six-year statute of limitations, C.R.S. \u00a7 13-80-103.5(1)(a), should apply to any meal and rest break violations under the Wage Order. (ECF No. 86 at 3-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"[I]t is the nature of the right sued upon and not the nature of the relief demanded which governs the applicability of a statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    McDowell v.

App. 1994). The Supreme Court of Colorado provides the following guidance to decide which one of two arguably applicable statutes of limitation should control: \"(1) a later enacted statute should be applied over an earlier enacted statute; (2) the\n   more specific of two applicable statutes should be applied; and (3) the longer of two applicable statutes should be applied.\"\n   <em>\n    Reg'l Transp.

However, the rule favoring application of the longer, rather than the shorter, of two applicable statutes of limitations is a rule of last resort. \"When conflicting statutes are related to each other as general and specific provisions, however, the General Assembly has specified its own rule of preference or choice, which takes precedence and alleviates any need for resolution by a rule of last resort.\"\n   <em>\n    BP Am.

Filing of Complaints\" to support its argument that Plaintiff's meal and rest period claims are subject to a two or three-year statute of limitations. (ECF No. 83 at 9.) That Section states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Any person may register with the division, a written complaint that alleges a violation of the Minimum Wage Order within two (2) years of said violation(s), except that all actions brought for a willful violation shall be commenced within three (3) years after the cause of action accrues and not after that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Colo.%20Code%20Regs.%20%C2%A7%201103-1%3A15\">\n    7 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1103-1:15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 15 became effective in 2018 and C.R.S. \u00a7 13-80-103.5(1)(a) became effective in 2013. Thus, Section 15 is the later-enacted statute, but that does not answer the question in this case. Section 15 is more specific than C.R.S. \u00a7 13-80-103.5(1)(a). Although, in this case, Section 15's specificity does not help Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The statute of limitations contained in Section 15 only applies to written complaints filed with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment Division of Labor Standards and Statistics (\"the division\"). The first clause of Section 15 (\"Any person may register with the division\") modifies the remaining statutory language, which includes the 2-year and 3-year time limits for written complaints to the division. As a result, based on the plain language of Section 15, the two and three-year provisions in that section do not apply to civil actions brought under Section 18 for the recovery of wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   By contrast, the statute of limitations for FLSA causes of action is contained in Title 29 of the United States Code and is titled, \"\u00a7 255.

Thus, the FLSA's statute of limitations clearly applies to a plaintiff seeking to \"enforce\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   cause of action\" unlike the limited scenario of written complaints filed with the division contained in Colorado's Wage Order. Accordingly, the Court cannot say the two or three-year statute of limitations in Section 15 applies to private rights of actions brought under Section 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Indeed, Section 18 does not state or incorporate any limitations period for private rights of action. The Wage Order does not contain any other limitations provisions. The Court must, therefore, look to Colorado's general statutes of limitation for an answer.

Thus, these claims are neither based in contract nor tort, making inapplicable the general limitations on actions\n   found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-80-101\">\n    Colo.

Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health Servs. Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Colo.%20App.%20286\">\n     38 Colo.App. 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20P.2d%20716\">\n     559 P.2d 716\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 718 (1976).\n    <em>\n     Silverstein\n    </em>\n    involved a statute that imposed only a criminal sanction; accordingly, the\n    <em>\n     Silverstein\n    </em>\n    court would not impose civil liability where the legislature declined to do so.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20P.2d%20716\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20P.2d%20716\">\n     at 718\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Similarly, the applicable factors favor the finding of an implied private cause of action: (1) Plaintiff and the proposed class are within the class of persons intended to be benefited by the Wage Order; (2) the General Assembly intended to create a private right of action for all instances where an employee is receiving less than the legal minimum wage; and (3) an implied right of action is consistent with the purpose of the statute.\n    <em>\n     Colorado Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Menor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8345353\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/166/205/#p210\">\n     166 P.3d 205\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 210 (Colo. App. 2007) (\"When a statute does not expressly provide for a private civil remedy, a court must consider three factors in determining whether a particular plaintiff has available a private cause of action: whether the plaintiff is within a class of persons intended to be benefited by the legislative enactment; whether the legislature intended to create, albeit implicitly, a private right of action; and whether an implied civil remedy would be consistent with the purposes of the legislative scheme.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Plaintiff includes two additional facts in response to Defendants' First Motion. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF 45-1, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12.) Plaintiff cites to Paragraph 3 of his declaration in support of the additional facts. But Paragraph 3 does not provide evidentiary support for either additional fact. Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to provide competent evidence in response to Defendants' First Motion or create a material factual dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In essence, Defendants have moved for judgment on the pleadings, not partial summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
