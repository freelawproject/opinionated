HealthPartners and Essentia have both moved to dismiss the complaint. For the reasons discussed below, the Court grants in part and denies in part HealthPartners' motion and denies Essentia's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Brittany Tovar was a nurse practitioner employed by Defendants Essentia Health and Innovis Health, LLC, d/b/a Essentia Health West (collectively, \"Essentia\"), from September 24, 2010, until July 29, 2016. (Doc. No. 66 (\"Am. Compl.\") \u00b6 16.) As part of her employee benefits, Tovar was provided health insurance through the Essentia Health Employee Medical Plan (the \"Plan\"), which is sponsored by Essentia and administered by Defendants HealthPartners, Inc., and HealthPartners Administrators, Inc. (collectively, \"HealthPartners,\" and collectively with Essentia, \"Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 25.) On October 1, 2014, Tovar's son, Plaintiff Reid Olson, became a beneficiary under the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2014, Olson was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which arises when an individual's gender identity differs from the gender assigned at birth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (\"DSM-5\"), the symptoms of gender dysphoria include \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Medical treatments such as mental health counseling, hormone therapy, and gender reassignment surgery have been shown to relieve the symptoms of gender dysphoria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Health professionals decided that these treatments were necessary to treat Olson's gender\n   dysphoria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Olson's doctor also recommended that Olson begin taking the medications Lupron and Androderm to treat Olson's gender dysphoria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-51, 63-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Tovar and Olson sought coverage for these medical treatments as well as pre-authorization for gender reassignment surgery for Olson through the Plan, but because the Plan at that time categorically excluded coverage of \"[s]ervices and/or surgery for gender reassignment,\" Defendants denied insurance coverage for Olson's treatment and medications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 33-34, 68.) Tovar appealed the Plan's categorical exclusion of gender reassignment treatments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-41.) HealthPartners denied Tovar's appeal, notifying Tovar of its intent to enforce the terms of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tovar incurred out-of-pocket expenses for Androderm, but Plaintiffs decided not to purchase Lupron. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 66.) Defendants later decided to provide coverage for Androderm as a one-time exception and reimbursed Tovar for her out-of-pocket expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) As a result of the denied coverage, Olson and Tovar suffered emotional and financial harm, and Olson suffered delayed access to medically necessary treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Essentia requested that HealthPartners remove the exclusion from the Plan starting on January 1, 2016, and HealthPartners did so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) On July 29, 2016, Tovar's employment with Essentia ended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Tovar and Olson, however, remained covered under the Plan through October 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs have brought identical claims against HealthPartners alleging a violation of Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Section 1557\"). Olson also brings a Section 1557 claim against Essentia. Essentia and HealthPartners separately move to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Finally, numerous courts that have had the occasion to consider the precise question at issue here have held that Section 1557's nondiscrimination requirements encompass gender-identity discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prescott v.

The Court finds the reasoning of the foregoing cases persuasive. Because Title VII, and by extension Title IX, recognize that sex discrimination encompasses gender-identity discrimination, the Court concludes that Section 1557 also prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Tovar's remaining injuries are non-economic and related to her emotional distress.

Here, the Court's conclusion that Section 1557 prohibits discrimination based on gender identity relies solely on the plain, unambiguous language of the statute. The Court does not base its decision on the constitutionality of the DHHS regulation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Franciscan Alliance\n   </em>\n   . The ultimate resolution of\n   <em>\n    Franciscan Alliance\n   </em>\n   and any potential, new proposed DHHS regulation will not affect the resolution of this matter. The Court therefore concludes that Defendants have not met their burden as the moving party in demonstrating a need for a stay and denies Defendants' requests to stay this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on the files, record, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   1.
