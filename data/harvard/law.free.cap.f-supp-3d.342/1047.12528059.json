Procedural and Administrative History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This action was originally filed as a NEPA challenge by Plaintiff WildEarth Guardians (\"WildEarth\") in May 2016. (Doc. 1.) However, in December 2016, the parties moved for a joint stay of the proceedings, pending the Service's decision to undertake the NEPA process and draft an environmental assessment (\"EA\") for the CITES Program. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42.) On February 8, 2017, the Service issued a Draft EA, and, following a public notice and comment period, the Service issued its Final EA and Decision Notice on May 18, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54.) The EA includes four alternatives: (1) a preferred and \"no action\" alternative maintaining the current CITES Program, AR00012-21; (2) a \"no tag\" alternative, under which the Service would not issue or require tagging prior to export, AR00021-23; (3) a \"no permit\" alternative, under which the Service would deny export of CITES Program species from the wild, AR00023-24; and (4) a \"no approved CITES export program\" in which the Service would eliminate its CITES Program but still allow export on a case-by-case basis, AR00024-25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the EA found that the preferred \"no action\" alternative would have no significant impact on the human environment and would best permit the streamlined, efficient review of state and tribal furbearer regimes. AR00011, 12. The Service issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\"). AR00068-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In July 2017, WildEarth filed an amended complaint, updating its NEPA claims in light of the EA and adding claims under the ESA. (Doc. 62.) In 2012, the Service had issued a Biological Opinion under Section 7 of the ESA to evaluate the effect on Canada lynx of bobcat trapping in states and tribal areas approved under the CITES program. AR21057-58, 77-78. The 2012 Opinion renewed, modified, and extended a 2001 Biological Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR21013-33. The Service found that since 2001, the take of lynx attributable to the Program was limited to eight trappings where the lynx were released unharmed. AR21077. The Service determined that the\n   export of bobcat pelts or parts under the CITES Program will not jeopardize the continued existence of the Distinct Population Segment of Canada lynx. AR21078.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The 2012 Biological Opinion incorporated an Incidental Take Statement, which remains in effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under that Statement, \"two (2) lynx may be killed and two (2) injured annually due to trapping over the 10-year term of th[e] biological opinion.\" AR21002. The Statement requires that when issuing bobcat tags, the Service must provide states and tribes with \"information on lynx identification, life-history, recovery needs, and references to current and ongoing methodologies to reduce mortality and injury to lynx when trapping bobcat.\" AR21002-03. The Service implements this measure by preparing a brochure and issuing it to states and tribes. AR21002;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR21034-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In July 2017, Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity filed a separate action, raising similar NEPA challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CV 17-99-M-DWM. The two cases were consolidated, (Doc. 68), and the\n   <em>\n    WildEarth\n   </em>\n   case designated the lead case. All docket references are therefore to documents filed in CV 16-65-M-DWM. Additionally, the Montana Trappers Association, National Trappers Association, and Fur Information Council of America (collectively \"Defendant-Intervenors\") have been granted leave to intervene. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 21, 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties fundamentally disagree about the nature and scope of the Program and environmental review at issue. Both the Service and Defendant-Intervenors argue that the CITES Program is merely an administrative framework that streamlines CITES compliance determinations, AR00003, but does not directly affect either trapping or exports, AR00026, 27. Under their view, the CITES Program \"does not eliminate any federal permitting requirements for exporters, nor does it command changes to state and tribal permitting regimes.\" (Doc. 108 at 9.) The Service therefore insists that the relevant analysis is that of the Program itself, \"not ... subsequent actions taken pursuant to or consistent with the Program,\" such as localized management decisions. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the other hand, \"the crux of Plaintiffs' claim is that the [CITES] Program increases exports, which in turn increases trapping, which in turn harms Plaintiffs' members.\" (Doc. 112 at 8.) According to Plaintiffs, the Service and Defendant-Intervenors \"attempt to relegate the Program to a mere paperwork exercise with no real world effects.\" (Doc. 117 at 9.) They allege that the record shows localized declines and other concerns for CITES species, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SUF, Doc. 97 at \u00b6 58), and that trapping activities increase when state export programs are approved, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 60). Plaintiffs insist the record shows a direct connection between the CITES Program and trapping, as the Service alone controls whether furbearers can be exported,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2023.13\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 23.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and the Program stands in the place of individual determinations for each export permit, AR00003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Both parties are partially correct. The continued administration of the CITES Program does not amount to \"major Federal action\" triggering NEPA. But, the incidental take statement for Canada lynx is remanded to the Service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs claim the Service violated NEPA when it did not adequately analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the Program and when did not prepare an EIS. Plaintiffs further argue that the 2001 and 2012 Biological Opinions and Incidental Take Statement referenced and incorporated in the EA are deficient under the ESA.

While \"tend to fall\" is not exclusive language-indicating that the list is not exhaustive-the list provides context for the type of activity meant to qualify; a mere continuation of current activity is not consistent with the qualities shown by the other listed activities. Rather, the annual review performed by the agency implements the procedural rules outlined in the CITES Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In this same vein, Plaintiffs insist that the Program has undergone significant changes that impact the human environment, warranting NEPA review. But, Plaintiffs fail to identify what the changes were and how they impacted the environment. To the extent Plaintiffs are referring to the 2007 rule update, they have waived any such challenge by failing to bring a timely claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C \u00a7 2401(a) (\"[E]very civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\"). To the extent Plaintiffs refer to the overall number of exports, the record shows that exports have declined in recent years. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 97 at \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The second argument raised by Plaintiffs is that the incidental take statement included as part of the 2001 and 2012 Biological Opinions is tantamount to a permit, which requires NEPA analysis. In\n   <em>\n    Ramsey v. Kantor\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit concluded that an take statement for salmon was \"functionally equivalent to a permit because the activity in question [fishing for salmon] would, for all practical purposes, be prohibited but for the incidental take statement.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649415\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/96/434/#p444\">\n    96 F.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444 (9th Cir. 1996). That is not the case here. It is legal (i.e., not take) to trap bobcats. The take statement at issue, which is discussed below, is for lynx that are accidentally trapped in an attempt to trap bobcat. Unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   where continued fishing would necessarily result in incidental take of protected salmon, one could trap bobcat for a lifetime and never trap a lynx. The take statement does not provide independent grounds for NEPA review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs' final argument is that the CITES Program has never been subject to NEPA analysis. This fact was likely the impetus for the Service to undertake the May 2017 EA in the first place. But the mere absence of previous environmental review does not obviate the threshold requirement of \"major Federal action.\" Because the Service's maintenance of the status quo does not amount to \"major Federal action,\" Plaintiffs' NEPA claims fail. Plaintiffs' other challenges to the EA's finding of no significant impact are therefore moot.\n   <em>\n    Idaho Conserv.

Thus, reasonableness turns on the \"validity\" of the Service's reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   There is no question-and the Service does not dispute-that the provision is poorly worded. Rather than fix it, however, the Service has simply adopted its disjunctive interpretation, placing the Court in the untenable position of having to defer to a reasonable interpretation of an unreasonable statement. While the Service's interpretation of \"two\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   two\" as \"two\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   two\" is reasonable, mere deference is not sufficient to save the statement from its inherent infirmity.

The Service does not address this argument, but Defendant-Intervenors insist this question was also clarified by Fahey's deposition, where she responds in the affirmative when the \"two and two\" cap is described as applying to a \"single year.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR24595. Plaintiffs argue that \"annually\" is modified by \"over the 10-year term\" to mean that take greater than \"two and two\" would have to occur for ten consecutive years for reinitiation to be triggered. Once again, none of the parties\n   dispute what the statement is\n   <em>\n    supposed\n   </em>\n   to mean. But once again, knowing what it should say is not the same as stating it. While this ambiguity is independently insufficient to make the statement arbitrary and capricious, it is yet another straw on the camel's back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge the word \"injury,\" arguing it is difficult to assess and diagnose, AR24288 (Maine 2014 EA), and trapped lynx are usually found by trappers, AR20997 (indicating one lynx was found by one trapper on one occasion). According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]he problem is the Service chose a standard that trappers are not qualified to assess ....\" (Doc. 117 at 34.) Plaintiffs argue that trappers should be required to contact the Service before releasing lynx so that \"adequately trained wildlife biologists\" can respond and \"assess the potential for injuries prior to release.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR24361-62 (the process followed in Maine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In response, the Service argues that there is no hard-and-fast rule for setting a trigger and that the Ninth Circuit has upheld a wide range of different triggers, including proxies that have no actual relation to the number of animals taken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

The Service's response does not address Plaintiffs' concern: defining and assessing injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Fahey's deposition briefly addresses this issue, explaining that \"injury\" was used as a basis for triggering reinitiation because \"it is a more pronounced or egregious form of take as far as the effects of lynx.\" AR24610. Essentially, the Service needs to know if lynx are \"getting injured in higher numbers than ... anticipated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528338\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/893/#p911\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, when asked to define \"injury,\" Fahey stated \"injury is not defined, so I would use the dictionary.\" AR24617. She then explained that a trapped animal that is released without injury would have \"no evidence of broken bones or blood or limping.\" AR24618.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   While the definition of \"injury\" has been cabined by usage throughout the ESA, it lacks precision here. First, the Service concedes it is not explicitly defined in this context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR24617. Second, turning to the dictionary-as the Service recommends-only expands the range of potential injurious conditions. For example, according to\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , while \"injury\" can mean impairing the soundness of health or inflicting material damage, it can also include the mere causing of \"pain, distress, or impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n   , 1164 (Merriam-Webster 1986). And, \"injury\" is defined so broadly that specific synonyms, such as \"damage,\" \"harm,\" or \"hurt,\" are generally preferred to convey the specific type of \"injury\" inflicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528338\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/893/#p911\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These definitions are all reasonable readings of the word \"injury\" within the context of this take statement, but reflect starkly different physical realities for a trapped lynx. For example, injury can mean pain or stress,\n   which trapping undoubtedly causes even when lynx are released with no physical indication of harm. Moreover, while Fahey implies only serious injury qualifies as take in her deposition, AR24610, 24618, serious injury may not always be immediately visible or ascertainable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR24361 (Maine 2014 Incidental Take Plan: \"There are several forms of capture-related injury that are difficult to diagnose in the field and some may take days to develop into recognizable pathology.\"), and even minor injuries can impair post-release survival,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528338\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/893/#p911\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is for these reasons that Maine determined it was appropriate to \"hav[e] a veterinarian assist in develop[ing] and evaluat[ing] a field-based injury rating system, provide training oversight to the [Maine Fish and Wildlife] staff that are involved in injury evaluation, and have veterinarians participate in several incidental lynx capture events.\" AR24362. Moreover, the take statement later uses the term \"severely injured,\" AR21003, raising the question why the statement uses the qualifier \"severely\" if \"injury\" was already limited to serious injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   While the statement has a \"numerical cap,\" \"a numerical cap is only useful insofar as the action agency is capable of quantifying take to determine when the trigger has been met.\"\n   <em>\n    Wild Fish Conserv. v.

While reinitiation of consultation is triggered under the statement if two lynx are killed or two lynx are injured in a single year, that clear numerical cap is undercut by the amorphous definition of injury and those tasked with assessing it. Because \"there are no numeric limits on the number of lynx that can be captured by the traps if the lynx are released unharmed,\"\n   <em>\n    Otter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20539329\">\n    2018 WL 539329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ; AR00061 (\"Lynx caught and released unharmed as a result of bobcat trapping are not counted towards the threshold as detailed in the [Incidental Take Statement].\"), the assessment of \"injury\" is critical to reinitiation of consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The agency's use of the term \"injury\" is both overbroad and underinclusive. The term applies to a wide range of conditions and includes those that are both very obvious yet superficial and those that are latent but deadly. Additionally, this amorphous condition is assessed by untrained trappers, not an experienced Service wildlife biologist whose interpretation would be due deference. The Service's interpretation and use of the term \"injury\" in the context of this case is arbitrary and capricious and not based on the best available science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Plaintiffs argue that because bycatch is not being reported and states are not reporting take,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR24546 (2007 Fahey email: \"The States were supposed to be reporting how much take they had but surprise surprise they haven't been reporting take.\"), the take statement fails to provide a basis for reinitiation. Plaintiffs note that at the time of the 2001 Biological Opinion, only one bycatch was reported in 20 years, AR20999, and only eight instances of reported bycatch occurred between 2001 and 2012, AR21077.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Service argues that it recognized the difficulty in ascertaining lynx bycatch, AR20999-21000, and that underreporting would occur,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR21002 (\"[The Service] anticipates that incidental take of lynx will\n   be difficult to detect because there is little likelihood that trappers would report bycatch of lynx.\"), and therefore included a higher level of take to compensate for this uncertainty,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Luis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p601\">\n    747 F.3d at 626-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that an averaging methodology employed by the Service \"counteracts the uncertainties inherent in its analysis by overestimating known parameters\") (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). And, as Defendant-Intervenors point out, the 2001 Biological Opinion requires local regulatory officials be informed \"within ten working days of the finding of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   trapped lynx or any unanticipated harm to the lynx.\" AR21003 (emphasis added). It therefore appears that while take only applies to dead or injured lynx, AR21002, all trapping of lynx must be reported, AR21003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   But, the disconnect between what is to be reported and what constitutes take is itself a problem because the purpose of reporting is to permit the Service to determine whether reinitiation requirements have been triggered.\n   <em>\n    Wild Fish Conserv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076642\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/513/#p532\">\n    628 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the reporting and take requirements are like two ships passing in the night and the disconnect that can only be remedied by addressing the trigger itself.

Here, the incidental take statement includes one minimization measure: when bobcat tags are issued, the Service must \"provide states and tribes with information on lynx identification, life-history, recovery needs, and references to current and ongoing methodologies to reduce mortality and injury to lynx when trapping bobcat.\" AR21002.

As a counter-example, Plaintiffs point to Maine's management program, which sought \"to improve how injuries are evaluated and managed,\" AR24022, and proposed trap-check interval requirements, AR24542. Defendant-Intervenors argue that the take statement evaluated states' and tribes' current trapping seasons, methodology, and historical bycatch information, AR20992-93, 20996-21001, and determined that the current regulations would not jeopardize the lynx, AR21000. Given this background, Defendant-Intervenors argue the brochure sufficiently minimizes take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Ultimately, the basis for the brochure and its content does not compensate for the fact that states and tribes are not required to give it to trappers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR21003 (\"A letter shall accompany the brochures and tags recommending that the State or Tribe should provide a copy of the brochure to bobcat trappers on a one-time basis and again if brochure is revised.\"), and trappers are not required to read it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Animal Prot.
