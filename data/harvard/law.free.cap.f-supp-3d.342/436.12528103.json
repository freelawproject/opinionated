Among other considerations, the Court will be required to construe the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\") that on its face limit attorney's fees awards in an action brought by a prisoner. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The use of force incident occurred on May 20, 2015, in a unit placed on lockdown because an inmate was believed to be in possession of contraband in the form of a cell phone. The sole plaintiff in the action as originally filed, Colson Jean-Louis, alleged that fifteen John or Jane Doe defendants, members of an Emergency Security Unit, \"sprayed [Jean-Louis] with MK-9 just as they had indiscriminately sprayed other inmates, kicked and stomped him, and dragged him to the hallway outside his cell.\" (Compl. \u00b6 25.) Jean-Louis, the single plaintiff, was not a prisoner at the time the action was filed and was represented by Ryan Lozar, Esq., who maintains a solo law practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   One month and nineteen days after the action was commenced, Lozar attempted to amend the complaint to add eighteen additional plaintiffs and name ten correctional officers as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At or about this time Ilissa Brownstein, Esq. entered a notice of appearance for all plaintiffs. (Doc. 9.) Lozar, in his declaration in support of the attorney's fees application, states that the additional eighteen plaintiffs had been represented by Brownstein and had filed notices of claims with the City. (Declaration of Ryan Lozar (\"Lozar Decl.\") \u00b6 32.) Brownstein endeavored to negotiate a pre-litigation settlement with the City but was unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 33.) Lozar agreed to file an amended complaint with the eighteen additional plaintiffs added. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 34.) Details were included in the amended pleading concerning the physical injuries experienced by each plaintiff (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 49 (Doc. 8) ), and the actions of particular defendants. (\n   <em>\n    E.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 57-62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At a pretrial conference, a case management plan was proposed by the parties and adopted by the Court setting a discovery\n   schedule ending August 18, 2017. (Doc. 41.) Fact discovery was set to close in August 2017. The parties wrote for an extension until December 22, 2017, which the Court granted. (Doc. 47.) The joint letter motion for extension of discovery stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   each one of the nineteen plaintiffs had significant medical records which needed to be collected before they could be meaningfully questioned about the incident at deposition. Although the parties have exchanged significant document discovery, additional time is needed to complete depositions of the nineteen plaintiffs and the eight individually-named defendants. Moreover, because many of the plaintiffs are currently in the custody of New York State and are located at a number of different facilities, the parties require additional time to coordinate the scheduling of plaintiffs' depositions with each facility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Doc. 46.)

The City's offer of judgment included within its scope state law claims against the City of New York and its employees but its offer to pay reasonable fees and costs was expressly limited to the federal claims. (\n   <em>\n    E.g\n   </em>\n   ., Doc 61-1.) There is no fee shifting provision that would entitle a party to recover attorney's fees on its state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

June 30, 2011). The additional or separate work attributable to the state law claims was minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   An allocation of time spent on state claims is appropriate. All state law claims were alleged in a single, five paragraph\n   claim for relief. Brownstein participated in the drafting of notices of claim and in the New York General Municipal Law \u00a7 50(h) examinations and seeks fees for the time incurred. Plaintiffs offer no defense to the specific proposed reduction other than the expression of their view that all work on all claims was inextricably intertwined. The Court disagrees and concludes that the time can easily be segregated. Brownstein's hours will be reduced by 33.7 hours, all incurred prior to joinder in the present action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This Court concludes that the hours spent on the matter by the three attorneys are reasonable and any seeming duplication of effort, unnecessary effort or inadequate descriptions were inconsequential. The following hours were reasonably spent on the federal claim: Lozar, 263.3 hours; Brownstein, 94.3 hours (128 hours less 33.7 hours); and Munar, 50 hours. The hours spent were reasonable even considering the modest size of the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    The PLRA Cap\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The matter of fixing reasonable attorney's fees in this case, however, does not end with a determination of the reasonable rates and reasonable hours spent on federal claims. The PLRA places a cap on the amount of fees that may be recovered in \"any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, in which attorney's fees are authorized under section 1988 of this title....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(d)(1).

It uses no limiting or qualifying language that would make it applicable only to actions initially or originally commenced by a prisoner. The construction urged by plaintiffs would lead to the absurd and peculiar result of allowing avoidance of the cap by locating a single, non-prisoner to commence the action and then amending as of right the next day to add a host of prisoner-plaintiffs.

(Docs. 8 &amp; 9.) The claims of these plaintiffs were simply not asserted, initiated or brought in any action until they joined in the amended pleading. To \"bring\" an action is synonymous with to \"institute\" an action.

When the complaint in this action was amended to assert claims by the thirteen incarcerated plaintiffs, the \"action\" became an \"action brought by a prisoner.\" This conclusion is supported by Rule 20(a)(1), Fed. R. Civ.

A reasoned allocation between work on the non-prisoners' claims and the prisoners' claims is possible on the record before this Court. Courts routinely are required to allocate fees or make fee reductions on a percentage basis for a host of disparate reasons.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kirsch v.

Reviewing the time spent by Lozar, the Court concludes that none of his time from December 11, 2015, when he first met with Jean-Louis, up to August 17, 2016, when he was first contacted by Brownstein about her clients joining the action, is subject to the cap. After August 17, 2016, a substantial portion of the time spent by Lozar in pursuing Jean-Louis's\n   claim, including identifying and serving defendants, obtaining and reviewing documents and generally preparing the case, would have been necessary if the case had remained a claim by a single non-prisoner. The Court concludes that it is reasonable to allocate 20% of his time after August 17, 2016 to the work on behalf of the thirteen incarcerated plaintiffs and hence subject to the cap. But none of his time before August 17, 2016, and 80% of his time after August 17, 2016, is not subject to the PLRA cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ilissa Brownstein represented eighteen individuals (thirteen of whom were incarcerated) who would eventually join the action commenced by Jean-Louis. When her pre-litigation efforts to settle their cases failed, her eighteen clients joined the existing action as plaintiffs. All work by Brownstein up to the August 21, 2016 attempted filing of the First Amended Complaint (less the 33.7 hours spent on the state law claims) will be subject to a reasonable allocation on the basis that 13/18ths is subject to the cap and 5/18ths of the time is not subject to the cap. After her clients joined in the federal complaint and she filed a notice of appearance for all plaintiffs, Brownstein acquired a nineteenth client, Jean-Louis. From August 21, 2016, to conclusion, Brownstein's efforts also benefitted him and therefore 13/19ths will be subject to the cap and 6/19ths of her time will not be subject to the cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Juliene Drei Munar first appeared in the action on August 10, 2017, and her work benefited all nineteen plaintiffs. Munar's time is reasonably allocated with 13/19ths subject to the cap and 6/19ths not subject to the cap. For all attorneys, time subject to the PLRA fee cap will be billed at an hourly rate no greater than $198, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(d)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    PLRA Allocation of a Portion of Fees to the Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The PLRA requires a Court to allocate some portion of the fee award to the judgment recovered but not to exceed 25%. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(d)(2).

In the case of the thirteen prisoner-plaintiffs, the Court views an allocation of 10% of the amount of the offered judgment to be reasonable because any greater allocation would seriously undermine the intended compensatory purpose of the award and any lesser allocation would undermine the purpose of the PLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Costs and Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The sole ground asserted by defendants for challenging the modest $2,633.34 of costs and expenses sought in this action is a claimed lack of adequate documentation.
