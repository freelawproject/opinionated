(\"Foundation\") develops, manufactures, and sells diagnostic tests that identify genomic mutations associated with cancer. Doc. No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 15. During the Class Period, Foundation offered two flagship products: FoundationOne, launched in June 2012, which detects genomic alterations in solid tumors, and FoundationOne Heme, launched in December 2013, which detects genomic alterations for patients with hematologic cancers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31-32. When the tests, which the company described as \"the first commercially available comprehensive molecular information products for analysis of routine cancer specimens in a clinical setting,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2, were launched, government insurance programs such as Medicare did not cover Foundation's tests, and private insurance only covered the tests to a limited extent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the Class Period, individual Defendants, who served as Foundation officers and directors, made various statements about the company's performance in press releases, public filings, and earnings calls. Throughout 2014, Foundation reported steadily increasing revenue and clinical test volumes. Foundation cited \"the value that ordering physicians see in our approach\" and \"strong sales and volume increases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Defendants explained throughout 2014 that Foundation's sales trajectory involved initial uptake \"from the major academic medical centers, the key opinion leaders\" and a subsequent \"migrat[ion] [of the tests] into the community setting\" after the testing \"became a little bit more well known\" and \"started to leak out into the community, often in a regional way around [the] leading academic medical centers[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, despite Foundation's positive statements to investors throughout 2014, community-based physicians were not adopting Foundation's tests to the extent anticipated. Foundation suffered from \"competitive noise\" from single-marker and hotspot diagnostic tests as well as from new entrants to the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Physicians were opting for single-market\n   and hotspot tests that were less expensive and covered by both Medicare and private payors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. Additionally, physicians found Foundation's tests to be of limited utility, because few of the genes that the tests identified corresponded to a drug treatment and because the physicians lacked knowledge of how to interpret how to interpret the tests' results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. In February 2014, Foundation ceased its prior practice of reporting the specific number of physicians that ordered its tests, claiming to analysts on the earnings call that it \"elected not to continue to just state ... the number of overall physicians ordering the tests\" because Foundation continued to \"refine the metrics that we will give the investor community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite these issues, in February 2015, reporting a number of tests performed in 2014 that was at the high end of Foundation's forecasted range,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48, Pellini stated in a press release that growth rates for fourth quarter 2014 \"highlight[ed] the broad adoption of our comprehensive genomic profiling approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 191. The press release announced guidance for 2015, anticipating between 43,000 and 47,000 clinical tests and revenue between $105 and $115 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On a February 24, 2015, call discussing the 2014 results, Defendant Pellini made positive statements about the likelihood of obtaining Medicare reimbursement, stating that \"we continue to believe it is a matter of when.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But beginning in May 2015, Foundation made a series of disclosures that tempered analysts' and investors' outlook. On May 11, 2015, Foundation announced a first quarter of 2015 clinical test volume of 7,854 tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. On the earnings call, Defendants said the test volume was due to \"increased confusion in the marketplace,\" making it \"difficult for some oncologists and pathologists to differentiate today between the various tumor profiling assays and to determine which test is most appropriate for a particular patient.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83. Defendant Daly cited \"bold and misleading marketing statements from companies\" that claimed to rival Foundation's tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 214. Pellini pointed to new market entrants in next-generation sequencing-based testing and liquid biopsy-based testing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 215. Daly noted the importance of the reorder rate among community-based physicians and Foundation's focus \"on ensuring the actionability of the results that we provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 218.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the same call, Foundation also acknowledged a \"slight decrease\" in the average reimbursement per clinical test to $3,400.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Ryan explained that \"[s]ome level of volatility in this number is to be expected before we gain broader reimbursement coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212. Foundation cited a January 23, 2015, draft local coverage determination issued by Palmetto GBA, LLC (\"Palmetto\") as grounds for optimism.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Palmetto, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (\"MAC\") based in South Carolina, had issued a draft determination for \"comprehensive genomic profiling\" for non-smoker patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer and who had already tested negative for certain genomic mutations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Because Palmetto enjoyed a reputation as having a leading role in molecular diagnostics coverage and reimbursement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74, Foundation called its determination \"an important step.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Moreover, Foundation maintained its 2015 guidance of expected revenue of between $105 and $115 million and expected clinical market tests (excluding those ordered by Foundation's biopharmaceutical partners) of between 43,000 and 47,000 tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. The following day, May 12, 2015, Foundation's stock price fell by 9.8 percent, or $4.33, to $39.66 per share, on unusually heavy volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86, 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 29, 2015, Foundation reported financial results for the second quarter of 2015, including 8,846 clinical tests, short of analysts' forecast of 9,770 tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Foundation cited \"slower than anticipated progress towards obtaining a local coverage determination from [NGS] and by some competitive noise in the market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon this report, Foundation announced a material downward adjustment of its 2015 guidance, to between $85 million and $95 million in revenue and between 35,000 and 38,000 tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the earnings call, Defendants told investors that Foundation was not seeing \"the commonly observed carryover effect from [the Palmetto draft determination] that we would typically expect to see in the field,\" while also noting that \"there was no direct precedent for this approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. Pellini informed investors that its prior 2015 guidance for clinical volume testing assumed having a local coverage determination for a portion of Medicare cases in place and that Foundation was \"no longer assuming any Medicare payment for the rest of 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ryan noted that the \"changes to guidance are driven by a shift in our assumptions around the timing of Medicare payments, the associated effect that a [local coverage determination] can have on non-Medicare volumes, and some of that competitive noise [in] the marketplace related to hotspot-based testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. Following these announcements, Foundation's stock price fell by 24 percent on June 30, 2015 (by $7.00, to $22.30 per share) and another nine percent on July 31, 2015 (by $2.00, to $20.20 per share), on abnormally high trading volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 240. Foundation's August 7, 2015 filing of Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2015 listed the company's previously-announced financial results and clinical test volume numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 241-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 3, 2015, the last day of the Class Period, Foundation reported disappointing revenue and a clinical test volume of only 8,102 tests for the third quarter of 2015. Defendants attributed this third straight quarter of missed estimates to a slowdown in reorder rates, sparing use of Foundation's tests by oncologists, and difficulty in harnessing the test results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. As a result, Foundation again downwardly adjusted its 2015 testing volume guidance to between 32,000 and 33,000 tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the earnings call, Defendant Ryan reported that the average reimbursement per clinical test recognized in revenue fell from $3,400 to $3,200.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 253. After these announcements, Foundation's share price fell by 28 percent (by $6.62, to $17.31) on unusually heavy volume.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 96, 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's Amended Complaint enumerates numerous statements and omissions during the Class Period that Plaintiff alleges were materially false and misleading. The alleged misrepresentations generally include positive and encouraging statements about Foundation's tests, statements about Foundation's competitive advantage and growth prospects, and statements about anticipated Medicare coverage and reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. The alleged omissions generally include the extent of competitive pressures that negatively affected test volumes and the lack of clinical utility of the tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Separately, Plaintiff alleges omissions in violation of Item 303 of Regulation S-K,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20229.303\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Item 303\"), which requires the disclosure of all \"known trends ... that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material ... unfavorable impact on ... revenues.\" Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to disclose, in Foundation's SEC filings during the Class Period, the rejection by community-based oncologists of Foundation's tests, the competition from academic medical centers and other diagnostic tests, the\n   unwillingness by clinicians to order Foundation's tests without secured reimbursement, and Foundation's inability to obtain reimbursement for more than just one of the six clinical indications for which it was sought. Doc.

Plaintiff cites several facts that he claims collectively support a strong inference of scienter: Defendants' positions within Foundation, the importance of the tests to the company's commercial viability, Defendants' various statements about the company's performance, and Defendants' sales of Foundation common stock. Doc. No. 19 \u00b6\u00b6 281-294. Plaintiff's essential allegation is that Defendants misled them by creating a misleading picture of demand for Foundation's tests and the company's revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As to Foundation's revenue during the Class Period, Plaintiff does not allege that any of the financial or operational data Foundation released during the period was inaccurate.

Further, filings also disclosed the number of tests \"reported in prior\" periods but for which revenue was received in the current period,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , giving investors all of the figures necessary to determine how many tests the company received revenue for in a given period, and, by proxy, the number of tests to which the average revenue figure referred. An investor could also simply divide the total revenue by the average revenue to determine that figure. Because the figures disclosed make clear that the number of tests performed contained a significant number of tests for which revenue was not received in the period, this claim does not give rise to a strong inference that Defendants intended to withhold information or had fraudulent intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fire &amp; Police Pension Ass'n of Colo. v. Abiomed, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051978\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/778/228/#p244\">\n    778 F.3d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244 (1st Cir. 2015) (defendants' informative disclosures \"undercut any inference of scienter\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff also claims that Defendants misled investors by providing figures on the number of tests performed without disclosing that many of those tests were performed at significant discounts. Doc. No. 19 \u00b6 53. This claim appears to suggest that the figures Defendants released misleadingly concealed the fact that revenue per test performed would inevitably be lower in future periods because of discounts promised in previous periods. But Plaintiff alleges no specific facts regarding discounting, instead providing only a blanket claim that Foundation was offering significant discounts. He also does not allege that Defendants ever released inaccurate information about company revenue or the number of tests it reported, nor does he specify any time at which revenue per test reported ever actually fell because of Foundation's discounting practices. Without more specific facts showing that Foundation's discounting amounted to fraud, this claim also fails to give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Reimbursement Eligibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants' claims about Foundation's progress toward achieving reimbursement eligibility, particularly from Medicare, were inaccurate. To the contrary, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant admitted that \"there was no direct precedent for reimbursement of its tests by government and private commercial payors,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67, and reported accurately on the steps Foundation took to secure such reimbursement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68-73. Plaintiff also acknowledges Defendants' statements highlighting the inherent uncertainty in the Medicare approval process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196. As a result, investors were not misled into believing that Medicare coverage for Foundation's tests was a certainty, much less that such coverage would begin by a certain date. In the absence of a specific statement that was inaccurate or misleading, Defendants' public conduct with respect to Medicare reimbursement is insufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that Defendants must have known at the time they claimed that Foundation would receive Medicare coverage for its tests during 2015 that such coverage was \"virtually impossible\" because of the Medicare program's internal processes for adopting new coverage standards, which Plaintiffs claim for the first time in their opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss include certain waiting periods before new coverage takes effect. Doc. No. 33 at 25. As a result, Plaintiff argues, Defendant's statements in February and May 2015 projecting Foundation's 2015 revenue were misleading at the time they were made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, Plaintiff points to no indication that Defendants were aware of these rules at the time of their statements, and such knowledge would be essential to a strong inference of scienter. Plaintiff also offers facts insufficient to establish that Defendants' July 29, 2015, reduction in revenue guidance was substantially the result of the timing of the possibility of Medicare reimbursements. Rather, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendants called Medicare reimbursement only \"one substantive piece of the change in the revenue guidance,\" Doc. No. 19 \u00b6 237, and that the earlier revenue guidance had included the possibility of only a \"local coverage determination ... for a portion of Medicare cases,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230, not a national determination that could have affected all of Foundation's Medicare cases. These facts undercut Plaintiff's suggestion that Defendants' earlier statements of higher revenue guidance were misleading when made because they were entirely dependent on Medicare reimbursement timing that Defendants knew was impossible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, even taking Plaintiff's account of the Medicare program rules as true, its conclusion that reimbursements in the first half of 2015 were an absolute impossibility is incorrect. Plaintiff reasons that Foundation would not have received Medicare reimbursement for about five months after its regional MAC adopted a local coverage determination for Foundation's products: first, a 90-day waiting period before the determination would become effective, and then approximately two months before claims would actually be paid under the determination. Doc. No. 33 at 25. But Foundation had been submitting claims for Medicare reimbursement at least as early as February 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114. As Defendants explain in reply, Foundation could have received payments for tests performed and submitted for reimbursement in earlier periods as soon as coverage became effective, making the actual delay only 90 days, not five months. Doc. No. 37 at 23. As a result, had Foundation's MAC announced a coverage determination in the first quarter of 2015, reimbursement could have begun within the first half of the year. If Defendants' revenue projections did include Medicare reimbursement the first half of 2015, such an optimistic assumption does not, therefore, necessarily support a strong inference of scienter. In any event, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts regarding the significance of Medicare reimbursement to the revenue projections or the related facts regarding possible Medicare reimbursement at the time of the relevant alleged statements to support a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Stock Sales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Defendants' sales of stock, as outlined in the Amended Complaint, also fail to support a strong inference of scienter. \"[A]llegations of unusual insider trading ... can support a strong inference of scienter,\" but \"mere pleading of insider trading, without regard to either context or the strength of the inferences to be drawn, is not enough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Greebel v.

Plaintiff fails to allege that the trades that he identifies by certain of the individual Defendants were unusual. In fact, the Amended Complaint only points to the fact that Defendants made the sales during the Class Period. Doc. No. 19 \u00b6 293. It does not indicate how the sales were unusual, either on their own or as compared to Defendants' trading outside the Class Period. Nor does it allege that the timing or amounts of Defendants' sales indicate knowledge of artificially inflated prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lenartz v. Am.

Accordingly, the bare facts alleged in the Amended Complaint about Defendants' trading do not permit a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff's opposition, Doc. No. 33 at 27, points to the Amended Complaint's allegation that a large share of Defendants' sales occurred in the early days of March 2015, Doc. No. 19 \u00b6 293, shortly after Palmetto had issued its draft local coverage determination,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73, and after Defendants discussed the draft determination in its February 24, 2015, conference call held in conjunction with Foundation's quarterly results announcement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 192. Plaintiffs argue that \"[t]he fact that three separate executives all sold significant positions on or about the same day ... is highly unusual and suspicious,\" particularly because of the sales' proximity to the draft determination. Doc. No. 33 at 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But allegations about insider trading must \"give rise to inferences that are at least as strong as any competing inferences regarding scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Pub.

At the time of the early March sales, Foundation had just received positive news from Palmetto. Further, on February 2, 2015, shortly before Defendants' stock sales in early March, Roche Holdings, Inc. had commenced a tender offer to purchase 18,758,256 shares of Foundation stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Foundation Medicine, Inc., Amendment No. 7 to Schedule TO (Form SC TO-T/A) (Apr. 14, 2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tender offer, which was oversubscribed, resulted in Roche's ownership of 57 percent of Foundation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049909\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/75/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The price of Foundation stock also increased dramatically from late 2014 to the first months of 2015.
