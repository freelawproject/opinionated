Defendant is instead disputing whether the photographs that are the subject of this lawsuit are actually included in the registration. Accordingly, the cases Plaintiff cites as to Defendant's burden to rebut the validity of a copyright registration (Pltf. Reply (Dkt.

As here, the photograph at issue was part of a group registration of 25 photographs - the \"059 Registration\" - and defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiff \"cannot demonstrate using admissible evidence that he had a valid copyright.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. At summary judgment, plaintiff offered two pieces of evidence to \"prov[e] that his photograph [was] part of the 059 Registration: (1) his sworn declaration stating that he 'caused a copy of the Subject Photograph to be deposited with the U.S. Copyright Office as part of [his] application bearing service request # 1-3653740711, dated June 16, 2016,' ... and (2) a copy of the copyright registration application that [he] sent to the U.S. Copyright Office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted). The court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [e]ven assuming that this evidence would be sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment on the issue of possession of a valid copyright, it was not\n   produced during discovery, and the Court concludes that it is appropriate in this case to prevent the Plaintiff from supplementing the factual record on this motion for summary judgment with information and material that was withheld during the course of discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turning to the four\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   factors, the court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [Plaintiff] has provided no justification for his failure to produce documents in his possession regarding the copyright registration except to state that Defendants also could have \"obtain[ed] certified copies of deposits from the U.S. Copyright Office.\" However, Plaintiff represented that he had these documents in his possession, Defendants requested the documents early in the discovery process, and the Plaintiff told the Defendants that he would produce the documents to them. Defendants were entitled to rely on his representations and not seek their own certified copy of those same documents. In addition, the Plaintiff failed to produce any discovery during the months-long discovery process without seeking an extension of the deadline or even informing Defendants that other testimony or documents would be forthcoming. Indeed, the Plaintiff was put on clear notice at the post-discovery conference that late efforts to produce discovery would not be tolerated. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff's effort to rely on unproduced evidence came after that warning. As a result, although the Court recognizes that the excluded evidence is plainly important, it would be awarding gamesmanship and a failure to follow the rules if the Court allowed the evidence into the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court further concluded that defendants would be prejudiced if plaintiff was permitted to use at summary judgment materials that he had not produced in discovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants filed for summary judgment specifically because the Plaintiff had never provided testimony or documentation proving that the photograph at issue was protected by a copyright. It would thus be highly prejudicial to Defendants to allow the Plaintiff to supplement the record with dispositive evidence after the motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed. Allowing the Plaintiff to put his testimony or his registration application into the record now would require discovery to be reopened because it would require Defendants to conduct further discovery, including potentially depositions, and to adopt a very different litigation strategy. Reopening discovery would thus delay this litigation and incur additional expenses by the parties that are difficult to quantify. Finally, although a trial date has not yet been set, and thus the fourth factor does not weigh heavily against the Plaintiff, the bell cannot be unrung with regard to the time and money devoted by the parties to summary judgment based on the evidentiary record as developed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The same principles addressed in\n   <em>\n    Mantel\n   </em>\n   support preclusion here. As to the first\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   factor, Plaintiff has offered no explanation for his failure to produce copyright application-related materials during discovery. Plaintiff's argument that Defendant could have obtained copies from the Copyright Office does not address why Plaintiff did not produce the requested materials during discovery. Defendant asked for all documents related to the copyright application both in its request for production and at Plaintiff's deposition, and Plaintiff represented that he did not\n   have a copy of what was submitted to the Copyright Office. The Court concludes that this factor favors preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As to the second\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   factor - the importance of the evidence at issue - the evidence is admittedly critical to this case.

(Dkt. Nos. 45 &amp; 46) Plaintiff states that \"[d]ue to an unfortunate and inadvertent office error, Plaintiff did not file his [Rule 56.1 Counterstatement] at the time his Opposition brief was due.\" Plaintiff requests that the Court consider his Rule 56.1 Counterstatement even though it was filed approximately one month late. (Nov. 22, 2017 Pltf. Ltr. (Dkt. No. 45) at 1) Defendant states that \"Plaintiff's suggestion that he merely failed to file this document borders on sanctionable, as this document not only was not filed it\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      never was served\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    and likely was not even drafted until the significance of Plaintiff's failure was made clear at a settlement conference just the other day.\" (Nov. 25, 2017 Def. Ltr. (Dkt. No. 46) at 1 (emphasis in original) ) Defendant further notes that, in many instances, \"Plaintiff's statement does not identify countervailing evidence, but only [provides] arguments without citation to any evidence of record.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 2) Moreover, Plaintiff does not contest the majority of Defendant's factual assertions.
