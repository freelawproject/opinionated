(\"PocketSonics\"), Analogic Corporation, Analogic Limited (collectively, \"Analogic\"), Jeff Pompeo, Travis Blalock, Farley Peechatka, and Ronald Rios. The defendants previously moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that Tolle's claims are barred by a Bonus &amp; General Release Agreement (\"Release Agreement\") that Tolle signed in consideration for certain bonus and severance payments, and that Tolle had not sufficiently stated a claim against Blalock, Peechatka, or Rios. In response, Tolle conceded that Blalock and Peechatka are not subject to individual liability under USERRA. However, he opposed the defendants' motion in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 5, 2018, the court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting in part and denying in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. Although the court found the Release Agreement to be clear and unambiguous, the court did not believe that the record had been sufficiently developed to determine whether the Release Agreement provided benefits that were greater than those that Tolle gave up in signing the agreement, rendering it enforceable under \u00a7 4302 of USERRA. In particular, the court found that \"limited discovery into a comparison of benefits, including whether the other employees received severance agreements, [was] necessary.\" Mar. 5, 2018 Mem. Op. 6, Dkt. No. 24. Because a ruling on the enforceability of the Release Agreement could be dispositive of Tolle's claims, the court declined to decide whether Tolle stated a plausible claim against Rios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have completed the limited discovery permitted by the court. The defendants have since filed a renewed motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative,\n   for summary judgment. The court held a hearing on the motion via teleconference on August 28, 2018. The motion has been fully briefed and is now ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tolle is a veteran of the United States Navy Reserve.

But as plaintiff contends, he was arguably entitled to the opportunity to transfer, either because that opportunity was offered to other employees not deployed for military service or by virtue of USERRA's 'escalator' principle.

Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vahey\n   </em>\n   , Tolle argues that the defendants' motion must be denied because they have \"failed to show, as a matter of law and/or based on undisputed material facts, that [he] subjectively believed that the benefits of the [Release Agreement] were more beneficial than his USERRA rights.\" Pl.'s Br. in Opp'n 3, Dkt. No. 52. The defendants, on the other hand, maintain that \"a 'subjective belief' standard is not required in assessing the validity of a USERRA waiver,\" and that the record conclusively establishes that \"the benefits plaintiff received were more beneficial, or in addition to, his USERRA rights.\" Defs.' Reply Br. 2, 5, Dkt. No. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Both sides have advanced strong arguments in favor of their respective positions on whether a \"subjective belief\" standard should be applied. In the court's view, a veteran's subjective understanding or motivation is one of several factors that may bear on the determination of whether a release agreement resulted in a situation more beneficial to a veteran than his USERRA rights. The court believes that other potentially relevant factors include the particular terms of the agreement, the extent to which the veteran was involved in negotiating the agreement, whether the veteran obtained the advice of counsel, and a comparison of how the employer treated similarly-situated non-veteran employees. Ultimately, however, the resolution of the\n   instant motion does not turn on whether Tolle subjectively believed that the rights provided in the Release Agreement were more beneficial than his USERRA rights. Even assuming that Tolle's subjective state of mind is immaterial or irrelevant to the analysis under \u00a7 4302, the court concludes, for the following reasons, that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment based on the Release Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the terms of the Release Agreement, when viewed in Tolle's favor, do not compel the conclusion that the agreement provided rights that were more beneficial to Tolle than his USERRA rights. Under USERRA, Tolle had the right not to be denied \"employment\" or \"any benefit of employment\" on the basis of his military service.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). By executing the Release Agreement, Tolle agreed to receive payments totaling $29,000, in exchange for releasing the defendants from \"any and all claims ... up through the date of [his] execution,\" including claims relating to his employment with PocketSonics and the termination of such employment. Release Agreement \u00b6 2. The court previously found such broad language to be sufficiently clear to waive Tolle's USERRA rights. However, neither this language, nor the language describing Tolle's payments as \"valuable consideration,\" conclusively establishes that the Release Agreement passes muster under \u00a7 4302.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Judge Martin observed in\n   <em>\n    Wysocki\n   </em>\n   , \"[j]ust because (1) a waiver clearly declares an intent to waive USERRA rights and (2) the veteran received substantial consideration does not permit the inference that the consideration was more beneficial to the veteran than his USERRA rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Wysocki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684320\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1102/#p1108\">\n    607 F.3d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Martin, J., concurring). \"Stated differently, the face of the Release does not allow for a conclusion of enforceability,\" and, at most, \"satisfied [the defendants'] initial burden of production in asserting the Release.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684320\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1102/#p1108\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For this very reason, the court found that limited discovery was necessary in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, unlike\n   <em>\n    Wysocki\n   </em>\n   , the record in this case includes additional evidence that would suggest that the money Tolle received for signing the Release Agreement was less beneficial than his USERRA rights, namely the evidence of how Tolle was treated in comparison to his non-veteran coworkers. It is undisputed that Tolle was the only PocketSonics employee who was not offered regular employment with Analogic, and that all of his non-veteran coworkers received compensation packages that included a sizeable base salary, bonus opportunities, paid vacation time, and other employee benefits. Likewise, the evidence produced during discovery, when viewed in Tolle's favor, indicates that his bonus/severance payments were significantly lower than the bonus payments made to similarly-situated, non-veteran employees of PocketSonics. Although the defendants correctly note that USERRA does not require \"identical\" treatment of veteran and non-veteran employees, Defs.' Br. in Supp. 11-12, Dkt. No. 45, an employee cannot be denied employment or employment benefits on the basis of his military service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That is precisely what is alleged here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 97.

Defs.' Br. in Supp. 3. For instance, in their brief in support of the pending motion, the defendants emphasize that \"[n]o other PocketSonics employee was offered 'severance' in connection with the merger with Analogic,\" and that certain\n   other employees instead received an FDA bonus that was contingent on the submission of the Sonic Window to the FDA for clearance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204311\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants' arguments in this regard do not carry the day on summary judgment. As emphasized above, Tolle received thousands of dollars less than non-veteran coworkers at PocketSonics and no offer of full-time regular employment from Analogic. Thus, while Tolle's severance package was clearly \"different,\" the court cannot say, as a matter of law, that it was more beneficial to Tolle than his USERRA rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the court is unable to conclude that Tolle's \"receipt of $29,000 was, by definition, ... 'in addition to' his USERRA rights,\" thereby rendering the Release Agreement enforceable under \u00a7 4302(a). Defs.' Br. in Supp. 2. This is not a case in which a policy or agreement plainly offered additional rights beyond those provided under USERRA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.7\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (\"For example, although USERRA does not require an employer to pay an employee for time away from work performing service, an employer policy, plan, or practice that provides such benefit is permissible under USERRA.\").

The defendants have failed to explain how the severance package could be viewed as being \"in addition to\" Tolle's USERRA rights, if those rights were eliminated or otherwise rendered unenforceable by the Release Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For all of these reasons, the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment based on the Release Agreement. At this stage of the proceedings, the court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Tolle. When the record is viewed in that manner, it cannot be said that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether the Release Agreement resulted in a situation more beneficial to Tolle than his USERRA rights.

Vill. of Newark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328249\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/35/359/#p368\">\n    35 F.Supp.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Upon review of the complaint, the court concludes that it states a plausible claim for individual liability against Rios. The complaint includes multiple allegations indicating that Rios had the power to hire Tolle to work for Analogic and that he ultimately decided not to offer Tolle a regular position with the company.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 86 (quoting from a May 9, 2014 statement from Analogic indicating that \" 'Mr. Rios decided to accept the earlier\n   recommendations of Mr. Pompeo and Dr. Blalock and not to offer Mr. Tolle a regular position with Analogic' \");\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87 (referencing an October 22, 2014 written statement from Rios in which he explained what \"affected\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   decision not to hire or retain Tolle as a regular employee after Analogic's acquisition of PocketSonics\") (emphasis added). Such allegations, accepted as true, allow the court to draw the reasonable inference that Rios had control over employment opportunities with Analogic and therefore was as an \"employer\" for purposes of USERRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
