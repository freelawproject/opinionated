BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendants Adonis Baker's and Leotha Williams' Motion to Preserve Right\n   to Jury Trial, filed December 1, 2017 (Doc. 33)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on March 19, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Hearing at 1 (taken March 19, 2018), filed April 17, 2018 (Doc. 61)(\"Tr.\"). The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court should instruct the jury about its power to nullify; and (ii) whether the Court should allow Defendants Adonis Baker and Leotha Williams to inform the jury of the United States Sentencing Guidelines' advisory sentencing provisions in their case. The Court will deny the Motion. The Supreme Court of the United States' recent decisions about the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America's right to a jury trial suggest that some Justices on the Supreme Court may be willing to reconsider precedent by addressing whether a practice is necessary to the jury trial right as it existed at the time that the States ratified the Sixth Amendment. Historical sources and precedent show that the common-law jury at the Founders' time knew the ramifications of a guilty verdict and used that knowledge in reaching a verdict, frequently choosing a verdict because it would mitigate a defendant's punishment. Moreover, although courts at the Founders' time instructed the jury that the court's role is to provide the jury the law and that the jury's role is to apply that law to the facts as the jury finds them, the courts also instructed the jury that its role included ultimately deciding both the facts and the law. Courts at the Founders' time allowed lawyers to argue openly to the jury that it should exercise its ability to decide the law in the case and nullify the law that the court gives. Accordingly, the common-law jury in the Framers' era knew about and exercised its power to acquit even when the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, or to mitigate the defendant's sentence, regardless whether application of the law given by the court to the facts which the jury found provided otherwise. The Court concludes that Supreme Court and United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit precedent allowing the jury to know about sentencing ramifications only if its participation in sentencing is required, and preventing the jury from learning about its nullification right, are inconsistent with trial practices at the Founders' time, and that these practices have eroded the Sixth Amendment jury trial right as the Framers understood that right. Nevertheless, because, as a district court, the Court must faithfully apply controlling Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, the Court will deny the Defendants' Motion, and prohibit them from instructing, arguing, or introducing evidence related to the jury's power to nullify or related to potential penalties resulting from a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 21, 2017, a federal grand jury issued an Indictment, filed September\n   19, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Indictment\"), charging Baker and Williams with human trafficking and related crimes.

The Defendants include Proposed Instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Instructions at 1.

Motion at 4-5. The Defendants argue that juries must be instructed about their authority to determine law, and that the Framers envisioned juries with the ability to determine law when they conceived of the jury trial right at the time of independence from the English Crown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 6-8. To perform the function that the Framers intended, the Defendants contend, modern juries must have sentencing information, as historical juries did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 11-13. Finally, the Defendants argue that justice requires trust in juries, and that juries are trustworthy when they are equipped with knowledge of their right to nullify unjust verdicts and information regarding the potential sentencing ramifications of their verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its Response, the United States begins by asserting that the Defendants' Motion acknowledges that the Defendants' requested instructions are \"an abrogation of federal law.\" Response at 2 (citing Motion at 2). The United States argues that the Defendants can cite to no current authority that permits the inclusion of their requested instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2. The United States argues that determining equity of law is not a jury function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2. The United States avers that the Tenth Circuit disallows jury instructions on nullification and on sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The United States argues that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial does not contemplate a right to a jury which will disregard the district court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. Nullification, the United States argues, is a power and not a right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. The United States asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It is the function of this Court to make determinations regarding the validity of the law. A jury must apply the law as given. While a jury has the inherent power to nullify a verdict, instructing them of this unlawful power is improper. An instruction explaining this concept would encourage the jurors to violate their oaths and disregard the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Response at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, the United States argues that it would be improper to reference potential punishment to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. The United States argues that sentencing is a task for the Court and is irrelevant to the jury's task.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3-4. The United States sets forth several arguments for not informing a jury about potential sentencing ramifications of their verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. According to the United States, informing a jury about sentencing would \"tend to draw the attention of the jury away from their chief function as sole judges of the facts, open the door to compromise verdicts and to confuse the issue or issues to be decided.\" Response at 4 (citations omitted). The United States further argues that informing a jury about sentencing \"invites jurors to ponder matters that are not within their province,\n   distracts them from their fact-finding ..., and creates a strong possibility of confusion.\" Response at 4. The only possible purpose served by instructing a jury to consider sentencing, the United States argues, \"would be to invite jury nullification.\" Response at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The United States argues that the Court has ruled on this issue in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Courtney\n   </em>\n   , and in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267047\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/266/1290/\">\n    266 F.Supp.3d 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.M. 2017) (Browning, J.), in each case denying motions to modify jury instructions on nullification and to inform juries about the sentencing ramifications of their verdicts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. The United States asks that the Court rule in conformity with its prior rulings, requests that the Court deny the Motion, and that the Court prohibit the Defendants from \"instructing, arguing, or introducing evidence related to the jury's power to nullify or potential penalties.\" Response at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Williams' Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Defendant Williams submits a Reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Williams Reply at 1. Williams argues that the United States ignores the historical roots of juries and \"denigrates [the jury's] sacred role as the people's last defense, and lays the foundation for the return of tyranny when it refuses to accept the jury in its entirety as envisioned by the Founders.\" Williams Reply at 1. Williams contends that the United States cites \"neither authority from the youthful years of the republic, nor any post-\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Blakely\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   decisions,\" and that the Supreme Court commands that today's jury emulate the jury of the Founders' time. Williams Reply at 2. Williams concedes that the Supreme Court has yet to decide this issue but argues that the Supreme Court overturned the decisions that the United States cites in the Response by describing the role of the jury in terms of its characteristics at the time of the Founders in its opinions in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Although it does not mention that power explicitly, it can logically be assumed that the definition of a jury used in that document would be consonant with the prevailing definition in the legal dictionaries of the period. The most common legal dictionary in Colonial Virginia was the British\n   <em>\n    Jacob's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   [ (1782) ]; and within the encyclopedic definition given in\n   <em>\n    Jacob's\n   </em>\n   , the word 'jury' is defined as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Jury ...

Hamilton argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The Chief Justice misdirected the jury, in saying they had no right to judge of the intent and of the law. In criminal cases, the defendant does not spread upon the record the merits of the defence, but consolidates the whole in the plea of not guilty. This plea embraces the whole matter of law and fact involved in the charge, and the jury have\n   an undoubted right to give a general verdict, which decides both the law and the fact.... All the cases agree that the jury have the power to decide the law as well as the fact; and if the law gives them the power, it gives them the right also. Power and right are convertible terms, when the law authorizes the doing of an act which shall be final, and for the doing of which the agent is not responsible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The intent constitutes crime. To deny, then, to the jury the right to judge of the intent, and yet to require them to find a general verdict of guilty, is requiring them to commit perjury. The particular intent constitutes the crime, in cases of libel, beca[us]e the act is not, of itself, unlawful; and where the particular intent alone constitutes the guilt, the court cannot judge of that intent, and the jury must find it....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   It is admitted to be the duty of the court to direct the jury as to the law, and it is advisable for the jury in most cases, to receive the law from the court; and in all cases, they ought to pay respectful attention to the opinion of the court. But, it is also their duty to exercise their judgments upon the law, as well as the fact; and if they have a clear conviction that the law is different from what it is stated to be by the court, the jury are bound, in such cases, by the superior obligations of conscience, to follow their own convictions. It is essential to the security of personal rights and public liberty, that the jury should have and exercise the power to judge both of the law and of the criminal intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20Cas.%20337\">\n    3 Johns.

The prosecution countered that the sound administration of court business requires that juries be permitted to determine the facts only:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The jury have, undoubtedly, the power, in criminal cases, to decide the law as well as the fact, if they will take upon themselves the exercise of it; but we must distinguish, in this case, between power and right. It is the right of the jury to decide the fact, and only the fact; and it is the exclusive province of the court to decide the law in all cases, criminal as well as civil. A jury is wholly incompetent, and necessarily must be, from the nature of their institution, to decide questions of law; and if they were invested with this right, it would be attended with mischievous and fatal effects. The law, instead of being a fixed rule, would become uncertain and capricious, and there would not remain any stability or uniformity of decision, or certainty of principle, in the administration of justice....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   If the jury were to judge of the law in the case of libels, why not of the effect of writings in civil cases, and of the law in all cases where the plea is the general issue? Surely the counsel on the other side are not prepared to carry their doctrine to this extent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20Cas.%20337\">\n    3 Johns.

Hamilton replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   But it is not only the province of the jury, in all criminal cases, to judge of the intent with which the act was done, as being parcel of the fact; they are also authorized to judge of the law as connected with the fact. In civil cases, the court are the exclusive judges of the law, and this arose from the nature of pleadings in civil suits; for, anciently, matters of law arising in the defence, were required to be spread upon the record, by a special plea, and the jury were liable to an attaint for finding a verdict contrary to law. But in criminal cases, the law and fact are necessarily blended by the general issue, and a general verdict was always final and conclusive, both upon the law and the fact. Nor were the jury ever exposed to an attaint for a verdict in a criminal case; and this is\n   decisive to prove that they had a concurrent jurisdiction with the court on questions of law; for where the law allows an act to be valid and definitive, it presupposes a legal and rightful authority to do it. This is a sure and infallible test of a legal power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   In England, trial by jury has always been cherished, as the great security of the subject against the oppression of government; but it never could have been a solid refuge and security, unless the jury had the right to judge of the intent and the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   The jury ought, undoubtedly, to pay every respectful regard to the opinion of the court; but suppose a trial in a capital case, and the jury are satisfied from the arguments of counsel, the law authorities that are read, and their own judgment, upon the application of the law to the facts, (for the criminal law consists in general of plain principles,) that the law arising in the case is different from that which the court advances, are they not bound by their oaths, by their duty to their creator and themselves, to pronounce according to their own convictions? To oblige them, in such a case, to follow implicitly the direction of the court, is to make them commit perjury, and homicide, under the forms of law. Their error is fatal and cannot be corrected. The victim is sacrificed; he is executed; he perishes without redress. Was he a juror, in such a case, he would endure the rack rather than surrender his own convictions on the altar of power, rather than obey the judicial mandate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

So in the case of a public libeller, the jury are to try, not only whether he published such a writing, but whether he published it seditiously. In all these cases, from the nature of the issue, the jury are to try not only the fact, but the crime, and in doing so, they must judge of the intent, in order to determine whether the charge be true, as set forth in the indictment. The law and fact are so involved, that the jury are under an indispensable necessity to decide both, unless they separate them by a special verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20Cas.%20337\">\n    3 Johns.

In England, where the judges are appointed by the crown, and juries form a substantial barrier between the prerogatives of that crown and the liberties of the people, the reasons for extending the powers of the latter are certainly much stronger than with us, where the judges are, in effect, appointed by the people themselves, and amenable to them for any misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

It is, that in criminal cases, and especially in capital cases, the jury are the judges of the law, as well as of the fact. My opinion is, that the jury are no more judges of the law in a capital or other criminal case, upon the plea of not guilty, than they are in every civil case, tried upon the general issue. In each of these cases, their verdict, when general, is necessarily compounded of law and of fact; and\n   includes both. In each they must necessarily determine the law, as well as the fact. In each, they have the physical power to disregard the law, as laid down to them by the court. But I deny, that, in any case, civil or criminal, they have the moral right to decide the law according to their own notions, or pleasure. On the contrary, I hold it the most sacred constitutional right of every party accused of a crime, that the jury should respond as to the facts, and the court as to the law. It is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the law; and it is the duty of the jury to follow the law, as it is laid down by the court. This is the right of every citizen; and it is his only protection. If the jury were at liberty to settle the law for themselves, the effect would be, not only that the law itself would be most uncertain, from the different views, which different juries might take of it; but in case of error, there would be no remedy or redress by the injured party; for the court would not have any right to review the law as it had been settled by the jury. Indeed, it would be almost impracticable to ascertain, what the law, as settled by the jury, actually was. On the contrary, if the court should err, in laying down the law to the jury, there is an adequate remedy for the injured party, by a motion for a new trial, or a writ of error, as the nature of the jurisdiction of the particular court may require. Every person accused as a criminal has a right to be tried according to the law of the land, the fixed law of the land; and not by the law as a jury may understand it, or choose, from wantonness, or ignorance, or accidental mistake, to interpret it. If I thought, that the jury were the proper judges of the law in criminal cases, I should hold it my duty to abstain from the responsibility of stating the law to them upon any such trial. But believing, as I do, that every citizen has a right to be tried by the law, and according to the law; that it is his privilege and truest shield against oppression and wrong; I feel it my duty to state my views fully and openly on the present occasion. It is not, indeed, an occasion, on which there is any reason to doubt, that an intelligent jury can understand the principles of law applicable to the subject, as well as the court; for they are the principles of common sense. And as little reason is there, in my view, to suppose, that they can operate injuriously to the real merits of the case of the prisoner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6644481,6644877\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/24/1042/\">\n    24 F.

No reflecting man in the jury box would be willing to take upon himself this responsibility. He would feel that the question could not be examined with the deliberation it required; that the law could not be expounded with quite so much facility as it could be made, -- and that there was no such inspiration in the jury box as would enable twelve men to determine, per saltum, grave questions which, elsewhere, require care, and thought, and patient study, and time for undisturbed reflection.

No instruction was given that questioned the right of the jury to determine whether the witnesses were to be believed or not, nor whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty of the offense charged. On the contrary, the court was careful to say that the jury were the exclusive judges of the facts, and that they were to determine -- applying to the facts the principles of law announced by the court -- whether the evidence established the guilt or innocence of the defendants of the charge set out in the indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The trial was thus conducted upon the theory that it was the duty of the court to expound the law, and that of the jury to apply the law as thus declared to the facts as ascertained by them.

But, on the other hand, I do consider that this power and corresponding duty of the court authoritatively to declare the law is one of the highest safeguards of the citizen. The sole end of courts of justice is to enforce the laws uniformly and impartially, without respect of persons or times or the opinions of men. To enforce popular laws is easy.

Among the affidavits taken by John Bridges and Samson Shelton Broughton, under the Queen's order of reference for the collection of evidence in connection with the Bayard appeal, are statements of some of the petit jurors who had joined in the verdict declaring Bayard guilty of high treason. Thomas Sanders and Isaac Stoutenbergh, two of the trial jurors, made oral statements as follows, confirming the allegations made by Bayard in his petition: \"... these [depend on] their great Ignorance of the Laws of England at that time not knowing what was High Treason ... the Foreman ...

These prerogatives the juries in New York did not hesitate to assert, and to these old and established powers of mitigation may be added, perhaps, the avoidance in New York of the incidents of felony judgment by the persistent finding of no goods or tenements.

John Taplin was tried before Ryder in October 1754 on an indictment charging theft from a dwelling house of a watch, valued at forty shillings, and of more than twenty guineas in money. The [Old Bailey] report of the outcome is as curt as possible, \"Guilty 39s.,\" meaning that the jury convicted him but determined the combined value of what was stolen to be thirty-nine shillings (less than two guineas, hence well below the value charged in the indictment). Ryder's notes explain why. \"The jury found him guilty to the value of 39s., which they did after I told them that 40s. was necessary to make him guilty of felony that was without benefit of clergy. It is by Act of 12 Ann.\" Ryder thus records his own role in guiding the jury's prerogative of 'valuing' the loot. Because the statute of 1713 to which Ryder refers withdrew so-called benefit of clergy from thefts of forty shillings' value or more when committed in a dwelling house, it foreclosed the primary ground upon which a convict could escape the death penalty for such an offense. The convention of the day, immortalized in Blackstone's phrase as the jury's \"pious perjury,\" was that the jury could \"downvalue\" the goods, in this instance to thirty-nine shillings, in order to consign the convict to the lesser sanction of transportation for seven years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   John H.

Langbein, Sterling Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School, concludes from Ryder's notebook chronicling many of his trials during his tenure on the Old Bailey bench that the paramount, if not only, purpose of the jury was to determine the sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Only a small fraction of eighteenth-century criminal trials were genuinely contested inquiries into guilt or innocence. In most cases the accused had been caught in the act or otherwise possessed no credible defense. To the extent that trial had a function in such cases beyond formalizing the inevitable conclusion of guilt, it was to decide the sanction. These trials were sentencing proceedings. The main object of the defense was to present the jury with a view of the circumstances of the crime and the offender that would motivate it to return a verdict within the privilege of clergy, in order to reduce the sanction from death to transportation, or to lower the offense from grand to petty larceny, which ordinarily\n   reduced the sanction from transportation to whipping....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   The jury not only decided guilt, but it chose the sanction through its manipulation of the partial verdict. Since guilt was typically although not inevitably a forgone conclusion in many (perhaps most) cases, sentence is what was at stake when these cases were \"contested.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 41, 55 (footnotes omitted). Professor Langbein notes that, in Ryder's two years on the bench at Old Bailey, although he tried over one-hundred and seventy-one cases, there were only sixteen different crimes with which the defendants were charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Langbein,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 42. Professor Langbein, in addition to reviewing Ryder's notebook, also reviewed a group of reports called the Old Bailey Session Papers (\"OBSP\") from the 1670s to the 1730s, concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   [T]he jury of that time had a large role in what we think of as sentencing, that is, in determining the sanction. In a significant fraction of the cases that went to trial, the real issue was whether the jury would choose to exercise its power to \"value\" stolen goods in ways that would affect the applicable sanction. It was understood that the value that the jury assigned was fictional, and that the jury was in truth deciding whether to rescue the culprit from the ordinary sanctions of transportation and death by so characterizing the crime that only a lesser sanction could be invoked. If the goods were valued below 12 pence (in practice the Old Bailey juries used the figure of 10 pence), the crime became petty larceny, hence a misdemeanor, and the convict escaped with a whipping or a short jail term. Under certain circumstances the jury could, by valuing goods below other monetary ceilings, bring the culprit under the rubric of benefit-of-clergy, for which the sanction was branding in the thumb. The decision between finding an accused guilty of murder or manslaughter, which also belonged to the jury, can be seen as the choice between capital punishment and branding. It could be argued that in all these situations the jury was in reality discharging a sentencing function, and even today we expect sentencing officers to consult past conviction evidence. But we have seen that the OBSP show that the juries were using past conviction evidence to determine guilt, and with no constraint from the bench.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   John H.

The Court concludes that the common-law jury knew about the sentencing ramifications and used that knowledge in reaching the verdict.

Additionally, defense counsel at the Founders' time were permitted to argue openly to the jury that it should exercise its nullification power. The Court therefore concludes that the Supreme Court's and Tenth Circuit's requirements to keep out any mention of the jury's ability to nullify and to prevent any lawyer from mentioning to the jury that it can mitigate or nullify its verdict, is inconsistent with the Framers' intent in preserving the jury trial right in the Sixth Amendment.

Given that: (i) the Founders contemplated the jury's role to include its right to be the ultimate decider of the law; and (ii) the mitigation power played such a large role in the common-law jury's resolution of a case, however, the contemporary judicially created requirement to keep all information from the jury about its \"power\" to nullify is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment jury trial right at the Founders' time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Supreme Court has noted that \"the Sixth Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power.

Grayson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769241\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/41/#p45\">\n    438 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769241\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/41/#p45\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769241\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/41/#p45\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Even if the Court instructed modern-day juries that the crime with which the defendant in the case is charged is a felony or a misdemeanor, given the multiple crimes with specific statutory minimum\n   and maximum sentences, those juries likely would not know the possible sentences the defendants face if found guilty. Whereas the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   that the nineteenth century saw a shift from mandatory, definite sentences to a system in which the court could impose a sentence at the court's discretion, because courts today are not permitted to inform the modern-day jury about the possible sentencing range flowing from the defendants' guilty verdicts, and given the complexity of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the modern-day jury is likely without knowledge of the possible sentencing ramifications of their guilty verdict. The Court, in its experience on the bench, has found that present-day jurors, beyond lacking knowledge about sentencing ramifications for felonies or misdemeanors, often do not recognize the difference between criminal and civil jury trials. Numerous times conducting voir dire, when the Court inquired about a potential juror's past experience on a civil or criminal jury trial, the juror's answers show that what the juror believes was a criminal trial was actually civil and vice versa. Judge Weinstein has similarly noted that the vast difference between late-eighteenth century juries' knowledge about criminal law and sentencing ramifications of guilty verdicts, and contemporary juries' knowledge, is not surprising given the vast difference in criminal law as it then existed compared with the law today: \"Criminal law then was much simpler than today, now requiring tomes of highly abstruse, convoluted definitions and extraordinary combinations of statutory prison maximums and minimums, fines, restitutions, forfeitures, probationary terms, treatment for mental health and other problems in and out of prison, sentencing guidelines, case law and local practice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Considering the small number of offenses in the late-seventeenth century and eighteenth century, and that there were only two sanctions available for a felony conviction, support for withholding sentencing information from the jury and the jury's resulting lack of knowledge cannot be found in the historical reality of the common-law jury known to the Founders at the time of the Sixth Amendment's ratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    B. JURORS ON COMMON-LAW JURIES USED THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR VERDICT'S SENTENCING RAMIFICATIONS IN REACHING THEIR VERDICT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Juries at the Founders' time not only knew about the sentencing ramifications of their verdicts, but historical evidence shows that juries weighed heavily the defendant's sentence in reaching their verdicts. In looking at jury verdicts throughout the eighteenth century in colonial New York, Professor Goebel concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   The verdicts ... are illustrative of one of the most important aspects of the jury's prerogative -- the power to effect a mitigation in the severity of the law by verdicts which would let off an obvious offender with penalties less than the worst of the charges against him would make inevitable. This power was not confined to the selection of a relatively innocuous count on which to return a conviction, but extended, as indicated above, to a finding of an offense less in degree than that charged in the indictment. The importance of this rule in the case of felonies was obvious, since it was possible thus for the defendant to pray clergy and escape the rigor of the otherwise inevitable judgment of life and limb.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   J. Goebel &amp; T. Naughton,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 673 (footnotes omitted). The eighteenth-century jury in England also consistently exercised its power to effect a mitigation of the\n   defendant's sentence. Professor Langbein notes that \"only a small fraction of eighteenth-century criminal trials were genuinely contested inquiries into guilt or innocence .... To the extent that trial had a function in such cases beyond formalizing the inevitable conclusion of guilt, it was to decide the sanction. These trials were sentencing proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 41. Professor Langbein provides the common example in which a jury found that the value of stolen goods was thirty-nine shillings, because at a value of forty shillings, the defendant lost ability for application of the benefit of the clergy and, thus, was necessarily sentenced to death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 22 (\"Ryder's notes explain ...

In\n   <em>\n    Jones v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that \"competition developed between judge and jury,\" and provided the jury's mitigation power as an example: \"The potential or inevitable severity of sentences was indirectly checked by juries' assertions of a mitigating power when the circumstances of a prosecution pointed to political abuse of the criminal process or endowed a criminal conviction with particularly sanguinary consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

In\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

It is thus clear that the Supreme Court's conception of the common-law jury which the Sixth Amendment protects includes a jury with knowledge of the sentences a guilty defendant faces and a jury that uses this knowledge to reach its verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   It may be suggested that this recognition that there was knowledge germane to common-law jurors, without more, does not clearly suggest that withholding knowledge about sentencing ramifications is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right. If, for instance, a juror at the Founders' time knew the sentence that a guilty defendant faced only because there existed a very limited number of laws and a much more limited class of potential sentences, the courts' refusal today to institute a change to affirmatively provide to the jury this information does not clearly violate the defendant's Sixth Amendment right. It seems tenuous to argue that knowledge lost because the jury pool has enlarged since the Sixth Amendment's ratification or that knowledge lost because the jurors in the jury pool are less educated about the criminal law, without any affirmative conduct on the courts' behalf -- and without more -- implicates the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Sixth Amendment \"limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury,\"\n   <em>\n    Blakely v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , 542 U.S. at 308,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; a change resulting from the inclusion of a broader base of citizens in the jury pool, or from an evolution of the jurors in the jury pool, without courts' affirmative exertion of power, may not implicate the Sixth Amendment jury trial right. On the other hand, however, even if the jury's lack of knowledge about the sentence that the defendant faces is diminished, because the modern-day jury is left without information that appears to have been important to the common-law jury's verdict and its power to mitigate the defendant's sentence, the substance of the defendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial right appears to have deteriorated substantially.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although, at the Framers' time, judges had discretion regarding sentences for misdemeanors -- largely between corporal punishment and banishment -- for felonies, judges until the nineteenth century had no discretion in relation to sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

Judge Ryder, while on the bench at Old Bailey, noted one particular situation in which the jury returned a guilty verdict finding that the defendant stole goods worth thirty-nine shillings and credits the jury's finding to the fact that the jurors found that amount \"after I told them that 40s. was necessary to make him guilty of felony that was without benefit of clergy.\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 22 (internal footnote omitted). Judge Ryder in the 1750s therefore, at least, was not required to keep information about the jury's verdict's sentencing implications from the jury. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Battiste\n   </em>\n   , Justice Story in 1835 read to the jury the statute pursuant to which the defendant was charged, which included the sentencing ramification: \"Death.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6644481,6644877\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-cas/24/1042/\">\n    24 F.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court construed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to constitute three separate offenses, rather than one sentence with three factual considerations for sentencing, because it reasoned that, to leave to a judge factual findings which would mean the difference between a sentence of up to fifteen years, up to twenty-five years, or up to life, implicates the defendant's Sixth Amendment jury trial right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the one hand, the Supreme Court's constitutional requirement that a jury participate in factfinding where the fact is necessary to a sentence with a substantially different punishment is analogous to the factual finding required in the case which Ryder notes, where the jury was to determine whether the total value of stolen goods was forty shillings or more, as a finding of forty shillings makes mandatory a death sentence and precludes the possibility of the benefit of the clergy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, whereas Justice Story in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Battiste\n   </em>\n   instructed the jury by reading them the statute which included the punishment -- death,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Moreover, it is possible that modern-day juries know whether the return of a guilty verdict in a capital case -- such as first-degree murder -- in their jurisdiction puts at issue a possible death sentence. On the other hand, in Ryder's example, he appears not only to have required the jury to find a fact upon which an enhanced sentence depends, but to have gone further and instructed the jury specifically about the implications of finding the particular fact. Ryder notes that \"I told them that 40s. was necessary to make him guilty of felony that was without benefit of clergy,\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder Sources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 22; by telling the jury that fact, he instructed it specifically that the implications of the factual finding meant an increased maximum sentence, or, rather, the preclusion of anything except for the maximum sentence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In the case of drug-trafficking, for example, where the amount of the drugs in which the defendant traffics determines the statutory maximum and minimum, the jury is not told, as Ryder told the jury in another context, the line at which the possible relief from the death sentence becomes impossible or that there is a line at which the statutory maximum and minimum sentence changes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Supreme Court's recent sentencing decisions requiring jury participation in this factfinding and precluding a court's substitution of facts for the jury's, therefore, preserves the jury's factfinding role as it existed at the Founders' times.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has apparently decided that, in a contemporary society in which Congress has enacted over three thousand federal criminal laws and substituted mandatory criminal sentences for the Sentencing Guidelines, the requirement to withhold jury instruction about possible sentences stems from the concern that their knowledge of sentencing ramifications \"distracts them from their factfinding responsibilities, and creates a strong possibility of confusion,\"\n   <em>\n    Shannon v.

For example, the fear may be that a white jury might engage in jury nullification when there is a white defendant officer accused of killing an African-American civilian. The Court would not take away jury nullification in these circumstances, because a prosecutor might be under political pressure to bring a case, and more importantly, because the jury more often has an African-American defendant on trial, and the jury might want to take race into consideration in these circumstances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Paul Butler, Racially Based Jury Nullification: Black Power in the Criminal Justice System,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Yale%20L.J.%20677\">\n     105 Yale L.J. 677\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 715-18 (1995) (arguing that African-American jurors should sometimes vote to acquit in criminal cases where African-American defendants are factually guilty, because the benefits of returning the defendant to the community may outweigh the harms caused by incarceration). This country has fought a civil war and engaged in a long struggle to attempt to rid itself of racial divide. The Court could also live with the proposition that the court tell the jury that it cannot base jury nullification on race. The jury could be told that race is an illegitimate factor. One might say that an instruction might not be effective, but a court can never rule out all jury misconduct, and the Court's experience is that American juries work hard to follow the court's instructions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    Professor Langbein explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n    The judges of the three royal central courts served as trial judges at the Old Bailey in a rotation; two or three of them joined the Recorder of London, the permanent judge of the Old Bailey, for each sessions. In the 1750s the Chief Justice of King's Bench took his turns in April and October. Ryder sat at four sessions, October of 1754, April and October of 1755, and April/May of 1756 (he died later that May). At these four sessions the Old Bailey conducted 171 felony trials. Ryder presided at about a quarter of them, forty-four trials, and his judge's notes survive for all forty-four. The original notes are contained in a single notebook, the property of the Earls of Harrowby (the peerage that, with some difficulty, was founded on Ryder's career). The notebook, together with other volumes of notes that Ryder made while conducting civil (nisi prius) cases, is now on deposit at Lincoln's Inn. Fortunately, all these shorthand judge's notes were transcribed in the 1970s and the typescript placed on deposit at Lincoln's Inn (and subsequently at the University of Chicago Law Library). The transcription is the work of K. L. Perrin, who rendered many other Ryder shorthand documents into typescript for the Harrowby muniments over a period of three decades until his death in 1981. The researcher who is prepared (as I have been) to rely upon the Perrin transcription does not need to master the shorthand.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n    The transcriber renders the shorthand documents as 'Law notes of Sir Dudley Ryder,' and he numbers them Documents 12-17.
