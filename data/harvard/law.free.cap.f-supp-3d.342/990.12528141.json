They contend Casillas was actively evading arrest when driving-by running intersections and almost causing traffic collisions, and on foot at the Saginaw Residence-by actively ignoring multiple commands to surrender. They also contend that when Casillas entered the Breezeway and charged at Officer Shipman, metal pipe in hand, he posed an immediate threat to Officer Shipman's safety. Thus, Defendants argue Officer Shipman acted reasonably in shooting and ultimately killing Casillas. Defendants therefore maintain Officer Shipman either did not violate Casillas's Fourth Amendment right, or is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs contend genuine issues of material facts still exist concerning Casillas's encounter with Fresno Police Officers. Plaintiffs point to numerous portions of the record that demonstrate Officer Shipman's account of the shooting is questionable. Plaintiffs also point to their expert's review of the events, which they contend demonstrates a reasonable alternative to Defendants' version of the events. Through this evidence, Plaintiffs aim to demonstrate that Casillas did not pose an immediate threat to Officer Shipman, and so any use of deadly force was unreasonable. Thus, Plaintiffs maintain a reasonable jury could still find Officer Shipman violated Casillas's Fourth Amendment right. Plaintiffs also point to numerous cases where the Ninth Circuit has deemed the use of deadly force in absence of an immediate threat to be excessive, and so Officer Shipman is not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must both (1) allege the deprivation of a right secured by the federal Constitution or statutory law, and (2) allege that the deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\n   <em>\n    West v.
