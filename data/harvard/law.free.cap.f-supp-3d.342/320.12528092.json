Compl. \u00b6 41, ECF No. 1-2; Compl, Ex. 1, at 1 (\"ESA\").

They argue that plaintiffs were \"charged rates that are substantially higher and untethered to the supply costs,\" and that XOOM's failure to charge a rate that approximates the \"Market Supply Rate\" \"caused injury to [p]laintiffs because ... their rate should have been based on XOOM's supply costs, which it was not.\" Compl. \u00b6 54, 56. Plaintiffs situate XOOM's behavior within the broader energy-deregulation movement across New York, arguing that XOOM, like other ESCOs operating with limited governmental oversight, \"exploits deregulated markets with false promises that its energy rates are based on its actual and estimated supply costs.\" Compl. \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After growing increasingly dissatisfied with XOOM's rates, plaintiffs cancelled their service with the company in November 2013.
