(Dkt. 1). This Court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to\n   Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 15), and Plaintiff's reply (Dkt. 16). For the reasons discussed below, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 15) is granted and Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 10) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for SSI on February 11, 2014.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-63). Plaintiff and her attorney appeared in Buffalo, New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On June 23, 2016, the ALJ issued an unfavorable decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-27). Plaintiff requested Appeals Council review; her request was denied on October 23, 2017, making the ALJ's determination the Commissioner's final decision.

If so, the claimant is not disabled. If not, the ALJ proceeds to step two and determines whether the claimant has an impairment, or combination of impairments, that is \"severe\" within the meaning of the Act, in that it imposes significant restrictions on the claimant's ability to perform basic work activities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(c).

If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.909), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(f).

(Dkt. 7 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of: depression, anxiety disorder, gastrointestinal disorder /gastroesophageal reflux disease, headaches, obstructive sleep apnea, tachycardia, hypertension, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ further found that other impairments alleged by Plaintiff, including but not limited to pelvic pain and keratosis, seborrheic, were non-severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a limited range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.967\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), with the limitations that Plaintiff can:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   lift and carry up to 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally, stand and/or walk up to 6 hours in an 8 hour workday, and sit for up to 6 hours in an 8 hour workday; occasionally climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and frequently climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of retail marker, electronics subassembler, and small parts assembler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

Banse, FPMHNP, a nurse practitioner (hereinafter, \"NP Banse\"), and failed to develop the record; (2) the RFC finding was not supported by substantial evidence, because the ALJ did not adopt medical opinions in the record and failed to develop the record; and (3) the ALJ failed to properly assess the credibility of Plaintiff's subjective complaints.

(Dkt. 7 at 739). NP Banse assessed Plaintiff with major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and nicotine dependence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 740, 744, 747, 751, 755). During the course of this treatment, NP Banse consistently assessed Plaintiff's GAF as 61. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 740, 744, 747, 751, 755). Another nurse practitioner, Angela Roche (hereinafter, \"NP Roche\"), assessed Plaintiff's GAF as 80 on several occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 758, 761, 765, 768, 771, 774, 778, 782).

NP Banse did not explain how or why she formulated that opinion. Further, there is no discussion of Plaintiff's mental limitations as applied to her work-related limitations anywhere in NP Banse's treatment notes supporting her opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ALJ considered NP Banse's July 2, 2014 opinion that Plaintiff was unable to work due to severe anxiety and depression and assigned it little weight.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ cited to specific portions of the record containing Plaintiff's GAF scores, and noted that many of the GAF scores were assessed by NP Banse herself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ also explained that NP Banse's statement that Plaintiff was unable to work was an opinion on the ultimate issue of disability, an issue that is ultimately reserved to the Commissioner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, the ALJ's assignment of \"little weight\" to NP Banse's opinion was proper. Inconsistency can constitute a good reason for rejecting a medical opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saxon v.

As noted by the ALJ, the opinion is inconsistent with Plaintiff's GAF scores, some of which were assigned by NP Banse herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, the Court finds that the ALJ's assignment of \"little weight\" to NP Banse's July 2, 2014 opinion was reasonable. The opinion appears once in several pages of notes and is not accompanied by any supporting medical data. In other words, Nurse Banse's opinion, in any light, is not an adequate functional assessment. Likewise, the July 2, 2014 opinion is contradicted by NP Banse's own notes. Plaintiff\n   is correct that NP Banse's treatment notes contain Plaintiff's subjective complaints of depression and anxiety, and NP Banse's opinion that Plaintiff appeared depressed at their meetings. (Dkt. 7 at 739-56). However, NP Banse's objective exams revealed that Plaintiff did not display mania or suspiciousness; had fair eye contact; had normal thought processes; experienced no delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, preoccupations or somatic thoughts; was alert and oriented; had intact memory, insight, and judgment; and had only decreased attention span and concentration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 740-56). These relatively mild objective findings are at odds with NP Banse's opinion that Plaintiff is unable to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the ALJ did not specifically consider the six factors she was required to consider before affording NP Banse's opinion little weight. (Dkt. 10-1 at 20). However, as noted above, \"[a]n ALJ does not have to explicitly walk through these factors,\" so long as the Court can conclude that he or she \"applied the substance\" of the regulations and appropriately set forth the rationale for the weight given to the opinions.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339715\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/37/614/#p625\">\n    37 F.Supp.3d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   32 ). It is abundantly clear from the written determination that the ALJ considered these factors, particularly because the ALJ cited to specific portions of the medical record, discussed specific tests NP Banse performed, compared NP Banse's evaluations to evaluations done by other medical professionals, and recognized that NP Banse was Plaintiff's mental health nurse practitioner.

(Dkt. 7 at 24-25). The ALJ explained that psychologist Straussner and Dr. Ransom both assessed Plaintiff as needing few work-related limitations and opined that Plaintiff's mental impairment was not severe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ assigned the opinions of psychologist Straussner and Dr. Ransom \"little weight,\" because \"evidence received at the hearing level establishes that the claimant's medically determinable mental impairments did cause more than a minimal limitation in her ability to perform basic work activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Because the ALJ discussed evidence received at the hearing in the written determination (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22), it is clear that the opinions of psychologist Straussner and Dr. Ransom conflicted with that evidence. In other words, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had at least some mental impairments and corresponding functional limitations beyond those assessed by psychologist Straussner and Dr. Ransom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ALJ next discussed the opinion of Dr. Siddiqui, who offered a fair prognosis and found no limitations in Plaintiff's ability to sit, stand, climb, push, pull or carry heavy objects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). The ALJ began her analysis by noting that Dr. Siddiqui was an examining physician, rather than a treating physician, and therefore his opinion was not entitled to controlling weight or great deference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). The ALJ then explained that the objective evidence in the record, which was summarized in detail in the written determination, showed that Plaintiff did in fact have severe impairments that cause some limitations in her functional ability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on the conflict between the objective medical evidence and Dr. Siddiqui's opinion, the ALJ assigned the opinion \"little weight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, as explained in greater detail at Section (II)(A), above, the ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to the opinion of NP Banse, because her opinion that Plaintiff was unable to work conflicted with objective medical evidence in the record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court finds that the ALJ properly and adequately discussed her reasons for assigning \"little weight\" to the medical opinions in the record. The Court further notes that, had the ALJ assigned greater weight to the opinions of psychologist Straussner, Dr. Ransom, and Dr. Siddiqui, the RFC assessment would have included fewer mental and physical work-related limitations than it does currently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff argues that because the ALJ assigned \"little weight\" to the medical opinions in the record, she \"created and widened an evidentiary gap\" in the record and therefore had to rely on her own lay opinion in assessing an RFC.

For example, it is clear that the assessed limitations relating to Plaintiff's exposure to particular extreme elements, such as heat, wetness, humidity, vibration, fumes, odors, dusts, gases, poor ventilation, hazards, machinery, and heights, as well as exposure to noise and flashing lights, are based on medical records assessing Plaintiff with a heart condition, reflux disease, anxiety, and Plaintiff's hearing testimony.

Finally, limitations on carrying heavy objects, walking, and sitting; climbing ladders, ropes, scaffolds, ramps, and stairs; and balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling, are based on Dr. Siddiqui's opinion that Plaintiff did not have any physical limitations.

Accordingly, the ALJ assessed Plaintiff's credibility, and concluded that \"there is ... very little objective evidence of record to support the alleged severity of the symptoms described by the claimant at the hearing, which diminishes her persuasiveness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, the ALJ found that \"studies have failed to show any severe neurological, cardiac or lung abnormalities, and numerous neurological examinations have yielded grossly normal results without evidence of any significant neurological deficits,\" and that Plaintiffs treatment has been successful in controlling her allegedly disabling symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Second, the ALJ considered that Plaintiff was not compliant with her medical care providers' instructions for cessation of tobacco usage, and that \"continuing to smoke is contrary to the normal treatment regimen for an individual with serious respiratory problems, and suggests a possible unwillingness to do what is necessary to possibly improve her condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Third, the ALJ noted that, while Plaintiff has been treated for depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, she \"has not received the type of level of mental healthcare that one would associate with an individual totally disabled by mental health impairments,\" such as hospitalization or emergency room treatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ noted that Plaintiff's \"conservative treatment and the relatively benign objective evidence are not consistent with the severity of condition purported by the claimant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, the ALJ found that \"[o]verall, the claimant's reported limited daily activities are considered to be outweighed by the other factors discussed in this decision, including the numerous normal psychiatric examinations and report that she has a boyfriend of 10 years, which suggests capacity to maintain long and meaningful relationships.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff contends that the ALJ's credibility assessment is based on \"a misconstruction of the record.\" (Dkt. 10-1 at 28). Plaintiff cites to the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff was \"non-compliant with CPAP,\" and argues that Plaintiff's compliance was on one occasion, and that she was later compliant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). A review of the record and of the ALJ's written determination reveals that the ALJ did not mischaracterize the information in the record as it relates to Plaintiff's CPAP usage. Indeed, the operative report of the surgeon who performed Plaintiff's tonsillectomy, under \"History and Indications,\" notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   This is a patient with persistent tonsillitis.... She also has untreated sleep apnea and declines to use CPAP.

In other words, Plaintiff's contention that she was non-compliant on only one occasion is not what is reflected in the medical records. The Court finds that the ALJ's interpretation of the record as it relates to Plaintiff's CPAP machine usage is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The ALJ also noted that Plaintiff had failed to comply with \"her medical care providers' repeated instructions and counseling for cessation of tobacco usage\" and that she had \"not provided a good reason\" for her failure to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). This Court and others have acknowledged \"the nature of nicotine addiction and the inherent difficulty of quitting smoking,\" and have found that, in light of these considerations, \"an ALJ may not base a credibility determination solely on a failure to quit smoking.\"\n   <em>\n    Feliciano v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:16-CV-06311 (MAT),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203537130\">\n    2017 WL 3537130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20131582\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

However, it is proper for an ALJ to consider whether a claimant attempted to comply with her physicians' instructions and made a meaningful attempt to quit smoking, regardless of the ultimate success of that endeavor.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20131582\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the record does not show that Plaintiff meaningfully attempted to quit smoking, despite being repeatedly counseled to do so by her physicians. To the contrary, Plaintiff repeatedly told her physicians that she was not ready to quit smoking or that she was merely \"thinking\" about doing so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 7 at 219, 221, 223, 268-269). Plaintiff's physicians pointed her to resources that could be used in ceasing to smoke, but she apparently did not follow-up on them, reporting that she was only \"pre-contemplating smoking cessation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 908, 912, 918). Under these circumstances, it was appropriate for the ALJ to conclude that Plaintiff had not complied with her physicians' instructions and that her failure to do so negatively impacted her credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monette v.
