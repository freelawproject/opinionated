INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas Rossley, Jr. brings this suit against Defendants Drake University and Drake University Board of Trustees, challenging Defendants' Title IX investigation that concluded Plaintiff sexually assaulted a female student, and contesting Defendants' failure to investigate his own sexual assault allegations. Plaintiff asserts Defendants violated both Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Plaintiff also brings state law claims alleging breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on all of Plaintiff's claims, asserting: 1) Plaintiff has not identified any genuine issues of material fact showing gender was a motivating factor in the disciplinary process; 2) Plaintiff did not request a reasonable accommodation and thus cannot bring an ADA claim; and 3) Plaintiff has not shown Drake violated any promise or contractual provisions contained in its Code of Conduct or Sexual Misconduct Policy. The Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's Title IX claim regarding Plaintiff's erroneous outcome and deliberate indifference theories, but denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title IX claim regarding Plaintiff's selective enforcement theory. The Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's Americans with Disabilities Act claim. As for Plaintiff's state law claims, the Court first determines Plaintiff's estoppel and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims are subsumed by his breach of contract claim. The\n   Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on some but not all of Plaintiff's alleged breaches of contract. The Court also dismisses Plaintiff's claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress because Plaintiff does not resist Defendants' motion for summary judgment on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Overberg Dep. 62:15-24, ECF No. 103 at APP. 027. During that meeting, Plaintiff explained that a friend had told him that since he could not remember part of the evening of October 8, 2015, and because Jane Doe had performed oral sex on him, perhaps he was a victim as well. Overberg Dep. 63:6-12, ECF No. 103 at APP. 027. Overberg stated she was unsure why Plaintiff was telling them this information and wanted to ensure that whatever information he wanted to share would be included in the investigative report. Overberg Dep. 83:18-84:6, ECF No. 103 at APP. 30. In response to Plaintiff's comments, Overberg and Parker set up a second interview with the investigators. Overberg Dep. 85:24-87:8, ECF No. 103 at APP. 030-31. Overberg then emailed Sirna and McKinney, explaining they should ask Plaintiff whether he was \"sharing this information in response to the allegations against [him], or [is he] asking that a conduct charge be filed against [Jane Doe] for sexual assault?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 308. Overberg directed Sirna and McKinney to get the necessary information from Plaintiff if he was requesting that a charge be filed against Jane Doe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Overberg explained to Sirna and McKinney that, although it was likely they could perform an investigation into both claims simultaneously, they \"would need to be sure the investigation into [Plaintiff's] charge was complete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On November 10, 2015, McKinney met with Plaintiff in person while Sirna joined them on the phone. Sirna Dep. 134:16-23, ECF No. 103 at APP. 065;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 182.

In the course of their investigation, the investigators interviewed twelve witnesses, including Plaintiff and Jane Doe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sirna listed nine other students they had not interviewed and briefly explained why they had not been questioned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 186-87. For instance, Sirna explained Student P, who Jane Doe had jumped on after leaving Theta Chi, had a \"limited interaction with [Jane Doe].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 187. Similarly, Student T, who was present during the conversation between Plaintiff and Witness K in which Plaintiff is reported to have said he wasted a condom, \"would [have] provided duplicative statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 186. The investigators also did not interview Student N, Jane Doe's ex-boyfriend, because Jane Doe had asked them not to contact him and he had not been present that evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Sirna ultimately determined there was a preponderance of evidence suggesting a sex act had occurred and the act was not consensual, because Jane Doe was either unconscious or incapacitated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 221-22. Sirna based this determination largely on six facts: 1) there were no eye witnesses and Witness J, Plaintiff's roommate who was reportedly in the room during the alleged assault, had limited credibility because there were inconsistent reports about whether he was drinking that evening; 2) Plaintiff's claims regarding his lack of memory were \"contradicted by [his] own words to Witness K ... when he ... stated he 'wasted a condom because he couldn't cum' \"; 3) although both parties were drinking that evening, multiple witnesses corroborated Jane Doe's \"impairment and eventual incapacitation\"; 4) neither Witness I nor Jane Doe stated that Jane Doe had complained that Plaintiff had been unable to \"cum\"; 5) if Jane Doe had made such a comment, \"it was likely she was merely repeating what [Plaintiff] had told her when she regained consciousness during the assault\"-namely, that he had \"whiskey dick\"; and 6) there was little evidence that Plaintiff was incapacitated, as the witnesses indicated either they had not formed an opinion about his level of intoxication or he wasn't as drunk as Jane Doe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 222-24. In the conclusion section, Sirna noted Jane Doe was largely credible because Jane Doe had made statements to investigators \"against her own interest,\" including an admission she had doubted herself at Mercy Hospital and had engaged in sexual activity with Witness I following the assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 225. Sirna's report mentions Plaintiff thought he might also be a victim during his second interview, but the report does not analyze Plaintiff's complaint nor does it make any findings about these allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 184-225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Disciplinary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After reviewing Sirna's report, Parker determined a disciplinary hearing on the matter was warranted. Parker Dep. 73:8-15, ECF No. 103 at APP. 043. Parker emailed Plaintiff in January 2016 to inform him of this decision and discuss the report. Parker Dep. 95:14-96:4, ECF No. 103 at APP. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Jerry Foxhoven was serving as Drake's hearing officer at the time. Parker Dep. 102:7-21, ECF No. 103 at APP. 046. Foxhoven had received training regarding sexual misconduct. Foxhoven Dep. 11:18-12:17, ECF No. 103 at APP. 073. Prior to the hearing, Foxhoven issued a notice to all parties (Jane Doe, Parker, and Plaintiff) and their representatives explaining Foxhoven would not admit \"any testimony or evidence of the prior sexual conduct or mental health issues of either\" Jane Doe or Plaintiff. ECF No. 137 at APP. 230. Plaintiff's personal representative, Matt Kaiser, filed a motion seeking to admit\n   Witness I's statement that Jane Doe performed oral sex on him, arguing the ban on prior sexual conduct did not apply and that Jane Doe's actions were \"highly probative of her state of mind on that night and her capacity to consent mere hours earlier.\" ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 299. Foxhoven permitted Plaintiff to introduce evidence regarding Jane Doe's subsequent actions with Witness I to show Jane Doe's level of intoxication and thus her ability to consent. ECF No. 137 at APP 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Additionally, Foxhoven considered how much time each party (Jane Doe, Parker, and Plaintiff) should have to present their arguments during the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 294. Foxhoven first gave each party equal time to make closing and opening arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After considering Plaintiff's pre-hearing motion, Foxhoven determined both Jane Doe and Parker would each have five minutes for an opening statement and ten minutes for a closing, while Plaintiff was given ten minutes for an opening statement and up to twenty minutes for a closing statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 234. After Parker argued Title IX requires all parties to be treated equally, however, Foxhoven amended his earlier decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 227. Under the amended order, Plaintiff and Jane Doe would both have five minutes for opening argument and ten minutes for closing argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Parker was given five minutes for both his closing and opening statements, although his argument was limited to \"any position that is inconsistent with the position of [Jane Doe].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The disciplinary hearing was held on February 12, 2016. ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 236. After Jane Doe's personal representative gave her opening statement, Parker stated during his opening statement that, based on all the evidence available to the Dean of Students' Office, the Office \"found [Jane Doe]'s account of this incident as being more credible\" and thus recommended \"the appropriate sanction be expulsion.\" Pl.'s Sealed App. Supp. Pl.'s Resp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at APP. 570-71, ECF No. 118-6. During his opening statement, Plaintiff's personal representative explained \"the two people who were involved were both blackout drunk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 571. During a later portion of his opening statement, however, Plaintiff's personal representative argued, based on the timeline of the evening, \"[w]e can know that [Jane Doe] was not incapacitated by looking at [the] window of 45 minutes ... incapacitation doesn't turn on a dime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 575-76. Based on Plaintiff's personal representative's statement that both Plaintiff and Jane Doe were \"blackout drunk\" during the events of the evening, Foxhoven amended his previous order regarding the admissibility of Jane Doe's actions after she left Plaintiff's room.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 596-98. Foxhoven explained because his order permitting the evidence was premised on the issue of whether Jane Doe was incapacitated and Plaintiff's personal representative's concession that Jane Doe was \"blackout drunk\" made her incapacitation no longer a contested issue, Jane Doe's subsequent actions were irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 596, 597. Thus, Plaintiff was not permitted to inquire into Jane Doe's actions with Witness I or Student P after leaving his room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Along with Jane Doe and Plaintiff, eleven witnesses testified at the disciplinary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 559-61.

However, for the first time, Jane Doe also testified that because she often experiences pain when she has vaginal intercourse, she did not believe she would have consented to having vaginal intercourse with Plaintiff. ECF No. 118-6 at APP. 590. Plaintiff's personal representative did not submit a question about the pain Jane Doe experiences during vaginal intercourse for Foxhoven to ask during Jane Doe's cross examination.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 611-22 (transcript showing Foxhoven asked Jane Doe various questions submitted by Plaintiff's personal representative but not about the pain Jane Doe experiences during vaginal intercourse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff called two individuals who had not been interviewed by Sirna: Student S and Student T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 560.

However, Plaintiff did call Student T, who was also present during that conversation. ECF No. 118-6 at APP. 560. Student T testified that, although Plaintiff confirmed he had \"hooked up\" with Jane Doe the previous night, he did not remember Plaintiff ever saying he had \"wasted a condom\" on Jane Doe. ECF No. 118-8 at APP. 751. Plaintiff's personal representative also did not call Student P, the individual Jane Doe jumped on after leaving Plaintiff's room, although Plaintiff's personal representative argued to Foxhoven that investigators should have interviewed Student P in order to establish a timeline for the evening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 619, 620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On February 17, 2016, Foxhoven filed his order regarding the case. ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 236-46. Foxhoven determined first \"that a preponderance of evidence supports the fact that vaginal intercourse between [Jane Doe] and [Plaintiff] was either attempted or completed on the evening in question .... In any event, it is clear that [Plaintiff] touched the genitals of [Jane Doe] on the evening in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 237. Foxhoven also noted no one else appeared to be present in the room during their interaction and \"[n]o sexual exam of [Jane Doe] was completed, resulting in a lack of definitive evidence of a sexual assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Foxhoven based his determination on the fact that although Jane Doe was \"not conscious during the assault,\" she awoke to Plaintiff \"violating\" her, \"[h]er pants were off,\" Plaintiff stated he had \"whiskey dick,\" and that when Jane Doe left the fraternity house, \"walking was painful in a way that indicated to her that she had been subjected to vaginal sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Foxhoven also determined \"a preponderance of evidence supports the fact that [Jane Doe] did not give her consent to the sexual contact in question,\" as she was incapacitated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Foxhoven considered the following facts in making his decision: 1) Jane Doe's testimony that she experiences pain when having vaginal intercourse and thus does not have vaginal intercourse unless she is comfortable and trusts her partner, \"[n]one of [which] apply to the relationship between [Jane Doe] and [Plaintiff]\"; 2) testimony from Witnesses C, F, A, E, L, H, B, and G as to Jane Doe's level of intoxication; and 3) the argument of \"[Plaintiff] and his counsel ... that both [Plaintiff] and [Jane Doe] were 'black out drunk' on the night in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237-40. Foxhoven also noted although Witness H stated upon initial contact with Jane Doe, he was not aware of anything that would have led him to believe Jane\n   Doe was intoxicated, \"he further testified that he believed that the complainant was extremely intoxicated by the fact that she was vomiting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Foxhoven next discussed Plaintiff's position that he was also incapacitated in a section entitled \"[Plaintiff]'s Argument of Mitigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 241. As to Plaintiff's argument \"that he was basically 'blacked-out' and that, therefore, he should not be held responsible for his conduct,\" Foxhoven determined Plaintiff's account lacked credibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, Foxhoven concluded although Plaintiff had been drinking that evening, the evidence showed he was \"clearly more in control of himself than [Jane Doe]\" and was aware of her level of intoxication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Foxhoven based this determination on: 1) statements from Witnesses C and L and Student S regarding Plaintiff's level of intoxication at Drake Bakery and when entering the fraternity house; 2) Witness B's statement that, although Plaintiff was intoxicated that evening, Jane Doe was more intoxicated during the sober cab ride; 3) Witness E's testimony regarding Plaintiff's actions and ability to \"pack[ ] a bowl\" in the bathroom at Theta Chi while Jane Doe vomited; 4) Witness H's comment that Plaintiff did not seem intoxicated; 5) Witness G's testimony that Plaintiff told him he \"had the situation handled\" in reference to Jane Doe's vomiting; and 6) Plaintiff's testimony indicating \"that he was able to call the 'sober cab' \" and had likely punched in the security code to enter the fraternity house, although he stated he did not remember doing so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 241-43. Foxhoven's findings did not address Plaintiff's complaint that he did not consent to Jane Doe giving him oral sex in the car before his alleged assault of Jane Doe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Based on his findings, Foxhoven recommended Plaintiff be expelled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 245. Acknowledging Plaintiff's personal representative's request Plaintiff be permitted to complete his degree, Foxhoven noted, due to Jane Doe's level of intoxication, Plaintiff's knowledge of Jane Doe's intoxication, and the \"particularly aggravating factor\" that the assault occurred after Jane Doe vomited, Foxhoven recommended expulsion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at APP. 244.

The panel determined Foxhoven's decision was supported by substantial evidence, explaining: 1) witnesses testified as to Plaintiff's and Jane Doe's differing level of intoxication; and 2) Plaintiff corroborated Jane Doe's testimony that Plaintiff had been using a\n   condom during a conversation with his friends the next day. ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 270.

Because Plaintiff does not resist Defendants' motion for summary judgment on this claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 111 \u00b6 6, the Court dismisses it. The Court next considers Plaintiff's claim for declaratory judgment (Count VIII). ECF No. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 248-52. The Court finds Count VIII does not state an independent basis for relief, but that the remedy of declaratory judgment may be applied to the other claims if applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court then turns to Plaintiff's Title IX claim (Count I).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169-88. The Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment for Count I under Plaintiff's Title IX erroneous outcome and deliberate indifference theories, but denies Defendants' motion for summary on Plaintiff's Title IX claim under his selective enforcement theory. The Court then analyzes Plaintiff's ADA claim (Count VI),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 235-40, and grants Defendants' motion summary judgment on that claim.

The Court grants summary judgment to Defendants on some, but not all, of Plaintiff's breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

ECF No. 111 \u00b6 6 (\"Plaintiff states that he will not proceed further with the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.\").

At the hearing on Defendants' motion, Plaintiff's counsel conceded the declaratory judgment he seeks cannot form the basis of a separate count. Mot. Summ. J. Hr'g Tr. 22:23-23:2, ECF No. 146. Consequently, to the extent Count VIII asserts an independent claim for relief, the Court grants Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court notes the relief Plaintiff requests in Count VIII references Plaintiff's other substantive claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 248-49 (referencing Plaintiff's previous counts and requesting declaratory judgment based on his assertion that \"Drake has committed numerous violations of the Parties' contracts and of federal and state law\"). Furthermore, Plaintiff reiterates these requests in his Prayer for Relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60. Consequently, although Count VIII fails to state an independent claim for relief, both Count VIII and Plaintiff's Prayer for Relief identify some permissible remedies for Plaintiff's other substantive counts. Specifically, all of Plaintiff's requested relief, except a declaration that \"Drake's Code is unconstitutional as applied\" may, if appropriate, be applied to the applicable counts discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court determines Plaintiff has not identified a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether gender bias caused an erroneous outcome in his disciplinary proceeding. Plaintiff also has not identified a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendants were deliberately indifferent toward Plaintiff by failing to investigate his claim that Jane Doe sexually assaulted him. Plaintiff has identified a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether gender affected Defendants' decision to selectively enforce a disciplinary process. The Court thus grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's Title IX claims under the erroneous outcome and deliberate indifference standards but denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment for Plaintiff's Title IX claims under the selective enforcement standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

ECF No. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 101-09, 142-47, 182. Specifically, Plaintiff contends Foxhoven erred by allowing Jane Doe to testify about her medical condition that made it painful for her to engage in vaginal intercourse, information that was not previously disclosed during the investigation, and which Foxhoven then relied on in determining whether Jane Doe had consented to sexual intercourse with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 144-45. Plaintiff likewise asserts there was insufficient medical or physical evidence supporting Jane Doe's claim that sexual intercourse occurred, noting Jane Doe did not get a sexual assault exam and did not provide the underwear she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault as evidence in the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-48. Plaintiff also contends Foxhoven erred by allowing Parker to present evidence and argument, arguing Parker was not an \"independent actor,\" as Foxhoven concluded, but instead presented evidence against Plaintiff and sought his expulsion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As to the appeals process, Plaintiff first contends Defendants refused to allow Plaintiff's father to present Plaintiff's appeal. ECF No. 46 \u00b6 153. Plaintiff additionally asserts the panel never heard the audio recording of the disciplinary hearing \"before rendering their short and vague affirmation of guilty against Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154. Rather, Plaintiff contends the panel was a \"rubber stamp\" for Foxhoven's findings. ECF No. 121 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   To show the alleged erroneous outcome was motivated by gender bias, Plaintiff asserts Defendants' actions, in general, during the investigation, the disciplinary hearing, and in making the ultimate decision to expel him reveal gender bias because they were taken against the weight of the evidence. ECF No. 121 at 15-24. Plaintiff also specifically contends the investigators, Foxhoven, Parker, and the appeals panel were all biased by the gender-based \"trauma trope,\" which allowed them to explain away Jane Doe's inconsistencies and \"counterintuitive\" behavior that would otherwise discredit her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Plaintiff also argues the \"trauma trope\" led Parker to testify that he would consider it \"slut shaming\" to imply Jane Doe's sexual activity after leaving Plaintiff's room was inconsistent with having been assaulted earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff contends Drake was \"victim centered\" against male respondents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. To show that being victim-centered means being gender-biased, Plaintiff points to evidence that most claims of sexual misconduct at Drake were brought by a female complainant against a male respondent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Plaintiff also asserts the Policy is gender-biased against respondents, who are \"disproportionately\" male, because it provides resources to complainants and labels them as \"survivors.\" ECF No. 46 \u00b6 185; ECF No. 121 at 27. Plaintiff further asserts the general purpose of the \"female protectionist nature of campus sex tribunals\" is a \"misconceived political effort to undercut fairness for respondents.\" ECF No. 121 at 27. This political pressure, Plaintiff argues, stems\n   from a April 2011 \"Dear Colleague Letter\" issued by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights which called on universities to improve their sexual assault review process or risk losing federal funding. ECF No. 121 at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff's Title IX claim cannot survive Defendants' motion for summary judgment under an erroneous outcome theory. Plaintiff fails on the second prong of his erroneous outcome claim as a matter of law. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, no reasonable jury could find the undisputed facts show Defendants' actions were motivated by gender bias. Because Plaintiff fails on the second prong of the erroneous outcome test, the Court need not address the first prong-whether there is articulable doubt as to the accuracy of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, no reasonable jury could find Defendants' choices regarding the investigative report and the disciplinary hearing were inherently gender-biased because Defendants found a male respondent responsible for sexual assault. Plaintiff asserts Defendants' \"[r]eliance on hearsay and crediting the female complainant despite the accumulated evidence reflected a gender biased reaching for a conclusion that objective evidence did not permit.\" ECF No. 121 at 16. Plaintiff points to, among other things, Sirna's decisions to interview some witnesses and not others, ECF No. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 102-104, Sirna's finding that Plaintiff's roommate's testimony was not credible,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101, and Foxhoven's characterization that Plaintiff argued he was intoxicated to avoid responsibility, ECF No. 121 at 22. Plaintiff also cites other evidence he claims is objective, such as his erectile dysfunction and Jane Doe's decision not to be medically examined after the alleged assault, that he claims call for an opposite conclusion than the one made by Defendants. ECF No. 121 at 16. In sum, Plaintiff argues that Defendants viewed the evidence through a gender-biased lens in a way that disfavored Plaintiff and favored the female complainant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), some courts have found that an action by a university official during the disciplinary process can raise a plausible inference of gender bias.\n   <em>\n    Prasad v.

Plaintiff also asserts Parker's testimony that he would consider it \"slut-shaming\" to imply sexual activity after being assaulted was inconsistent behavior for a victim was a gender-biased comment. ECF No. 121 at 25. Plaintiff retained an expert witness who opined Sirna and other officials justified Jane Doe's \"inconsistent behaviors\" and memories and thought Jane Doe could reasonably \"behave in any way whatsoever post-assault.\" Pl.'s Sealed App. Supp. Pl.'s Resp.

Plaintiff cannot show the trauma-based theories used by Defendants were used because Plaintiff is a man. The statements Plaintiff suggests demonstrate Sirna's victim-centric approach were gender-neutral. For instance, McKinney stated in her deposition that \"people behave differently\" after a traumatic event. McKinney Dep. 50:6-51:22, ECF No. 118-3 at APP. 285. When Sirna was asked if she thought Jane Doe's behavior directly after the traumatic event was relevant to her credibility, Sirna stated: \"victims often engage in counterintuitive behavior after a sexual assault. It's very common for them to want to regain control, and so they go and they have sex that's consensual with somebody else.\" Sirna Dep. 172:9-15, ECF No. 118-5 at APP. 457;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Sealed App. Supp. Pl.'s Resp.

Plaintiff argues a system focused on victims, even if stated in gender-neutral terms, is gender-biased because victims are women. ECF No. 121 at 26. Plaintiff asserts \"females being both victims and accused\" is a \"theoretical but non-existent possibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365372\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/110/774/#p778\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff does not cite any evidence for this proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff argues the Policy is gender-biased because it provides resources for victims and lists ways to prevent sexual assault but does not provide any resources for accused students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. But these sections also use gender-neutral language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Sealed App. Supp. Pl.'s Resp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at APP. 087-117, ECF No. 118-1. Moreover, the Policy itself states it \"applies regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\" ECF No. 118-1 at APP. 099. Plaintiff asserts the gender-neutral language is \"a pretext for Drake's anti-male discrimination.\" ECF No. 46 \u00b6 50. Notwithstanding his conclusory allegations discussed here, Plaintiff does not show how victim-centric or trauma-informed language reveals a gender-biased approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here, at the summary judgment stage when Plaintiff has had the opportunity to review discovery to demonstrate gender bias, the Court finds Plaintiff is unable to do so. Without more, a jury could find the statements and decisions by Defendants and the Policy itself reveal a victim-centered, trauma-informed approach, but could not find they reveal a bias toward one gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Third, no reasonable jury could find the data about the gender of those accused of sexual misconduct at Drake reveal Defendants operated their nonacademic disciplinary\n   procedure with gender-biased motives. Plaintiff asserts that because all 51 respondents in sexual misconduct disciplinary proceedings at Drake during the 2015-2016 academic year were male, the disciplinary system is infected with gender bias. ECF No. 121 at 26. Defendants point out the tracking chart provided by the Drake University Title IX coordinator indicates that although no respondents for sexual misconduct are labeled as female, there is no information provided about the gender of the respondent in numerous cases. ECF No. 135 at 1 n.1;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 118-13 at APP. 1195-1254. Even when viewing the statistics as Plaintiff presents them, this data is not enough to show gender bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Courts have declined to infer a gender-biased motive on the part of university officials from the disparity in gender among those who are accused of sexual assault, noting that schools are not responsible for which students choose to report sexual misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

In noting the allegations were sufficient to raise an inference of gender bias at the motion to dismiss stage, the Sixth Circuit noted \"[d]iscovery may reveal that the alleged patterns of gender-based decision-making do not, in fact, exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p592\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515976\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/579/#p592\">\n    at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, the court finds the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Boston College\n   </em>\n   more persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Boston College\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit reasoned \"after the parties have engaged in substantial discovery, a complete lack of evidence-whether direct or circumstantial-will not allow a party to survive a motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiff asserts the \"Dear Colleague Letter\" pressured universities to create tribunals with the purpose of finding men responsible for sexual assault or risk losing federal funding. ECF No. 121 at 26-27; ECF No. 46 \u00b6\u00b6 20, 51.

Plaintiff contends Parker's statement that Drake would not investigate Plaintiff's claim of sexual assault because it was a form of retaliation indicates deliberate indifference. ECF No. 121 at 33-34. Defendants contend Plaintiff's claim fails because one assault does not constitute a \"systematic\" denial of an education program and Drake's conduct did not cause Plaintiff's alleged assault or make him vulnerable to it. ECF No. 104 at 23-24. As explained below, the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to this theory because Plaintiff has not shown how Defendants' alleged inaction subjected him to harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For a school to incur liability under a Title IX deliberate indifference claim, \"it must be (1) deliberately indifferent (2) to known acts of discrimination (3) which occur under its control.\"\n   <em>\n    Shrum ex rel.

Both the disciplinary proceedings against Plaintiff and his ultimate expulsion were triggered by Jane Doe's complaint, rather than by Plaintiff's own assertions regarding the sexual assault he allegedly experienced. Significantly, Plaintiff concedes Defendants were required to investigate Jane Doe's complaint against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 121 at 30.

These factual questions make it impossible for the Court to grant Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's selective enforcement claim. In considering Defendants' motion as to this claim, the Court addresses\n   two factual questions. First, were Plaintiff and Jane Doe treated equally when they brought their respective complaints of sexual misconduct?

The Dean of Students then investigated the complaint, a process required by the Code. ECF No. 137 at APP. 116.

Overberg Dep. 63:6-12, ECF No. 103 at APP. 027. In response, Overberg set up a time for Plaintiff to meet with investigators Sirna and McKinney to talk about his allegations. Overberg Dep. 87:5-10, ECF No. 103 at APP. 031. Overberg also instructed Sirna and McKinney to ask Plaintiff if he wanted to initiate a conduct charge against Jane Doe and to get all the relevant information from him about it.

If Plaintiff was discouraged from filing his complaint, then Jane Doe and Plaintiff would be similarly situated-they both were in the position to initiate complaints of sexual misconduct. Jane Doe was successful in initiating formal disciplinary proceedings. Plaintiff was not. Plaintiff claims he chose not to initiate his complaint because he was told it would be retaliatory. Pl.'s Dep. 151:13-152:25, 153:14-154:5, ECF No. 118 at APP. 38-39.

Parker Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 306. The Code includes a general prohibition of retaliation. The Code states: \"[r]etaliation occurs when action is taken against another because they have sought guidance, filed [a] complaint or participated in an investigation.\" ECF No. 137 at APP. 115. \"Examples of retaliation include, but are not limited to, any action that has an adverse impact on the complainant's employment, compensation or work assignments, or, in the case of students, grades, class selection or any other matter pertaining to [the] student.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267790\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/238/195/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at APP. 115-16. This same language was included in the email that Plaintiff received initially informing him he was the subject of a complaint. ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 152-53. These general warnings against retaliatory actions, although not an exhaustive list, do not specifically mention counter-complaints of sexual misconduct against a student's accuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiff alleges he was told a counter-complaint would be retaliatory, Pl.'s Dep. 153:14-154:5, ECF No. 118 at APP. 39, and the general warning against retaliation in the Code does not list counter-complaints as an example of retaliatory action. ECF No. 137 at APP. 115-16. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find Plaintiff was dissuaded from filing a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   There is also a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the allegations of Plaintiff and Jane Doe were treated differently and whether this disparate treatment was motivated by gender. It is undisputed Plaintiff told the Dean of Students he might be a victim of sexual assault. Overberg Dep. 62:15-63:12, ECF No. 103 at APP. 27. It is disputed, however, if the Dean of Students investigated or dismissed his complaint. According to the Code, the Dean of Students can initiate an investigation of sexual misconduct. ECF No. 137 at APP. 116. Plaintiff contends Parker told his father on a phone call before the disciplinary hearing that \"Drake would not be investigating [Plaintiff's] claim because they believed [Plaintiff's] claim to be retaliatory.\" Rossley Sr. Decl. \u00b6 10, ECF No. 118-13 at APP. 1180. Defendants, however, contend Plaintiff's complaint was \"effectively investigated and adjudicated and found to be without merit.\" ECF No. 104 at 20. As evidence of the investigation of Plaintiff's allegations, Defendants rely on Sirna's findings from the investigation and Foxhoven's ruling after the disciplinary hearing that indicated Plaintiff lacked credibility. ECF No. 103-1 at APP. 220-25, 241. Sirna and Foxhoven, however, made this credibility determination about Plaintiff regarding Jane Doe's allegations of sexual assault by Plaintiff-not specifically about Plaintiff's allegations of sexual assault by Jane Doe. Thus, there is a dispute of material fact as to how Plaintiff's allegations of sexual misconduct by Jane Doe-and subsequent decision not to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Jane Doe-were treated by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Although Defendants claim Plaintiff cannot allege facts to show any possible disparate treatment was motivated by gender, the disputed facts themselves-whether an arguably similarly situated man and woman were treated differently-raise the specter of gender bias. Defendants have provided different explanations for their approach to Plaintiff's allegations. Parker is reported to have told Plaintiff's father that Plaintiff's complaint would not be investigated, while Defendants have argued that the allegations were investigated and found to be without merit. ECF No. 118-13 at APP. 1180; ECF No. 104 at 20. These differing explanations can be evidence of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v.

This inquiry of gender-based motivations is distinct from the inquiry of gender bias in Plaintiff's erroneous outcome claim.

As to the plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim, the court noted although it was unclear whether a student's failure to follow a formal procedure nullified an informal request for an accommodation, the plaintiff's argument was ultimately moot as the plaintiff testified she had attempted to comply with the formal procedure and had previously received accommodations outside the school's formal process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1296 &amp; n.25. Additionally, in examining the defendant's decision to dismiss the plaintiff, the court ultimately determined the plaintiff was not a \"qualified individual\" during her clinical rotation as she had not identified or requested the reasonable accommodations that would permit her to satisfy the program's essential requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n    at 1293-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   thus stands for the proposition that formal requests may not be required, particularly when informal requests have previously been granted,\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   First, unlike Plaintiff, the\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's informal requests actually identified the accommodations she was requesting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n    at 1296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff has not identified any informal requests he made during the disciplinary process that specified the accommodations he now contends were necessary. Second, as noted above, the\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   court ultimately determined the plaintiff had not requested a reasonable accommodation during her clinical rotation, and was thus not a \"qualified individual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339928\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/165/1274/\">\n    at 1293-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, Plaintiff only points to his past requests for academic accommodations to support his claim that Defendants were on constructive notice as to his requests for accommodations during the investigation and subsequent hearings. Although Plaintiff asserts his academic accommodations put Defendants on notice of his need for the disciplinary accommodations he now identifies, the academic accommodations addressed different contexts than the disciplinary procedures set out in the Code and the Policy. For instance, \"time and a half\" during an exam is not procedurally or substantively comparable to \"time and a half\" during a disciplinary procedure involving credibility and factual determinations. Furthermore, while there was no formal process to request accommodations during the disciplinary procedure, to receive academic accommodations Plaintiff had previously, he had to, at the very least, affirmatively approach a professor regarding his request and identify the particular accommodations he needed. He stated the disability coordinator had told him he needed to be more \"accountable\" regarding this affirmative responsibility. Pl.'s Dep. 230:2-24, ECF No. 118 at APP. 058. Thus, although he may not have been required to follow a formal procedure to request an accommodation, Plaintiff understood he must, at a minimum, ask that his disabilities be accommodated. As discussed above, he failed to do so during the disciplinary procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   is similarly distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit considered the plaintiff's failure to accommodate claim under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting the school \"must know or be reasonably\n   expected to know of [the plaintiff]'s handicap\" to be liable under the Act, the court ultimately concluded there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the school was on notice of the accommodations the plaintiff sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n    at 1381, 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the court noted either the school was on constructive notice due to the plaintiff's repeated statements that she was unable to attend the school without an accommodation, or the school was on direct notice due to the plaintiff's \"direct requests for accommodations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n    at 1382-83, 1387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   provides a closer fit to the facts at issue here than\n   <em>\n    Redding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   is also ultimately distinguishable. First, unlike Plaintiff, the student in\n   <em>\n    Nathanson\n   </em>\n   repeatedly requested a particular accommodation (a type of desk) as it applied to her general ability to attend school.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547474\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1368/\">\n    at 1381-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, while Plaintiff requested and received academic accommodations, he did not request such accommodations for his disciplinary procedures. Rather, his requests were specifically directed to his academic pursuits. Plaintiff did not indicate that, due to his disabilities, he would be unable to participate in the investigation or subsequent hearings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, to the extent the court determined constructive notice triggers some duty to accommodate absent a request for an accommodation, the Court is bound by Eighth Circuit precedent to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mershon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063861\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/1069/#p1076\">\n    442 F.3d at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting under both Title III of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a party bringing a failure to accommodate claim \"bears the initial burden of demonstrating that he requested reasonable accommodations, and that those accommodations would render him otherwise qualified for admission\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierre v.

Mot. Summ. J. Hr'g Tr. 52:5-14, ECF No. 146.

For the reasons set forth above, Rossley, Sr. could not request an accommodation for his adult son and Defendants were not required to engage with Plaintiff in response to his father's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Finally, even if Plaintiff's father could request an accommodation for his adult son, the record does not provide any indication of what accommodations Rossley, Sr. specifically requested.

This declaration does not indicate what accommodations were necessary in the hearing, which accommodations Rossley, Sr. believed should have been provided during the investigation, and how Defendants should accommodate Plaintiff's disabilities. Although Plaintiff received academic accommodations, as noted above, those accommodations were provided in a separate process and involved accommodations for different requirements under the Code.

Looking at the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court thus determines there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Plaintiff, his attorney, or his father, requested any reasonable accommodations. Because Plaintiff is required to show he requested such an accommodation as a basis for his ADA claim, the Court thus grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

For purposes of summary judgment, Defendants concede the Code and the Policy constitute contracts under Iowa state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 104 at 34. Defendants argue Plaintiff's contractual claims fail because: 1) Plaintiff cannot show Defendants violated any contractual rights due to him under the Code or the Policy, including the requirement to conduct a fair hearing; 2) Plaintiff's covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim would alter the terms of the contract; and 3) the Code and the Policy explained all of the\n   promises made to Plaintiff, and by conducting a fair and equitable hearing, Defendants kept their promise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Court first considers whether Plaintiff's claims asserting estoppel and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing are subsumed by his claim alleging breach of contract. Determining they are, the Court next examines whether Plaintiff has identified genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants breached their contractual duties to Plaintiff under the Code or Policy. The Court finds Plaintiff has shown that some, but not all, of the alleged breaches include genuine issues of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Estoppel &amp; covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Counts IV and VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In Count VII, Plaintiff asserts a claim for estoppel and reliance.

Because Plaintiff asserts he suffered harm after reasonably relying on \"representations and promises\" by Defendants, the Court understands Plaintiff to be making a promissory estoppel, rather than equitable estoppel, claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Under Iowa law, \"[t]he theory of promissory estoppel allows individuals to be held liable for their promises despite an absence of the consideration typically found in a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Schoff v.

A Drake student also \"acknowledges the right of the University to initiate disciplinary procedures when an allegation or a complaint of non-academic misconduct is made and to impose disciplinary sanctions when it has been determined that non-academic misconduct has occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Plaintiff has not pointed to any genuine issue of material fact beyond his opinions about partiality and unfairness, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to these alleged breaches of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   However, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to Plaintiff's claim that Defendants breached the contract by failing to conduct an equitable investigation of Plaintiff's allegations against Jane Doe. There is also a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this failure was motivated by sex discrimination. The Code requires the Dean of Students conduct investigations into student complaints of sexual misconduct. ECF No. 137 at APP. 116. There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Plaintiff filed a complaint, what Defendants decided to do with Plaintiff's complaint if it was initiated, and, finally, if any of these decisions were the result of sex discrimination. A jury must weigh the evidence to answer these questions and determine if Defendants breached their contract with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amherst Coll.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267790\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/238/195/#p223\">\n    238 F.Supp.3d at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding the specific factual allegations that \"the [defendant] responded differently to similar reports when the genders of the potential victims and aggressors were different\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   sufficient to show a breach of an agreement to hold a fair hearing to survive a motion for a judgment on the pleadings). Thus, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied as to the alleged breaches of contract that Defendants failed to conduct an equitable investigation of Plaintiff's claim and Defendants discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff did not contend dismissal of his negligent infliction of emotional distress claim. Plaintiff did not request a reasonable accommodation and thus cannot maintain his ADA claim. Plaintiff has not identified genuine issues of material fact to support his deliberate indifference and erroneous outcome claims under Title IX. The Court thus grants summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim, his ADA claim, and his Title IX claim under his erroneous outcome and deliberate indifference theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   However, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants selectively enforced their Code and Policy against Plaintiff in violation of Title IX. The Court thus denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Title IX claim under a selective enforcement theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Plaintiff may not maintain an independent claim for declaratory judgment, so the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to that claim. Plaintiff's estoppel and covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims are subsumed by his other contractual claims. Consequently, Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's estoppel and covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   However, there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants breached their contract with Plaintiff by failing to investigate his claim of sexual misconduct. The Court denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's contract claims as to these two breaches. Summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendants on all of Plaintiff's other breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants' Motion for a Summary Judgment, ECF No. 99, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Title IX claim (Count I) under Plaintiff's erroneous outcome and deliberate indifference theories. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Title IX claim (Count I) under Plaintiff's selective enforcement theory. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim (Count III) regarding Defendants' failure to conduct an equitable investigation and to apply a proper burden of proof. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim (Count III) regarding the Defendants' failure to investigate Plaintiff's allegations of sexual misconduct and its discrimination against Plaintiff on the basis of sex. The Court finds Plaintiff's estoppel and covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims (Counts IV and VII) are subsumed by Plaintiff's breach of contract claim and thus\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts IV and VII. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count V) is not resisted by Plaintiff and is thus\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   . The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's ADA claim (Count VI). Plaintiff's claim for a declaratory judgment\n   (Count VIII) does not constitute an independent claim of relief. The Court thus\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Count VIII for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The parties are responsible for their own costs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    The Policy governs conduct of students, employees, and certain third parties.
