PRATT, Judge\n   Before the Court is Defendants WHO Television, LLC and Tribune Media Company's Motion for Summary Judgment, filed on June 13, 2018. ECF. No. 47. Plaintiffs filed a resistance on July 5, 2018, ECF. No. 57, and Defendants filed a Reply on July 12, 2018. ECF No. 58. The Court heard oral argument on August 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 65. The matter is fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   James Nelle is the owner of Roof One Exteriors LLC, Roof One of Iowa LLC, and Roof One Nebraska, LLC, which are construction companies and \"storm chaser\" businesses that travel to storm-damaged areas to try and solicit work. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 11. Roof One Exteriors LLC (Roof One) operates out of Winterset, Iowa, where Nelle lives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Roof One Nebraska, LLC was dissolved on June 2, 2015, and reinstated on August 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. It is the practice of at least some construction companies, and Nelle and Roof One, to use contingency contracts, wherein the contractor is paid the amount of the insurance payout for storm repair to a home, and the homeowner pays only the insurance deductible on the homeowner's policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-18; ECF 54-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the summer of 2015, Mary Gregory of Winterset, Iowa called Nelle to examine her house for hail damage. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 29. Nelle and Gregory knew each other in passing from the veterinarian's office where Gregory worked. ECF No. 54-2, 4:2-7. On July 6, 2015, they signed a contract for home repair (the Contract). ECF No. 47-1, \u00b6 29. Gregory kept the pink carbon copy for her records. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 31. The contract provides, among other things, that it does not obligate either party until it is approved by Gregory's insurance provider; that the price will be the agreed amount with the insurance provider; that Roof One Exteriors LLC will receive the total payout from the insurance company; and that Gregory will only have to pay the deductible on her insurance policy. ECF Nos. 47-18, 47-19. The contract has a space for payment schedules and a line for \"Total Price of Job.\" On the second page of the contract are additional provisions, including line 4, \"THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS OF ANY KIND,\" and line 7, a liquidated damages provision of twenty-five percent of the contract price in case of cancelation. ECF No. 47-19. In Gregory's copy of the contract, the line next to \"Total Price of Job\" is blank. ECF No. 47-18. In the copy in Nelle's possession, and later sent in a demand letter to Gregory, the \"Total Price of Job\" line is filled in with \"$32,134.86 + any supplement.\" ECF Nos. 47-19, 47-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sometime later, Nelle returned to Gregory's house for a walk-around damage inspection with her insurance adjustor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54-6; ECF No. 54-2, 5:1-6:19. Gregory then received a scope of insurance form from her insurance company, which she gave to Nelle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54-2, 11:17-19; ECF No. 54-6; ECF No. 54-16. The scope of insurance lays out the damage the insurance company found, what it will cover, Gregory's deductible, and the total payout it will provide for repairs. Nelle filled in the total amount of the scope of insurance, ECF No. 54-16, into his copy of the contract. Plaintiffs contend Gregory was present when Nelle filled the numbers in, and Nelle would later tell a reporter that Gregory could not find her\n   own copy of the contract when they filled the numbers in. ECF No. 54-2, 13:6-8; ECF No. 54-6, 9:1-14. Gregory, for her part, would instead tell a reporter that she did not know where the numbers came from.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-6, 52:10-19. Gregory did not sign or initial the changes on Nelle's copy of the contract, and the price term changes are not reflected in her own copy. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When construction supplies started to arrive at Gregory's house in August 2015, she was surprised and called another contractor she had solicited a bid from, David Falke, and asked if they were for him. ECF No. 47-10 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Falke went to Gregory's house and determined they were not his supplies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Falke was also shown paperwork Gregory had received from Nelle and Roof One.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Falke was concerned, as he did not see a price term on the document, and believed Gregory thought it was a contract for an estimate, rather than a contract for repair work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nelle also came to the house, and Falke perceived Nelle to be using high pressure sales tactics against Gregory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Gregory decided she did not want Roof One Exteriors to do the repairs and rejected building supplies sent to her house, she received a demand letter from Mark L. Smith, a lawyer representing Roof One. ECF No. 47-20. The letter was dated August 25, 2015, and sought liquidated damages of $8033.72 for backing out of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter referred to a \"total agreed upon payment\" of $32,134.86 plus supplements, and included a copy of Nelle's version of the contract, featuring the filled-in price term without any initials or signatures next to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gregory in turn informed Falke of the demand letter, and Falke contacted WHO-TV to express his concerns about the blank-price contract and Nelle's actions as he understood them. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. WHO-TV is an NBC affiliate television station, incorporated in Delaware, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tribune Media Company. It broadcasts in central Iowa, and is located in Des Moines, but its stories are also posted online.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Falke spoke with a reporter for WHO-TV, Aaron Brilbeck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Falke provided Brilbeck with his story about Gregory's situation, Gregory's copy of the contract with Roof One Exteriors, and the demand letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brilbeck, interested in what he heard, began to investigate the story. He spoke first with Gregory, on September 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Gregory told him the following story, which would air on WHO-TV as the lead news story that same night: Gregory believed she signed a request for an estimate from Nelle and Roof One Exteriors that did not obligate her to use Roof One Exteriors for repairs; she was surprised and did not know why roofing supplies were being sent to her house; she was not present when the price term was filled into Nelle's copy of the contract and did not know how it got there; and the first time she learned of it was when she received the demand letter that sought damages from her for breach of contract. ECF 47-6, 52:1-119; ECF No. 47-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Brilbeck then went to speak to Nelle at his home and place of business. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 47. Upon arrival, Brilbeck introduced himself as a reporter from WHO-TV and asked Nelle about Gregory and the contract. Parts of the interview with Nelle were recorded, including an earlier part on Nelle's doorstep and a second part inside Nelle's house. ECF No. 54-2, 2:1-3:19. Although the two go in circles a few times, the fundamentals are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nelle explained, several times, how he does business and how he believed he worked with Gregory. ECF No. 54-2, 4:1-24, 5:16-24, 7:20-24, 29:11-30:5. He goes door-to-door or by appointment, largely in\n   storm-damaged areas. After a storm, a homeowner files an insurance claim and an adjustor comes out, assesses the damage, and writes a check to the homeowner consistent with the policy. Nelle meets with a potential client before that event and they sign a contingency contract, which obligates the person to give Nelle and Roof One Exteriors the amount the insurance agrees to pay in total for repairs. In return, Nelle and Roof One Exteriors do all the home-repair work, and Nelle works with the insurance adjustor to ensure that the claim is as robust as possible. Nelle told Brilbeck that the price contract is blank because the final payout is determined by the insurance company, but the contingency contract is signed before the specific payout from the insurance contract is approved. Nelle explained that the contract is not for a specific price term, but for the \"scope of insurance\" that is filled in once they hear from the insurance company, and that the contract is not affected by the amount of the scope. Nelle conceded that Gregory did not sign or initial the addition of the price term to the contract, but insists that she sat next to him when he filled it in, and that he did not have her do that because he did not think she would back out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:9-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nelle also told Brilbeck that Gregory called him to seek an estimate and that he sat down and filled out a contract with Gregory that only obligated her if the insurance company agreed to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:17-25. Nelle told Brilbeck he put a bid together and then met with Gregory's insurance adjustor,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:16-24, and increased her claim only about $6000 to the $32,000 of damages reflected in the scope of insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:21-7:2. Nelle told Brilbeck that Gregory reached out to him when she received the scope of insurance and they filled in the price on his copy of the contract together.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29:11-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Brilbeck, in response, returned to the added price term. He asked Nelle how anyone else would know that Gregory knew the price term was put into the contract, because she did not sign or initial it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 54-2, 18:17-19:5. Brilbeck also told Nelle several times that he did not care about other parts of the story, and when Nelle offered to show Brilbeck the scope of the insurance contract to show where the price term came from, Brilbeck refused to even look at it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:22, 36:6-21. Brilbeck also accused Nelle at several points of cheating Gregory,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:19-22, 13:13-16, terrorizing her with the demand letter,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:5-7, and committing fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After speaking with Nelle, Brilbeck spoke with two other people for his first story. The first person was Falke, the construction contractor and competitor who had initially told Brilbeck about the story; and the second was a law professor at Drake University Law School named Robert Oberbillig. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first WHO-TV broadcast aired on September 1, 2015, the same day that Brilbeck interviewed Gregory, Nelle, Falke, and Oberbillig.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. The broadcast explained how Gregory's home was damaged and she believed she had signed an agreement for an estimate from Nelle and Roof One Exteriors. ECF No. 47-12. Instead, according to the story, she was \"conned.\" ECF No. 47-12 at 2. The story went on to say that the copy of the contract that went to the insurance company was altered, that Gregory did not authorize the $32,134.86 figure, and that Nelle added it to the contract after Gregory signed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The broadcast explained that she received a demand letter for more than $8000 after turning away workers from Roof One Exteriors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The story then turned to Nelle and Roof One Exteriors, and Brilbeck said in voice over that Roof One Exteriors \"alters\n   contracts all the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Brilbeck, in a clip from his interview with Nelle, stated that Nelle \"altered the contract illegally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The story then paraphrased Nelle's explanations of how he works, saying that Nelle added the figures to the contract after he got them from the insurance company, but that Gregory did not sign or initial the changes. Brilbeck then stated that \"Nelle says she agreed to it verbally ... even though his own contract states 'there are no oral agreements of any kind.' \" ECF No. 47-12 at 3. The broadcast then turned to Falke, who stated he had never seen a contract in which the numbers are filled in later and called it a \"scam\"; and to Oberbillig who opined that the document is not a contract because it is not completed. The broadcast ended with Gregory describing her hope that others do not get \"bilked\" like she did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day, WHO-TV aired a second broadcast. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 54. The follow-up broadcast included interviews with representatives from the Iowa Insurance Division and the Iowa Attorney General's office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It again referred to \"Roof One Exteriors of Winterset.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. It repeated many of the comments from the first story, including that Nelle altered the contract after Gregory signed it, and that he submitted it to the insurance company. The second story also included a clip in which Nelle stated he did not commit fraud, and Brilbeck responded, \"I disagree with you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This second story also explained that the Iowa Insurance Division and the Iowa Attorney General's office intended to investigate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nelle, upset about the broadcasts, called WHO-TV and spoke to news director Roderick Peterson. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6\u00b6 57-58. Peterson sent another reporter, Michael DaSilva, to have a conversation with Nelle to ensure the facts were accurate. DaSilva did not apparently see any reason to be concerned,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-9, 66:18-67:4, and no follow-up story ran at the time. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 2, 2016, WHO-TV ran another follow-up story. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 65. The story noted that the Iowa Insurance Division had cleared Roof One Exteriors of insurance fraud but that the Iowa Attorney General's office was still investigating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Unlike the previous two stories, this story explained that Nelle met with the insurance adjustor at Gregory's house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Gregory, however, stood by her statements in the story that Nelle filled in the costs without her and that she believed she was signing a request for an estimate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Iowa Attorney General began an investigation in April 2016, when the insurance division concluded its own investigation and did not find any evidence of wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. Ultimately, the Iowa Attorney General and Nelle entered into an Agreement of Voluntary Compliance (AVC) to correct certain business practices on August 5, 2016, and a public statement about that agreement was made on August 17, 2016. ECF No. 47-15. The AVC includes allegations that Roof One Exteriors improperly negotiated insurance claims on behalf of real estate owners, violated specific duties under the Iowa Door-to-Door Sales Act, misrepresented the nature of the work contract as an estimate, obtained signatures on documents that did not contain key terms, and sought liquidated damages that did not bear a reasonable relationship to anticipated actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. As part of the AVC, Nelle and Roof One Exteriors denied the allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit in Polk County District Court on February 22, 2017, alleging defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other things. ECF No. 1. Defendants removed the case to this Court on March 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On\n   June 13, 2018, Defendants filed the present Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The term \"summary judgment\" is something of a misnomer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.

Third, Defendants argue that Plaintiff Roof One Nebraska, LLC is not properly a party because the statements at issue were not \"of and concerning\" that party. Fourth, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that the actions involved rose to the level of outrageous conduct, made with the requisite intent, needed to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The parties do not agree about the\n    <em>\n     truth\n    </em>\n    of that report. In these circumstances, the truth or substantial truth of the statement is decidedly not a matter for the Court, but for the trier of fact.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Nelle's claim that the contract was not altered and that the price term was filled in with Gregory's knowledge and consent, is supported by ample record evidence to find a genuine dispute of material fact. Nelle has, both in his deposition and in his statements to Brilbeck, stated that he discussed the terms of the contract with Gregory; that he went back to her house when the scope of insurance arrived; and that he filled in the price terms on the contract on his document with Gregory present. ECF 47-3, 45:15-46:11; ECF No. 54-2, 18:17-18. There is text message evidence suggesting that Gregory and Nelle were in communication about the scope of insurance and intended to meet and discuss it. ECF No. 54-6. The third WHO-TV broadcast itself explained, in a shift from the previous two, that Nelle went to Gregory's house to work with the insurance adjustor to find damages, providing further support for Plaintiffs' version of events that Gregory was present when Nelle filled in the price terms. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6 70.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Further, the contract was a contingent contract, and obligated Gregory to pay only if the insurance company agreed to pay, with Gregory liable only for her deductible. That the contract included a \"blank\" price term, contingent on the scope of insurance given by the insurance company, does not necessarily mean that the contract was not otherwise valid in obligating Gregory to pay the insurance proceeds. To the extent that the contract was one for \"the scope of insurance\" rather than for a specific amount, filling in the price term later did not, in fact, change what Gregory was obligated to pay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    And contrary to the September WHO-TV broadcasts, the record contains no evidence to support the statements that Nelle or Roof One Exteriors submitted the yellow copy of the contract, with the scope of insurance numbers filled in, to Gregory's insurance company first. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6\u00b6 53, 56.

The fact that the contract was possibly not compliant with the law in some areas, as is suggested by the AVC (and that Nelle conceded he may have violated in his deposition) are not related to the \"gist\" of the WHO-TV broadcasts. Instead, these violations involve tertiary issues such as providing proper contact information, or the font and sizing of withdrawal rights. ECF No. 47-15 \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. Whether Roof One Exteriors committed these other violations in dealings with Gregory, is not relevant to the \"gist\" of the WHO-TV broadcasts. Further, the Iowa Attorney General's investigation and the AVC would not be binding on a fact-finder. Even if the AVC is some evidence of the substantial truth of Defendants' story, it cannot defeat summary judgment simply by its presence. Had Plaintiffs\n    <em>\n     admitted\n    </em>\n    misconduct in the AVC, circumstances may be different, but in fact Plaintiffs expressly denied any wrongdoing.

Defendants' broadcasts occurred on September 1 and 2, 2015, and May 2, 2016. The Iowa Attorney General did not issue a release about the AVC until August 17, 2016. ECF No. 47-16. All three broadcasts, in other words, occurred before any announcement from the Iowa Attorney General, and Plaintiffs' status for earlier stories could not have been affected by that later event. Neither are Plaintiffs public figures due to the apparent interest of the\n    Iowa Insurance Division and Iowa Attorney General in the September 2 broadcast, as that interest was sparked by Defendant's own actions in approaching those entities after the first broadcast aired. \"Clearly, those charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure.\"\n    <em>\n     Proxmire\n    </em>\n    , 443 U.S. at 135,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180640\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/111/\">\n     99 S.Ct. 2675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Wolston\n    </em>\n    , 443 U.S. at 167-68,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181102\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/157/#p167\">\n     99 S.Ct. 2701\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiffs are therefore private figures, bringing a claim of defamation against media defendants.

But, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the outside experts appear to have received incomplete explanations about the underlying facts, somewhat blunting their independence and leading them to \"pile on\" the narrative of wrongdoing.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , ECF No. 54-5, 3:22-4:2 (Oberbillig interview). So too to use Falke as the sole industry expert. Falke was the person who brought the story to WHO-TV in the first place, and who does not appear to know anything about contingency contracts, but was nonetheless the sole \"independent\" member of the roofing industry interviewed for the broadcasts. Defendants did not talk to anybody else in the \"storm industry\" to see if, as Nelle said, that was common practice.

Further, Nelle's evidence of physical, mental, and emotional issues can only qualify as \"parasitic\" harm, and cannot independently sustain an action for defamation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The record does, however, contain evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, that Nelle and Roof One Exteriors were harmed both financially and in reputation by Defendants. Defendants' own expert suggests there was at least some financial loss, even if not as much as Plaintiffs allege. ECF No. 47-40 \u00b6 26. Nelle testified in his deposition that he knocked on doors after the stories aired, along with his salesman, and that both were rebuffed, sometimes by people referencing Defendants' September broadcasts. ECF No. 47-4, 38:11-40:25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In support of reputational harm, Plaintiffs submit four affidavits. Two are from Mark Schmidt, who owns another Roof One-affiliated business, and Mattie Preston, a former customer of Nelle. ECF Nos. 54-13; 54-14. Both affidavits attest they had positive views about Nelle, viewed Defendants' broadcasts in September 2015, and as a result of those broadcasts and the suggestion within that Nelle engaged in fraud, had a more negative impression of Plaintiffs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    In addition, Plaintiffs submit an\n    affidavit from Harry Evans, general manager of Roof One Restoration in Missouri. ECF No. 54-12. Evans's affidavit states that he became aware of the news stories because customers and competitors of his in Missouri had brought them up, concerned that the story showed Nelle and Roof One Exteriors in Iowa defrauding customers.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11675010\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/585/217/#p224\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As a result, Evans had to explain that the Roof One Exteriors business in Iowa was separate from his business.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11675010\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/585/217/#p224\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In essence, Evans suggests the reputation of Roof One Exteriors in Iowa suffered as a result of the broadcasts, as did Evans's own business. Finally, Plaintiffs submit an affidavit from Maureen Nelle, James Nelle's ex-wife. ECF No. 54-11. Her affidavit states that while she did not believe the WHO-TV broadcasts, she knew other people who did and who perceived Nelle more negatively as a result.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Between the affidavits and the financial evidence, there is sufficient evidence of reputational harm to make a submissable case of defamation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Defendants challenge the extent of Plaintiffs' harms, primarily through two arguments. First, that some harm has been done by the public announcement of the AVC; and second, that weather patterns would have sharply decreased Plaintiffs' business regardless. These are valid issues, and Defendants are free to present them at trial to mitigate damages. But neither shows that there is no genuine dispute that Roof One Exteriors was not harmed at all, as would be necessary in order for the Court to grant summary judgment on the basis of damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    This Court is mindful of \"turning libel per quod into 'libel per se lite,' \" as the\n    <em>\n     Bierman\n    </em>\n    court cautioned.\n    <em>\n     Bierman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7066226\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/826/436/#p444\">\n     826 N.W.2d at 463\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

In contrast, Plaintiffs here have evidence of lost business opportunities and harm to reputation, from the affidavits of Evans, Maureen Nelle, Schmidt, and Preston.

The analysis of defamation by implication largely tracks the elements of libel per quod, and the Court will rest on its above analysis to the extent they are similar.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that a defendant has juxtaposed a series of facts so as to imply a defamatory connection between them, or created a defamatory implication by omitting facts even though the facts were correct.\n    <em>\n     Stevens v.

Defamation by implication comes from what is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    said in a statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that, by showing the contract in the background of the news reports, Defendants implied the existence of undisclosed information about the contract that supported Defendants' story. But Plaintiffs have made no showing as to what the underlying defamatory implication would be, or how it would be beyond the statements already made, explicitly, in the broadcast. Showing the contract in the background does not support a claim of defamation by implication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    There is a genuine dispute of material fact, however, as to whether Defendants' broadcasts omitted facts about the price term. In particular, the September broadcasts leave out the source of the price term, which was Gregory's scope of insurance. Defendants knew, or should have known, that the price term came from the scope of insurance from Gregory's insurance and was not a number Nelle made up for the purpose of charging Gregory more. Nelle told them as much, pointed Brilbeck to the contingency language in the contract, and the scope of insurance makes that clear. ECF No. 54-2, 36:1-21. Gregory's deductible, and therefore her out-of-pocket costs, remained the same before and after the price term was written in. Instead, however, one could watch the September broadcasts and have no idea where the price terms Nelle placed on the contacts originated, and believe the defamatory implication-bolstered by the broadcasts' statements that Nelle submitted his contract to the insurance company-that the price term was made up to charge Gregory and her insurance company more. These are implications Defendants should have known were unwarranted.

Nebraska is never mentioned, nor is the fact that other Roof One-related entities do business anywhere other than Winterset, or that other Roof One-related entities exist. The reports were broadcast in Iowa, by an Iowa station, about an explicitly Iowa company and location. There is no evidence the reports were intended to, tried, or did refer to anyone other than Nelle and \"Roof One Exteriors of Winterset,\" and no evidence that Roof One Nebraska, LLC was harmed. In addition, Roof One Nebraska, LLC was dissolved on June 2, 2015, months before the broadcast.

As the Court has noted, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the truth of the \"gist\" of the story. There is little evidence in the record to suggest, however, that Brilbeck or other members of the WHO-TV team subjectively knew, or harbored serious doubts, that the story was false. Brilbeck, Peterson, and DaSilva all stand by the story. ECF No. 47-1 \u00b6\u00b6 62-63, 71; ECF No. 47-9, 66:18-67:6. And while actual malice does not require a reporter to go on record with doubts, it is not satisfied by simple speculation that reporters doubt more than they let on. Various reporting failures that Plaintiffs complain of, including failure to investigate further,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Harte-Hanks\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p668\">\n     491 U.S. at 688\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218419\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/657/#p668\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , or not accepting a plaintiff's view of events,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Edwards v. Nat'l Audubon Soc'y, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956561\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/113/#p121\">\n     556 F.2d 113\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 121 (2nd Cir. 1977), similarly do not rise to the level of actual malice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    At its core, the story as Brilbeck heard it was a he said/she said debate. Gregory stated she thought she signed an estimate and was not present when the price term was added to the contract. Nelle says that Gregory signed a contract for work and that she was sitting next to him when he added the price term. Nowhere in Brilbeck's interview with Nelle, or in the rest of Brilbeck's reporting, is evidence provided that would tip the scales decisively, such that taking one side over the other could only happen over serious doubts. That Brilbeck chose to believe Gregory over Nelle does not support a finding of actual malice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The strongest evidence Plaintiffs point to is that Brilbeck refused to even look at\n    the scope of insurance when Nelle offered it. That is certainly avoidance of\n    <em>\n     something.\n    </em>\n    But even if Brilbeck had looked at the scope of insurance, the scope is not evidence that Gregory was present when Nelle filled in the price terms in their contract, or that Gregory knew she had actually signed a contract for work and was trying to back out. That is, by not looking at the scope, Brilbeck did not avoid viewing a document that would otherwise raise a high probability of falsehood. Nothing in the scope references Plaintiffs, and Nelle is as likely to have a copy of the scope of insurance for making an estimate as he is to do repair work. Nelle's own statement that he got the price term from Gregory's insurance company in fact made it into the original broadcast. ECF No. 47-12 (\"Nelle told us he added the figures after he got them from the insurance company.\"). That this statement made it into the broadcast makes it difficult to see what examining the scope of insurance would have\n    <em>\n     subjectively\n    </em>\n    provided to Brilbeck in investigating the story.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Plaintiffs argue, and the record is clear, that Brilbeck thought Nelle had cheated and terrorized Gregory, was committing fraud, and belonged in jail. But Plaintiffs do not point to anything in the record that suggests this led Brilbeck to ignore doubts about the story. If anything, the opposite is true. Brilbeck had no prior relationship with, or information about, Plaintiffs. The only reason Brilbeck harbored negative feelings was because he believed the negative story he was told. Other members of the news team, none of whom appear to have harbored the same feelings as Brilbeck, also stand by the reports, which suggests that any animus did not in fact lead Brilbeck to ignore doubts. The same is true of Brilbeck's apparent unhappiness that DaSilva was asked to go back and talk to Nelle again. This may well be circumstantial evidence of actual malice, but only if it were paired with some reason beyond speculation to think Brilbeck was nervous because he had ignored doubts he had in airing the story. There is none here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that evidence of actual malice can be found in the fact that Brilbeck did not air versions of the story more in sync with what Nelle told Brilbeck, and that WHO-TV did not air a follow-up story. So long as Defendants believed the broadcasts portrayed Nelle truthfully, however, there is no requirement that he be portrayed in a positive light, and Plaintiffs do not hold editorial rights over Defendants' broadcasts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Janklow v. Newsweek, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1569616\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/788/1300/#p1306\">\n     788 F.2d 1300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1306 (8th Cir. 1986). So too with Defendants' decision not to air a story after DaSilva followed up with Nelle. While DaSilva had \"a better understanding of [Nelle's] perspective,\" ECF No. 54-18, 28:6-16, DaSilva also apparently did not feel that the prior story had misstated any facts. ECF No. 47-9, 66:18-67:6. In the absence of any evidence disputing this assertion, it cannot support a claim of actual malice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Actual malice is a demanding standard. It is easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to nitpick even decisions that seem obvious at the time. But it is not enough that a reporter was aggressive, negligent, or utterly incorrect. Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment for the Defendants, barring the submission of punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The First Amendment's protections of speech sweep broadly, in order to protect a national commitment to public debate that is \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\"\n    <em>\n     New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n     376 U.S. 254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 270,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n     84 S.Ct. 710\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p270\">\n     11 L.Ed.2d 686\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1964). But those protections tolerate false speech only insofar as they must to protect more valuable commentary. For\n    this reason and those already stated, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 47) is GRANTED against Plaintiff Roof One Nebraska, LLC on all counts. With respect to Plaintiffs Nelle, Roof One Exteriors, and Roof One of Iowa, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 47) is GRANTED as to Counts One and Four and DENIED as to Counts Two and Three.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-113\">\n     Defendants also argue that the allegedly libelous statements were not \"of and concerning\" Plaintiff Roof One Nebraska, LLC.

He could not, because the altered price term came from the insurance company itself.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-118\">\n     Defendants argue that this Court should follow\n     <em>\n      Clay v.
