She was detained following an individualized bond hearing at which she bore the burden of proving that she was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. The bond hearing was presided over by an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), whose decision was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). Ms. Darko, who has no criminal convictions, has now been detained from March 18, 2018, to the present day. She brings the instant Petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging the constitutionality of her detention, and specifically, the requirement that she bear the burden of establishing her right to be released on bond. The question thus presented is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment required that the Government bear the burden of justifying her detention. Joining with a\n   growing body of persuasive authority, the Court concludes that the Due Process Clause required that the Government bear the burden of proving that Ms. Darko's detention was justified, and that it was required to meet its burden by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, Ms. Darko's Petition is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

At that hearing, the Government shall bear the burden to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that she is a danger to the community or a flight risk. Should the government fail to provide Ms. Darko with such a bond hearing within seven calendar days, the government shall immediately release her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In addition to her constitutional argument concerning the appropriate allocation of the burden of proof, Ms. Darko asserts three additional causes of action: (1) an INA claim asserting that requiring her to bear the burden at the bond hearing is contrary to the legislative history of the INA; (2) an Administrative Procedure Act claim asserting that placing the burden on detainees is arbitrary and capricious; and (3) a Due Process claim asserting a violation based on the IJ's failure to consider certain evidence at the bond hearing. Because of the Court's decision on the constitutional claim, it does not reach these latter three.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    To be sure, Petitioner also challenges the statutory scheme pursuant to which she was detained, but as previously noted,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 1, the Court does not reach those challenges.
