Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   To show a film, a movie theater must obtain a license from the film's distributor. The case before the Court involves the competitive market between theaters for exclusive licenses to show specialty films. Plaintiffs-2301 M Cinema d/b/a West End Cinema (\"West End Cinema\"), the Avalon Theatre Project, Inc. (\"the Avalon\"), the Denver Film Society, and the Cinema Detroit (collectively, \"plaintiffs\")-bring this action against Silver Cinemas Acquisition Co. d/b/a Landmark Theatres and its parent corporation 2929 Entertainment, LP (collectively, \"Landmark\"). Plaintiffs allege that Landmark violated federal antitrust law by using its national market power to coerce film distributors into granting Landmark exclusive licenses, preventing plaintiffs and other independent theaters from showing specialty films. Plaintiffs' four-count complaint charges Landmark with: (1) circuit dealing in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act; (2) using its monopoly power in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (3) attempting to use its monopoly power in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and (4) interfering with plaintiffs' business relations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court is Landmark's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 16. After careful consideration of the motion, the response, the reply thereto, and the applicable law, Landmark's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are four independent, community theaters that primarily show specialty films. Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. Specialty films include \"independent films, art films, foreign films, and documentaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Unlike mainstream commercial films, specialty films are not intended to appeal to a broad audience and are therefore released less widely than commercial films.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The first plaintiff, West End Cinema, operated in the District of Columbia from 2010 until 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. In 2015, West End Cinema was \"forced\" out of business, allegedly by Landmark's anticompetitive licensing practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Landmark leased the West End Cinema's space and has since opened a Landmark theater\n   in its place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Avalon is another independent theater located in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. The Denver Film Society is a nonprofit organization located in Denver, Colorado that provides specialty film programming via \"year-round screening, film festivals, and other special events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. It operates the Sie FilmCenter, a specialty film theater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Cinema Detroit is a non-profit specialty film theater located in Detroit, Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Landmark is a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of 2929 Entertainment, LP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. It operates fifty-one specialty film theaters in twenty-two geographic markets nationwide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is \"the largest specialty film movie theater chain in the country\" and is purportedly opening new theaters on a regular basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Both plaintiffs and Landmark are \"exhibitors,\" the industry term for movie theaters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Exhibitors must negotiate with film distributors for licenses to exhibit films at their theaters.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Distributors are the entities responsible for marketing the film; they act as a \"middleman\" between the production studio and the exhibitor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Generally, a distributor's income for each film is tied to the revenue earned by the exhibitor during its run of the film.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76. License agreements between distributors and exhibitors specify the terms under which the exhibitor may show a particular film.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 25. In some instances, license agreements may include \"clearances,\" or an exclusive right to show a film.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. In acquiescing to a clearance, a distributor agrees not to license a film to any other exhibitor, or to specific exhibitors, in the same geographic market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Clearances are generally negotiated either for the first few weeks a film is shown, a \"first-run\" clearance, or for the entire period a film is screened by an exhibitor, a \"day and date\" clearance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25, 28. Clearances must be negotiated on a theater-by-theater, film-by-film basis. Therefore, exhibitors may not engage in circuit-dealing, whereby \"a dominant movie theater chain,\" known as a \"circuit,\" \"uses its market power to obtain preferential agreements, particularly clearances, from distributors for the licensing of films ... in multiple geographic markets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mot., ECF No. 16.

Third, Landmark argues that plaintiffs fail to state a plausible monopolization or attempted monopolization claim (Counts II and III) because plaintiffs fail to allege: (1) that Landmark exercised leveraging conduct; and (2) that Landmark has monopoly power.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-28. Finally, Landmark contends that plaintiffs fail to state a plausible tortious interference claim (Count IV).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.

First, Landmark argues that plaintiffs fail to allege that Landmark wielded its national circuit power to coerce distributors to agree to clearance agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-19. Landmark also argues that plaintiffs do not allege that it negotiated any unlawful blanket clearances covering more than one theater or film.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, it contends that plaintiffs merely allege a series of theater-by-theater, city-by-city negotiated clearance agreements for individual films, a lawful industry practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-18.

Opp'n, ECF No. 17 at 24-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Landmark argues that plaintiffs fail to allege an injury to competition and consumers. Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 16 at 22-25. Landmark contends that plaintiffs merely assert individual harm, an insufficient antitrust injury.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs respond that the complaint alleges injury to competition by way of decreased output and revenue for distributors and increased prices, fewer choices, and decreased quality for consumers.

As the Court has discussed, plaintiffs allege that Landmark is the largest specialty film exhibitor in the nation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 18. Landmark does not dispute that allegation; it agrees that it has fifty-one theaters in twenty-two major geographic markets nationwide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot., ECF No. 16 at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6 71. Moreover, plaintiffs describe several markets in which Landmark occupies the majority of the specialty film exhibitor market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-62. Such allegations are sufficient at this early stage of the proceedings. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Cobb Theatres\n   </em>\n   , the district court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss in part because the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had \"69% share of [the] market,\" an amount sufficient to infer monopoly power.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358238\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/101/1319/#p1342\">\n    101 F.Supp.3d at 1340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"in some circumstances, 'over two-thirds of the market is a monopoly' \")(quoting\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak Co. v.
