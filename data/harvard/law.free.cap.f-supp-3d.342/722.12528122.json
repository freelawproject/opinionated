ECF No. 10. The government alleges that Sandoval-Cordero is a noncitizen who was found in this country without permission on July 17, 2018, and that he had previously been removed from the United States on or about February 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to Sandoval-Cordero's 2017 removal, an officer employed by the Department of Homeland Security personally served Sandoval-Cordero with a document entitled \"Notice to Appear\" (\"NTA\") on December 6, 2016.

The NTA ordered Sandoval-Cordero to appear before an immigration judge (\"IJ\") \"to show why [he] should not be removed from the United States based on the charge(s) set\n   forth [elsewhere in the NTA].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the NTA did not provide Sandoval-Cordero with a date and time for the removal hearing. Instead, it simply stated he was to appear \"on a date to be set at a time to be set.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From the time Sandoval-Cordero received the NTA, he remained detained at the Johnson County Jail in Cleburne, Texas. ECF No. 43, Ex. D. On January 11, 2017, the immigration court in Dallas mailed him a document entitled \"Notice of Hearing in Removal Proceedings\" (\"Notice of Hearing\"), which provided information missing from the NTA: the removal hearing would take place on February 8, 2017, at 1:00 p.m.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When the date arrived, Sandoval-Cordero appeared before the IJ via video conference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The IJ denied Sandoval-Cordero's application for relief from removal and ordered him removed to Mexico.

Mot. 2. Therefore, Sandoval-Cordero argues, his removal proceedings violated due process and the government cannot prove he was \"removed\" as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
