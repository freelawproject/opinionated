The government argues against dismissal, asserting that the IJ had jurisdiction to order Niebla's removal and that, in any event, Niebla has not satisfied the requirements to collaterally attack that order in this case.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A noncitizen who has been removed from the United States commits a felony if he subsequently reenters the United States without permission.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
