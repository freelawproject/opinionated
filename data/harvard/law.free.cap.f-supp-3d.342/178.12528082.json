With respect to the mailing labels, the court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ... the alleged inability to fit the Court's mailing address on the TRULINCS labels cannot serve as a basis for statutory tolling. Although Petitioner claims that the mailing address of the Court did not fit on the labels used by the TRULINCS program, the evidence establishes that the Court's mailing address did, in fact, fit on TRULINCS labels.[ ] Further, Petitioner's contention is belied by the fact that he was able to successfully file three separate pleadings with other districts in December 2009, at least two of which were served on parties using mailing addresses as long or longer than that of this Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Next, the Plaintiff sought relief by way of a Motion Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Relief from Judgment; Newly Discovered Evidence pursuant to Fed.

This Motion was also denied, and with respect to the TRULINCS issue, the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In the previous motion to toll, [the Government] provided a declaration of a prison employee familiar with the TRULINCS system who stated that the address for the Court could indeed fit on the four lines generally allowed by the\n   system, and that in addition, the system allowed addresses with up to six lines through the use of \"Re:\" and \"Comments\" lines .... The employee also stated that he had spoken with Petitioner about his problem and suggested abbreviating the Court's address if he was having difficulties, but that to his knowledge Petitioner never attempted to do so ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, even if he were precluded from sending the filing to this Court, Petitioner does not provide the date he mailed the petition to his sister (whether it was sent within the limitations period), or explain why it took 37 days for the petition to reach her, and for her to mail it to this Court.

In relevant part, the court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner ... takes issue with this Court's holding that he offered no evidence to contradict the December 20, 2011 finding that this Court's address fit on the TRULINCS labels, and that the TRULINCS system thus did not prevent him from filing his habeas petition within the statute of limitations. Docket No. 889 at 7. Petitioner offers no new evidence or argument on this front, but merely repeats arguments he raised in his previous motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 882. He argues, for example, that no one ever showed him how to abbreviate the Court's address to fit on a TRULINCS label. However, as noted in this Court's previous order, the two abbreviations included in the government's example label (\"Attn:\" and \"CA\") are in general use, and it is not clear why Petitioner would specifically need someone to instruct him on how to use such abbreviations.[ ]\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 886 at 3. In any event, Petitioner raises no new point on this issue ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The only new information Petitioner offers in his motion only undermines his argument that he is entitled to equitable tolling. After concluding that he was not able to mail his habeas petition using the TRULINCS labels, Petitioner ultimately filed his petition by mailing it to his sister and having her send it to the court. In the January 11, 2013 order, this Court noted that Petitioner had not stated that he mailed the petition to his sister within the limitations period, nor did he explain why it took until 37 days after the limitations period for the petition to reach the Court. Docket No. 886 at 3-4. Petitioner now clarifies that he mailed his habeas petition to his sister after the statute of limitations had already run because he had been trying to obtain an exemption from the requirement that prisoners use the TRULINCS system ... He does not explain why, knowing that the deadline for his petition was approaching, he waited until after the deadline passed to mail his petition to his sister, thus ensuring that it would not be timely filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 3-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Plaintiff has now filed the current action, alleging violations of his constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1.

The Plaintiff's Habeas Petition was denied by the Northern District of California for untimeliness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. Denying Hab. Pet. at 3. The Northern District of California subsequently examined the facts, evidence, arguments, and circumstances regarding the Plaintiff's late-filing, and whether any alleged encumbrances caused by the TRULINCS labeling system contributed to this situation. The Northern District addressed these claims and issues on three occasions, and the Plaintiff had ample opportunity to raise additional theories and evidence during those proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. Denying Mot. to Toll &amp; Vacate at 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ord. Denying Mot. for Relief from Judgment &amp; Indic. Ruling at 2-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ord. Denying Mot. to Alter &amp; Amend at 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The underlying crux of the instant matter is the Plaintiff's apparent dissatisfaction with the determinations made the Northern District of California regarding his collateral attacks on his conviction and sentencing, as evidenced by the Plaintiff's focus on these issues in his Opposition to the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 35-38. The Plaintiff repeatedly argues that the Northern District was \"mistaken,\" \"incorrect,\" and that it made any number of errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5437219\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/518/221/#p232\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 37 \u00b6\u00b62, 3. Having exhausted his avenues for relief from the Northern District of California, the Plaintiff is merely attempting to have this Court reconsider the decisions rendered by that court.

At this juncture the Plaintiff has not properly requested leave to amend pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2). These additional potential claims were not part of the original Complaint, and therefore, the Defendants would have no notice upon which they could respond to these new potential claims. The Court also finds that these potential claims fail to state claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), as the Plaintiff's potential additional claims do not appear ripe based on the present allegations. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not stated that he has suffered \"actual injury,\" only that there is \"potential\" for injury.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 2 nn.1 &amp; 2;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lewis v.
