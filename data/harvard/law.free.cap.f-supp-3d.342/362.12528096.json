WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Xerox Corporation (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action on December 8, 2017, seeking damages for defendant Lantronix, Inc.'s (\"Defendant\") alleged breach of its obligations under an indemnification clause to the parties' \"Multinational Master Purchase Agreement for Design, Manufacture, and Supply of Wireless Print Adapter\" (the \"Agreement\"). (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff also seeks a declaratory judgment that the Agreement requires Defendant to defend and indemnify Plaintiff in a separate lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 29, 2018, Defendant answered Plaintiff's Complaint and asserted three counterclaims. (Dkt. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims on the ground that Defendant failed to satisfy the prelitigation requirements set forth in the Agreement's \"Dispute Resolution\" clause. (Dkt. 12). On March 9, 2018, Defendant opposed Plaintiff's motion, and, alternatively, cross-moved to stay the resolution of the motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 18). On June 5, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to amend/correct its counterclaims to allege\n   that it had since engaged in good faith negotiations with Plaintiff in full satisfaction of the Dispute Resolution clause. (Dkt. 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2018, the Court heard argument on each motion. After considering the arguments presented by both sides, the Court ruled from the bench that it granted Defendant's motion to amend/correct its counterclaims, denied Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, and denied as moot Defendant's cross-motion to stay the resolution of the motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 30). The Court informed the parties that a decision explaining the basis for its determinations would be issued in due course. This Decision and Order is intended to memorialize the Court's analysis in written form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it and Defendant are parties to the Agreement. (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 12-3 (the Agreement) ). The Agreement requires Defendant to provide wireless print adapters for Plaintiff to use within its \"multifunction printers.\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 9). Plaintiff claims that the Agreement requires Defendant to \"indemnify and hold harmless [Plaintiff] ... from all Claims whatsoever resulting from any alleged or actual infringement of any third party's [intellectual property] Rights\" that may arise from the wireless print adapters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). The Agreement also requires Defendant to \"intervene in or defend any such proceedings\" for the violation of a third party's intellectual property rights at Plaintiff's \"option and [Defendant]'s expense ... upon notice by [Plaintiff] to [Defendant].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2017, several non-party individuals filed a complaint against Plaintiff in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the \"Texas Action\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). The Texas Action alleged that Plaintiff infringed upon certain registered federal patents, and that these patent violations involved the wireless print adapters supplied by Defendant under the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By letter dated March 29, 2017, Plaintiff demanded that Defendant \"fulfill its defense and indemnification obligations under the Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). Defendant refused to do so, and, as a result, Plaintiff incurred attorneys' fees and litigation costs in defending the Texas Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant seeking damages for the alleged breach of the Agreement's indemnification clause and a declaratory judgment ordering that Defendant defend and indemnify Plaintiff in the Texas Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). On January 29, 2018, Defendant answered the Complaint and filed three counterclaims against Plaintiff. (Dkt. 8). Defendant's first counterclaim seeks damages from Plaintiff based upon its alleged violation of the Agreement by failing to purchase 890 wireless print adapters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5). Defendant's second counterclaim alleges that Plaintiff breached the jurisdictional and venue provisions of the Agreement by initially filing a complaint requesting indemnification in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas instead of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, or \"a New York state court sitting in Monroe County, New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). That prior complaint was \"voluntarily dismissed\" before Plaintiff filed the instant action in this District. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The third counterclaim seeks costs\n   and attorneys' fees incurred in defending the instant action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss Defendant's counterclaims on the ground that Defendant failed to comply with the Agreement's Dispute Resolution clause. (Dkt. 12-1). That clause provides that Plaintiff and Defendant would \"attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to [the] Agreement promptly by negotiation between the parties at the appropriate level of management.\" (Dkt. 12-3 at 9). If those negotiations failed, \"then either party [would] provide written notice to the respective authorized representatives of the other party, which [would] be at the next level of management not directly involved in the dispute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If the dispute was not resolved within thirty days of the receipt of that notice, \"then the dispute [would] be escalated to designated senior business executives of each party, who [would] have an additional [thirty] days to resolve the dispute.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The parties could agree to extensions for these time periods, and nothing in the clause prevented \"either party from applying for any interim, interlocutory or preliminary injunctive or declaratory relief; from bringing any claim for contribution or indemnity; or from exercising any rights it has, if any, to cancel [the] Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, if the dispute remained unresolved \"within the timeframes set out above, then either party may bring a legal action or proceeding against any other party arising out of or relating to [the] Agreement\" in the Western District of New York, or any New York State court sitting in Monroe County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 9, 2018, Defendant filed its response in opposition to Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, and, alternatively, cross-moved for a stay of Plaintiff's motion. (Dkt. 18). Defendant opposed Plaintiff's motion on three grounds: (1) the Dispute Resolution clause did not apply to compulsory counterclaims; (2) the Dispute Resolution clause did not set forth a condition precedent to asserting a counterclaim in a \"legal action or proceeding\" that had already been commenced; and (3) the Dispute Resolution clause was unenforceable because it was indefinite and ambiguous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-5 at 3-9). In the alternative, Defendant cross-moved to stay the resolution of Plaintiff's motion to dismiss in order to permit Defendant time to comply with the provisions of the Dispute Resolution clause and to seek leave to replead the counterclaims once those requirements had been satisfied. (Dkt. 18 at 10-13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-5 at 10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 29, 2018, Plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss and in opposition to Defendant's cross-motion for a stay. (Dkt. 21). On June 5, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to amend/correct its counterclaims. (Dkt. 25). Without conceding any of the arguments previously asserted in its opposition to Plaintiff's motion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.1), Defendant argued that it had made several good faith efforts to satisfy the requirements of the Dispute Resolution clause and requested leave to amend its counterclaims to allege that it had done so (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-12). Plaintiff opposed Defendant's motion for leave to amend. (Dkt. 29). Specifically, Plaintiff argued that the Court should deny Defendant's motion for leave to amend/correct because Defendant failed to demonstrate its compliance with the Dispute Resolution clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 27, 2018, the Court heard oral argument, after which the Court granted Defendant's motion to amend/correct its counterclaims, denied Plaintiff's motion to dismiss, and denied as moot Defendant's cross-motion to stay the resolution of the motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 30). The following\n   analysis is intended to explain the rationale underlying the Court's determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss is Denied Because the Dispute Resolution Clause Does Not Apply to Counterclaims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In addition, Black's Law Dictionary defines the phrase, \"bring an action,\" as \"[t]o sue; institute legal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Dispute Resolution clause provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \"If the parties cannot resolve any dispute in the manner and within the timeframes set out above, then either party may\n   <em>\n    bring a legal action or proceeding\n   </em>\n   against any other party arising out of or relating to this\n   Agreement....\" (Dkt. 12-3 at 9 (emphasis added) ). Plaintiff contends that the phrase to \"bring a legal action or proceeding\" encompasses the counterclaims asserted by Defendant in this action. (Dkt. 21 at 5-7).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 12-3 at 9). As a mechanism to promote alternative dispute resolution and avoid the costs of litigation, it makes sense that the Agreement limits a party's ability to run into court before attempting to resolve the dispute through non-litigation efforts. However, once a party has engaged in the act of \"bringing\" an action or proceeding, a party is free to defend against the lawsuit and assert any counterclaims-the Agreement's Dispute Resolution clause does not prevent a party being sued from asserting claims against the party who brought the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, the inclusion of the word \"bring\" is critical to the Court's analysis, since the act of bringing an action is defined as the institution of legal proceedings and represents the first step in commencing the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pelella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050463\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/73/#p81\">\n    350 F.3d at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A party institutes an action when he commences a judicial proceeding. A party commences a judicial proceeding when he takes the first step that invokes the judicial process.\"). Accordingly, by its plain language the Dispute Resolution clause applies only where a party \"bring[s] a legal action or proceeding\" by filing a complaint and not where a party merely asserts counterclaims in response to an already pending legal action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050463\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/73/#p81\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"An action is ... instituted when a plaintiff files a complaint as that constitutes the first step invoking the judicial process. In sharp contrast, a defendant asserts a counterclaim in response to a plaintiff's institution of an action.\" (citations omitted) ); Black's Law Dictionary 427 (10th ed. 2014) (defining a \"counterclaim\" as \"[a] claim for relief asserted against an opposing party\n   <em>\n    after an original claim\n   </em>\n   has been made\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, pursuant to the Agreement's plain language, the dispute resolution process was only required before commencement of an action. Plaintiff took that step and commenced this action. As a result, Defendant was under no obligation to comply with the Dispute Resolution clause before asserting any of its counterclaims-irrespective of whether they are compulsory-and thus, Plaintiff's motion to dismiss is denied and Defendant's cross-motion to stay the resolution of Plaintiff's motion to dismiss is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion for Leave to Amend/Correct Its Counterclaims is Granted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the Court has concluded that Defendant was not required to exhaust the dispute resolution process prior to asserting its counterclaims, Defendant's motion to amend the counterclaims to allege compliance with the Dispute Resolution clause is arguably no longer necessary. Nonetheless, for the sake of completeness, and because an appellate court could potentially disagree with this Court's reading of the Dispute Resolution clause, the Court now turns to Defendant's motion for leave to amend its counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In support of this position, Defendant has set forth a timeline describing various communications between its representatives and Plaintiff's representatives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Defendant indicates that it initiated dispute resolution negotiations in October 2017, at which time Defendant's head of sales, Kevin Yoder (\"Yoder\"), emailed \"a manager in the Xerox Global Purchases group,\" Chris Campbell (\"Campbell\"), regarding 480 wireless print adapters that Defendant claims Plaintiff was contractually obligated to purchase from Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 (email communications) ). Campbell apparently denied that Plaintiff was contractually obligated to purchase those units. (Dkt. 25 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In January 2018, Kurt Scheuerman (\"Scheuerman\"), Defendant's Vice President and General Counsel, contacted Michelle Waites (\"Waites\"), Plaintiff's Senior Patent Counsel in its Office of General Counsel, to discuss the costs incurred by Defendant in responding to Plaintiff's first indemnity lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas, as well as the cost of the 480 wireless print adapters and associated raw materials allegedly owed by Plaintiff to Defendant. (Dkt. 25 at 6-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-2 at 3 (email communications); Dkt. 18-3 (Scheuerman letter to Waites outlining Defendant's position on both issues) ). On January 29, 2018, Waites sent a letter response to Scheuerman, stating that Plaintiff was not required to purchase the additional wireless print adapters, and disputing Defendant's explanation for why it need not indemnify or defend Plaintiff in the Texas Action. (Dkt. 25 at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-4 (Waites's letter to Scheuerman) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On February 28, 2018, Scheuerman addressed a \"written notice\" to Waites, which set forth the history of the parties' discussions and indicated that he was unsure of who he should consider as Plaintiff's \"authorized representative\" for purposes of the second level of dispute resolution negotiations. (Dkt. 25 at 7). Scheuerman also stated that he was acting with the understanding that Waites was Plaintiff's \"authorized representative,\" and noted that Jeff Benck (\"Benck\"), Defendant's CEO and President, was Defendant's \"designated senior business executive\" for purposes\n   of any third-tier dispute resolution discussions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant did not receive any response to Scheuerman's February 28, 2018, letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). On March 30, 2018, Scheuerman sent another letter to Waites, explaining the situation and, again, requesting the name of Plaintiff's \"designated senior business executive\" for purposes of any escalated third-tier negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On April 4, 2018, Waites responded by email, indicating that neither she nor Scheuerman were authorized to engage in any dispute resolution processes under the Agreement because they were lawyers, and recommending that Yoder contact Campbell to initiate prelitigation negotiations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9). Waites failed to acknowledge that Yodell and Campbell had already communicated in October 2017, at which time Campbell denied Yoder's initial inquiry into Plaintiff's alleged obligation to purchase the 480 wireless print adapters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18-1 at 2). Notably, Plaintiff has acknowledged that, \"[a]t most, the October 2017 communication reflects the first of three steps in the dispute resolution provision.\" (Dkt. 21 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On April 16, 2018, Benck emailed Campbell, explaining that he was doing so with the understanding that Campbell was Plaintiff's \"designated senior business executive\" for purposes of the Dispute Resolution clause, because, in his view, Waites had identified him as such. (Dkt. 25 at 9). On April 18, 2018, Campbell emailed Benck, indicating both that he had received the April 16, 2018, email, and that Defendant's complaints had been taken under advisement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 29-2 at 3 (email communications) ). Finally, on May 14, 2018, Campbell sent another email to Benck, denying that Plaintiff owed Defendant anything, and explaining that he was not Plaintiff's \"designated senior business executive.\" (Dkt. 25 at 10; Dkt. 29-2 at 2). Instead, Campbell indicated that Kurt Brasser (\"Brasser\") was Plaintiff's \"authorized representative\" for purposes of the second level of dispute resolution negotiations. (Dkt. 29-9 at 2).

Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   insufficiency raised by Plaintiff's motion to dismiss is Defendant's purported failure to allege compliance with the Dispute Resolution clause. (Dkt. 12-1 at 6-9).

While the Court need not opine upon Defendant's contention that the Dispute Resolution clause is unenforceable due to indefiniteness in order to resolve the parties' respective motions, the open-ended nature of this provision appears to be ambiguous.

Insofar as Defendant has asserted \"substantial good faith\" compliance with the Dispute Resolution clause (Dkt. 25 at 5-10), the Court fails to see how Defendant has acted in bad faith by seeking to amend its counterclaims after attempting for months to comply with an arguably ambiguous contractual term.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dervan v.
