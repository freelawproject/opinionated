Mortimer, and Wood, Phillips, Katz, Clark, &amp; Mortimer allege that defendant Zsolt Rumy tortiously interfered with plaintiffs' expectancy of recovering legal fees for representing defendant Zoltek Corporation in patent litigation spanning the course of 20 years. Plaintiffs also seek recovery from defendants Zoltek and Toray Industries,\n   Inc. (which purchased Zoltek in 2014) under a quantum meruit theory.

R. 28 \u00b6 9. Rumy, a Florida or Missouri citizen,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   founded Zoltek and was its majority shareholder until Toray (a Japanese corporation) acquired Zoltek in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 17, 74. Plaintiff Wood Phillips is an Illinois law firm, and plaintiffs Monco and Mortimer are attorneys with Wood Phillips licensed in Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1996, Zoltek hired Monco and Mortimer to represent Zoltek in litigation conducted in Washington, D.C. to enforce a Zoltek patent (\"Zoltek litigation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6-8, 16, 21-23. That litigation ended up lasting 20 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Payment for Monco and Mortimer's work was largely on a contingency basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 61. Ultimately, the relationship between Zoltek and Monco and Mortimer soured. After a crucial meeting in St. Louis in July 2016 scheduled by Zoltek's other outside counsel (Missouri-based Thompson Coburn), Zoltek terminated Monco and Mortimer as counsel, substituted another firm as lead counsel in the Zoltek litigation, and refused to pay Monco and Mortimer for overdue bills.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-83. Shortly thereafter, the Zoltek litigation settled for $20 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. Plaintiffs apparently did not recover any of that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit in September 2017. R. 1. Plaintiffs amended their complaint in January 2018 to raise two claims: a claim against Rumy for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage (Count I), and a claim against Zoltek and Toray for recovery under quantum meruit (Count II). R. 28 \u00b6\u00b6 91-108. Both claims seek compensatory damages for legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and plaintiffs also seek punitive damages against Rumy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The amended complaint alleges several bases for specific and general personal jurisdiction over Rumy. As plaintiffs' counsel made clear at oral argument, however (R. 127 at 9-11), plaintiffs are currently asserting only one of those bases: that \"[t]his Court ... has specific jurisdiction over\n   Rumy because he committed the intentional tortious acts set forth ... in Count I, causing foreseeable injury to Plaintiffs in Illinois.\" R. 28 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Count I sets forth the intentional tortious acts based on which plaintiffs claim specific personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs allege that Rumy \"purposefully interfered\" with plaintiffs' attorney-client \"relationship and [fees] expectancy\" with Zoltek by \"inducing Zoltek and Toray to discharge Monco/Mortimer as their attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that \"Rumy made false and misleading statements to Toray about the Zoltek Litigation and Monco/Mortimer,\" including a representation \"that the value of the Zoltek Litigation was zero\" and that Monco and Mortimer \"had jeopardized the case by not taking damage discovery (even though discovery had been bifurcated and was still open at the time of settlement).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Through these machinations,\" plaintiffs allege, \"Rumy was able to obtain Toray's assent to Rumy being personally paid a significant share, if not all, of the recoveries from the Zoltek Litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In other words, as currently pleaded, plaintiffs' tortious interference claim is based on Rumy's communications about plaintiffs' work on and about the value of the D.C.-based litigation. Although the amended complaint does not specify where and precisely to whom Rumy's communications took place, Rumy argues that if they occurred at all, the communications occurred during the meeting in St. Louis in July 2016 and were made to Missouri-based Zoltek executive personnel or their Missouri-based outside counsel Thompson Coburn. R. 38 at 4. Plaintiffs do not dispute in their response that the alleged communications were between Rumy and Zoltek personnel and/or Thompson Coburn and occurred in St. Louis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rumy filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in February 2018. R. 37. At the parties' joint request, this Court held oral argument on the motion in May 2018. R. 127. At oral argument, Rumy conceded that Missouri would have personal jurisdiction over him, but denied that Illinois does based on the tort as alleged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because this Court is sitting in diversity, it has personal jurisdiction over the parties to the extent that an Illinois court could exercise such jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Philos Techs., Inc. v.

The \"three essential requirements\" for specific personal jurisdiction are: \"(1) the defendant must have purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting business in the forum state or purposefully directed his activities at the state; (2) the alleged injury must have arisen from the defendant's forum-related activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Felland v.

The parties have very different understandings\n   of what constitutes purposeful direction \"at\" Illinois. Rumy focuses on the fact that his alleged tortious statements occurred while he was in Missouri. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, focus on the fact that regardless of where the statements took place, they focused on Illinois plaintiffs and their business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This area of the law is evolving, which complicates the analysis. But the Court agrees with Rumy that the more recent case law, all following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , is on Rumy's side.

Ill. 2017) (case cited by plaintiffs finding that Canadian defendants' email communications directed at plaintiff in Illinois related to the fraud, combined with plaintiffs' injury in Illinois, established specific personal jurisdiction). Plaintiffs also may make arguments on the other bases they originally pleaded for this Court's personal jurisdiction over Rumy, which plaintiffs expressly declined to assert for purposes of this motion. R. 127 at 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Rumy's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction [37] without prejudice. A status hearing is set for October 4, 2018. At that status hearing, plaintiffs should let the Court know whether they believe they can set forth a plausible basis for minimum contacts between Rumy and Illinois in an amended complaint. Plaintiffs also should let the Court know if they wish to litigate the privilege of the emails attached to their motion to dismiss response before Judge Cole prior to filing that amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The amended complaint alleges that Rumy is a Missouri citizen (R. 28 \u00b6 10), but Rumy claims he is a Florida citizen (R. 38 at 1). Because no party claims that Rumy is an Illinois citizen, his precise citizenship is not relevant for current purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    In addition to the amended complaint allegations, plaintiffs also attach several documents to their sur-reply in opposition to Rumy's motion to dismiss that Magistrate Judge Cole found to be non-privileged (R. 172). These documents are emails between Rumy and Toray and Zoltek representatives (all non-Illinois citizens) and related attachments. R. 172-1; R. 172-2; R. 172-3. Plaintiffs claim these documents support their position that \"Rumy personally orchestrated Zoltek's termination of Plaintiffs\" and that Rumy was \"a personal claimant in the Zoltek Litigation.\" R. 172 at 1. But no matter how advantageous these documents may be for plaintiffs' claims on the merits, they are not contacts by Rumy with anyone in Illinois that support plaintiffs' specific personal jurisdiction argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Plaintiffs also attach to their response to Rumy's motion to dismiss two emails between Rumy and plaintiffs in May and June 2016. Rumy in his reply brief objected to plaintiffs' attachment of these communications, saying they are covered by the attorney-client privilege and inadmissible. That privilege issue was never briefed by plaintiffs. At oral argument, this Court explained that the parties should litigate the issue of these documents' privilege before Magistrate Judge Cole. R. 127 at 15. Despite proceeding before Judge Cole for a number of months on discovery issues and mediation, the parties appear to have never raised this issue. Perhaps this is because Rumy at oral argument agreed to \"withdraw\" the affidavit filed in support of his motion to dismiss \"as unnecessary for the argument presently before the Court\" on specific personal jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8. There is thus no \"affidavit[ ] or other evidence in opposition to the exercise of jurisdiction\" submitted by Rumy that would require consideration of plaintiffs' \"affirmative evidence\" beyond their allegations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Purdue\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105256\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/773/#p782\">\n     338 F.3d at 782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Plaintiffs at oral argument maintained that they had established a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    case of specific personal jurisdiction without relying on the emails. The Court therefore reaches its holding without consideration of these emails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Court notes, however, that even if it were to consider these emails, plaintiffs' current complaint allegations do not mention these emails or connect them up with the alleged tortious interference. Again, \"[f]or a State to exercise jurisdiction consistent with due process, the defendant's\n    <em>\n     suit-related\n    </em>\n    conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State.\"\n    <em>\n     Advanced Tactical\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069806\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/796/#p801\">\n     751 F.3d at 801\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As explained below, the Court will give plaintiffs an opportunity to replead, before which they may wish to litigate the issue of these documents' privilege before Judge Cole as previously instructed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Despite this broader statement of law,\n    <em>\n     Tamburo\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable from this case on its facts.
