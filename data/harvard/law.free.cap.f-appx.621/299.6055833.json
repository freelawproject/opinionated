In asserting his sentence is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), he contends he used the passport to illegally enter the United States solely for the purpose of reuniting with his family, and not to either commit a crime of terrorism or endanger others. Quezada also contends the sentence: was based on the Guidelines\u2019 \u201crelatively high starting point [of a 27-to-33-month sentencing range] for the relatively minor offense\u201d; overstated the seriousness of his criminal history; and does not reflect his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 48-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">As Quezada concedes, he did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence; therefore, review is only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). (Regarding his conceded failure to object, Quezada maintains he should not be required to do so concerning the reasonableness of his sentence when it is imposed; recognizes this issue is foreclosed by our circuit precedent; and presents the issue to preserve it for possible future review. Moreover, even if the more lenient abuse-of-discretion standard were applied to his challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, it would fail.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">Under the applicable plain-error review, if Quezada demonstrates a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights, the reversible plain error may be remedied, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). For the following reasons, the requisite clear or obvious error is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">Quezada\u2019s sentence was within the Guidelines advisory sentencing range and is, therefore, presumptively reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). To rebut that presumption, Quezada must show: \u201cthe sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, ... gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or .,. represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The district court considered Quezada\u2019s assertions in mitigation of his sentence and, balancing them with the \u00a7 3553(a) objectives, concluded a sentence at the bottom of the sentencing range was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). The court determined Quezada\u2019s criminal history, cultural assimilation, and benign motive for illegally returning to the United States did not warrant a below-Guidelines sentence, but granted his request for a sentence at the low end of the sentencing range. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
