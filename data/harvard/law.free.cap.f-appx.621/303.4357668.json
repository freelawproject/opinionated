He maintains that the combined 48-month sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline that applies to illegal-reentry offenses, is not empirically based and results in prior convictions, including those that are too remote to be included in the criminal history calculation, being unduly weighed. Olvera argues that sentences under \u00a7 2L1.2 are not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the guideline is not empirically based; as he concedes, that argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). He further argues that his sentence, which was greater than necessary to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public, overstated the seriousness of his illegal-reentry offense, undermined respect for the law, and failed to provide just punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Olvera did not object to his sentences after their imposition and, thus, plain error review typically applies. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). However, because Olvera\u2019s substantive reasonableness claims fail even under the ordinary standard, the standard of review is not dispositive. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). To the extent that Olvera contends that no objection is needed to preserve the issue of the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, that argument, as he concedes, is foreclosed. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The 42-month sentence imposed for Olv-era\u2019s illegal-reentry offense was within the guidelines range and, therefore, is entitled to the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The record reflects that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based upon an individualized assessment of the facts in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference, and we may not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Olvera\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and inordinately weighs prior convictions, including those too remote to receive criminal history points, is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected challenges that are based upon the alleged triviality of illegal-reentry offenses. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, Olvera has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness, See <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">To the extent that Olvera separately challenges the reasonableness of his revocation sentence, he has not shown that the within-guidelines six-month sentence was plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The district court had the discretion to order the sentences to be served consecutively. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260-61 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8584(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) and comment, (n.4), p.s. Because the sentence fell within the advisory policy range and was consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy with regard to consecutive sentences, it is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2); \u00a7 7B1.4; <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006). Olvera has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the consecutive sentence and has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 809 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
