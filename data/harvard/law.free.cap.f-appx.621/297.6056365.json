Mazzant presiding, which granted both Bank of America, N.A.\u2019s and Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.\u2019s motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and denied Win-inger\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. After a thorough review of the record, briefs on appeal, and the rulings of the district court, we conclude that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed. The district court properly granted the dismissals due to Wininger\u2019s failure to allege facts that would make the claims plausible. Additionally, the district court correctly held that Wininger\u2019s claims against Select Portfolio Servicing were barred by res judicata. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>484 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2007). The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Wininger\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Among other factors, Wininger had sufficient prior opportunities to amend or supplement the facts alleged in his complaint and a second amended complaint would have been futile. <em>See Smith v. EMC Corp., </em>393 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2004). Therefore, we affirm the decisions of the district court to dismiss Wininger\u2019s claims with prejudice and deny his motion\" for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
