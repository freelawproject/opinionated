We decline the invitation and instead apply the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Plaintiff-Appellant Joseph Edward Parker was an employee of Defendant-Appel-lee Leaf River Cellulose, LLC (\u201cLeaf River\u201d) from 2008 until 2013. On December 13, 2013, Leaf River terminated Parker\u2019s employment because, contrary to company policy, Parker parked his vehicle in the company parking lot with a firearm locked inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Under Mississippi law, with exceptions not pertinent here, a \u201cprivate employer may not establish, maintain, or enforce any policy or rule that has the effect of prohibiting a person from transporting or storing a firearm in a locked vehicle in any parking lot, parking garage, or other designated parking area.\u201d Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 45-9-55(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Leaf River allegedly violated this law. Based on this alleged violation of the law, Parker brought this diversity action seeking damages in excess of $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The same statute Leaf River allegedly violated further provides that a \u201cprivate employer shall not be liable in a civil action for damages resulting from or arising out of an occurrence involving the transportation, storage, possession or use of a firearm covered by this section.\u201d Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 459-55(5). Based on this provision, Leaf River filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court granted. The issue is whether a damages claim is available to Parker. Applying the law as written, we find no such remedy available.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>Gearlds v. Entergy Servs., Inc., </em>709 F.3d 448, 450 (5th Cir.2013). We must determine whether the allegations, taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, \u201cstate a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Gines v. D.R. Horton, Inc., </em>699 F.3d 812, 816 (5th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twom-bly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">This case presents a pure question of statutory interpretation. Because we are construing a Mississippi statute, we must adhere to the interpretive methods of Mississippi courts. <em>See Boatner v. Atlanta Speciality Ins. Co., </em>115 F.3d 1248, 1255 (5th Cir.1997). Where statutory text is plain and unambiguous, Mississippi courts disclaim any interpretive role. <em>See Pat Harrison Waterway Dist. v. Cnty. of Lamar, </em>No. 2013-CA-01535-SCT, \u2014 So.3d -, -, 2015 WL 1249679, at *10 (Miss. Mar. 19, 2015) (\u201cBefore we engage in statutory interpretation, we look to the statute to determine whether interpretation is necessary, that is, whether the language is plain, unambiguous, and in need of no interpretation.\u201d); <em>Miss. Methodist Hosp. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., Inc. v. Miss. Div. of Medicaid, </em>21 So.3d 600, 607 (Miss.2009) (\u201cThis Court will not engage in statutory interpretation if a statute is plain and unambiguous.\u201d). Further, the Mississippi Supreme Court has very recently reiterated that its \u201cfunction is not to decide what a statute should provide, but to determine what it does provide,\u201d its \u201cconstitutional duty is to interpret statutes according to their clear meaning,\u201d and its obligation is to \u201capply the plain meaning of unambiguous statutes.\u201d <em>DeSoto Cnty. v. T.D., </em>160 So.3d 1154, 1156 (Miss.2015) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The Mississippi legislature has decided that employers \u201cshall not be liable in a civil action for damages resulting from or arising out of an occurrence involving the transportation, storage, possession or use of a firearm covered by this section.\u201d Miss.Code. Ann. \u00a7 45-9-55(5). We find this provision plain, unambiguous, and applicable. This is a \u201ccivil action for damages\u201d that, as alleged, results from and arises out of Parker\u2019s transportation and storage of a firearm as contemplated by section 45-9-55(1). Accordingly, Leaf River cannot be held liable for civil damages and the case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Parker does not argue that this civil action for damages does, not arise from his transportation and storage of a firearm. Rather, he argues that the statute does not mean quite what it says. We do not quibble with Parker\u2019s contention that section .45-9-55 must be read and interpreted as a whole. <em>See e.g., Lawson v. Honeywell Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>75 So.3d 1024, 1029 (Miss.2011) (\u201cThe Court looks to the whole of a statute to avoid adhering to one sentence or phrase of statute in a way that skews its true meaning.\u201d). But, as is shown when his specific arguments are considered, this gets Parker nowhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Parker argues' that the law\u2019s purpose would be confounded if damages claims were not permitted, that subsection (5)\u2019s immunity only covers situations where \u201can employee illegally uses the firearm the employer was prevented from prohibiting,\u201d that subsections (1) and (5) are in conflict, and that we have \u201cpower to correct obvious errors.\u201d Each of these arguments fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Parker\u2019s purposivist approach to statutory interpretation is at odds with the strict textual approach applicable under Mississippi law when the text is unambiguous. Further, Parker goes beyond the text and cites legislative history in an effort to show that subsection (5) was intended to provide employers immunity only in the event of a shooting. Under Mississippi law, however, legislative history is a tool of \u201cstatutory construction\u201d only employed after a finding that the text is ambiguous. <em>See, e.g., Bell v. State, </em>160 So.3d 188, 193 (Miss.2015). That Parker\u2019s invocation of legislative intent is inconsistent with the statutory text is laid bare by Parker\u2019s stark plea: \u201cLet Legislative Purpose Control Over Words.\u201d This we will not do. <em>See DeSoto Cnty., </em>160 So.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">\u201cWhere statutes are ambiguous or in conflict with one another, it is proper to resort to the rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Miss. Gaming Comm\u2019n v. Imperial Palace of Miss., Inc., </em>751 So.2d 1025, 1028 (Miss.1999). Parker believes subsections (1) and (5) are in conflict if, as it seems, the first provision prohibits certain conduct and the second provides that a violator is not liable for damages in a civil action. This is plainly wrong. Subsection (5) does not nullify or conflict with subsection (1). It merely precludes plaintiffs from seeking a specific remedy \u2014 damages in a civil action. Parker\u2019s choice to pursue the one remedy subsection (5) denies does not bespeak conflict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Next, Parker asks we correct the Mississippi legislature\u2019s purported \u201cobvious\u201d error by adding the phrase \u201cother than for a violation of subsection (1) of this section\u201d to the end of subsection (5). If there is an error here, it is not obvious. This case is not like <em>Roseberry v. Norsworthy, </em>a case cited by Parker in which the Mississippi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Supreme Court concluded with irresistible conviction\u201d that the legislature committed a \u201cmere clerical error\u201d by using the word \u201cmaximum\u201d when it meant \u201cminimum.\u201d <em>See </em>135 Miss. 845, 100 So. 514, 517 (1924). Nor is this case like <em>Martin v. State, </em>where the Mississippi legislature committed another clerical error \u2014 using the word \u201cand\u201d where it intended to use the word \u201care.\u201d <em>See </em>190 Miss. 32, 199 So. 98, 101 (1940). We cannot very well add eleven words to the statute and claim to be correcting a clerical error. Absent undeniable evidence of error, such a course would be especially inappropriate given that we are a federal court applying state law in a diversity action. The legislature may rewrite the law, we will not.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-2\">Parker\u2019s final argument dispenses with statutory interpretation altogether. In <em>McArn v. Allied Bruce-Terminix Co., Inc., </em>the Mississippi Supreme Court identified two \u201cnarrow\u201d exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine: (1) where the employee is discharged for refusing to participate in illegal acts, and (2) where the employee \u201cis discharged for reporting illegal acts.\u201d 626 So.2d 603, 607 (Miss.1993). Only to that \u201climited extent\u201d have Mississippi courts created \u201cpublic policy exceptions to the age old common law rule of employment at will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Per Parker, we \u201cshould adopt a third public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine.\u201d In other words, notwithstanding subsection (5) and Mississippi\u2019s robust at-will employment doctrine, we should create a cause of action that permits Parker\u2019s suit to go forward. The common law is not a means to end-run legislative enactments, and we will not effectively abrogate subsection (5) by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">. As an alternative basis for affirmance, Leaf River argues section 45-9-55 does not provide a private right of action. We do not reach this argument, but the existence of the issue illustrates the lack <em>of </em>conflict here. Not every statutory violation gives rise to a private lawsuit, or to a claim for damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
