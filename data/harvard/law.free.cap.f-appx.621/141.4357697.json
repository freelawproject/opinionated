For the following reasons, we will dismiss his appeal from the District Court\u2019s May 20, 2014 order, and we will affirm in part and vacate in part the District Court\u2019s April 24, 2014 order.</p>\n<p id=\"AYX\">' I.</p>\n<p id=\"AvH7\">In November 2013, Schneller filed a pro se motion for leave to intervene in the above-captioned case, which involved a same-sex couple\u2019s challenge to, among other' things, Pennsylvania\u2019s Marriage Law, 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1102 and 1704. Schneller sought to intervene on behalf of himself and the Philadelphia Metro Task Force (\u201cTask Force\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which he states is a community organization of which he is the cofounder and sole decision-maker. The-District Court denied Schneller\u2019s request, concluding that he could not proceed pro se on behalf of the Task Force, and that he had not established that he was eligible to intervene by right or permission pursuant to Rule 24(a) or (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"A8n\">On March 17, 2014, the District Court denied Schneller\u2019s motion to reconsider. Schneller did not appeal from that order, and instead filed a motion for leave to file an amended motion to intervene. Schnel-ler argued that the District Court should allow him to file the amended motion to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), which governs the amendment of pleadings. He also stated that \u201c[t]he order denying intervention ... set forth errors that clearly could be resolved by an improved pleading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARxI\">On April 24, 2014, the District Court denied Schneller\u2019s motion, explaining that it was more properly construed as a second Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion for reconsideration. The District Court stated that, \u201c[ijnasmuch as we have previously denied Mr. Schneller\u2019s request for reconsideration, we again easily do so here, noting that he has met none of the touchstones of Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e),. and is merely attempting to gain a \u2018second bite\u2019 at the apple.\u201d The District Court\u2019s order also effectively issued a filing prohibition against Schneller, directing the Clerk of Court to \u201creturn any future filings by Mr. Schneller to him upon receipt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">Schneller\u2019s May 7, 2014 notice of appeal was returned to him due to the District Court\u2019s filing injunction. He then submitted a notice of appeal to this Court, challenging the denial of his motions, as well as the District Court\u2019s filing prohibition and its initial failure to file his notice of appeal. <em>{See </em>C.A. No. 14-2871.) We instructed the District Court to docket the appeal as filed on May 15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"AqtQ\">On May 20, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and declared that 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1102 and 1704 are unconstitutional. The defendants did not appeal. Schneller, however, filed a notice of appeal on June 14, 2014, attempting to appeal from the District Court\u2019s May 20, 2014 order. <em>{See </em>C.A. No. 14-3049.) He also again challenged the District Court\u2019s filing prohibition and its denial of his various motions.</p>\n<p id=\"AD5\">Schneller\u2019s appeals have been consolidated for all purposes, and are now ripe for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"AUf\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"ABOH\">First, Schneller does not have standing to challenge the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>May 20, 2014 order holding Pennsylvania\u2019s Marriage Law unconstitutional. He was a non-party whose motion to intervene was denied and, despite his arguments, he has not been aggrieved by the District Court\u2019s May 20th order. <em>See United States v. Stoerr, </em>695 F.3d 271, 276 (3d Cir.2012) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court and our Court have long recognized, as a general matter, 'that \u2018only parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Marino v. Ortiz, </em>484 U.S. 301, 304, 108 S.Ct. 586, 98 L.Ed.2d 629 (1988)). Thus, because Schneller lacks standing, we dismiss his appeal from the District Court\u2019s May 20th order.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u2018 Second, our jurisdiction is limited to review of the District Court\u2019 April 24, 2014 order. A second motion for reconsideration does not toll the time to appeal from an initial judgment, <em>see Turner v. Evers, </em>726 F.2d 112, 114 (3d Cir.1984), and Schneller\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within thirty days of either the District Court\u2019s February 6, 2014 order denying his motion to intervene or the March 17, 2014 order denying his first motion for reconsideration, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1). Accordingly, we review only the District Court\u2019s order denying Schneller\u2019s motion to file an amended motion to intervene. Our standard of review over the District Court\u2019s order is for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The District Court properly treated Schneller\u2019s motion as a second motion to reconsider its March 17th order denying his initial motion to intervene, as he clearly wanted the District Court to reconsider its previous orders and allow him to intervene. <em>See Ahmed v. Dragovich, </em>297 F.3d 201, 208 (3d Cir.2002) (stating that courts are free to recharacterize a \u201cmotion to amend to match the substance of the relief requested\u201d). The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the rechar-acterized motion, as Schneller merely restated the arguments set forth in his initial motion to intervene and first motion for reconsideration. <em>See Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, </em>554 U.S. 471, 485 n. 5, 128 S.Ct. 2605, 171 L.Ed.2d 570 (2008) (noting that Rule 59(e) \u201cmay not be used to relitigate old matters\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s April 24 order to the extent that it denied Schneller\u2019s amended motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We will, however, vacate the District Court\u2019s filing prohibition against Schneller. We review such an order for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, </em>901 F.2d 329, 331 (3d Cir.1990). A district court is permitted to issue a filing injunction against vexatious litigants under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) when it believes that the abusive conduct will continue if not restrained. <em>Id. </em>at 332. However, this is an \u201c \u2018extreme remedy which must be narrowly tailored and sparingly used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Matter of Packer Ave. Assoc., </em>884 F.2d 745, 747 (3d Cir.1989)); <em>see also Brow v. Farrelly, </em>994 F.2d 1027, 1038 (3d Cir.1993) (holding same). Before issuing such an order, the district court must provide the litigant with notice and an opportunity to respond. <em>See, e.g., Gagliardi v. McWilliams, </em>834 F.2d 81, 83 (3d Cir.1987) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Here, the District Court\u2019s April 24th order directed the Clerk \u201cto return any future filings by Mr. Schneller to him upon receipt.\u201d The District Court did not provide Schneller with notice of its intent to prohibit future filings or an opportunity to respond. Moreover, the restriction does not appear to be limited in any way. Although Schneller has filed numerous meritless actions and has attempted to intervene in many cases (and may very well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>constitute a vexatious litigant), the District Court offered no explanation for its imposition of the order. Thus, we will vacate the portion of the District Court\u2019s April 24, 2014 order setting forth the filing prohibition against Schneller.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We have thoroughly reviewed Schnel-ler\u2019s remaining arguments and claims on appeal and conclude that they are merit-less. Schneller\u2019s motions to file his brief out of time and to accept the noncompliant filing are granted, and Schneller\u2019s brief is deemed filed as of February 26, 2016. Ap-pellees\u2019 motion j;o be excused from filing a brief is granted. Schneller\u2019s motion for oral argument is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-13\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A7VM\">. We dismissed the Task Force as a party to this appeal in our January 2, 2015 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\">. We need not remand for any further proceedings because the District Court, if it wishes, can sua sponte direct Schneller to show cause why he should not be subject to a filing injunction. We express no opinion on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
