Slay contends that she was discharged from her job at the Florida State Attorney\u2019s Office because she complained about being required to falsely report on her time sheets that she spent 100% of her time working on a particular grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">Slay worked as a Victim Advocate for the State Attorney\u2019s Office in the Chipley, Florida office from March 1997 until October 31, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That office is part of Florida\u2019s 14th Judicial Circuit and is located in Washington County. In November 2012, Slay received an email that was sent to all of the Victim Advocates in the 14th Judicial Circuit, \u201cinforming them that their timesheets needed to reflect 100% time spent on the VOCA grant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Slay \u201crefused to do this since she was not spending 100% of her time on the grant,\u201d and she later discovered that \u201cMelanie Ditty from the Marianna business office ... was writing on her timesheet.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">\u201c[A]fter months of not claiming 100% time spent on the VOCA grant,\u201d Ditty sent Slay an email on March 27, 2013, \u201crequesting that [Slay] again certify that she had spent 100% of her time on the VOCA grant.\u201d Slay responded by email that same day, \u201cregarding her concerns about being asked, to falsify her time sheets yet again,\u201d and she asked to speak to Chief Assistant State Attorney Greg Wilson \u201cabout the issue.\u201d Slay and Wilson spoke on the phone on April 2, 2013, and during that conversation Slay \u201cdiscussed concerns [about] being asked to falsely represent the amount of time she spent working on the VOCA grant.\u201d Wilson stated that \u201cperhaps Washington County did not really warrant a full time Victim Advocate,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>According to Slay, \u201cafter several more months of indicating on her time sheets that she was working only 75% on the VOCA grant,\u201d she was told that her position was being eliminated. She was also told that she could take a new position as a Victim Advocate in Bay County, which would have been for her a 1.5-hour drive each way, or she could stay in Washington County as a receptionist with a $7,000 pay cut. Slay states that \u201cshe had no choice but to resign.\u201d Her employment ended on October 31, 2013, nearly seven months after her conversation with Wilson and her complaints about falsifying time sheets. After Slay resigned, another Victim Advocate was hired in Washington County to replace her. Slay asserts: \u201cAt no time was it [her] job or within her job duties to report misspending and/or the improper allocation of wages under the grant and in so objecting, she was acting as a private citizen and not as an employee of the Office of the State Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Slay filed a lawsuit in Florida state court against Wilson and Glenn Hess, State Attorney for the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, alleging that they had retaliated against her for exercising her First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wilson and Hess removed the case to federal district court and then moved to dismiss Slay\u2019s amended complaint. The district court granted that motion. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief. <em>Starship Enters. of Atlanta, Inc. v. Coweta Cnty., Ga., </em>708 F.3d 1243, 1252 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1960, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). The Court explained in <em>Garcetti:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">When an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a matter of public concern, the First Amendment requires a delicate balancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences. When, however, the employee is simply performing his or her job duties, there is no warrant for a similar degree of scrutiny. To hold otherwise would be to demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 423, 126 S.Ct. at 1961. Slay does not dispute that filling out time sheets was part of her official duties as an employee of the State Attorney\u2019s Office. She states in her brief to this Court, \u201cWhile keeping her time may have been a function of being an employee, it was not the reason why [her] job existed.\u201d She admits that \u201cshe had to submit timesheets to account for the work she accomplished.\u201d She argues, however, that \u201cfilling out timesheets was not her job, her job was to serve as a victim advocate.\u201d A duty does not have to be the reason a job existed or the primary purpose of the job to be part of an employee\u2019s official job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">Slay\u2019s internal complaints about how her time was allotted on the time sheets \u2014 even accusations that her supervisors were falsely allotting that time \u2014 did not remove her time sheet responsibilities from the normal course of her job duties and trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>form her complaints into constitutionally-protected speech. <em>See Morris v. Crow, </em>142 F.3d 1379, 1382 (11th Cir.1998) (concluding that an accident report written in the normal course of an investigator\u2019s job duties was not protected speech even though it contained information unfavorable to the sheriffs department). In complaining to her superiors at work about how time was allotted, she was speaking as an employee, and when a government employee speaks as an employee \u201cthere can be no First Amendment issue, and the constitutional inquiry ends.\u201d <em>Boyce v. Andrew, </em>510 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Abdur-Rahman v. Walker, </em>567 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that \u201cthe reports of the inspectors to their supervisors about sewer overflows they were required to investigate are not protected under the First Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Slay does not dispute those principles, but she argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lane v. Franks, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2369, 189 L.Ed.2d 312 (2014), broadened the scope of citizen speech. She asserts that her speech was protected under <em>Lane </em>even if it did \u201crelate to\u201d her job duties. <em>Lane </em>held that a public employee\u2019s sworn testimony, which was compelled by subpoena and given outside of the course of his ordinary job duties, was protected by the First Amendment even though the testimony concerned information about public corruption that he had discovered during the course of his job. <em>See id. </em>at 2378.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The <em>Lane </em>opinion noted: \u201c[T]he mere fact that a citizen\u2019s speech concerns information acquired by virtue of his public employment does not transform that speech into employee \u2014 rather than citizen \u2014 speech. The critical question ... is whether the speech at issue is itself ordinarily within the scope of an employee\u2019s duties, not whether it merely concerns those duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2379. Slay made an internal complaint about internal record-keeping. Her circumstances are far removed from the facts of <em>Lane, </em>because complaints to superiors in the workplace are not the same as subpoenaed grand jury and tria} testimony. Neither the holding nor the reasoning of <em>Lane </em>extends as far as Slay would stretch it.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">When Slay complained to her superiors that she was being required to falsely allot her time on her time sheets, she was performing her official duties as an employee and was speaking as an employee and not as a citizen. \u201cSpeech that owes its existence to the official duties of public employees is not citizen speech even if those duties can be described so narrowly as not to mandate the act of speaking.\u201d <em>Abdur-Rahman, </em>567 F.3d at 1285. Slay\u2019s amended complaint fails to state a First Amendment retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\">.We take these facts from Slay\u2019s amended complaint, accept them as true, and construe them in the light most favorable to her for the purposes of this appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. <em>See Belanger v. Salvation Army, </em>556 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-15\">. Slay does not state what the \u201cVOCA grant\u201d was.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-17\">. Slay does not state what Ditty was writing on her timesheet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. Slay's initial complaint also alleged a violation of the Florida Whistleblower Act, but she did not include that state law claim in her amended complaint, which is the operative one for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
