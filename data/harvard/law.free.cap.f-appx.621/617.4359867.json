The United States filed the writ to satisfy a judgment for restitution and fines that it had obtained in a criminal action against Wright. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">We review the denial of Wright\u2019s motion to dissolve the writ of execution for abuse of discretion. <em>See Zelaya/Capital Int\u2019l Judgment, LLC v. Zelaya, </em>769 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2014). Under that deferential standard, we will not disturb the judgment unless the district court \u201capplied the wrong law or its decision was manifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Wright\u2019s motion to dissolve the writ of execution. \u201cAll property in which [a] judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest ... [is] subject to levy pursuant to a writ of execution.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(a). A lien in favor of the United States \u201car[ose] on the entry of the judgment\u201d of restitution and fines, and the lien attached to \u201call property and rights to property of\u2019 Wright. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c). That lien was treated as \u201ca liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\u201d <em>id., </em>and when recorded on May 10, 1999, in the County Clerk\u2019s Office of Gadsden County, Florida, the lien had the same effect as a federal tax lien, <em>id, </em>\u00a7 3613(d), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Wright challenges the denial of his motion on three grounds, all of which fail. First, Wright argues, for the first time, that his property is not subject to a writ of execution because it was not mentioned as a forfeitable asset in his plea agreement, but federal law permitted the United States to seek a writ of execution on all of Wright\u2019s property in which he had a \u201csubstantial nonexempt interest,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(a). Second, Wright argues that his property is protected under the homestead exemption provided by the State of Florida, but the federal statute that permitted the writ of execution to satisfy the criminal judgment against Wright, <em>id., </em>provides no exception for a homestead exemption under state law. The Supreme Court ruled in <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>461 U.S. 677, 103 S.Ct. 2132, 76 L.Ed.2d 236 (1983), that the Supremacy Clause \u201cprovides the underpinning for the Federal Government\u2019s right to sweep aside state-created [homestead] exemptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 103 S.Ct. at 2146. Third, Wright argues that the lien is defective because the United States failed to comply with Florida law, but the United States satisfied its obligation to file its lien \u201cin the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the real property ... is situated,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 713.901(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Wright\u2019s motion to dissolve the writ of execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
