The district court dismissed Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint with prejudice as barred by the three-strikes provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"A0h\">Diaz does not address in his opening brief whether the district court erred in dismissing his complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g). Even if we construe his pleading entitled \u201cAffidavit Relating To Previous Filings\u201d as a timely filed reply brief, this does not help Diaz. Although we ordinarily do not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, <em>see United States v. Transocean Deepwater Drilling, Inc., </em>767 F.3d 485, 492 (5th Cir.2014), we have done so in the instant case in light of Diaz\u2019s pro se status and in the interests of justice. Diaz\u2019s arguments do not show that the district court erred in imposing the \u00a7 1915(g) bar and dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Diaz\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Asj\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
