On appeal, he argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">We review sentences for reasonableness, first ensuring that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error and then reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, as Mendoza-Lopez failed to object to the reasonableness of his sentence below, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To demonstrate plain error, Mendoza-Lopez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>fects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Where, as here, the district court varies or departs upward from the guidelines range, we must determine whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect\u201d the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). When imposing sentence, the district court assessed the facts and provided specific reasons consistent with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to support its determination that a sentence outside of the guidelines range was necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707. The district court was particularly concerned with Mendoza-Lopez\u2019s \u201cextensive\u201d criminal history, which included, among others, an uncounted conviction for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine. We have affirmed upward variances or departures based on a defendant\u2019s criminal history and uncounted convictions. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008). The district court also took Mendoza-Lopez\u2019s mitigation argument into account when sentencing him. Nothing required the district court to give dis-positive weight to the mitigating factors that Mendoza-Lopez advanced. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, Mendoza-Lopez\u2019s double counting argument is foreclosed, <em>see United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), as is his substantive reasonableness challenge based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry, <em>see United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Given the above, Mendoza-Lopez has not shown plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
