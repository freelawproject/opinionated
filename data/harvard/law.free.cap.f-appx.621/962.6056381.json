Dutton, as administrator of the estate of her late husband Bartow C. Dut-ton, appeals the dismissal of her Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claim, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). Dutton alleges that doctors and staff of the Charlie Norwood Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) committed medical malpractice under Georgia law. Specifically, she argues that Dr. David H. Riggans failed to properly perform an angiography, and that subsequently, various other VAMC employees failed to properly treat a condition that developed in Dutton\u2019s right leg. She contends that these failures resulted in \u201cMr. Dutton\u2019s intense suffering, agony and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>loss of his entire right leg due to amputation.\u201d The district court granted partial summary judgment to the United States for claims against Dr. Riggans because he was an .independent contractor \u2014 not an employee \u2014 under the FTCA. The court then granted summary judgment to the government on all remaining claims, holding that Dutton\u2019s only proffered expert was not competent to testify under Georgia evidentiary rules, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-7-702(c). After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Bartow Dutton was a veteran eligible for medical care at the VAMC. On May 24, 2010, Dutton was admitted to the VAMC after complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Testing revealed that he suffered from mesenteric ischemia, a vascular disease in which insufficient blood supply to the small intestine causes intestinal damage. As treatment, Dr. Rig-gans attempted to stent the blocked superior mesenteric artery. That attempt failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The night after the failed procedure, Dutton told staff at the VAMC that he felt as though he was losing blood flow in his right leg. A nurse could feel no pulse in his foot, and noted that his leg was discolored and cool to the touch. A vascular surgery team evaluated Dutton and determined that he had developed a blood clot in his right leg. Still, Dr. Manuel F. Ramirez, who led the team, recommended conservative treatment, noting the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">Given, patient\u2019s active issues with mesenteric ischemia and GI bleed, he has a strong contraindication to anti-coagulation, the patient was instructed to hang his right leg off the side of his bed and to be treated with conservative measures at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-8\">It was discussed [with the] patient that there may be a possibility that he will require an AKA [above knee amputation] in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The next morning, Dutton\u2019s right leg remained cold and pulseless. Dr. Ramirez noted that the \u201cgeneral consensus was to proceed with a repeat aortogram with intent to revascularize the celiac trunk and proceed with ly[t]ie therapy of his throm-bosed RLE.\u201d Dutton was transferred to the Medical College of Georgia to continue lytic therapy. The therapy was unsuccessful, and \u201cin light of the patient\u2019s mesenteric ischemia and risk of having an acute dead bowel presentation masked by the right lower extremity problems, it was decided to proceed with a lower extremity amputation.\u201d Dutton\u2019s right leg was amputated on June 6, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and use the same standard of review utilized by the district court.\u201d <em>Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Fla. v. United States, </em>566 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A court views the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Summary judgment is appropriate when a non-movant \u201cfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that part/s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We first address whether the district court erred by granting partial summary judgment because Dr. Riggans was an independent contractor. The FTCA \u201cwaive[s] the sovereign immunity of the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees.\u201d <em>FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1000, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (citing \u00a7 1346(b)). But a plaintiff may not recover against the United States for the torts of an independent contractor. <em>Means v. United States, </em>176 F.3d 1376, 1379-80 (11th Cir.1999). Under this Court\u2019s precedent, \u201ca person is not an \u2018employee of the government\u2019 for FTCA purposes unless the government controls and supervises the day-to-day activities of the individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379. Said another way, \u201cthe critical factor in making this determination is the authority of the principal to control the detailed physical performance of the contractor.\u201d <em>Logue v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 521, 527-28, 93 S.Ct. 2215, 2219, 37 L.Ed.2d 121 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We hold that Dr. Riggans was an independent contractor, not a federal employee. Dr. Riggans was an employee of Vascular Radiology Associates II(VRA). The contract between VRA and the VAMC states that VRA shall render services to the VAMC \u201cin its capacity as an independent contractor,\u201d and that VRA shall provide its workers compensation, insurance, health examinations, income tax withholding, and social security payments. More importantly, the contract expressly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APq\">The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided but retains no control over professional aspects of the services rendered, including by example, the Contractor\u2019s or its health-care providers\u2019 professional medical judgment, diagnosis, or specific medical treatments. The Contractor and its health-care providers shall be Hable for their liability-producing acts or omissions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Further, VRA \u2014 not the VAMC \u2014 established Dr. Riggans\u2019s work schedule, and Dr. Riggans spent only one-fourth of his time working at the VAMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Beyond the terms of the contract, the parties\u2019 performance suggests that the VAMC did not control Dr. Riggans\u2019s day-to-day activities. Dr. Riggans testified that VAMC policies did not \u201cdictate! ] ... any specific procedure\u201d he performed. He added that \u201c[t]he steps that, [he went] through to complete [a] procedure [were] 100 percent on [him].\u201d Similarly, Dr. Gau-tam Agarwal \u2014 a staff surgeon at the VAMC \u2014 stated that \u201cthe [VAMC] vascular surgeons do not tell the contract interven-tional radiologists employed by [VRA] how to perform a procedure, nor do they give technical guidance into the course of action that a contract interventional radiologist should take.\u201d As the district court put it, \u201c[t]he VAMC physicians consulted with Dr. Riggans about patients, but did not tell him <em>how </em>to conduct procedures or <em>hoiv </em>to treat an ailment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Dutton argues that because the VAMC supplied Dr. Riggans\u2019s equipment, facilities, and patients, he should be treated as its employee. However, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that this makes little difference: \u201c[w]hen a physician shows up to work in today\u2019s world \u2014 either as an independent contractor or a full-fledged employee \u2014 he no longer is likely to carry all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>relevant medical instruments in a black satchel.\u201d <em>Tsosie, </em>452 F.3d at 1164. Whether the VAMC provided Dr. Riggans with equipment does not affect our analysis of its control of his day-to-day activities. Dutton also points to Dr. Riggans\u2019s VAMC identification card which.listed him as an \u201cemployee.\u201d However, this detail does not overcome the myriad other facts suggesting he was an independent contractor. In short, the district court did not err in finding that Dr. Riggans was an independent contractor for purposes of the FTCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Next, we address the district court\u2019s grant of the government\u2019s motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Michael A. Bettmann.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Dutton preliminarily argues that because this case arises under federal law, the district court should have applied the Federal Rules of Evidence, not O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-7-702. To the contrary, in <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2004), we held that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-7-702 applies where a federal court exercises supplemental jurisdiction over a Georgia medical malpractice action. <em>Id. </em>at 1295. Although the general rule is that the Federal Rules of Evidence govern in diversity suits, this Court reasoned that Georgia\u2019s evidentiary rules are so intimately intertwined with its medical malpractice laws that it would create an <em>Erie </em>conflict not to apply the state evidentiary rules in federal court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">This, of course, is an FTCA case, not a supplemental-jurisdiction case, so the <em>Erie </em>doctrine does not apply. However, in FTCA cases, \u201cthe extent of the United States\u2019 liability ... is generally determined by reference to state law.\u201d <em>Molzof v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 301, 305, 112 S.Ct. 711, 714, 116 L.Ed.2d 731 (1992). And Federal Rule of Evidence 601 instructs that in civil cases, \u201cstate law governs the witness\u2019s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.\u201d Thus, although not controlling, we believe that our decision in <em>McDowell </em>is persuasive here. Georgia\u2019s evidentiary rules for a physician\u2019s expert testimony are so intimately intertwined with its malpractice laws that the rules must apply in an FTCA case for medical malpractice. That understanding accords with the holding of at least one sister Circuit. <em>See Liebsack v. United States, </em>731 F.3d 850, 855-56 (9th Cir.2013) (holding, in an almost identical case, that Alaska Statute \u00a7 09.20.185 applies in a FTCA action based on medical negligence). In short, we agree with the district court that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 24-7-702 applies here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Next, Dutton argues that even applying Georgia\u2019s evidentiary rules, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>court wrongly excluded the testimony of Dr. Michael Bettmann. \u201cWe review a district' court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>392 F.3d at 1294. \u201c[W]e do not apply a stricter standard even though the ruling results in a summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]o qualify as an expert in a medical malpractice action [in Georgia], the witness must (1) have actual knowledge and experience in the relevant area through either \u2018active practice\u2019 or \u2018teaching5 and (2) either be in the \u2018same profession\u2019 as the defendant whose conduct is at issue or qualify for the exception to the \u2018same profession\u2019 requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hankla v. Postell, </em>293 Ga. 692, 749 S.E.2d 726, 729 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">\u201cIn order to determine whether OCGA \u00a7 24-7-702(c) authorizes the admission of [expert] testimony, it is necessary in this case to accurately state both the area of specialty at issue and what procedure or treatment was alleged to have been negligently performed.\u201d <em>Toombs v. Acute Care Consultants, Inc., </em>326 Ga.App. 356, 756 S.E.2d 589, 593 (2014) (quotation marks omitted). Georgia courts have made clear that \u201cthe area of specialty is dictated by the allegations in the complaint, not the apparent expertise of the treating physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Dutton\u2019s complaint alleges negligence for failing \u201cto implement emergent medical care and treatment\u201d following \u201can acute thromboembolic event ... in Mr. Dutton\u2019s right leg.\u201d Thus, as the district court found, \u201cthe primary treatment at issue is the management of an emergent leg ischemia in a patient with critical mesenteric ischemia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Dr. Bettmann\u2019s testimony about whether the defendants negligently managed the care of a patient suffering from critical ischemia. The important distinction here is between vascular radiology and vascular surgery. According to Dr. Bettmann, \u201cthe training in vascular surgery is in surgical procedures,\u201d while \u201c[t]he training in [vascular] radiology is in imaging and use of imaging to perform procedures.\u201d Dr. Bettmann testified that he was board certified in vascular and interventional <em>radiology, </em>but was not certified or trained in vascular <em>surgery. </em>He testified that interventional radiologists are not trained to perform surgeries and that he had never done one himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">His lack of expertise as a vascular surgeon, or in broadly treating a patient suffering from critical ischemia, is fatal to his ability to testify about the VAMC\u2019s alleged negligence in this case. \u25a0 Dr. Bettmann\u2019s primary contention was that once Bartow Dutton showed symptoms like a cold, pulseless leg, the VAMC team should have performed one of two procedures within four to six hours: either (1) thrombolytic therapy or (2) surgical' thrombectomy. Thrombolytic therapy involves the use of drugs to break up or dissolve blood clots. However, Dr. Bettmann actually testified that he could \u201cnot say[ ] that [thrombolytic therapy was] something that should be done\u201d because of Dutton\u2019s ischemia of his intestines. <em>See also id. </em>(\u201cI think you could make a good point about the contraindication.\u201d). As for surgical thrombec-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>'tomy, Dr. Bettmann had never performed the procedure that he thought should have been done here, and testified that he did not \u201cknow how hard or easy it would have been in Mr. Dutton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">More broadly, the government\u2019s expert \u2014 Dr. Jacob Robison \u2014 summarized the problem inherent in Dr. Bettmann\u2019s proposed testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-5\">[I]nterventional radiologists are not trained as vascular surgeons and have no experience with surgical judgment and techniques required to manage patients with a complex arterial problem in the context of a life threatening'situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-6\">As an interventional radiologist, Dr. Bettmann ... has no clinical experience in \u2022 performing vascular-surgery procedures, like the surgery that he indicates should have been performed on Mr. Dut-ton by Dr. Ramirez on the evening of June 2, 2010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Speaking to Dutton\u2019s situation here, Dr. Robinson emphasized that the \u201csimultaneous compromise of circulation to <em>both </em>the right leg <em>and </em>the intestine\u201d presented \u201ca very difficult and challenging problem from the beginning.\u201d Lytic therapy was \u201crelatively contraindicated ... as the [intestinal] bleeding may have been exacerbated by the clot-dissolving therapy.\u201d And \u201c[t]he mesenteric ischemia was judged immediately more life threatening than the leg ischemia appeared to be immediately limb threatening, and concerns about the bowel preempted any attempt to save the leg with a long, complex surgery.\u201d Although Dutton may be right that \u201cit does not take a vascular surgeon to know that a blood clot which prevents blood flow to a leg will cause that limb to die,\u201d the district court was right that it \u201ctakes a vascular surgeon to know when intervention to save the limb of a critically ill patient will not kill the patient in the process'.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it excluded Dr. Bett-mann\u2019s testimony, we also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Under Georgia law, \u201c[t]o recover in a medical malpractice case, a plaintiff <em>must demonstrate, by expert testimony, </em>a violation of the applicable medical standard of care and also that the purported violation of or deviation from the proper standard of care is the proximate cause of the injury sustained.\u201d <em>Porter v. Guill, </em>298 Ga.App. 782, 681 S.E.2d 280, 285 (2009) (alterations adopted) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted). Because Dutton\u2019s only expert was properly excluded, the United States was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">. This language is almost identical to the language in the contract at issue in <em>Tsosie v. United States, </em>452 F.3d 1161 (10th Cir.2006), in which the Tenth Circuit held that a doctor was an independent contractor \u2014 not an employee \u2014 for purposes of the FTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1164-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b986-8\">. Our decision in <em>Bravo v. United States, </em>532 F.3d 1154 (11th Cir.2008), is readily distinguishable. The contract in that case specifically stated that \"[t]he contractor OB/GYN physician'activities shall be subject to day-today direction by Navy personnel in a manner comparable to the direction over Navy uniformed and civil personnel engaged in comparable work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1160 (alteration omitted). The contract also specified that contract doctors must \"comply[] with directions received from Navy hospital professional personnel in the course of patient care activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration adopted). There are no such provisions in VRA\u2019s contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b986-14\">.
