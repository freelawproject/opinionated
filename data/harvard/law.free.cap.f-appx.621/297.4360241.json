California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Calderon-Corona has not filed a response, has completed the confinement portion of his sentence, and has been removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">We do not enforce Calderon-Corona\u2019s appeal waiver in light of the magistrate judge\u2019s failure to admonish him adequately of its consequences. Nevertheless, our independent review of the relevant portions of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2, and in part as moot, <em>see United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
