By seeking leave to proceed IFP, Riley is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">Riley conclusionally argues that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782 and that his base offense level should have been reduced from 38 to 36, with a corresponding reduction in the applicable guideline range. But as th\u00e9 district court correctly concluded, because Riley was accountable for 44.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, his base offense level remains at 38 even under the retroactive amendment, and his range is unchanged. Because Amendment 782 did \u201cnot have the effect of lowering [Riley\u2019s] applicable guideline range,\u201d he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and he can show no error in the denial of relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>States v. Bowman, </em>632 F.3d 906, 910-11 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Riley has not demonstrated a nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n.24; 5th Cib. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The instant motion is Riley\u2019s fifth \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion seeking a reduction based on the same or similar frivolous claim. Riley is therefore CAUTIONED that future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings will invite the imposition of sanctions, which may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Riley is warned that he .should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
