Matthews\u2019s complaint primarily alleged that the restaurant had failed to pay her minimum wage and overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 et seq. In response to the complaint, Alston moved to compel arbitration based on an agreement. Matthews had signed when she was hired (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). Matthews claimed, however, that the Arbitration Agreement should not be enforced because it is \u201cincomplete, indefinite, contradictory and unintelligible,\u201d and includes an unconscionable cost-shifting provision and an unconscionable deadline for the arbitration proceedings. The district court summarily denied the motion to compel arbitration, saying only: \u201cThis is an FLSA overtime action. It is before the Court on the Defendant Alston\u2019s Motion To Compel Arbitration and to Stay [Doc. 19] which are DENIED.\u201d On appeal, Alston argues that: (1) the Arbitration Agreement is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable; (2) he never waived his right to arbitration; and (3) the district court\u2019s summary order denying arbitration does not allow for appellate review and should be vacated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel arbitration. <em>See Jenkins v. First Am. Cash Advance of Ga., </em>LLC, 400 F.3d 868, 873 (11th Cir. 2005). Where a district court\u2019s order is too summary in nature, we may \u201cundertake our own plenary inquiry into the\u201d issue on appeal if the record is complete and \u201cprovides an adequate basis\u201d for our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>review. <em>Hall v. Holder, </em>117 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.1997). Where, however, the record \u201cwholly fail[s] to provide [us] with an opportunity to conduct meaningful appellate review,\u201d we will vacate a district court\u2019s order and remand to the.district court to consider the case in full and enter a reasoned order. <em>Danley v. Allen, </em>480 F.3d 1090, 1091-92 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Clay v. Equifax, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 952, 957-58 (11th Cir.1985) (collecting cases in which the Supreme Court and our predecessor Court \u201curged the district court to state the reason for its decision and the underlying predicate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The FAA evinces a \u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983); <em>see also Picard v. Credit Solutions, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe FAA creates a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration.\u201d). Under this policy, courts \u201crigorously enforce\u201d arbitration agreements. <em>Klay v. All Defendants, </em>389 F.3d 1191, 1200 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). Thus, we\u2019ve affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to compel arbitration where, like here, employees brought FLSA claims against their employer. <em>See Caley v. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., </em>428 F.3d 1359, 1364 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Walthour v. Chipio Windshield Repair, LLC, </em>745 F.3d 1326, 1334 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cAfter examining the FLSA\u2019s text, legislative history, purposes, and ... Supreme Court decisions, we discern no \u2018contrary congressional command\u2019 that precludes the enforcement of plaintiffs\u2019 Arbitration Agreements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201c[Arbitration is a matter of contract.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, </em>563 U.S. 333, 131 S.Ct. 1740, 1745, 179 L.Ed.2d 742 (2011) (quotation omitted). A contract containing an arbitration agreement \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The FAA permits arbitration agreements \u201cto be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.\u201d <em>Concepcion, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1746 (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration.\u201d <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 91, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\u201c[S]tate law generally governs whether an enforceable contract or agreement to arbitrate exists.\u201d <em>Caley, </em>428 F.3d at 1368. Under Georgia law, \u201c[a] contract cannot be enforced if its terms are incomplete, vague, indefinite or uncertain.\u201d <em>Kitchen v. Insuramerica Corp., </em>296 Ga.App. 739, 675 S.E.2d 598, 601 (2009) (quotation omitted). A contract is also unenforceable if, \u201cin the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract.\u201d <em>NEC Techs., Inc. v. Nelson, </em>267 Ga. 390, 478 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1996) (quotations omitted). Unconscionability in Georgia can be either procedural, which \u201caddresses the process of making the contract,\u201d or substantive, which \u201clooks to the contractual terms themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When considering procedural unconscionability, the Georgia courts examine \u201cthe age, education, intelligence, business acumen and experience of the parties, their relative bargaining power, the conspicuousness and comprehensibility of the contract language, the oppressiveness of the terms, and the presence or absence of a meaningful choice.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 772. As for the substantive element, \u201ccourts have focused on matters such as the commercial reasonableness of the contract terms, the purpose and effect of the terms, the allocation of the risks between the parties, and similar public policy concerns.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Here, Matthews argues that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable because it is poorly written and unconscionable. The district court agreed with Matthews that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, but did so in a summary fashion, without expressing any factual findings or legal conclusions. Even the parties do not agree on the reasons behind the order. In fact, Matthews\u2019 only explanation for the brevity of the decision is that the language of the Arbitration Agreement compels its conclusion. After reviewing the full record, we remain hard-pressed to discern on what basis the district court relied in denying the motion to compel arbitration \u2014 especially given the \u201cliberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. 927. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for a full and reasoned order addressing any and all issues necessary to the court\u2019s decision. <em>See Danley, </em>480 F.3d at 1091-92; <em>see also Musnick v. King Motor Co. of Fort Lauderdale, </em>325 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that our sister circuits have remanded cases concerning motions to compel arbitration for further fact-finding); <em>Benoay v. Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc., </em>805 F.2d 1437, 1440-41 (11th Cir.1986) (\u201cWe therefore remand this case to the district court to conduct a more thorough exploration of the validity of the arbitration issue.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We identify below some of the issues the district court may address on remand, depending on how the court rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">First, as for Matthews\u2019s argument that the Arbitration Agreement is irreparably \u201cincomplete, indefinite, contradictory and unintelligible,\u201d we faced a similar challenge in <em>Blinco v. Green Tree Semcing LLC, </em>400 F.3d 1308 (11th Cir.2005), <em>abrogated on other grounds, as recognized in Lawson v. Life of the South Ins. Co., </em>648 F.3d 1166, 1171 (11th Cir.2011). There, the plaintiffs argued that an arbitration clause was unenforceable because it did not specify the identity of the arbitrator, forum, location or allocation of arbitration costs. <em>Id. </em>at 1312-13. We determined that this \u201cincompleteness\u201d did not invalidate the arbitration clause, relying on <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 90-91, 121 S.Ct. 513, which held that an arbitration agreement\u2019s failure to address fees and costs did not, on its own, invalidate it. <em>Blinco, </em>400 F.3d at 1313. Thus, the district court may need to address on remand how the agreements in <em>Blinco </em>and <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp. </em>compare to the one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The district court may also tackle whether the cost-shifting provision and 30-day deadline found in the Arbitration Agreement make it unconscionable. Indeed, when addressing a cost-sharing provision in an arbitration agreement, we\u2019ve said that the Supreme Court has \u201cmade clear that the strong federal preference for arbitration of disputes expressed by Congress in the [FAA] must be enforced where possible.\u201d <em>Musnick, </em>325 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>1258. Thus, in <em>Musnick, </em>we held that a \u201cparty seeking to avoid arbitration under [an arbitration] agreement has the burden of establishing that enforcement of the agreement would preclude him from effectively vindicating [her] federal statutory right in the arbitral forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259 (quotation omitted). We are unable to ascertain whether Matthews has done so here since, <em>inter alia, </em>resolving this issue und4r Georgia law is a fact-intensive exercise. As we\u2019ve observed, \u201c[a] finding that enforcing a contract provision would be unconscionable is a finding of an ultimate fact; it is inferred from a variety of circumstances depending on the nature of the case. In a sense, a court must conduct a mini-bench trial to reach the finding.\u201d <em>Cappuccitti v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>623 F.3d 1118, 1124 (11th Cir.2010) (footnote omitted). \u201cIn most cases, the court will make the finding on the basis of the claims the plaintiff is asserting, the contract documents (including the arbitration clause), the representations of the parties, judicial notice of court judgments, statutes, regulations (such as the amount of state and federal court filing fees), adjudicative facts <em>(see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201), affidavits, or testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 16. Yet despite the fact-intensive nature of this question, the district court has made no findings to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Nor, moreover, do we have any guidance from the district court concerning the sev-erability of any problematic provisions of the Arbitration Agreement. Whether a contract is severable under Georgia law turns on the intent of the parties. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-l-8(b). Once again, this is a question the district court may address in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In short, on this record, we are unable to conduct meaningful appellate review of the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement. <em>Danley, </em>480 F.3d at 1091-92. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\">. Matthews concedes on appeal that she has never argued that Alston waived the right to arbitration in this case, and we do not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-5\">. Even to the extent we\u2019ve viewed a motion to compel arbitration as akin to a motion for summary judgment, <em>see Johnson v. KeyBank Nat\u2019l Assoc., </em>754 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2014) (describing an order compelling arbitration as \u201csummary-judgment-like\u201d), we\u2019ve said that \u201cparties are entitled to know the reasons upon which summary judgments are based, if for no other purpose than to secure meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Hulsey v. Pride Restaurants, LLC, </em>367 F.3d 1238, 1243-44 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
