He now appeals his conviction and sentence. Hooper argues that his guilty plea was unknowing and involuntary because the Government withheld exculpatory sentencing evidence regarding the amount of methamphetamine for which he was accountable. He contends that the Government\u2019s withholding of this evidence violated its obligations under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Hooper\u2019s guilty plea precludes him from raising a claim that the Government failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Conroy, </em>567 F.3d 174, 178-79 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Orman v. Cain, </em>228 F.3d 616, 617 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Matthew v. Johnson, </em>201 F.3d 353, 361-62 (5th Cir.2000). Hooper concedes this point and raises the issue solely to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-20\">Hooper also argues that the Government\u2019s failure to provide exculpatory sentencing information resulted in a denial of the effective assistance of counsel. To establish ineffective assistance, Hooper must show that his counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient and that it prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Because Hooper does not show that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d he does not show that he was denied the effective as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>sistance of counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Regarding the reasonableness of his sentence, Hooper challenges being held responsible for conduct occurring prior to-the date alleged in the indictment. His argument fails. The district court determined that Hooper\u2019s relevant conduct includes acts dating from 2006. \u201cDrug transactions occurring before the precise time frame of the conspiracy for which a defendant is convicted may be considered\u201d as relevant conduct. <em>United States v. McCaskey, </em>9 F.3d 368, 375 (5th Cir.1993). Additionally, a district court\u2019s assessment of relevant conduct affects the calculation of a defendant\u2019s criminal history score, and the Guidelines explain that, for purposes-of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2), \u201ccommencement of the instant offense\u201d includes any relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.8).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Challenging the amount of drugs for which- he was held responsible at sentencing, Hooper notes that the district court sustained his objections to the drug quantity as set forth in the PSR but contends that counsel made an error in calculation and that the appropriate offense level was two levels lower than that argued at sentencing and determined by the district court. The error of which Hooper complains regarding drug quantity was invited and should be reviewed only for manifest injustice. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir.2010). Hooper has failed to satisfy this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Finally, 'Hooper argues that the district court erred in denying a reduction for having a minor role in the offense. He contends that he was not involved ih the conspiracy after 2008, and therefore, he should have .been granted a two-level reduction for having less involvement during the time frame covered by the indictment. The district court\u2019s denial of a reduction for a mitigating role is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). The determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro, comment. Hooper does not dispute that his actions during 2006-2007 would not qualify for a minor role reduction. Because the district court found that Hooper\u2019s relevant conduct included the conduct in 2006 and 2007, Hooper fails to show that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a minor role adjustment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5); <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
