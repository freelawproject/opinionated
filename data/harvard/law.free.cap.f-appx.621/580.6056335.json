Petitioner has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel to assist him in his appeal, which we DENY. As to the substance of the appeal, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) dismissing the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">Following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, Petitioner was convicted in May 2006 of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Federal prosecutors (\u201cthe Government\u201d) provided evidence to the sentencing court that Petitioner had at least three prior state convictions that qualified as predicate offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (the \u201cACCA\u201d), including: (1) a 1985 felony conviction for attempting to cause bodily injury with a deadly weapon, (2) a 1987 felony conviction for cocaine distribution, which had a maximum sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>tence of 15 years, and (3) a 1989 felony conviction for indecent assault. Based on these convictions, the court sentenced Petitioner as an armed career criminal under the ACCA to 240 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. Petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in February 2007. The Second Circuit dismissed the appeal in June 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In October 2009, Petitioner filed a motion in the Western District of New York to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other asserted claims, Petitioner argued in his \u00a7 2255 motion that the sentencing court erroneously categorized him as an armed career criminal under the ACCA. The district court denied Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and declined to issue a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Petitioner filed a notice of appeal and a motion for a COA, which the Second Circuit denied. Petitioner subsequently filed another \u00a7 2255 motion in the Western District of New York, which the district court construed as a request for permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and transferred to the Second Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). The Second Circuit denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Petitioner filed the \u00a7 2241 petition underlying this appeal in June 2014, asserting several grounds for relief from his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Petitioner alleged that his sentence violated due process because of a \u201clack of evidence\u201d that his 1987 drug conviction and his 1989 indecent assault conviction qualified as ACCA predicates under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). Petitioner also argued that the sentence was imposed without the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The magistrate judge issued an R <em>&amp; </em>R recommending dismissal of the petition. The R &amp; R noted that \u00a7 2255 is the primary method available to collaterally attack a federal sentence, and that \u00a7 2255(e) imposes jurisdictional requirements for obtaining relief under \u00a7 2241 that were not satisfied in this case. The district court adopted the R &amp; R, and dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioner argues on appeal that his claims met the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 2255(e), and that the district court thus erred in dismissing the petition. Petitioner also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">A. <em>Availability of Relief under \u00a7 224,1</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQC\">Whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider the merits of a \u00a7 2241 petition is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013). The jurisdictional question is a threshold issue, and we cannot reach the merits of a \u00a7 2241 petition unless we find that the district court had jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>Id. </em>at 1337, 1340 (holding that \u00a7 2255(e) imposes a jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>As noted in the R <em>&amp; </em>R, \u00a7 2255 is the primary mechanism for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his sentence. <em>See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2013). Petitioner previously filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion, and the Second Circuit denied Petitioner\u2019s subsequent attempts to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C., \u00a7 2255(h) (authorizing a successive motion that is certified by the appellate court to contain newly-discovered evidence sufficient to show that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty or a new, retroactively applicable, rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable). Relief under \u00a7 2255 is thus unavailable to Petitioner. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1311 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (\u201cThe statutory bar against second or successive motions is one of the most important AEDPA safeguards for finality of judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Petitioner argues that he may nevertheless collaterally attack his sentence via a \u00a7 2241 petition that falls within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e). -The savings clause permits a prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition where the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256. As applied to sentencing claims such as Petitioner\u2019s, this Court has interpreted the \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d language to permit a \u00a7 2241 petition when: (1) throughout sentencing, direct appeal, and the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the relevant Circuit precedent specifically addressed and squarely foreclosed the claim raised in the \u00a7 2241 petition, (2) subsequent to the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, a Supreme Court decision overturned the Circuit precedent that had squarely foreclosed the claim, (3) the new rule announced by the Supreme Court applies retroactively on collateral review, (4)' as a result of the new rule being retroactive, the petitioner\u2019s current sentence exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by Congress, and (5) the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) reaches the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">As discussed, Petitioner relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Shepard, Be-gay, </em>and <em>Descdmps </em>to satisfy the above requirements. Specifically, Petitioner argues that his 1987 drug conviction does not qualify as an ACCA predicate because the sentencing court improperly looked beyond Shepard-approved documents to determine that the conviction involved cocaine and thus carried a penalty of more than ten years. Petitioner further asserts that his 1989 indecent assault conviction does not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under <em>Begay\u2019s </em>\u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d analysis, and that the sentencing court failed to follow the categorical approach required by <em>Descamps </em>in concluding that the assault was a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-145, 128 S.Ct. 1581; <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-2282.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"><em>Shepard </em>and <em>Begay </em>do not even arguably bring Petitioner\u2019s claim within the first or second prong of <em>Bryant. Shepard </em>was decided in 2005, and was thus available to Petitioner throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Likewise, <em>Begay </em>was decided in 2008, prior to Petitioner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 proceeding. In fact, Petitioner acknowledges that he alleged a <em>Begay </em>error in his first \u00a7 2255 motion, but the district court determined that his claim was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">As for <em>Descamps, </em>that decision does not meet <em>Bryant\u2019s </em>third prong, which requires an intervening Supreme Court decision that \u201capplies retroactively on collateral review.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. To apply retroactively, a Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>decision must first announce a \u201cnew rule.\u201d <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (\u201ca case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d) (emphasis in original). <em>See also Howard v. United States, </em>374 F.3d 1068, 1073-74 (11th Cir.2004) (applying the <em>Teague </em>retro-activity doctrine). Assuming that requirement is met, the decision must also fall within an exception to the general prohibition against the retroactive application of such new rules to convictions that are already final. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (explaining that new constitutional rules only apply to final convictions in limited circumstances): New substantive rules generally qualify as an exception, but new procedural rules generally do not. <em>Id. </em>at 351-352, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (noting that only a \u201csmall set of watershed rules of criminal procedure\u201d apply retroactively) (quotation marks and citation omit-' ted).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><em>Descamps </em>refined the process for determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281-82. The <em>Des-camps </em>Court reaffirmed that in the case of a \u201cdivisible\u201d statute, the sentencing court may apply a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d, to determine which of the statutory alternatives formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction and thus whether the conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate. <em>Id. </em>at 2283-84 (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). In other words, when the statute at issue sets out alternative crimes, some of which qualify as. ACCA predicates and some of which do not, the sentencing court may look to certain Shepard-approved documents to determine which crime the defendant committed. However, the <em>Descamps </em>Court held that the modified approach had \u201cno role to play\u201d in a case involving an \u201cindivisible\u201d statute, that is, a statute that simply defines the crime at issue too broadly rather than setting forth alternative elements. <em>Id. </em>at 2285-86. Following <em>Descamps, </em>a sentencing court cannot look beyond the fact of conviction to determine whether the defendant\u2019s violation of an indivisible statute qualifies as an ACCA predicate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">As is evident from the above discussion, <em>Descamps </em>did not announce a \u201cnew\u201d constitutional rule. In fact, the <em>Descamps </em>Court emphasized that the outcome in the case was \u201call but resolve[d]\u201d by existing Supreme Court precedent \u201cexplaining the categorical approach and its \u2018modified\u2019 counterpart.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283. Neither did <em>Descamps </em>implement a substantive or a \u201cwatershed\u201d procedural change in the law. <em>See Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352-357, 124 S.Ct. 2519 (describing the difference between substantive and procedural rules and discussing the \u201cextremely narrow\u201d class of watershed procedural rules). Rather, the <em>Descamps </em>Court simply interpreted its \u201cprior decisions and the principles underlying them\u201d to hold that \u201csentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime [at issue] has a single, indivisible set of elements.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282. As such, <em>Des-camps </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and is not a proper basis for granting relief under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">B. <em>Failure to Conduct an Evidentiary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing in this case for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Hernandez v. United States, </em>778 F.3d 1230, 1232 (11th Cir.2015). An. evidentiary hearing is not required if the petitioner\u2019s allegations or claims are \u201caffirmatively contradicted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). That is the case here. It was evident from the record before the district court that Petitioner was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2241, because he did not cite any Supreme Court authority that was (1) issued after his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding and (2) retroactively applicable. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s request for an eviden-tiary hearing. <em>See San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1271-1272 (11th Cir.2011) (the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing where there was no reason to believe an evidentiary hearing would help the petitioner prevail on his claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">For the reasons discussed above, Petitioner\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED, and the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Appellant\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\">. Petitioner had filed two prior \u00a7 2255 motions, which were dismissed as premature and denied without prejudice to refile after his direct appeal became final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">. In the interim, Petitioner filed a separate \u00a7 2241 petition in the Northern District of Florida, which, the district court denied. He subsequently filed a third successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the Western District of New York, which was again transferred to and denied by the Second Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
