(2012) petition without prejudice. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2012). The magistrate judge recommended that the \u00a7 2241 petition be dismissed without prejudice and advised Brown that failure to file timely, specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. The district court found that no objections were filed and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition. The record discloses, however, that Brown filed timely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. The objections were mistakenly construed as a notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s order because they were received after entry of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">We accordingly vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for consideration of Brown\u2019s timely objections.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-12\"> We have construed Brown's informal brief as a timely notice of appeal.
