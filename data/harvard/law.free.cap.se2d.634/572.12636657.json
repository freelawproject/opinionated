(\"BMA\"), appeals from an order issued 16 November 2004 in Wake County Superior Court dismissing BMA's claims pursuant to North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(b)(1), and alternatively, granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Facility Services (\"DFS\") and North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Facility Services, Medical Facilities Planning Section (\"the Planning Section\"), and defendant-intervenors, Total Renal Care of North Carolina, Inc. (\"TRC\") and Health Systems Management, Inc. (\"HSM\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 1 July 2004, BMA, the sole provider of in-center kidney dialysis services in Wake County, received the July 2004 Semiannual Dialysis Report (\"SDR\") prepared by the Planning Section. This report is released twice each year as part of the State Medical Facilities Plan (\"SMFP\"). The SMFP defines and governs how the need for additional dialysis stations is to be determined. The Planning Section applies the formula established in the SMFP to the data reported to it from the Southeastern Kidney Council (\"Kidney Council\") to determine whether the various counties are in need of additional dialysis stations. The July 2004 SDR reported that there was a need in Wake County for an additional ten dialysis stations, and gave a deadline for applications to fill that need. Any dialysis provider, including BMA, could apply for a Certificate of Need (\"CON\") which is what is required to fill a reported need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After reviewing the SDR, BMA contacted the Planning Section and was provided with the data upon which the report was based. BMA compared the data it was given to its own numbers and determined that an error had been made in the data reported to the Planning Section by the Kidney Council. The data reported by the Kidney Council showed fifty-two patients at BMA's Fuquay-Varina facility when there actually were fifty-one. This error resulted in a calculation that the Fuquay-Varina facility was operating at over eighty percent capacity, when use of the\n   correct patient count would have shown the facility was operating at less than eighty percent capacity. Due to the formula used to calculate need, had the correct data been used, the need determination for new dialysis stations in Wake County would have been zero, rather than ten as reported in the July 2004 SDR. BMA contacted the Planning Section to report this error and was informed that no changes to the SDR could be made based on BMA's data unless the error was confirmed by the Kidney Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 2 July 2004, BMA contacted the Kidney Council regarding the possible data error. The Kidney Council confirmed the error to BMA on 13 July 2004. The Kidney Council informed the Planning Section of the error on 16 July 2004. On 19 July 2004, BMA requested that the Planning Section amend the July 2004 SDR to correct the error in the data reported by the Kidney Council. The Planning Section advised BMA on 20 July 2004 that, after reviewing the request to amend the July 2004 SDR, DFS management had declined to amend the SDR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   BMA filed a verified Complaint for a Declaratory Judgment, a Permanent and Preliminary Injunction, and Writ of Mandamus on 11 August 2004 where BMA sought to compel the Planning Section to amend the July 2004 SDR to reflect results based on corrected data. BMA further sought to prevent the acceptance of any CON applications based upon the unamended July 2004 SDR. TRC and HSM, providers of in-center kidney dialysis services in counties other than Wake, were allowed to intervene by consent on 25 August 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants DFS and the Planning Section filed an Answer and Motions to Dismiss and Defendant-Intervenors TRC and HSM filed a Motion to Dismiss on 20 September 2004. A hearing on the motions was held at the 12 November 2004 session of Wake County Superior Court. The trial court dismissed BMA's claims pursuant to North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(b)(1), and alternatively, granted summary judgment in favor of defendants DFS and the Planning Section and defendant-intervenors TRC and HSM by order issued 16 November 2004. BMA gave notice of appeal on 15 December 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   BMA argues the following issues on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in dismissing its claims based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity; (2) the Planning Section abused its discretion in failing to amend the SDR; (3) the Governor was not the person or entity with the authority to amend the SDR; (4) the trial court erred in converting defendants' motions to dismiss to motions for summary judgment; (5) BMA's claims are not moot; and (6) if not properly before the trial court, BMA's action may be brought before the Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\"). For the reasons stated below, we affirm Judge Hight's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   BMA's first assignment of error contends the trial court erred in dismissing its claims pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. As a preliminary matter, we address whether the issue of sovereign immunity is properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their Motion to Dismiss, defendants DFS and the Planning Section alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(b)(1), a lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Defendants TRC and HSM also filed a Motion to Dismiss, in which they alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   a lack of subject matter jurisdiction in part due to sovereign immunity, a lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and alternatively granted summary judgment in favor of defendants and defendant-intervenors, having considered matters outside the verified pleadings. The trial court did not rule on the other grounds for dismissal, such as a lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). The reasons stated for granting dismissal included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"`[A]n appeal of a motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity presents a question of personal jurisdiction rather than\n   subject matter jurisdiction.'\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Although the trial court gave several reasons why BMA's claims were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, it did not rule on the Rule 12(b)(2) motions. Neither defendants nor defendant-intervenors brought cross assignments of error to the trial court's failure to make a 12(b)(2) ruling. The scope of review on appeal is limited to those assignments of error properly set forth in the record on appeal. N.C. R.App. P. 10(a) (2006). To properly preserve a question for appellate review a party must request, and receive, a ruling on the question from the trial court. N.C. R.App. P. 10(b)(1) (2006). As there was no ruling by the trial court on the issue of personal jurisdiction, and there was no error assigned, the matter is not properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We next consider whether sovereign immunity may properly be addressed under a grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A defendant may show that summary judgment is proper by \"(1) proving that an essential element of the plaintiff's case is nonexistent, or (2) showing through discovery that the plaintiff cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim, or (3) showing that the plaintiff cannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    James v.

First, BMA contends that the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") allows suit against State agencies when appropriate relief is not available through the administrative and judicial review process. In support of this position, BMA specifically relies upon the following language contained in the APA:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent any person from invoking any judicial remedy available to him under the law to test the\n   validity of any administrative action not made reviewable under this Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-43 (2003). BMA ignores, however, the preceding language of that statute. In its entirety the statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Any person who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case, and who has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him by statute or agency rule, is entitled to judicial review of the decision under this Article, unless adequate procedure for judicial review is provided by another statute, in which case the review shall be under such other statute. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent any person from invoking any judicial remedy available to him under the law to test the validity of any administrative action not made reviewable under this Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633141\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/385/#p389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At no time does BMA assert that it is- and clearly it is not-a person aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case, which is a prerequisite for this statute to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Further, the trial court made the following findings of fact, which we hold are supported by sufficient evidence:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   4. . . . . The State Medical Facilities Plan is specifically excluded from the definition of a rule. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-2(8a)(k). As acknowledged by Plaintiff in its Complaint, the SDR is part of the State Medical Facilities Plan. . . . . Therefore, the SDR is not a rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   11. It is clear, as a matter of law, neither Defendants nor any of their individual employees or agents named by Plaintiff have authority to amend the July 2004 SDR as requested by Plaintiff, as that authority lies with the Governor of North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    Frye Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Hunt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132016\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/350/39/\">\n    350 N.C. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , [46-47,]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20159\">\n    510 S.E.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164 (1999). There is no allegation or evidence tending to show that Plaintiff ever made a proper request for the Governor to amend the July 2004 SDR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Frye,\n   </em>\n   the Governor has the authority to amend the SMFP, and in the instant case, there is no evidence indicating that such a request was made to or denied by the Governor. As the SDR is a part of the SMFP, it is only logical that the Governor is the proper party with the authority to amend the SDR. BMA sought to have the Planning Section amend the report, when in actuality, the Governor was the proper party to whom the proposed amendment should have been addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The dissent suggests that the majority's allowing the use of the defense of sovereign immunity abrogates any remedy for a party aggrieved by the State. This is not the case. We merely are presented by a set of facts in this case in which sovereign immunity is appropriate and, accordingly, have permitted application of the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is nothing in this opinion which abrogates or seeks to abrogate the proper application of the APA-which provides a more than adequate remedy to a party aggrieved by the State in many instances. Moreover, there is nothing in this opinion that abrogates or seeks to abrogate the proper application of the Declaratory Judgment Act- another remedy available to parties aggrieved by the State in certain instances. In this case, however, neither remedy is available as plaintiff did not seek an amendment to the SMFP as prescribed by\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   -by seeking an amendment through the Governor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The dissent seems to suggest that the plan is a fluid document, subject to constant updating via the agency's ministerial duties. We cannot agree. Instead, the enabling statute seems to suggest that the plan is a snapshot in time intended to enable the Department to \"[d]evelop policy, criteria, and standards for health service facilities planning[,]\" among other things. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 131E-177(4) (2003).\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   was clear on this point. It is the role of the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Health Coordinating Council to\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"prepare\" or \"develop\" the SMFP. N.C. [Gen.Stat.] \u00a7\u00a7 131E-176(25), 131E-177(4). The Governor's role is to \"approve\" the SMFP. N.C. [Gen.Stat.] \u00a7 131E-176(25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Read in context, these statutes suggest that the Governor's role is to make the final decision concerning the SMFP's contents after it has been developed and prepared by the Department and the Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Frye,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132016\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/350/39/\">\n    350 N.C. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20159\">\n    510 S.E.2d at 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court recently has reiterated that authority in\n   <em>\n    Good Hope Health Sys., L.L.C. v. N.C.

BMA cites specifically to subsections (a) and (b) which authorize suit against the Department of Health and Human Services in an administrative proceeding or in court regarding decisions to \"issue, deny, or withdraw a certificate of need[.]\" This statute clearly is inapplicable as there has been no decision by the Department of Health and Human Services regarding the issuance, denial or withdrawal of a CON. BMA argues that this statute should be applied nonetheless in this case as the refusal to amend the SDR \"set the process in motion\" that ultimately would result in the granting or denial of a CON. This is beyond the terms and conditions for the waiver of immunity prescribed by the statute and therefore does not support a waiver of immunity under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As the State has not consented to suit in this case and there is no statutory waiver of sovereign immunity under this set of circumstances, we hold that the doctrine of sovereign immunity applies in this case. BMA further argues that its rights under both the State and federal constitutions have been violated and, therefore, its claims should not be precluded on the basis of sovereign immunity. However, BMA did not allege violation of its constitutional rights in either its Complaint or proposed Amended Complaint. Although BMA did allege in its Response to Defendant and Defendant-Intervenors' Motion to Dismiss that its constitutional rights had been violated, this allegation was insufficient to overcome the defense of sovereign immunity because the right allegedly violated is not constitutionally protected.\n   <em>\n    See Coleman v.

Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On 1 July 2004, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Facility Services (\"DFS\") published the July 2004 Semiannual Dialysis Report (\"SDR\") which determined a need for ten additional dialysis stations in Wake County as a result of data provided by the Kidney Council to North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Facility Services, Medical Facilities Planning Section (\"the Planning Section\"). On 1 July 2004, Jim Swann (\"Swann\"), Regional Director of Health Services for BMA, contacted Jim Keene (\"Keene\"), a planner with the Planning Section. Swann noted an error in the data which indicated fifty-two patients were receiving services at BMA's Fuquay-Varina dialysis facility, when the actual census was only fifty-one patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But for the Kidney Council's error, no additional need determination would have occurred, and the utilization of existing dialysis stations would have remained below eighty percent. Keene recalculated the dialysis station need, but failed to make any changes in the SDR based on the corrected data Swann provided. On 2 July 2004, Swann contacted the Kidney Council, which acknowledged the correct census was fifty-one patients. Later that day, Swann spoke with Keene to see\n   whether the Kidney Council had contacted him to correct the miscalculation. Swann discovered the Kidney Council had not yet contacted Keene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On 13 July 2004, the Kidney Council contacted Swann, confirmed that the reported patient census was erroneous, and stated it would contact the Planning Section. On 16 July 2004, Jenna Krisher, the Executive Director of the Kidney Council, sent an e-mail to Keene admitting the error and stated the correct patient census for BMA's Fuquay-Varina facility was fifty-one patients as of 31 December 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On 19 July 2004, Swann sent a letter to Keene and requested DFS amend the SDR to reflect the actual census of fifty-one patients. On 20 July 2004, Keene responded in a letter and stated in pertinent parts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [T]he Agency relies on data provided by the Southeastern Kidney Council (SEKC) for the \"Semiannual Dialysis Reports (SDR).\" The timeline for production of each issue of that report is established in the State Medical Facilities Plan. The timeline for the \"July 2004 SDR\" indicated that data for the period ending December 31, 2003 would be reported by the SEKC on May 12, 2004 for the report to be published on July 1, 2004. The Agency must adhere to this timeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [T]he current Agency practice regarding revision of need determinations based on changes in inventory, a different but parallel issue, does not allow a need determination to be \"reduced if the relevant inventory is adjusted upward\n   <em>\n    60 days or less prior to the applicable `Certificate of Need Application Due Date.'\n   </em>\n   \" Applications for need determinations in the \"July 2004 SDR\" are due on September 15, 2004.

DFS failed to amend the July 2004 SDR, and began accepting applications for CONs. BMA filed suit against defendants seeking a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctions, and petition for writ of mandamus. On 13 September 2002, Judge Howard Manning issued a temporary injunction, which \"prohibited [defendants] from issuing a certificate of need to any person for the development or operation of any dialysis stations in Wake County as a result of the [ten]-station county need determination set forth in the July 2004 SDR. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On 16 November 2004, Judge Henry W.

Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The practical effect of the majority's decision is to remove from judicial review and remedy a state administrative agency's decision under the guise of sovereign immunity. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 10A, 14B.0155(b). The North Carolina General Assembly expressly waived sovereign immunity by enacting N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-43 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-254. A state agency cannot assert sovereign immunity as a defense to claims by an aggrieved party adversely affected by that agency's action or inaction. Judge Manning expressly recognized the availability of judicial review and issued an injunction, a judicial remedy, to prevent DFS from proceeding to issue certificates of need based on erroneous data which generated the need. Nothing in the record shows DFS defended or objected to entry of this injunction based upon an assertion of sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Administrative Code clearly requires defendants to correct the SDR when erroneous data is timely brought to its attention as a ministerial duty. BMA's requested remedies of declaratory judgment and petition for writ of mandamus are expressly recognized by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 150B-43, the Declaratory Judgment Act, and prior precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   BMA's requested review and remedies have been recognized for centuries as an inherent right and authority of the Judicial Branch and under the North Carolina Constitution to compel a governmental agency to perform a ministerial duty owed to BMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 18 (\"All courts shall be open; every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law; and right and justice shall be administered without favor, denial, or delay.\");\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

DFS admitted, using the corrected data, it possessed neither power nor authority under the statutes or Administrative Code to solicit CON applications for additional dialysis stations in Wake County, if the utilization rate was below eighty percent. The corrected data was furnished to DFS well within the time period required in the Administrative Code to cancel the solicitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Admin.

DFS was required to correct the error and to cancel the solicitation for CON applications as a ministerial duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   It is undisputed that DFS received the corrected patient census long before the Administrative Code and statutes would have allowed additional beds to be added under a new CON.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Judicial Branch and the General Court of Justice possesses the statutory jurisdiction to review defendants decision and power to compel defendants to comply with the statutes and Administrative Code to correct its admitted error. Sovereign Immunity does not remove jurisdiction to prevent the court's review of BMA's claims. The majority's opinion is an unprecedented abdication of the court's essential statutory and constitutional duty to provide judicial review and remedies to BMA's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendants based on sovereign immunity. The trial court's order should be reversed. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
