We find no error in the denial of the motion to dismiss but reverse and vacate the conviction of first-degree burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 18 January 2005, defendant Pierre Torez-Omar Farrar was indicted for robbery with a dangerous weapon and first-degree burglary. On 7 February 2005, defendant was also indicted for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. The case was tried at the 14 March 2005 Criminal Session of Guilford County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State presented evidence at trial which tended to show the following: On 22 March 2004, defendant, along with Brandon Williams and a man named Verdelle, went to a residence on Avalon Road in Guilford County. The three men got on the porch, put shirts over their faces and put latex gloves on their hands. Verdelle then kicked the door in and walked into the house with a gun, followed by Williams and defendant. Inside the house were Mollie Slade, her sister Darlene Slade, Darlene's two children, and Mollie's sons Lamar and Demar. Lamar came out of the back of the house, and Verdelle pointed a gun at him. A chain was taken from around Lamar's neck, and Verdelle walked into Lamar's room and took a Playstation, some games, and a VCR. Williams kept watch on Mollie and Darlene while defendant walked up and down the hallway, looking through rooms. Meanwhile, the men kept asking, \"Where is it? Where is the money?\" and \"Where is the stuff?\" Finally, before leaving, one of the men picked up Darlene's purse and asked her if there was any money in it. When she said no, the man dropped the pocketbook and the three men left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the close of the evidence, the judge instructed the jury on the charge of first-degree burglary as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Now, I charge that for you to find the defendant guilty of first-degree burglary, the State must prove six things beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   And sixth, that at the time of the breaking and entering, the defendant intended to commit robbery with a firearm. Or attempted to commit robbery with a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and first-degree burglary and was sentenced to consecutive terms of seventy-two to ninety-six months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction for attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss such charges. Specifically, defendant contends that the State failed to present substantial evidence that he took or attempted to take any property from Mollie or Darlene Slade. After careful review of the records, briefs and contentions of the parties, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, the State must present substantial evidence of each essential element of the charged offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We conclude this evidence was sufficient to show that there was an attempted taking. The grabbing of the pocketbook was an \"overt act\" calculated to deprive Darlene of her personal property.

At the charge conference, following the evidentiary portion of the trial, the trial court informed the parties that it intended to instruct the jury that in order for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the offense of felonious breaking or entering, they, the jury, had to find that the defendant intended to commit the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury or assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Silas,\n   </em>\n   there was no amendment or motion to amend the indictment made by the State, however, the outcome was the same; the jury was instructed and defendant convicted of a crime of which he was not given sufficient notice in order to enable him to prepare an adequate defense.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 382,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635398\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/604/#p608\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We find that the same analysis applied by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Silas\n   </em>\n   is applicable in the instant case, and therefore it must be held that while there is no requirement that an indictment for first-degree burglary contain specific allegations of the intended felony, if an indictment does specifically allege the intended felony, the State must prove that particular felony and no amendments may be had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, it is axiomatic that where the State alleges an intent to commit a specific felony as an element of burglary in the indictment, such as in the instant case, that the jury be required to find defendant possessed the intent to commit the specific felony alleged in order to convict on the charge. Based on the foregoing conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the remaining assignment of error asserted by defendant on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the trial court correctly denied the motion to dismiss the charge of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, but the trial court's instructions to the jury as to first-degree burglary created a fatal variance in the indictment and resulted in prejudicial error. Therefore, the conviction of first-degree burglary must be vacated and remanded for entry of judgment of non-felonious breaking and entering. Further, the record on appeal contains additional assignments of error which are not properly addressed by defendant in his brief to this Court. Pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6), we deem them abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   No error in part and vacated in part and remanded for entry of judgment of non-felonious breaking and entering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN and Judge HUNTER concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
