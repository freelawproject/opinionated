For the reasons stated herein, we find defendant's judgment and conviction to be without error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The State's evidence tends to show that on 28 May 2001, Carla Patterson, (\"Carla\"), her sister, Candace Patterson (\"Candace\"), and their roommate, Christine Crawford (\"Christine\"), the sister of defendant, received a call around 10:00 p.m. from defendant asking what they were doing and if they were going to bed. Carla told defendant that they would all be going to bed soon. Candace and Christine went to bed shortly thereafter and Carla remained on the sofa in the front room to watch television. The front door and screen were closed but not locked at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Another call was made at 1:00 a.m. on the morning of 29 May 2001, however, Carla did not answer it. Sometime thereafter, Carla fell asleep on the sofa, but was awakened around 4:00 a.m. by a bumping noise. Carla discovered that the screen door was propped open and that both her and Candace's purses were missing. Carla's purse contained personal identification, credit cards, a money order, $400.00 to $500.00 in cash, identification for her father, Charles Patterson, and her father's endorsed paycheck in the amount of $391.00 from Holiday Pools to be cashed and used to pay his bills. The women considered the possibility that defendant had taken the purses, due to the earlier phone calls and the fact that defendant had entered their residence in the night the week prior to the break-in, and had awakened Candace by sitting on her bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 31 May 2001, defendant attempted to cash a $391.00 paycheck from Holiday Pools made out to Charles Patterson at the drive-thru of a Wachovia bank. After the teller noted that the identification was for a much older man than defendant, she instructed defendant to enter the bank. Defendant left the scene. The teller positively identified defendant as the individual who attempted to cash Charles Patterson's paycheck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Two weeks following the break-in, Candace met her sister Jesse Patterson (\"Jesse\") at the Tee-Time bar, where she saw defendant playing pool with his brother, Jason. Candace heard defendant say, \"I'm not worried about them bitches. I got them anyway.\" Jesse heard defendant say \"I got you girls, I got your stuff.\" Candace threatened defendant with a pool cue, but was stopped by Jason, and then left the bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant offered no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to first degree burglary and defendant was sentenced to 108 to 139 months in prison. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant first contends that the trial court erred in refusing defendant's request to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor breaking or entering.

Defendant's affirmative statement as to his prior record level constitutes a stipulation for purposes of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(f). We therefore find this assignment of error to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As the trial court did not err in failing to give an instruction as to the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor breaking and entering, defendant failed to establish a reasonable inference that his presumptive sentence\n   was punishment for his failure to take a plea bargain, and defendant's prior record level was stipulated to by counsel, we find no error in defendant's judgment and conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN and Judge McCULLOUGH concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
