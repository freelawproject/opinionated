Dinh Pham,\n    </em>\n    Criminal No. K105537, pending in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Judge Alden granted Pham's motion to prohibit the death penalty. In a letter opinion incorporated in that order, Judge Alden concluded that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Optional Protocol on Disputes, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 (the \"Vienna Convention\"), confers judicially enforceable individual rights and that the Commonwealth violated those rights with regard to Pham. Judge Alden further concluded that the preclusion of the death penalty was an appropriate remedy for the violation of Pham's rights under the Vienna Convention and thus prohibited the Commonwealth from seeking the death penalty in that criminal proceeding. The Commonwealth's Attorney then filed the petitions for a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition.\n   </history>\n   <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n    <em>\n     Page v.

The authorized punishment for a Class 1 felony is \"death, if the person so convicted was 16 years of age or older at the time of the offense and is not determined to be mentally retarded . . ., or imprisonment for life and . . . a fine of not more than $100,000.\" Code \u00a7 18.2-10(a);\n     <em>\n      see also\n     </em>\n     Code \u00a7 18.2-10(g) (except in cases for which the sentence of death is imposed, a court may impose life imprisonment without a fine). In other words, there are three sentencing options if a defendant is found guilty of capital murder: (1) death; (2) life imprisonment and a fine of not more than $100,000; or (3) life imprisonment.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     In the context of ruling on a pre-trial motion, Judge Alden precluded the Commonwealth's Attorney from seeking the death penalty in the event Pham is found guilty of capital murder. Under Judge Alden's order, only life imprisonment, or life imprisonment and a fine of not more than $100,000, would\n     be at issue in a penalty phase hearing. Judge Alden's pre-trial order not only eliminated one of the statutorily prescribed sentences that could be imposed if Pham is found guilty of capital murder, but her ruling is also tantamount to a refusal by Judge Alden to conduct a penalty phase hearing at which the \"future dangerousness\" and \"vileness\" aggravating factors set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and - 264.4(C) would be at issue. The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C), however, state that \"[i]f the jury finds the defendant guilty of an offense which may be punishable by death, then a separate proceeding before the same jury\n     <em>\n      shall\n     </em>\n     be held as soon as practicable on the issue of the penalty, which\n     <em>\n      shall\n     </em>\n     be fixed as is provided in \u00a7 19.2-264.4.\" (Emphasis added.) When the action of a court is \"a simple refusal to hear and decide the case; and this [C]ourt having held that no appeal lies from such refusal, it is exactly the case to which the highly remedial writ of mandamus is most frequently applied, in order to prevent a defect or failure of justice.\"\n     <em>\n      Cowan v.
