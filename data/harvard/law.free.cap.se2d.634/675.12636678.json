Dinh Pham,</em> Criminal No. K105537, pending in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Judge Alden granted Pham's motion to prohibit the death penalty. In a letter opinion incorporated in that order, Judge Alden concluded that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Optional Protocol on Disputes, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 (the \"Vienna Convention\"), confers judicially enforceable individual rights and that the Commonwealth violated those rights with regard to Pham. Judge Alden further concluded that the preclusion of the death penalty was an appropriate remedy for the violation of Pham's rights under the Vienna Convention and thus prohibited the Commonwealth from seeking the death penalty in that criminal proceeding. The Commonwealth's Attorney then filed the petitions for a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition.</history>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-11\"><em>Page v.

The authorized punishment for a Class 1 felony is \"death, if the person so convicted was 16 years of age or older at the time of the offense and is not determined to be mentally retarded . . ., or imprisonment for life and . . . a fine of not more than $100,000.\" Code \u00a7 18.2-10(a); <em>see also</em> Code \u00a7 18.2-10(g) (except in cases for which the sentence of death is imposed, a court may impose life imprisonment without a fine). In other words, there are three sentencing options if a defendant is found guilty of capital murder: (1) death; (2) life imprisonment and a fine of not more than $100,000; or (3) life imprisonment.</p><p id=\"p-13\">In the context of ruling on a pre-trial motion, Judge Alden precluded the Commonwealth's Attorney from seeking the death penalty in the event Pham is found guilty of capital murder. Under Judge Alden's order, only life imprisonment, or life imprisonment and a fine of not more than $100,000, would <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"677\" href=\"#p677\" id=\"p677\">*677</a>be at issue in a penalty phase hearing. Judge Alden's pre-trial order not only eliminated one of the statutorily prescribed sentences that could be imposed if Pham is found guilty of capital murder, but her ruling is also tantamount to a refusal by Judge Alden to conduct a penalty phase hearing at which the \"future dangerousness\" and \"vileness\" aggravating factors set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2 and - 264.4(C) would be at issue. The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-264.3(C), however, state that \"[i]f the jury finds the defendant guilty of an offense which may be punishable by death, then a separate proceeding before the same jury <em>shall</em> be held as soon as practicable on the issue of the penalty, which <em>shall</em> be fixed as is provided in \u00a7 19.2-264.4.\" (Emphasis added.) When the action of a court is \"a simple refusal to hear and decide the case; and this [C]ourt having held that no appeal lies from such refusal, it is exactly the case to which the highly remedial writ of mandamus is most frequently applied, in order to prevent a defect or failure of justice.\" <em>Cowan v.

The Court concluded that there was no statutory requirement that the election contest complaint be filed prior to the service of the complaint on the officers whose elections were being contested. <em>Id.</em> at 336, <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20S.E.2d%20135\">117 S.E.2d at 137</extracted-citation>. Because former Code \u00a7 24-436 required that, \"[i]n judging of such election or return, the court shall proceed on the merits thereof and decide the same according to the [C]onstitution and laws,\" this Court held that it was manifest error to deny a decision on the merits. <em>Id.</em> at 337, <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20S.E.2d%20135\">117 S.E.2d at 137</extracted-citation>.

(30 Gratt.) at 428 (\"If a judge . . . refuses to <em>sign a proper</em> bill, or <em>to proceed</em> to settle the matter of a bill objected to, he may, in either case, be compelled by <em>mandamus</em> to act\"); <em>Kent, Paine &amp; Co. v.

After consideration of the report, and upon good cause shown, the court may set aside the sentence of death and impose a sentence of imprisonment for life. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the court sets aside the sentence of death and imposes a sentence of imprisonment for life, it shall include in the sentencing order an explanation for the reduction in sentence.</p><p id=\"p-28\">Under this statutory scheme, Judge Alden did not have the authority to make a sentencing decision when ruling on a pre-trial motion, thereby implicitly refusing to conduct a penalty phase hearing with regard to the \"future dangerousness\" and \"vileness\" aggravating factors. If a jury fixes Pham's punishment at death, Judge Alden will have the authority, under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5, to exercise judicial discretion to decide whether to impose the death penalty. Judge Alden <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"679\" href=\"#p679\" id=\"p679\">*679</a>would likewise have the authority, and thus the discretion, to decide in the first instance whether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment if the case were tried without a jury. <em>See</em> Code \u00a7 19.2-257. No statute, however, authorizes Judge Alden to exercise such sentencing discretion in a pre-trial context. In other words, the action taken by Judge Alden was not within her discretion. <em>See Davis,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2114035\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/211/410/\">211 Va. at 413</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=177%20S.E.2d%20524\">177 S.E.2d at 526</extracted-citation>. The mere fact that Judge Alden made her decision when ruling on a motion does not render the decision discretionary.</p><p id=\"p-29\">Furthermore, by directing the Commonwealth's Attorney that he may not seek the death penalty if Pham is found guilty of capital murder, Judge Alden performed an executive function and exercised discretion that resides solely in the Commonwealth's Attorney. <em>See</em> Va. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 1 (\"The legislative, executive, and judicial departments shall be separate and distinct, so that none exercise the powers properly belonging to the others, nor any person exercise the power of more than one of them at the same time.\"); Code \u00a7 15.2-1627(B) (\"The attorney for the Commonwealth . . . shall be a part of the department of law enforcement of the county or city in which he is elected or appointed, and shall have the duties and powers imposed upon him by general law, including the duty of prosecuting all warrants, indictments or informations charging a felony.\"); <em>see also Genesee Prosecutor v.

The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-398 set forth the circumstances in which the Commonwealth may appeal from a circuit court's pre-trial rulings in a felony case. For example, the Commonwealth can appeal pre-trial decisions to suppress evidence. <em>See</em> Code \u00a7 19.2-398(A)(2). In this instance, the Commonwealth's Attorney cannot, however, appeal Judge Alden's decision refusing to conduct a penalty phase hearing upon proper evidence in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) and -264.4.

The petition for a writ of mandamus is granted and the writ is issued directing Judge Alden to allow the petitioner to seek the death penalty, in accordance with Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.3(C) and -264.4, in the criminal case of <em>Commonwealth v.
