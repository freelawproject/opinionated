This case concerns property that is adjacent to the City's Eisenhower Avenue Metro station. In 2003, the City adopted the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan (Eisenhower area plan), a part of the City's comprehensive plan adopted pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.2-2223. The City wanted to create high-density economic development near the Metro station consisting of retail, residential, and commercial uses. The City also planned to have these uses supported by open space, recreational entertainment, and cultural amenities. The City's design objective was to \"encourage a system of streets and blocks which provides for an urban framework for the area\" and to \"establish an urban design character for Eisenhower Avenue\" as a \"major urban boulevard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Hoffman Family, L.L.C., Peggy L. Hoffman, Hubert N. Hoffman, III, and Linda L. Hoffman (collectively, Hoffman), own several parcels of property, as well as air and surface easements, located in the Eisenhower East section of the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mill Race project, approved by the Alexandria City Council (the city council) as a component of the Eisenhower area plan, is a proposal developed by the Trammell Crow Company, an owner of land adjacent to Hoffman's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Mill\n   Race development proposal includes one apartment building, one condominium building, and one commercial office building. The proposal for each building includes plans for retail establishments located on the ground floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A storm water box culvert (box culvert) is located on the site of one building planned for the Mill Race project. The box culvert, which is a part of the City's storm water sewer system that extends underground in the area of the properties at issue, is a concrete structure designed to convey storm water from land surfaces to an outfall downstream.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The present controversy arose when the City decided it was necessary to relocate the box culvert. The City determined that it was impractical to allow construction of a building over the box culvert on the Mill Race site because \"maintenance of the storm water structures may require the use of heavy equipment, which may not be able to access portions of the storm water culvert where buildings are constructed over the culverts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City planned to relocate the box culvert to a site on Hoffman's property on the south side of Eisenhower Avenue. Under the City's plan, this placement would allow the storm water sewer to run primarily under Mill Race Lane and Grist Mill Place, two new public streets being constructed in conjunction with the Eisenhower area plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The proposed relocation required acquisition from Hoffman of two temporary construction easements covering a combined area of 8,434 square feet, and the permanent acquisition of 1,009 square feet of Hoffman's property for the storm drain easement. In accordance with Code \u00a7 25.1-417, the City attempted to purchase the affected property from Hoffman but was unable to reach agreement on a price. Thereafter, the City, asserting its statutory powers of condemnation, filed petitions in the circuit court to condemn these portions of Hoffman's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its condemnation petitions and in the City Council's resolution authorizing the condemnation, the City stated that the property and temporary construction easements would be used for construction, maintenance, and repair of a sewer system that was \"necessary . . . (1) to implement the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan Chapter of the 1992 Master Plan (1998 ed.) of the City of Alexandria, (2) to promote the orderly and proper development of the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan area, and (3) to permit the development of the Mill Race project as approved by CDD Concept Plan No.2002-0001 and DSUP Nos. 2002-0002 and 2002-0003.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to the petitions in condemnation, Hoffman filed a plea in bar, arguing that the City's attempt to take a portion of Hoffman's property to relocate the storm sewer line was \"solely for the benefit of the private owner of [adjoining] land.\" Hoffman asked that the circuit court declare the attempted condemnation invalid because there was neither a public purpose nor a public necessity for the takings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hoffman also filed a motion requesting a jury trial on the issues raised in its plea in bar. The circuit court denied the request and conducted a bench trial to resolve the issues presented in Hoffman's plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The evidence at trial showed that the decision to relocate the box culvert followed the City's preferred practice of locating all public utilities, including sewers, along and under public streets. Emily Baker, City Engineer for the City of Alexandria, testified that the City prefers to locate sewers along public streets to permit maintenance of the sewers without any potential conflicts from private landowners. However, Baker acknowledged that the City also wanted to relocate the box culvert to allow construction of a building at the box culvert's present location. Baker further agreed that the existing box culvert was functioning properly, was in good repair, and had sufficient capacity to serve the area in which it functioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Eileen P. Fogarty, Director of Planning and Zoning for the City, testified that the street grid system in the Eisenhower area plan and the Mill Race project was a matter of high priority to the City. Fogarty explained that the street grid system would\n   help achieve the City's goal of creating a pedestrian community in the area, while also enhancing general safety and fire truck access and providing significant traffic circulation benefits. Fogarty also stated that the relocation of the sewer and box culvert from the existing location was one of the benefits of the Mill Race project identified by her staff in its recommendation supporting the issuance of the special use permit for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Richard Baier, Director of Transportation and Environmental Services for the City, confirmed much of Fogarty's testimony. Baier stated that the discussion of a grid pattern of streets for the Eisenhower East area began long before the plan for the Mill Race project emerged. Baier acknowledged, however, that a road grid could have been constructed while leaving the old box culvert in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After hearing all the evidence, the circuit court overruled Hoffman's plea in bar. The circuit court concluded that the purpose of the taking was to \"facilitate proper storm water runoff into the City's storm sewer system.\" The circuit court held that the City's action was for a public use, \"[r]egardless of any incidental benefit that may flow to the developer of [the Mill Race site] by the movement of the existing storm sewer box culvert.\" The circuit court further explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The fact that the underlying motivation for the relocation of the storm sewer box culvert is the implementation of the [Eisenhower area plan] and to promote the orderly and proper development of the [plan] in accordance with the Small Area Plan and the Special Use Permits approved for Mill Race does not, in this Court's view, diminish the public use of the taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following its decision overruling Hoffman's plea in bar, the circuit court held a hearing on the issue of just compensation. William R. O'Neill, who qualified as an expert in the field of real estate appraisal, testified that $53,400 was the total value of the property interests taken by the City. After hearing this evidence, the circuit court entered a final order awarding Hoffman $53,400 as compensation for the land and easements taken by the City. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first consider Hoffman's argument that the circuit court erred in denying its request for a jury trial on the plea in bar. Hoffman observes that the Constitution of Virginia provides a right to trial by jury in all actions at law, including condemnation proceedings. Hoffman further notes that Code \u00a7 8.01-336(D) provides a right to a jury determination of a plea in bar raised to an equitable claim. Hoffman contends that a plea in bar filed in an action at law should not be treated differently from a plea in bar to an equitable claim, particularly because jury trials are guaranteed in actions at law while jury trials are not guaranteed with regard to most equitable claims. We disagree with Hoffman's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There is no constitutional or statutory authority providing for a jury trial on a plea in bar in a condemnation proceeding. Moreover, in Code \u00a7 25.1-219, the General Assembly has directed that the circuit court in condemnation proceedings determine \"issues or other matters in controversy, excepting the issue of just compensation or matters relating to the ownership of any land or other property or the interests of any party in such land or other property.\" The circuit court's duty to decide the matters in controversy other than those specified in that statute complements the provisions of Code \u00a7 25.1-220, which state that when the proper parties have appeared or responded to the petition in condemnation, the issue of just compensation shall be determined by a jury unless the parties agree to have the court make that determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   These statutes illustrate the particular care that the General Assembly has given to the mode of determining all issues that may arise during the course of a condemnation proceeding. In specific language, the General Assembly has reserved for decision by the court those issues that do not involve\n   the question of just compensation or the determination of ownership or other interests in the property sought to be condemned. Therefore, we hold that the circuit court properly determined that Hoffman did not have a right to a jury trial on the issue raised in its plea in bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We next consider Hoffman's argument that the circuit court erred in concluding that the City sought to condemn Hoffman's property for a public purpose. Hoffman contends that there is no evidence to support the circuit court's finding that the \"purpose of the taking\" was \"to facilitate proper storm water runoff.\" According to Hoffman, the City decided to condemn the property to allow Mill Race's developers to construct a building that met certain planning goals the City wanted to accomplish in that area. Hoffman asserts that under the holding in\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Foster,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2123182\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/215/543/\">\n    215 Va. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20S.E.2d%2093\">\n    211 S.E.2d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975), the power of eminent domain may not be exercised for the private purpose of improving land at a neighbor's expense. Such a private purpose, Hoffman maintains, is at issue in this case because, \"but for\" the Mill Race project, there was no need or plan to relocate the box culvert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hoffman further alleges that the comprehensive plan considerations cited in the City's resolution do not provide a basis for the City's exercise of its power of eminent domain. Hoffman observes that with the exception of blighted property, which is not at issue here, there is no statutory authority granting local governments the power to condemn property to achieve planning goals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hoffman further notes that under Code \u00a7 15.2-2307, a local government cannot rezone property in violation of vested property rights. Thus, according to Hoffman, because local governments are prohibited from impairing vested property rights in exercising zoning powers, those localities likewise do not have authority to condemn property for planning purposes. We disagree with Hoffman's analysis and arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In resolving this issue, we first review the constitutional and statutory authority of a city to condemn property for public purposes. Our review of these provisions is guided by certain established principles of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The statutes confirming the power of eminent domain must be strictly construed, and a locality must comply fully with the statutory requirements when attempting to exercise this right.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Thus, if the record supports a conclusion that the property proposed for condemnation will be a public use acquired for a public purpose, the fact that neighboring property owners will benefit from that use is irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Applying these principles, we conclude that the circuit court correctly held that the City sought to condemn Hoffman's property for a public use. The box culvert qualifies as a public use because it is designed to function as a component part of the City's storm water sewer management system, a use specifically identified in Code \u00a7 15.2-2109 as one for which a locality may acquire \"whatever land may be necessary.\" The record further shows that construction\n   of the box culvert on the condemned property will provide the City better access for maintenance and will permit the City to place its connecting sewer line primarily underneath public streets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because there will be no private use of the condemned property, the issue of private benefit to nearby properties is irrelevant. Thus, like the public parking lot in\n   <em>\n    Dervishian,\n   </em>\n   the box culvert in the present case retains its character as a public use, irrespective of the fact that a neighboring property owner may benefit from the City's exclusive use of the condemned property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Hoffman's contrary argument alleging private benefit to the Mill Race project is additionally without merit because it confuses the City's declaration of necessity with the public purpose of the box culvert use.

Rather, the declaration of necessity sets forth the City's reasons supporting its legislative determination that a box culvert is necessary at this location. We will not review the City's determination of necessity because it reflects a legislative decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Hamer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2108652\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/240/66/#p70\">\n    240 Va. at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20S.E.2d%20623\">\n    393 S.E.2d at 625-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Carneal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859091\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/129/388/#p393\">\n    129 Va. at 393-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20S.E.%20403\">\n    106 S.E. at 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The developer of Mill Race attempted to negotiate with the City of Alexandria to obtain permission to build a high-rise residential building on top of the existing box culvert, but the City rejected the developer's request because of concerns related to the maintenance of the culvert. The developer approached Hoffman and inquired about the possibility of relocating an existing storm water culvert onto a portion of Hoffman's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The developer was unsuccessful in its efforts to relocate the box culvert on Hoffman's property. During a meeting with the City Manager of Alexandria, the Director of Planning and Zoning, the developer, and other City officials, a discussion ensued regarding whether the developer could acquire an easement for the relocation of the culverts from Hoffman. The minutes of the meeting contained the following summary:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"The meeting began with a discussion on the box culvert relocation. Mr. Sherman [developer's representative] started the discussion by noting how critical the covenant is related to the streets and how development of the parcels was dependent on it. He voiced a concern that Hoffman would be able to extract more as time goes on. Mr. Viola [developer's representative] commented that Hoffman had received the paperwork from the City Attorney's office\n   and was currently reviewing it, although it looked like what had been requested had been provided. He brought up the point that if the box culvert has to be moved, an easement would be needed for the realignment, since it would have to cross the Hoffman and ATA properties. Mr. Rak noted that the streets within the project would be dedicated to the City. He commented that a discussion with SP? would take place regarding the realignment of the culvert and utilities, although moving the utilities would not impact the Hoffman development. Mr. Rothmeyer emphasized that a signed document would be needed sooner rather than later, since it would be harder to get Hoffman to sign as the project moves along because he will have greater leverage. He voiced concern about any additional time it would take, since the City had taken so [much] time on the covenant issue. [The city manager] commented that the City would force the issue and that it would not take as long as the covenant because it is a public issue instead of a private one.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Emily Baker, the City Engineer for the City of Alexandria, testified during the condemnation proceedings that \"[b]ut for the Mill Race project, there were no plans to relocate that box culvert.\" The existing box culvert was functioning properly, and it was in good repair. The existing box culvert was expected to function properly for an additional 20 to 70 years. The existing box culvert had sufficient capacity to serve the area that drained into it. Baker testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \"Q: It [the current box culvert] had sufficient capacity to serve the area which drained into it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \"A: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"Q: And in fact, there was no intrinsic need to relocate that box culvert other than the desire to put a building on top of there?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \"A: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"Q: There was no engineering necessity to move that box culvert other than the fact that Mill Race was going to put a big building where Building No. 1 is shown?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \"A: There would be no reason to move the sewer if there were not construction on top of it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   She also acknowledged that the proposed new box culvert would have less capacity than the present box culvert. Baker further testified that a grid pattern of streets that the City desired to create in the vicinity of the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan could have been accomplished without an easement on the Hoffman property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Additional expert testimony confirmed that the relocation of the box culvert onto Hoffman's property will actually decrease the capacity of the storm water system. The new box culvert is exactly the same size as the existing culvert, but because the new box culvert contains \"bends and turns,\" it has less capacity than the existing box culvert. The bending of a storm water system decreases its hydraulic capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Richard Baier, the City's Director of Transportation and Environmental Services, testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \"Q: Before the Mill Race project came along, there were no plans to relocate the box culvert?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"A: That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \"Q: Well, then, straight to the chase, what generated the need to relocate the box culvert and the placement of a building on top of it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \"A: That's correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"Q: Not the road grid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \"A: The road grid provided a place just like Eisenhower Avenue provided a place for the sanitary sewer. The road grid provided a place for the relocation of the storm sewer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Emily Baker testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Q: Are you aware of any other time the City has asked someone to relocate a perfectly good operating facility just because a street was built nearby?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"A: I'm not aware of any only because a street was nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \"Q: The real reason as you stated earlier was, they wanted to put a building on top.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \"A: That's right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   There are many locations in the City of Alexandria where utilities are not constructed in a street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The developer of Mill Race could have relocated the box culvert on its property without impacting the Hoffman property. Baier testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Q: From an engineering standpoint, you're an engineer, the developers of Mill Race could have relocated the box culvert in their property without touching the Hoffman property?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \"A: That's correct. That would have been less preferable, but that's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The City claimed that it prefers that public utilities, such as storm sewer box culverts, are located in public streets when possible, even though the existing culvert involved in this litigation is not so situated. The City presented testimony that it prefers the location of the sewer in the street because that location provides continuity of service, easier maintenance, and less disruption during maintenance. With the creation of new streets, the City will be able to relocate the storm sewer box culverts onto public streets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The condemnation resolution that the City Council adopted does not contain any language that suggests that the City condemned Hoffman's property for reasons related to the improvement or construction of a sewer discharge system. The only purported public purposes stated within the resolution are the development of the Mill Race project and the implementation of the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan. In response to an interrogatory that Hoffman propounded to the City during this litigation requesting that the City state all facts upon which it relied in asserting that the taking was for a public use, the City did not identify any uses related to the improvement or construction of the sewer system; rather, the City only identified goals related to economic development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   If the culvert is not relocated onto the Hoffman's property, the developer of Mill Race would have to reduce the building design of the high-rise apartment by 60,000 square feet of buildable area. This reduction in square footage would reduce the value of the building to the developer by at least $2,090,000. The developer of Mill Race has agreed to reimburse the City for all condemnation expenses that the City incurs, including legal expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   This Court, for over 100 years, has repeatedly held that private property can only be condemned if that property is to be taken for a public use.

Without the attempt to develop, Highway Department approval of the plans for drainage is unnecessary. Without the development, the statute transferring title to the easement does not become operative.

This Court did not hold in Dervishian that a court, when undertaking judicial review of whether a public purpose existed, is required to focus its inquiry solely upon the property that is the subject of the take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The majority's holding in today's decision renders meaningless the concept of judicial review of the issue of public use. If I understand the majority's test correctly, a city in Virginia could decide to generate substantial tax revenue by enticing a developer to construct a football stadium that would be the home of a professional football team. The developer might acquire the parcels upon which the stadium would be constructed, but fail to obtain the necessary drainage easements from residential property owners who live in the neighborhood adjacent to the site of the proposed stadium. The majority's holding would permit the City, which has a properly functioning sewer system, to condemn residential property to construct culverts throughout the residential neighborhood to suit the developers of the football stadium. Upon judicial review, this Court could not consider the football stadium, but would be compelled to focus its inquiry upon whether the condemned land was used for a sewer. Certainly, this narrow view, which the majority today has established as the controlling test, is inconsistent with meaningful judicial review of condemnation proceedings in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The following example is also illustrative of the restrictive effect of the majority's test. Assume that the board of supervisors of a large Virginia county adopted a development plan for the county that includes a large mix of retail, commercial, and open space in an area that is currently zoned agricultural. The residents of the agricultural area are farmers whose ancestors have been farmers in that county for many generations. The farmers wish to continue their livelihoods. The county, over the objection of the farmers,\n   decides to condemn the landowners' farms and install underground culverts as a part of the county's sewer system, even though the county has perfectly functioning culverts that serve the agricultural district. Simultaneously, the county negotiated with a developer who agreed to purchase the farmers' property from the county and develop the property in a manner consistent with the county's development plan. The majority's test would preclude this Court from considering an impending transfer of the property to a private party during judicial review of the question whether the county's decision to condemn the farmers' property was for a public purpose. I think, as these scenarios reveal, that the restrictive nature of the majority's test renders judicial review meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   I am compelled to conclude that upon application of the correct test, which includes consideration of surrounding facts and circumstances, in the case before this Court the public interest does not dominate the private gain and, hence, the taking of Hoffman's private property was illegal. The City admitted, through its officials, that the City did not need a new culvert and that the existing culvert was functioning properly. The City admitted that the new culvert would have less sewer capacity than the current culvert because of the design of the new culvert. The City admitted that the culvert would not need to be relocated but for the City's desire to enable the private developer to construct a high-rise building on the site of the current culvert. The City Engineer admitted that the \"real reason\" the City desired to relocate the culvert was to enable a private developer to construct a building on the site of the existing culvert. Even though the developer in this case could construct a structure on the current site, the structure would be significantly smaller than its desired structure and would result in a $2,000,000 diminution in the value of the proposed project. The City admitted that it could construct its grid pattern of streets without the necessity of relocating the culvert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and I would enter a judgment in favor of Hoffman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The City initiated separate proceedings against Hoffman Family, L.L.C., owner of land and easements of one parcel of the property at issue, and against Peggy L.

At trial, counsel for the City argued that the imposition of the street grid was the \"driving factor\" which led to the City's decision to relocate the box culvert, and that \"the developer's net gain is a nonexistent thing.\" On appeal, the City argues that \"the significant planning and zoning benefits to the City flowing out of the implementation of the Eisenhower East Small Area Plan and the Mill Race development only buttress the public benefits of having greater control over the storm sewer.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    After the City's attempted condemnation of Hoffman's land, the Trammell Crow Company sold its interest in the property to Paradigm Development Company, another private developer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3.\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Effective July 1, 2006, commissions no longer serve as an alternative mechanism for determining issues of just compensation.
