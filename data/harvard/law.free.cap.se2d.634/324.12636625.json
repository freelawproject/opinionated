KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal presents a choice of law question in the context of two personal injury actions. We must decide whether a New York statute, which imposes vicarious liability on the owner of a vehicle for death or injuries caused by the negligence of a person operating the vehicle with the owner's permission, is a matter of tort, meaning Virginia's substantive law applies, or a matter of contract, meaning the New York statute applies. Because we conclude the latter, we will reverse the circuit court's judgment applying Virginia substantive law and holding that two vehicle rental companies would have no vicarious liability based on their ownership of a vehicle involved in an automobile accident in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sherman Dreher, while operating an automobile in which his wife, Chrisceia Dreher,\n   was a passenger (collectively the Drehers), was involved in an accident with Leonard Saunderson. The accident occurred in Virginia Beach, and the Drehers are both Virginia residents. Saunderson was operating a rental vehicle owned by Budget Rent-A-Car System, Inc., a New Jersey company, and Cendant Car Rental Group, Inc., a New York company (collectively, the Owners). The automobile was rented pursuant to a written contractual agreement entered into in New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Drehers allegedly sustained personal injuries as a result of the automobile accident. They each filed a separate motion for judgment against the Owners, alleging that, \"pursuant to the law of New York, [the Owners are] responsible for the negligence of . . . Saunderson, as the owner, operator, and rentor of the vehicle . . . operated by Saunderson.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Drehers based their claim against the Owners on a New York statute that states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Every owner of a vehicle used or operated in [New York] shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries to person or property resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle, in the business of such owner or otherwise, by any person using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of such owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Veh.%20%26%20Traf.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20388\">\n    N.Y.

Law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Owners demurred to each action, arguing that, since the automobile accident occurred in Virginia, the choice of law rules of Virginia applied. Continuing, the Owners asserted that, under those rules, Virginia's substantive law governed issues of tort liability in the actions, including any claim of vicarious liability. Therefore, according to the Owners, the Drehers, as residents of Virginia who were injured in an accident occurring in Virginia, could not recover against the Owners for the negligence of Saunderson unless some type of agency relationship existed between the Owners and Saunderson. Since the Drehers did not allege any such agency relationship in their respective motions for judgment, the Owners asked the circuit court to grant the demurrers and dismiss the actions. The circuit court agreed, sustaining the demurrers and dismissing the actions with prejudice. In a letter opinion, the circuit court recognized that it had to apply Virginia's choice of law rules since the Drehers filed their respective actions in the Commonwealth. The circuit court further recognized that Virginia adheres to the doctrine of lex loci delicti, meaning tort liability depends on the law of the place of injury. Thus, the circuit court concluded that, under Virginia's choice of law rules, \"the substantive law of Virginia would apply and the [Owners] would have no vicarious liability to the [Drehers] based upon the ownership or the permissive use of the vehicle involved in the accident.\" The Drehers appeal from the circuit court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the Drehers assert that the circuit court erred by sustaining the Owners' demurrers and concluding that Virginia law, as opposed to New York law, determines whether the Owners are vicariously liable to the Drehers for Saunderson's negligence in operating the Owners' vehicle. \"A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of facts alleged in pleadings, not the strength of proof. We accept as true all facts properly pleaded . . . and all reasonable and fair inferences that may be drawn from those facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Glazebrook v.

Relying on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   the Drehers also assert that New York's imposition of liability upon owners of vehicles is a contractual provision imposed by statute like the physical contact requirement at issue in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   and that the New York statute creates a substantive right of action. Therefore, according to the Drehers, the circuit court erred by failing to apply the substantive law\n   of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Owners, however, contend that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because that case involved a coverage dispute between an insured and his insurer arising out of their contractual relationship; whereas, the Drehers and the Owners have no contractual relationship. Because Virginia steadfastly adheres to the doctrine of lex loci delicti, the Owners contend that the Drehers are attempting to recast their Virginia tort claims into New York contract claims.

Thus, we find the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Buchanan, a resident of Virginia, was injured in an automobile accident that occurred in West Virginia when an unidentified truck driver forced Buchanan's vehicle off the road.\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2088395\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/246/67/#p71\">\n    246 Va. at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 S.E.2d at 290. There was no contact between the two vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pursuant to the provisions of his automobile liability insurance policy, which was issued in Virginia, and Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, Buchanan filed a personal injury action in Virginia against the truck driver as \"John\n   Doe.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69-70, 431 S.E.2d at 290. To pursue a John Doe tort action under West Virginia law, proof of physical contact with the John Doe vehicle was required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70, 431 S.E.2d at 291. Neither Buchanan's uninsured motorist insurance coverage nor Virginia's uninsured motorist statute, however, required such contact between the two vehicles in order to maintain the John Doe action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69, 431 S.E.2d at 290. Thus, a conflict of laws issue was raised, and \"[t]he disagreement [was] whether the West Virginia proof-of-contact requirement [was] a matter of tort law controlled by West Virginia law, or one of contract controlled by Virginia law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70, 431 S.E.2d at 291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because Buchanan filed his action in Virginia, we applied the law of the Commonwealth as the forum state to resolve the disagreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=431%20S.E.2d%20289\">\n    431 S.E.2d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After explaining the difference between a tort and a contract, the Court noted that, while the substantive tort law of both states required a plaintiff to prove his injuries were caused by a defendant's negligence, the tort law of neither state required a plaintiff to prove physical contact in order to impose liability on a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72, 431 S.E.2d at 291-92. Further noting that the West Virginia proof-of-contact requirement neither imposed a duty upon a John Doe driver nor benefited a tortfeasor, we concluded the West Virginia \"proof of contact requirement [was] a contractual provision imposed by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72, 431 S.E.2d at 292. Since the uninsured motorist statutes in both Virginia and West Virginia \"expressly condition[ed] recovery in John Doe cases upon compliance with their respective protective provisions,\" the Court did \"not think what would otherwise be a contractual condition in the proof-of-contact requirement of the West Virginia [uninsured motorist] statute [was] converted into an element of John Doe's breach of duty merely by providing that the contractual condition be fulfilled in the John Doe tort action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73, 431 S.E.2d at 292;\n   <em>\n    see also Willard v.
