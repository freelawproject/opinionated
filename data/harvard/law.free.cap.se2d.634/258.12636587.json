Defendant entered pleas of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to trial, defendant's trial counsel issued a subpoena to Duke University Health Systems (\"DUHS\") seeking \"any and all documents from the Great Smoky Mountain Study recording, reflecting or referencing any statement by [M.B.] . . . mentioning or describing any abuse of her.\" DUHS moved for a protective order, contending that the 29 July order was contrary to the \"Certificate of Confidentiality\" issued to researchers pursuant to federal law. Defendant asserted that M.B. was expected to be called by the State to offer evidence pursuant to N.C.G.S. 8C-1, Rule 404(b) that defendant had sexually abused her in the past and that the information contained in the records was necessary for impeachment purposes. On 18 August 2004, the trial court vacated its 29 July 2004 order, granted DUHS's motion for a protective order, and required DUHS to \"maintain a sealed copy of the records referred to in the Court's July 29, 2004 Order until the final adjudication of all issues in this case, including any appeals or until further order of this court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At defendant's trial, the evidence tended to show that F.A. first met defendant when she was eight or nine years old. F.A. is the niece of defendant's daughter-in-law, Laura Bradley. In August 2003, F.A. went with Laura Bradley to prepare for a surprise party for defendant's wife. F.A. testified that she enjoyed going to defendant's house and that they treated her \"like family.\" During the party preparations, defendant and F.A. went to the grocery store to purchase additional food. F.A. testified that on the way to the store defendant touched her \"on the outside of my clothes on my privates\" and \"put his hand inside my panties on my vagina . . . . He put his finger inside. Not all the way, but a little bit.\" He also touched her breasts and on her \"butt\" under her clothes. She further testified that defendant told her that\n   it was their secret and \"not to tell anyone.\" She eventually told her school counselor and then talked to her grandparents, and police. These witnesses corroborated her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State also offered the testimony of K.C., F.C., and M.B. with respect to incidents in which defendant had allegedly committed similar acts upon them. Thirteen-year-old K.C. testified that defendant is her mother's stepfather, that when she was five or six, \"once or twice\" he had put his hand in her underwear and touched her \"butt,\" and on another occasion, he \"rubbed [her] butt\" for \"[a] couple of minutes.\" Once, when tying her shoe, \"he bent down to pick up my foot and he stuck it on his private part\"; when she moved her foot, he \"moved it back\" and told her \"not to tell, that it was our secret.\" When defendant's granddaughter, Melinda Bradley, was discussing F.A.'s accusations with K.C. and other family members, K.C. told Melinda what defendant had done to her. According to K.C.'s testimony, Melinda responded by telling her \"not to tell or else we could get [defendant] in a lot of trouble.\" The next day, K.C.'s mother told her about F.A.'s accusations, and her mother asked K.C. if defendant \"had done anything to me,\" and I told her, \"Yeah.\" K.C. later made a statement to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   F.C. testified that K.C. is her daughter, and corroborated K.C.'s statements. She also testified that defendant is her stepfather, who cared for her after her mother died, from age six until sixteen, when she left home to marry her husband. She testified that she remembered defendant sitting her in his lap and touching her vagina while he was driving his truck. She also recalled that when she was ten or eleven, defendant carried her from her bed on nights when her stepmother was out of town and touched her with his hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   M.B., who is Melinda Bradley's sister, testified that defendant is her grandfather. M.B., her sisters, and their mother lived with defendant \"[f]or the most part as I was growing up,\" except for a period when she was younger than ten years old. At that time, M.B. told her mother that defendant \"was fondling my breasts,\" and the Department of Social Services \"said it was best\" that they not live with him. M.B. further testified that her mother did not believe her allegations, and, after a couple of years, they moved back in with her grandfather. Once they returned to defendant's house, defendant had M.B. perform oral sex on him and took her on car rides where \"he would fondle my breasts and put his hand on my vagina.\" He also once pulled down both her pants and his pants and \"put his part between my legs.\" As she got older, the abuse lessened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant testified on his own behalf and denied all of the allegations, as did other family members and neighbors, who attested to defendant's law-abiding nature and general good character. These witnesses also expressed their doubts about the credibility of the State's witnesses. Melinda Bradley testified that her grandfather was truthful and law-abiding, and she denied any conversation with K.C. about defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of two counts of taking indecent liberties with a child, and one count of statutory sexual offense against a victim who was 13 years old at the time of the offense. Defendant was sentenced to 240 months to 297 months for the sexual offense charge and two consecutive sentences of 16 months to 20 months for the indecent liberties charges. Defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel moved that the documents maintained by DUHS pursuant to the trial court's 29 July 2004 order, relating to any statements made by M.B. and sealed pursuant to the court's order, be made available \"to ensure a full and fair appellate review.\" By order dated 3 May 2005, the trial court ordered DUHS to produce the records for defendant's appellate counsel for the purpose of determining whether any error should be assigned premised on their contents. Dissemination of the contents of the documents to anyone other than counsel for the parties was prohibited. DUHS appealed from the * order requiring disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant Bradley has moved to dismiss DUHS's appeal, arguing that DUHS has no right to appeal in this matter. We deny the motion to dismiss. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-271 permits \"aggrieved parties to appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"A `party aggrieved' is one whose legal rights have been denied or directly and injuriously affected by the action of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Selective Ins.

Furthermore, Section 1-277 of our General Statutes permits appeal \"from every judicial order or determination of a judge of a superior or district court, upon or involving a matter of law or legal inference, whether made in or out of session, which affects a substantial right claimed in any action or proceeding.\" N.C.

The trial court's order effectively requires DUHS to disclose information concerning the research subject's privacy which it is obliged, pursuant to the Certificate of Confidentiality and federal statutes, to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We turn now to the substance of DUHS's appeal. DUHS argues that the trial court erred when it granted defendant's motion for review of the sealed documents because the confidentiality of these documents is protected by federal statute and the trial court's order violates the statute. Defendant contends the trial court was required, at the very least, to review the records\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to determine if there was exculpatory evidence contained therein, as required by\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.
