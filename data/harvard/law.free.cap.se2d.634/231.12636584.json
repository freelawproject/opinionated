(\"the complainant\") volunteered as a cheerleading coach at a public school in Beaufort County. On 15 July 2003, boxes of cheerleading apparel arrived at the school's office. At approximately 11:30 a.m., the complainant decided to pickup some of the boxes from the office and unload them at the cheerleading room to prepare for cheerleading camp. The cheerleading room was located down a small path behind the school next to the football and baseball fields.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complainant parked her blue Ford Explorer by the cheerleading room, went inside, and began to unload the boxes. After approximately five minutes, someone tapped the complainant on the shoulder. The complainant turned and observed a light-skinned black male holding an eight-inch-long hunting knife. The complainant described the male as having facial hair trimmed to a goatee, a gap between his two front teeth, and wearing an earring in his left ear, a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and a black \"do-rag.\" The male put the knife against the complainant's face and demanded she remove her pants and lie down on the floor. The complainant complied. The male climbed on top of the complainant and attempted to insert his penis into her vagina. The male successfully penetrated the complainant at least once and remained on top of her for approximately five minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The male told the complainant to get up, and she walked backwards to the rear of the room. The male walked, facing the complainant, with the knife pressed against her face. When the complainant got close enough, she jumped into a small bathroom and kept the door closed with her feet. The male tried to push his way into the bathroom, but was unsuccessful after several attempts. The complainant heard her vehicle start and drive away. The complainant ran to the teacher's lounge and contacted police. She gave police a detailed description of her assailant, car, and driver's license number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beaufort County Sheriff's Deputy Clayton Miller (\"Deputy Miller\") was instructed to patrol Highway 17 to be on the lookout for the complainant's vehicle. Deputy Miller observed a blue Ford Explorer parked on a dirt path next to a power supply station located four to five miles from the school. Deputy Miller observed a black male running from the vehicle. Deputy Miller ordered the individual to stop and placed him under arrest at approximately 12:15 p.m. The individual arrested was later identified as defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was transported to the school for the complainant to identify him in a \"show up.\" The complainant viewed defendant from a window in the principal's office. Law enforcement officers turned off the lights and adjusted the blinds in order that individuals located outside could not see inside the office. Defendant was wearing different clothes than what the complainant described her attacker as wearing. The complainant could not positively identify defendant. Defendant was brought back a second time so that the complainant could\n   view the gap in his teeth. The complainant attempted to move closer to the window to view defendant, but law enforcement officers would only allow her to approach as far as the front of the desk. The complainant could not positively identify the suspect from that distance. The complainant explained her attacker was only a foot away from her when she was raped. She could not positively identify defendant as her attacker while she was located inside the principal's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the complainant left to go to the hospital, she walked by a deputy sheriff's vehicle where defendant was sitting in the passenger's seat. The complainant was approximately six to eight feet away from the side of the vehicle. The complainant observed the side profile of defendant's face. The complainant stated to her sister, \"it looked like him,\" but she \"wasn't one hundred percent sure.\" Later that evening, the complainant saw a mug shot of defendant on the eleven o'clock news. The complainant immediately began crying and told her husband \"that was him,\" the male who had raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the afternoon of 15 July 2003, Sergeant Laurel Miller (\"Sergeant Miller\"), along with other deputy sheriffs, was ordered to conduct a search of defendant's residence. Investigator Gentry Pinner (\"Investigator Pinner\") went to the hospital to obtain consent from Christie Boone (\"Boone\"), the owner of the residence where defendant also resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Earlier in the day, Boone had been transported by ambulance to the Beaufort County Hospital Emergency Department at approximately 1:17 p.m. Matthew Pitman (\"Pitman\"), a nurse practitioner, examined Boone. Boone's chief complaint was pain in her right shoulder, and two medications were administered by injection. Boonoe was given Toradol for pain and an one-half dose of Vistaril for anxiety. Pitman compared this dosage of Vistaril to two Benadryl tablets and noted the drug could potentially make a patient drowsy. Pitman testified these medications were non-narcotic and generally do not affect an individual's mental capacity. Pitman testified Boone was alert and oriented and her mental faculties were normal at the time she was treated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Investigator Pinner arrived at the hospital, he informed Boone that defendant was a suspect in an investigation and he requested permission to search her residence. Boone verbally agreed and signed a form granting permission to the search. Boone informed Investigator Pinner that defendant did not have exclusive possession of any portion of the residence. Investigator Pinner told Sergeant Miller to proceed with the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Investigator Pinner also took a statement from Boone, which was reduced to writing. Boone indicated that she was not under the influence of any drug or alcohol at that time. Boone told Investigator Pinner that she had an eleventh-grade education. Boone also provided her birth date and Social Security number. Boone told Investigator Pinner that some time after 11:00 a.m., defendant had entered the residence and told her \"he had got a car.\" Boone noticed defendant was in possession of a clear cellular telephone and five \"cards\" that did not belong to him. One of the cards was a Chocowinity Club Card with the name of the school where the complainant volunteered printed thereon. Boone signed this statement, although her signature was \"messy.\" Boone's mother was present and signed the statement as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial, Boone asserted she could not remember anything from the time she was injected with medication at the hospital. She did not remember talking with Investigator Pinner, signing the permission to search form, or giving or signing a statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the first search of Boone's residence, investigators found a white T-shirt, a black nylon head cover or \"do-rag,\" a red checkbook belonging to the complainant, and the complainant's driver's license. Investigators also found several of the complainant's discount cards, credit cards, and Social Security cards inside Boone's residence. Additional evidence was seized at the site where the complainant's vehicle was recovered. Investigator Kenneth Watson located several \"shoe track\" impressions located by the driver's side door. Other shoe impressions were found on the path between the power station\n   and the trailer park, where defendant and Boone resided. The shoe track impressions were consistent with the soles of the boots defendant wore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later that evening, at approximately 6:15 p.m., Investigator Pinner, along with Washington Police Detective Cliff Hales (\"Detective Hales\"), approached Boone for permission to search her residence a second time. Detective Hales was investigating another rape which occurred a few days prior to 15 July 2003. Boone signed a second \"Permission to Search\" form in the presence of Investigator Pinner and Detective Hales. No additional evidence was seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DNA tests were conducted on the material contained on vaginal swabs collected from the complainant. The results indicated a \"Y\" chromosome profile consistent with the profile of defendant and his paternal relatives. Investigator Pinner testified that defendant's father, Martin Watson, was incarcerated at the time of the rape and that defendant had no brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant was tried in Beaufort County Superior Court in September 2004. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the first-degree rape and felony larceny charges. The trial court declared a mistrial on 14 September 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant was re-tried in April 2005. The jury found defendant to be guilty of first-degree rape and felonious larceny. Defendant was sentenced as a prior record level II within the presumptive range to a minimum term of 324 months and a maximum term of 398 months for the first-degree rape conviction and to a minimum of ten months and a maximum of twelve months for the felonious larceny conviction. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by: (1) denying his motion to suppress evidence recovered during the search of his residence; (2) denying his motion to suppress the complainant's in-court identification of him; (3) denying his motion to rehear his motion to suppress the search of his residence and his motion for\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   regarding the in-court identification; (4) allowing the State to introduce evidence that he did not give a clarifying statement upon questioning; (5) admitting the prison records of his father; (6) allowing Investigator Pinner to testify he had no brothers; (7) denying his request to instruct to the jury on the lesser included offense of unauthorized use of a conveyance; and (8) denying his motion to dismiss the first-degree rape charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    III. Motion to Suppress the Search of Defendant's Residence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence recovered from his residence and asserts Boone did not voluntarily consent to the search. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Boone testified at the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress that on 15 July 2003 she was defendant's girlfriend and resided with defendant at 130 Whitfield Mobile Home Park in Chocowinity. Defendant did not maintain exclusive possession of any portion of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Boone testified she remembered defendant being arrested on 15 July 2003, but had no recollection of anything else that occurred that day. She did not remember being transported to the hospital via ambulance, being treated other than receiving a shot, or speaking with Investigator Pinner. Boone specifically did not recall giving Investigator Pinner consent to search her residence, signing the consent to search form, or giving and signed any statements to Investigator Pinner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Boone had complained of shoulder pain and was treated at the Beaufort County Hospital on 15 July at approximately 1:17 p.m. Pitman, a nurse practitioner, administered Boone medication. The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   8. Pittman [sic] indicated [Boone] was alert and oriented as to person, place, and time. Her eyes were open and her speech was normal. She was mildly reclined and able to sit up under her own strength. Pittman [sic] indicated that Boone was uncomfortable and extremely anxious and restless. Pittman [sic] did state that he was not very impressed with her level of anxiety, and as a result, prescribed only a 1/2 dose of Vistaril, 50 mgs, by injection. Pittman [sic] compared this dose of Vistaril\n   to two tablets of Benadryl. He also administered 60 mgs of Toradol, a pain reliever, by injection. Pittman [sic] stated that these medications were non-narcotic, so they generally do not affect one's mental capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Pitman testified he did not observe any behavior from Boone to indicate she was not in possession of her mental faculties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Investigator Pinner arrived at the hospital at approximately 1:50 p.m. Investigator Pinner testified he observed nothing to indicate Boone was not in possession of her mental faculties. Boone told Investigator Pinner that she was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Investigator Pinner read Boone the consent to search and obtained her consent to search the residence between 1:50 p.m. and 2:25 p.m. Investigator Pinner obtained a statement from Boone at approximately 3:00 p.m. Boone's mother signed the written statement as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Boone was discharged from the hospital at 3:15 p.m. Investigator Pinner approached Boone at home again at 6:15 p.m. for consent to search her residence. The second search was requested by the Washington Police Department, which was investigating another rape. To the knowledge of Investigator Pinner, no additional evidence was seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court's findings of fact numbered 17 and 18 and the trial court's conclusions of law numbered 3 and 4 are erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    A.

The Court, in observing the demeanor of the aforementioned witnesses, finds that Christy [sic] Boone appeared to be extremely reluctant to testify against her current boyfriend, the defendant. The Court further finds that Boone's total lack of memory of the events of July 15, 2003, is not credible, especially in light of medical evidence to the contrary. The medications administered to Boone at Beaufort County Hospital were non-narcotic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   18. The Court finds that the warrantless search of the residence located at Lot 130, Whitfield Mobile Home Park, Chocowinity, North Carolina, was consented to by Christy [sic] Boone, and her consent and permission was given freely and voluntarily and without any promises or threats of any kind made against her. Furthermore, Boone's consent was given intelligently and at that time, she was in possession of her mental faculties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   3.

Subsequent to the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial court permitted the complainant to identify defendant in the presence of the jury. Defendant argues: (1) the complainant's in-court identification \"was based on highly suggestive sightings of the defendant on later occasions, and not from the source of the crime\" and (2) the \"show-up\" was \"so impermissibly suggestive that it created a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The credibility and weight to be given to witness identification is for the jury to determine, unless the identification evidence is \"inherently incredible.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4753111\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/312/237/#p244\">\n    312 N.C. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    321 S.E.2d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 861 (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The complainant testified that defendant's penis penetrated her vagina \"more than once.\" During direct examination, the complainant testified:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Q: And do you know how many times he tried to put it in you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   A: Probably around 10 or 15 times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Q: Now, [J.H], as far as you know, was he wearing a condom?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   A: I don't think so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Q: Now, [J.H.], did this person's penis penetrate your vagina?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Q: Can you explain?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   A: He kept going in my vagina, and I would try to contract my muscles to push it back out, but it had gone in it so I could contract it out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Q: Are you familiar with the term \"labia\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A: Yes, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Q: And can you tell us whether his penis got past the labia or the lips?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   A: Yes, it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Q: Do you know how many times or whether it was more than once?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   A: Yes, it was more than once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the complainant's testimony tends to show defendant penetrated her vagina. Substantial evidence was also presented to show defendant threatened and pressed an \"eight-inch long knife\" against the complainant's face before and after the assault. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the first-degree rape charge. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    X. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence recovered from his residence and motion to suppress the complainant's in-court identification of defendant. The trial court did not err in declining to rehear defendant's motion to suppress the search of his residence or motion for\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   regarding the complainant's in-court identification without defendant presenting new evidence that was presented when these motions were heard at his first trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Defendant failed to properly preserve his argument on appeal that his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated. The trial court properly admitted the prison records of defendant's father to eliminate paternal relatives of defendant as perpetrators of the rape and properly allowed Investigator Pinner to testify that defendant had no brothers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The trial court did not err in denying defendant's request to instruct the jury on\n   the lesser included offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle on the larceny charge. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the first-degree rape charge after the State presented evidence of vaginal penetration and defendant's use of a deadly weapon. Defendant received a fair trial free from prejudicial errors he preserved, assigned, and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   No Error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Judges WYNN and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
