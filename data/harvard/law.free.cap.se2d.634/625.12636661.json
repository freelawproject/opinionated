As the issues presented in these separate appeals involve common questions of law, we have consolidated the appeals for purposes of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant contends that a finding of the North Carolina Industrial Commission, in an action brought under the State Tort Claims Act, that Leon Reece Penland, Jr. (\"SPC Penland\") was not grossly negligent precludes recovery in this case under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 166A-14 (2005). Because, however, the Industrial Commission proceeding and this action do not involve an identity of claims or parties, the doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable. Further, the Commission had no jurisdiction to make any finding regarding SPC Penland, and, therefore, the gross negligence finding cannot be a basis for collateral estoppel. Accordingly, we hold the trial court properly granted summary judgment on defendant's affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case are largely undisputed. On 14 September 1999, following Hurricane Floyd, North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. issued a Proclamation of a State of Disaster for the North Carolina coastline under the North Carolina Emergency Management Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 166A-1 through -53 (2005). As part of the Emergency Operations Plan, the North Carolina National Guard, including SPC Penland, was called to active duty in the area of Oak Island, North Carolina. The National Guard and volunteers, including plaintiffs Jill Ward, Michael Gregory, and Shirley Snapp, performed beach patrols in which they attempted to keep people off of the beaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Late in the evening on 22 September 1999, SPC Penland was waiting at a local fire department for another National Guard member. While there, SPC Penland met Ms. Ward, Mr. Gregory, and Ms. Snapp, who told SPC Penland that they were bored and were interested in riding in a Humvee. Although he had never previously driven a Humvee on a beach, SPC Penland offered to take the group in a Humvee on a beach patrol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SPC Penland drove east along the beach until the end of the island, turned around, \"gunned the engine,\" and \"did a little fish-tail\" before straightening back out. Although Mr. Gregory advised SPC Penland to follow his outbound tracks and stay on the hard-packed sand if he wished to increase the speed, SPC Penland drove toward the\n   softer sand by the dunes and \"accelerat[ed] to significantly higher speeds than he had originally driven.\" As the Humvee bounced over the dunes, \"the vehicle became airborne,\" then \"landed and . . . vaulted again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When it landed for the second time, the Humvee flipped over. All three passengers were injured, and SPC Penland was thrown from the vehicle and killed. No one had seen the speedometer, but Ms. Ward and Ms. Snapp believed the vehicle had been going \"extremely fast,\" which Ms. Ward estimated to be about 50 or 55 miles per hour. Mr. Gregory estimated that the Humvee had been going between 40 and 50 miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs ultimately filed a complaint against defendant in Brunswick County Superior Court alleging gross negligence by SPC Penland. Based on the same facts, plaintiffs also brought an action in the Industrial Commission against the North Carolina National Guard under the State Tort Claims Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 143-291 through -300.1A (2005). Prior to the adjudication of plaintiffs' claims in superior court, Deputy Commissioner Morgan S. Chapman denied plaintiffs' claims in the Industrial Commission. Plaintiffs appealed and, on 2 December 2003, the Full Commission likewise entered an opinion and award in favor of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Commission relied upon N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 166A-14(a), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) All functions hereunder and all other activities relating to emergency management are hereby declared to be governmental functions. Neither the State nor any political subdivision thereof, nor, except in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith, any emergency management worker complying with or reasonably attempting to comply with this Article or any order, rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this Article or pursuant to any ordinance relating to any emergency management measures enacted by any political subdivision of the State, shall be liable for the death of or injury to persons, or for damage to property as a result of any such activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Applying this statute, the Commission found that SPC Penland \"was an emergency management worker acting within the course of his employment\" on the date of the accident and that he had \"breached his duty of care\" toward plaintiffs. The Commission concluded, however, that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover under the State Tort Claims Act because the Emergency Management Act did not permit recovery\n   <em>\n    against the State\n   </em>\n   for an emergency management worker's actions \"committed during emergency management operations.\" The Commission further found that SPC Penland's \"actions did not rise to the level required in order to constitute gross negligence,\" as required for individual liability under the Emergency Management Act. Plaintiffs ultimately chose not to appeal the Full Commission's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, defendant moved for summary judgment in superior court, contending that the Commission's finding that SPC Penland was not grossly negligent precluded plaintiffs' action based on res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court disagreed and instead entered summary judgment for plaintiffs on defendant's defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Defendant timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As an initial matter, we must address whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal since it involves an interlocutory order. An order is interlocutory if \"it is made during the pendency of an action and does not dispose of the case but requires further action by the trial court in order to finally determine the entire controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Howerton v.

For defendants to establish that a plaintiff's claim is barred by res judicata, they \"must show (1) a final judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit, and (3) an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.\"\n   <em>\n    Erler v.

We hold, however, that defendant has failed to meet the second and third requirements for res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the Industrial Commission, plaintiffs brought a claim against the State under the State Tort Claims Act, while the action currently on appeal is a common-law claim against an individual. Our Supreme Court has previously held that a claim against the State in the Industrial Commission \"did not constitute\n   <em>\n    another action\n   </em>\n   pending\n   <em>\n    between the same parties\n   </em>\n   for the same cause\" as an action filed in superior court against a state employee.\n   <em>\n    Wirth v.
