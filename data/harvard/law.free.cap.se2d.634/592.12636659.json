Defendant's convictions were consolidated into seven judgments, and she was sentenced to five consecutive terms of ten to twelve months in prison and two concurrent terms of ten to twelve months in prison. The two concurrent terms were suspended and Defendant was placed on supervised probation for sixty months, to begin at the expiration of her prison terms. As a condition of probation, Defendant was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $15,089.09. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent Defendant on appeal has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal and asks that this Court conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error. Counsel has also shown to the satisfaction of this Court that he has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

However, although Defendant's counsel does not make any arguments on appeal, he does raise the issue of Defendant's prior record level calculation as an issue that arguably might have merit on appeal. Specifically, counsel raises the question of whether there was an effective stipulation to Defendant's prior record level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(f) (2005) provides that \"[t]he State bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a prior conviction exists and that the offender before the court is the same person as the offender named in the prior conviction.\" A defendant's prior conviction may be proven by any of the following methods:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) Stipulation of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) An original or copy of the court record of the prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) A copy of records maintained by the Division of Criminal Information, the Division of Motor Vehicles, or of the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) Any other method found by the court to be reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also State v.

Included on the worksheet were several out-of-state convictions, the date of these convictions, and their classification. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(e) (2005) governs the classification of prior convictions from out-of-state, based on whether the out-of-state conviction is \"substantially similar\" to an offense in North Carolina. In this case, the parties stipulated that the information on the worksheet was accurate, \"including the classification and points assigned to any out-of-state convictions[.]\" Based on this stipulation, the trial court found that Defendant had six points for a prior record level of III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, our Court recently held in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although this Court did not explicitly state that a defendant could not stipulate to the substantial similarity of out-of-state convictions, the Court did conclude that this Court's prior statement in\n   <em>\n    State v.
