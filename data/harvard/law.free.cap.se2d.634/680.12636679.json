STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kenneth Alonzo Hodges, II, appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, which affirmed his convictions for first-degree murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and use of a firearm while in the commission of a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Hodges asserts that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting into evidence certain statements made by the victim, Shelly Marie Jackson, prior to her death. Hodges argues that the admission of these statements violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Virginia's hearsay rules. For the reasons set forth below, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

Lovelace of the South Boston Police Department uncovered evidence that Jackson was selling marijuana. Jackson was arrested for the distribution of marijuana and, while being questioned by police, wrote a confession (\"Jackson's Written Statement\"), dated April 17, 2002, in which she claimed that Hodges approached her about selling marijuana for him and provided her with the marijuana she sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Hodges was arrested on a charge of conspiracy to distribute marijuana on April 18, 2002,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but released on bond, which required that he have no contact with Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shelly Jones (\"Shelly\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), Jackson's cousin, testified that on the day before Hodges' preliminary hearing on the conspiracy charge, Jackson asked Shelly to accompany her to Cody Store, a local store, because she needed \"to talk to [Hodges] about court.\" According to Shelly, when they arrived at Cody Store, Jackson \"went over and . . . started talking\" to Hodges' wife. Shelly saw Hodges \"walking up and down . . . on the other side of the street\" while Jackson and Hodges' wife were talking, but she did not see Hodges and Jackson speak to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lt. Lovelace testified that at Hodges' preliminary hearing on June 24, 2002, Jackson \"decided at that time she wasn't going to testify\" and that some of the charges against Hodges were dismissed. However, Lt. Lovelace further testified that he intended to reinstate those charges for the September 2002 grand jury term because he believed\n   Jackson would change her mind about testifying against Hodges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 30, 2002, Jackson met with her attorney regarding the distribution of marijuana charge still pending against her. Jackson's attorney recommended that Jackson cooperate with the Commonwealth's Attorney by testifying against Hodges in order to avoid additional charges, incarceration, or losing custody of her young daughter. Jackson's attorney testified that Jackson did not indicate whether she would testify. That same day, Hodges' wife telephoned the home of Jackson's mother to speak with Jackson, but Jackson was not there to receive the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Another of Jackson's cousins, Missy Jones (\"Missy\"), testified that on August 31, 2002, Jackson told her that although \"she didn't really want to testify [against Hodges at his trial,] she had to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jackson's sister, Angela Jackson, testified that at 11 a.m. the next day, September 1, 2002, Jackson received a telephone call at the apartment where she and Angela resided. Angela recognized the telephone number listed on the caller identification as Hodges' cellular telephone number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediately after receiving the telephone call, Jackson left the apartment with her daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jackson's friend and babysitter, Farah F. Canada, testified that \"about twelve noon,\" Jackson arrived at Canada's residence in order to leave her daughter with Canada. Canada further testified that Jackson said she was going to \"meet [Hodges, but] would be right back.\" This was the last time Jackson was seen alive. Canada also testified that she watched Jackson's daughter on earlier occasions while Jackson said she was meeting Hodges \"down the dirt road . . . past his house.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Angela reported to police her sister was missing on the evening of September 2, 2002. On September 4, 2002, the police discovered Jackson's body on rural property in Halifax County owned by Hodges' parents. The medical examiner testified that Jackson had sustained four gunshot wounds, but was not able to determine what type of gun caused the injuries, nor was she able to establish the precise date or time of Jackson's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Police also discovered the car Jackson had driven after leaving Canada's home in the parking lot of a Ramada Inn in Reidsville, North Carolina. A cashier at a gas station adjacent to the Ramada Inn testified that Hodges was in his store the afternoon of September 1, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence from an expert in forensic biology who performed DNA analysis on items retrieved from the crime scene. Hodges \"could not be eliminated\" as one of the contributors to DNA located on a knife found at the scene of the crime. The Commonwealth also presented evidence regarding Hodges' cellular telephone use on the afternoon of September 1, 2002. Numerous calls were placed between Hodges' cellular telephone and his home telephone and his wife's cellular telephone. Telephone records indicated that the earliest calls were routed through \"South Boston area\" telephone switches, while later telephone calls were routed through Danville, then Henderson, North Carolina, and later Reidsville, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence statements made by Jackson prior to her death to support its theory that Hodges killed Jackson in order to prevent her from testifying against him on the marijuana conspiracy charge. Over Hodges' objection, Lt. Lovelace was permitted to read Jackson's Written Statement to the jury. During cross-examination of Lt. Lovelace, Hodges introduced into evidence a written statement dated June 23, 2002, the date of the Cody Store meeting, which purportedly bore Jackson's signature, and stated that Jackson's Written Statement implicating Hodges in the sale of marijuana was \"false[]\" and made only because of police pressure. Missy, Shelly, and Canada were each permitted to testify regarding the statements\n   Jackson made regarding her meetings with Hodges prior to her disappearance, her decision to testify against Hodges, and about her intended meeting with Hodges on the day of her disappearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Twice during its closing argument, the Commonwealth referred generally to Jackson's statements. First, the Commonwealth contended the statements were \"direct evidence\" from Jackson \"to the extent that she is present to argue for herself.\" Later, the Commonwealth argued that Jackson's statements were \"direct evidence\" in the case against Hodges and \"Shelly Jackson is saying things from the grave as it were.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A jury found Hodges guilty of first-degree murder and fixed his punishment at 32 years' imprisonment. The jury also convicted Hodges of use of a firearm while committing or attempting to commit murder, for which they fixed his punishment at three years' imprisonment. The trial court entered judgment against Hodges in accordance with the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Hodges contended, inter alia, that the admission of each statement purportedly made by Jackson was reversible error. The Court of Appeals affirmed Hodges' convictions, holding that the admission of each challenged statement was either proper or did not constitute reversible error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Hodges v.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Hodges first contends the admission of Jackson's Written Statement violated the Confrontation Clause and Virginia's hearsay rules. Hodges also contends the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to introduce Jackson's oral statements to Missy, Shelly, and Canada because these statements were inadmissible hearsay and their admission also violated the Confrontation Clause. Hodges further asserts the trial court should have given a limiting instruction that Missy's testimony was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted. Lastly, Hodges contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the trial court committed harmless error when it improperly admitted Canada's testimony about Jackson's statements about meeting with Hodges prior to September 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Jackson's Written Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Hodges filed a motion in limine to exclude Jackson's Written Statement, which the trial court denied because\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   the purpose of offering this evidence or this statement is not to show the truth or falsity of her description or Ms. Jackson's description of Mr. Hodges as having been one who is involved with her in the drug offenses but rather to show the motive for the killing of Ms. Jackson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court concluded the admission of Jackson's Written Statement did not \"violate[] the Defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses against him and [is not admitted] for the truth of the matters asserted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court of Appeals agreed and found no error in the admission of Jackson's Written Statement because \"the Commonwealth offered evidence that Jackson had implicated [Hodges] in a marijuana distribution conspiracy in order to show [Hodges] had a motive for killing [Jackson], not to show that he had in fact engaged in such a conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167955\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/735/\">\n    45 Va.App. at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167955\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/735/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Court of Appeals stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   because [Hodges] failed to proffer a limiting instruction - whether due to oversight or trial strategy - and because the Commonwealth did not rely on the evidence for an improper purpose, [Hodges] may not now complain about the trial court's failure to give a limiting instruction or the possibility that the jury may have considered Jackson's confession for the truth of its allegation that [Hodges] was a drug dealer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167955\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/735/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167955\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/735/\">\n    at 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167955\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/735/\">\n    613 S.E.2d at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hodges contends that, despite assurances to the contrary, the Commonwealth did use Jackson's Written Statement \"for the truth of the matter asserted.\" He argues that the\n   Court of Appeals' decision \"eviscerate[s]\" the Confrontation Clause as applied in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

To further support his argument, Hodges cites\n   <em>\n    Donahue v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2078347\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/225/145/\">\n    225 Va. 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20768\">\n    300 S.E.2d 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983), in which the Court held the Commonwealth's use of an out-of-court statement was to \"prove the truth of its contents\" despite its purported use when first admitted for \"other purposes.\" Hodges also argues that the Court of Appeals' decision amounts to holding that Hodges' \"failure to request a limiting instruction or redaction of [Jackson's Written Statement] constitutes a waiver of the Confrontation Clause claim, despite Hodges' objections to the confession and the trial judge's assurance that the objection was noted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that Jackson's Written Statement was properly admitted because it was offered \"solely to prove [what Jackson] said [and] not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i.e., that [Hodges] was a drug dealer.\" Furthermore, the Commonwealth argues the Court of Appeals correctly held \"Hodges waived his right to have the jury instructed that it could consider the confession only as it related to [Hodges'] motive\" because Hodges \"never proffered such an instruction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   bars the admission of an out-of-court testimonial statement used to establish the truth of the matter asserted unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   59 n. 9, 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Hence, the statements are not barred by the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247-48, ___ S.W.3d ___.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hodges' argument that the Commonwealth \"paint[ed] Hodges as a drug dealer\" in opening and closing arguments, and thus improperly used Jackson's Written Statement for the truth of its contents, is unpersuasive when the record is viewed in context. In arguing for the admissibility of Jackson's Written Statement, the Commonwealth's Attorney stated, \"[Jackson's Written Statement] is important [because Jackson] implicated [Hodges] in a case that was [going to] be tried and this provided his motive for getting rid of her.\" He later suggested that if Hodges was concerned about possible misuse of Jackson's Written Statement, the appropriate response would be a cautionary instruction to the jury stating the limited purpose for which it was to be considered. Thus, the Commonwealth properly contemplated the limited purpose of proving motive as the basis for which Jackson's Written Statement would be used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Although the text of Jackson's Written Statement does allege Hodges conspired with Jackson to distribute marijuana, the specific references by the Commonwealth's Attorney during opening and closing argument present the statement's contents as being Jackson's allegations rather than independent statements of fact that Hodges actually conspired with Jackson to distribute marijuana. In opening argument, the Commonwealth's Attorney said that Jackson \"gave a complete statement saying that for some time she\n   indeed had been selling marijuana . . . and that she was doing it for . . . Hodges[.] So she implicated Mr. Hodges as being part of the conspiracy.\" This statement does not argue as fact that Hodges actually conspired with Jackson to distribute marijuana, but only that Jackson had told police that he had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Similarly, in summarizing the evidence presented at trial during closing argument, the Commonwealth's Attorney described the claims in Jackson's Written Statement as damaging to her and also to Hodges, whether or not the acts attributed to Hodges were true:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   [Jackson's Written Statement was] written out by her [a]nd when you look at it she explains everything that happened in the course of this conspiracy, that she was supplied by [Hodges] with the marijuana and that she sold it from [her] apartment. . . . It's a very damning thing. And frankly, Shelly Jackson didn't help herself out by giving it in the sense that she inculpated herself and she was obviously looking at some serious charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While pointing out that Jackson had \"inculpated herself,\" the Commonwealth's Attorney did not argue Jackson's accusations inculpated Hodges or were statements of fact of acts actually committed by Hodges. The Commonwealth's Attorney then noted that Jackson's Written Statement only \"identified [Hodges] as her supplier,\" not that Hodges in fact supplied Jackson with marijuana. The record thus supports the conclusion that the Commonwealth did not introduce or use Jackson's Written Statement as proof of the veracity of its contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Hodges' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   is also unpersuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Donahue,\n   </em>\n   we held the Commonwealth improperly used a written note that had been admitted for a proper nonhearsay purpose to establish the truth of the note's contents instead.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2078347\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/225/145/\">\n    225 Va. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20768\">\n    300 S.E.2d at 771-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as noted above, the record in this case does not support a finding that the rationale for introducing Jackson's Written Statement, to show motive, was altered by an actual use of the statement to prove its contents as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Contrary to Hodges' assertion, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Street\n   </em>\n   does not limit the introduction of an out-of-court statement only to occasions where the defendant has put the matter at issue or where \"no alternative[]\" means of presenting the evidence is available.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203741\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/409/\">\n    471 U.S. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203741\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/409/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, while Hodges argues that the Commonwealth could have used other means short of reading all of Jackson's Written Statement to the jury to achieve the purpose for which the statement was admissible, Hodges did not seek such alternatives at trial. Hodges did not ask the trial court to redact any of Jackson's Written Statement, and thus did not \"afford the trial court the opportunity to rule intelligently\" on the alternatives he now proposes and has waived the issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25;\n   <em>\n    Riner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631728\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/601/555/#p303\">\n    268 Va. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631728\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/601/555/#p303\">\n    601 S.E.2d at 571-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The admission of Jackson's Written Statement does not violate Virginia's hearsay rules for the same reason that it does not violate the Confrontation Clause - the statement was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.

In addition, the Commonwealth argues the evidence that Jackson and Hodges' wife discussed Jackson's allegations against Hodges at Cody Store several months earlier permitted the inference that Jackson would continue to discuss her intent to testify against Hodges with him or his wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This argument, accepted by the Court of Appeals, is defective because it rests upon successive speculative inferences to conclude knowledge, sufficient to show motive, on Hodges' part. The Commonwealth's argument requires the initial inference that because Jackson may have talked to Hodges' wife at Cody Store in June regarding her earlier intent to testify against Hodges, she was more likely in September to discuss a new intent to testify against Hodges as expressed to Missy on August 31st. There is no basis in the record to connect the two events, except pure speculation. Furthermore, the record is devoid of evidence to prove that Jackson, or anyone else, ever communicated a decision by Jackson to testify against Hodges to him. The record contains no evidence of any actual communications between Hodges or his wife and Jackson after her refusal to testify at his preliminary hearing on the drug conspiracy charges, until the September 1 telephone call, of which there is no detail other than Jackson was to meet Hodges. Although Hodges and his wife attempted to call Jackson on other occasions, the record does not reflect they ever communicated. Jackson gave no indication to her attorney or anyone else except Missy that she would testify against Hodges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To conclude from this evidence that Jackson communicated her intent to testify against Hodges to him is pure speculation. As we said in\n   <em>\n    Mullins,\n   </em>\n   an individual cannot be induced to act by a fact or circumstance that he did not know. While Jackson's statement to Missy is evidence of her state of mind, the statement should not have been admitted because it was not relevant to a material issue in the case, in particular, Hodges' motive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Where a criminal case has been tried by jury, the court reviewing whether an error is harmless \"must decide whether the alleged error substantially influenced the jury.

Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, vacate Hodges' convictions, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals with instructions to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial in accordance with the principles expressed in this opinion, if the Commonwealth be so advised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   ---------------\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Justice KINSER, with whom Justice LEMONS joins, dissenting in part and concurring in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   While I agree with much of the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent from the portion concerning Missy Jones' testimony and the majority's conclusion that the admission of her testimony was not harmless error.

Thus, I will now summarize some crucial evidence presented at Hodges' trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In April 2002, Shelly Jackson made a written statement to the police in which she implicated Hodges in a marijuana distribution conspiracy. At the time Jackson made her statement, the South Boston Police Department was already investigating Hodges, and Jackson's statement provided the additional information needed to arrest Hodges for conspiracy to distribute marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   After his arrest, Hodges was released on bond, with one of the conditions requiring him to have no contact with Jackson. On June 23, 2002, however, after receiving a telephone call from either Hodges or his wife, Jackson asked her cousin, Shelly Jones, to accompany her to a local store because Jackson was going \"to meet [Hodges] to talk to him about court.\" At the store, Jackson talked with Hodges' wife, while Hodges paced up and down the street. At trial, Hodges introduced into evidence a statement, purportedly signed by Jackson that day, recanting her previous statement to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The following day, at the preliminary hearing on the charges pending against Hodges, Jackson announced that she was not going to testify. Because Jackson failed to testify, the Commonwealth was unable to proceed on the conspiracy charge. The investigating officer indicated he nevertheless planned to present charges against Hodges to the next grand jury, which was scheduled to meet in September 2002. The officer believed that Jackson would change her mind about testifying against Hodges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Sometime after Hodges' preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth informed Jackson's attorney, Tracy Quackenbush Martin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that unless Jackson testified against Hodges, the Commonwealth would bring a conspiracy charge against Jackson. Quackenbush informed Jackson that, with such a charge, the possibility of Jackson's receiving a period of incarceration increased substantially. The day before Jackson disappeared, Quackenbush\n   met with her, reiterated the seriousness of a conspiracy charge, and advised her to testify against Hodges. Jackson did not give her attorney a final answer that day, and her attorney never saw her again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   During the time between Hodges' preliminary hearing, June 24, 2002, and the day Jackson disappeared, September 1, 2002, Hodges, either personally or through his wife, attempted to contact Jackson on numerous occasions, sometimes as often as \"four or five times a week . . . two or three times a day.\" The day before Jackson disappeared, Hodges' wife called the home of Jackson's mother looking for Jackson. On the morning of her disappearance, Jackson received a telephone call at her sister's home at 11 a.m. According to the caller identification function on her sister's telephone, the call came from Hodges' cellular telephone. Hodges informed the police that he kept the cellular telephone with him at all times \"unless it's on the charger inside the home.\" Hodges' cellular telephone records showed that no calls were made either from or to his cellular telephone for about an hour and 40 minutes after the approximate time Jackson received the telephone call that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Soon after receiving the telephone call from Hodges' cellular telephone, Jackson and her daughter left her sister's home, and Jackson took her daughter to stay with a friend, Farah Canada. Jackson told Canada that she was going to meet Hodges \"down the dirt road down past his house,\" and \"she would be right back.\" But, Jackson never came back. It was off this road, on property owned by Hodges' parents, that Jackson's body was found three days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   On September 2, 2002, Jackson's automobile was found in the parking lot of a Ramada Inn off Route 29 in Reidsville, North Carolina. Through a photographic line-up, a clerk at a convenience store located adjacent to the Ramada Inn identified Hodges as having been in the store on September 1, 2002 sometime between 2:30 and 4:00 p.m. At trial, the clerk identified Hodges as the person he saw in the store that day. Hodges' cellular telephone records confirm that he was in the Reidsville, North Carolina area during the time period when the store clerk saw him. Furthermore, cellular telephone records showed Hodges and his wife communicating back and forth as they traveled separately on September 1, 2002 from the South Boston, Virginia area, to the vicinity of Reidsville, North Carolina. Testimony indicated that the most direct route between the two locations is via Route 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Finally, the evidence at the crime scene also implicated Hodges. Jackson's body was found not only on property owned by Hodges' parents but also in a location where Jackson was known to have met Hodges previously. The police officers who investigated the scene where Jackson's body was found discovered signs indicating the body had been dragged through the woods in the direction of a shallow, rectangular hole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the rainfall in the area around the time that Jackson was killed and the amount of water in the hole, it was likely dug prior to September 1, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   At the scene, the police found a knife from which a DNA sample was recovered. Testing revealed that more than one individual contributed to that DNA sample. Hodges could not be excluded as a contributor of the DNA but Jackson was eliminated. Statistical analysis demonstrated that it was \"billions of times more likely\" that Hodges was one of the contributors of that DNA as opposed to two unknown individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Despite the totality of this and other evidence proving Hodges' guilt, the majority concludes that Missy Jones' testimony about Jackson's statement that she had to testify against Hodges was a \"critical component\" of the Commonwealth's case with regard to Hodges' motive for murdering Jackson. I do not agree. Whether Hodges actually knew Jackson had changed her mind, while lending strength to the Commonwealth's argument regarding motive, was not a determinative factor. Hodges knew that Jackson had given a statement to the police implicating him in a drug conspiracy. On the day before Hodges'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   preliminary hearing, Hodges or his wife apparently persuaded Jackson to sign a statement recanting her prior statement to the police. The handwriting in the body of the statement was different from both Jackson's signature on it and Jackson's handwriting on the statement given to the police. Furthermore, the very next day, Jackson decided not to testify at Hodges' preliminary hearing. After the preliminary hearing, Hodges or his wife attempted to contact Jackson on numerous occasions up until the day she disappeared, and someone using Hodges' cellular telephone did in fact talk to her that day. From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that Hodges remained concerned about whether Jackson would ultimately testify against him. Killing Jackson eliminated the risk. That alone was sufficient motive irrespective of whether Hodges knew that Jackson had indeed changed her mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Not only was Missy Jones' testimony superfluous to the Commonwealth's case concerning Hodges' motive, it was also only a small part of three days of testimony regarding Jackson's murder and Hodges' involvement. Through numerous witnesses and exhibits, the jury knew that Jackson was going to meet Hodges on the day she disappeared. The jury knew that Hodges traveled to the Reidsville, North Carolina area that same day and that Jackson's vehicle was found in the area the next day. The jury also knew that Hodges could not be eliminated as a contributor of DNA on a knife found at the crime scene. Finally, Jackson's body was discovered on property owned by Hodges' parents, which was a location where Jackson had met Hodges on previous occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Clay\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, in order for this Court to grant a new trial, it must find that the jury was \"substantially swayed\" by Missy Jones' testimony.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204150\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/262/253/\">\n    262 Va. at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=546%20S.E.2d%20728\">\n    546 S.E.2d at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
