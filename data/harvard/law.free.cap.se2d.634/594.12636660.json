After a thorough review of the record, relevant law, and arguments of the parties, we hold that defendant received a trial free from prejudicial error; as such, we affirm the judgment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant argues that a warrant used to collect evidence from his house, specifically his computer, was constitutionally deficient and tainted the outcome of his trial. While we wholeheartedly agree the warrant in question is void of sufficient probable cause, and the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress, our review of the trial court's error supports a determination it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argues that evidence of prior misconduct and sexual orientation was errantly\n   introduced to the jurors and affected their ability to render a fair decision. We determine that there is no prejudicial error in the trial court's decision to allow presentation of this evidence. Further, although defendant disputes the relevancy and admissibility of his wife's financial status, we find no error in the trial court's rulings. And finally, in a lengthy and contentious trial where both the State and defendant were ably represented, we see no prejudicial error in the State's remarks during closing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 9 December 2001, at 2:40 a.m., defendant called the City of Durham's 911 center from his residence. He stated that his wife, Kathleen Peterson (Kathleen), had fallen down the stairs. Defendant further stated that she was unconscious but was still breathing. Defendant hung up and then called back to 911 a short time later, claiming that Kathleen was not breathing. Approximately seven to eight minutes after defendant's initial 911 call, James Rose and Ron Paige - paramedics with the Durham County Emergency Medical Services - arrived at the Peterson residence. Defendant's son, Todd Peterson (Todd), arrived at the same time as the paramedics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Peterson house is a large estate home with an open foyer entrance. The paramedics found the front door open and noticed blood on it. Straight ahead through the front door is the large, main staircase leading to the second floor. Immediately to the left after entering, however, is a front hallway leading down to the kitchen. Off of this hallway near the kitchen is an enclosed, narrow stairwell also leading to the second floor. Upon entering the house, the paramedics observed Kathleen lying at the bottom of this stairwell. Her legs were out into the hallway and her head was just inside the encased, open doorframe where the first few steps are located. The stairwell runs parallel to the hallway, but has a few angled steps at the bottom designed to open up the staircase perpendicular to the hallway. Defendant was seen standing over Kathleen in a \"semi-knees-bent position\" with blood on his hands, arms, legs, and feet; he wore shorts and a t-shirt partially blood-soaked with splatter spots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When paramedics arrived at Kathleen's body, Todd tried to pull defendant away, stating, \"Dad, she's dead, the paramedics are here.\" Paramedics Rose and Paige quickly determined that Kathleen had no pulse and was not breathing. Defendant stated that he had gone outside to turn off the lights, came back in, and found her at the bottom of the steps. Paramedic Rose testified that there was an \"enormous amount of blood involved.\" He saw \"dried blood on the steps, and also on the wall. And it also looked like it had been wiped away or wiped on. It had been smeared, instead of just blood droplets just soaking down the wall.\" He testified that based on his experience there was an unusual amount of blood for a fall, and the most severe injury he had seen from a fall was a broken neck. The blood under Kathleen's head had already clotted and started to harden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that day, Dr. Deborah Radisch, a pathologist with the Office of the North Carolina Medical Examiner, performed an autopsy on Kathleen's body and determined the cause of death to be blunt force trauma of the head. The autopsy revealed multiple contusions and abrasions on the head and neck; seven distinct lacerations on the posterior scalp; and contusions and abrasions on the arms, wrists, and hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also on that day, Investigator A.H. Holland, Jr., a member of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Durham Police Department, applied for and received a search warrant to search the Peterson residence at 1810 Cedar Street, Durham, North Carolina. The warrant stated that the property to be seized included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   fingerprints, bloodstains, physical layout and measurements of the premises, documentary evidence indicating ownership, and moving pictures, video, and still pictures to preserve the nature of the crime scene. Investigator Holland's affidavit supporting probable cause included the following underlying facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This applicant has been a law enforcement officer for more than nineteen years. I am currently assigned to the Homicide Unit of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Durham Police Department. I have been an Investigator with the Durham Police\n   Department since 1989. During this time I have been assigned to conduct follow-up investigations of Child Sexual Abuse, Adult Rape, Aggravated Assault and Homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 9, 2001, 0309 hrs., I, Inv. A.H. Holland, Jr., was paged by On-Call CID Supervisor Sgt. Fran Borden in reference to a Death Investigation at 1810 Cedar St. Sgt. Borden advised that the victim, age 47, fell down a flight of stairs and there was a large amount of blood present at the scene. At 0359 hrs., this investigator arrived at 1810 Cedar St. Prior to entering the front door, I observed blood on the sidewalk that leads to the front door. Upon entering the front door, I observed blood on the inside of the door. Sgt. Terry Wilkins advised that the victim's husband had blood all over his person. I saw the victim at a distance, but did not approach. At this point, this investigator made the decision to obtain this Search Warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On 10 December 2001 Investigator Holland applied for and received a second search warrant. This warrant stated the premises to be searched as defendant's residence along with four vehicles not on the first warrant. The probable cause for the second warrant simply repeated the probable cause from the affidavit for the first warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On 12 December 2001 Investigator Holland applied for and received a third search warrant to search defendant's residence. That warrant stated that the property to be seized included all items from the previous warrant as well as \"computers, CPUs, files, software, accessories and any and all other evidence that may be associated with this investigation.\" The only additional probable cause listed in Investigator Holland's application for the search warrant was the following statement: \"After conferring with the District Attorney's Office and the State Medical Examiners Office, this applicant has probable cause to believe that additional evidence remains at the residence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On 20 December 2001 defendant was indicted on the charge of first-degree murder for the death of Kathleen. Before trial, the court denied defendant's motion to suppress all evidence seized as a result of the 9, 10, and 12 December 2001 search warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At trial, the State's evidence relative to motive tended to show that Kathleen had worked at Nortel Networks. Helen Prislinger, a process analyst and project manager for Nortel Networks, reported directly to Kathleen. Ms. Prislinger testified that Kathleen telephoned her on 8 December 2001, at 11:08 p.m. Ms. Prislinger informed Kathleen that she had documents to e-mail her for a meeting the coming Sunday in Canada. Kathleen asked someone in the room for an e-mail address and gave it to Ms. Prislinger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Todd Markley, a lead consultant at CompuSleuth which performs forensic processing and investigation, testified as an expert in forensic computer examination. He examined a disk drive from defendant's computer and identified an e-mail sent 8 December 2001 at 11:53 p.m. from Ms. Prislinger. He could not determine if the e-mail had been read, but was \"pretty confident\" that the attached documents were not extracted. Mr. Markley also testified that he recovered a large volume of pictures of sexual activity that were on the computer as a result of web browsing. The State introduced numerous e-mails between defendant and Brent \"Brad\" Wolgamott, a male escort. In these e-mails with Mr. Wolgamott, defendant attempted to set a time to \"hook up\" with Mr. Wolgamott and also indicated that defendant understood he would be paying for sexual services. The State further introduced an e-mail dated 23 February 2001 from Dirk Yates, an operator of a web service dealing in homosexual pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State also introduced numerous papers that were collected by the police from defendant's den or study area. This paperwork included naked photographs of Mr. Wolgamott, escort reviews of Mr. Wolgamott, and printouts of e-mails between defendant and Mr. Wolgamott discussing defendant paying Mr. Wolgamott for sexual services. This paperwork was intermingled with other various paperwork including a tax appraisal of defendant's residence, Kathleen's cell phone bill from Sprint, and Kathleen's flex benefit confirmation statement from Nortel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regarding the Petersons' finances and Kathleen's job status at Nortel Networks, Raymond Young, a special agent, certified public accountant, and certified fraud examiner with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, testified that at the time of Kathleen's death, the value of the Petersons' major assets was $1,618,369.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1999, $276,790.00 was received into the Petersons' bank account\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and $461,400.00 left the account. In 2000, $203,390.00 was received into the account and $300,760.00 left the account. In 2001, $180,480.00 was received into the account and $288,000.00 left the account. On the Petersons' 1999, 2000, and 2001 tax returns, defendant had no taxable income from employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Katherine Kayser, an administrative assistant at Nortel Networks, testified that in 2001, Kathleen earned $145,000.00 plus a bonus of $10,750.00. At Nortel, she obtained the following stock options: In 1994, 4,800 shares at $3.94 per share and she had 1,600 shares outstanding; in 1995, 5,600 shares at $4.2113 per share; in 1996, 4,800 shares at $5.6175 per share; in 1997, 5,600 shares at $8.8513 per share; in 1998, 6,000 shares at $11.29 per share; in 1999, 4,000 shares at $17.43 per share; in January 2000, 2,000 shares at $37.94; in April 2000, 2,000 shares at $57.41 per share; and in July 2000, 2,000 shares at $80.69 per share, and all were outstanding. In September 2000, Nortel's stock plunged. All of Kathleen's stock options from 2000 were cancelled as the market price fell below the option price; she was going to trade them in; however, upon her death they were reinstated. Kathleen exercised 3,200 shares of options with a purchase price of $3.94 in five separate transactions of 500, 800, 500, 200, and 1,200 shares with market prices of $36.75, $32.75, $37.625, $31.94, and $19.40 respectively, for a total profit of $80,431.50, less $31,054.05 in taxes for a net profit of $49,377.45. She exercised her last option in March 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Kayser also testified that as Kathleen's beneficiary, defendant received $29,360.38 after taxes from her 401(k) plan; $94,455.75 after taxes from her retirement benefits; and $223,182.46 from her deferred compensation fund. Kathleen also had a life insurance policy for which she had filled out a \"Life Insurance Beneficiary Designation Form\" listing defendant as the beneficiary; however, she had neither signed nor dated that form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Kim Barker, a human resource employee at Nortel, testified that from the fourth quarter of 2000 through 2001 Nortel laid off employees, described by Nortel as \"optimization.\" In November of 2001, Kathleen was placed on the \"optimization list\" for three days. However, Ms. Barker did not know if Kathleen knew that she was on the list. Ms. Barker testified that a terminated employee is not entitled to continue a company life insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   John Huggard, an expert in the field of estate planning, testified as to how Kathleen's estate would be divided, pursuant to the laws of intestate succession, between defendant and Kathleen's daughter Caitlin Atwater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   E-mails recovered from defendant's computer also related to the Petersons' finances. One e-mail was from defendant to his ex-wife, Patty Peterson, asking her to pay a portion of their sons' living expenses. Another was an e-mail from Thomas Ratliff to defendant on 19 April 2001, responding to defendant's request that Thomas pay $5,000.00 per semester for Martha Ratliff's college expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court also allowed the State to present evidence related to the death of Elizabeth Ratliff, a friend of defendant and his\n   first wife who died under circumstances with factual similarities to the death of Kathleen. The facts regarding this incident will be set forth more fully in our discussion of the issue arising from the ruling to admit this evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant presented evidence tending to support the theory that Kathleen died as a result of an accidental fall down the stairs. He presented several expert witnesses who testified regarding the blood splatter patterns and the biomechanics of a fall to support his theory of accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On 10 October 2003 a jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder. From that verdict and resulting sentence to life imprisonment without parole, defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Warrant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On 4 March 2002 and 14 February 2003 defendant filed motions to suppress the evidence seized from the Peterson home. On 31 March 2003 the trial court conducted a hearing on these motions. The trial court's order, entered on 28 April 2003, contains nineteen findings of fact and five conclusions of law determining that the police had probable cause for the issuance of each of the three search warrants used to search and process the Peterson house during the time after Kathleen's death. Defendant argues that each warrant was invalid. Specifically, he argues each affidavit supporting the warrants was void of sufficient facts to suggest probable cause that a crime had been committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[T]he standard of review in evaluating a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress is that the trial court's findings of fact `are conclusive on appeal if supported by competent evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Taken as true, they reflect that Investigator Holland obtained an initial search warrant for the Peterson residence and one Jaguar vehicle on 9 December 2001 at 6:04 a.m. The probable cause was based on the relay of information regarding an excessive amount of blood at the base of the stairs, blood \"all over\" defendant, and blood droplets on the door and sidewalk outside. Also noted in the affidavit was Investigator Holland's background of nineteen years on the force and his connection with homicide investigations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The property to be seized was identified with some level of particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Fingerprints, bloodstains, fired and unfired bullets and casings, any and all other weapons, footwear impressions, trace hair and clothing fibers, physical layout of the premises, measurements of the premises, moving pictures, video, and still pictures to preserve the nature of the crime scene; documentary evidence indicating ownership, possession and control of the premises; and any and all evidence that may relate to the Death Investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, this first search warrant was sought and issued within a matter of hours after police discovered Kathleen's body. The probable cause outlines that Kathleen suffered a fall down a set of stairs. There was an excessive amount of blood located around the body for a fall located around the body and down the stairs. There was also blood at various points inside and outside the house. Notably, the victim's husband's hands and clothes were covered in blood. Under a deferential standard, these statements are sufficient to at least suggest something more than a fall and perhaps even a homicide, albeit that innocent explanations for the blood also might exist. \"Probable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard. It does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false. A practical, nontechnical probability is all that is required.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, looking for a weapon, whether that be a blunt object, sharp object, or gun would be sufficient based on this evidence. Further, ascertaining evidence about the scene would also be justified, including pictures, measurements, fingerprints, impressions, or fibers.

The allegation that agents have conducted an investigation which has disclosed evidence of irregularities which, if supported by evidence and found to be true, would constitute serious violations of the law on the part of the defendant, without the disclosure of facts from which the magistrate could ascertain the existence of irregularities that would constitute serious violations of the law, does not meet the constitutional standard for issuance of a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=265%20S.E.2d%20914\">\n    265 S.E.2d at 919\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Evidence from a search of defendant's computer is the\n   crux of what was recovered and admitted pursuant to the invalid warrant. That evidence suggested that the Petersons were possibly in financial difficulty, that defendant had homosexual interests, that an e-mail was sent to Kathleen the night of her death, and perhaps that the Petersons' marriage was strained. This same evidence was presented through numerous other sources: Helen Prislinger testified about sending the e-mail to defendant's account; ample evidence of defendant's possible predilection for homosexuality was introduced by printed e-mails and photos seized from the desk drawer next to the computer pursuant to a valid warrant; and copious amounts of evidence and testimony was admitted regarding the Petersons' faltering financial condition. As such, the evidence introduced pursuant to the invalid warrant was nothing more than repetition of other properly admitted evidence, thereby rendering its impact on the jury harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Rule 404(b) Ratliff Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The trial court conducted an extensive\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   hearing on the proposed Rule 404(b) evidence regarding Elizabeth Ratliff, an individual close to defendant who seventeen years prior to Kathleen's death was found dead at the bottom of a set of stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Elizabeth Ratliff worked as a teacher with the Department of Defense Dependent School System, and her husband George was an officer in the United States Air Force. In the early 1980s the couple lived in Klein Gerau, Germany. Both were good friends with defendant and his first wife, Patty. After George's death in 1983, defendant began to help Elizabeth with funeral arrangements, financial matters, and general support. About a year after her husband's death, Elizabeth and the couple's two daughters moved to a house down the street from the Petersons in Graefenhausen, Germany. Defendant continued to help care for the Ratliff family over the next year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Then, at around 7:15 a.m. on 25 November 1985, Barbara Malagino, permanent nanny to the Ratliff children, found Elizabeth dead at the bottom of the main staircase in her home. A friend and co-worker of Elizabeth's, Cheryl Appel-Schumacher, testified that she arrived at the house around 9:00 a.m.; she described the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   She stated that defendant was there, talking mainly with the police, military, and other official personnel at the house. Along with defendant and those officials, several other people were in the small foyer area: Amy Beth and Bruce Berner, neighbors of the Ratliff family; Patty Peterson; and a taxicab driver. Elizabeth's body was at the bottom of the stairs; she was wearing a pair of yellow boots and was partially covered by a coat. There was blood sprayed down the wall of the open staircase, blood on the wall opposite the foyer area, blood on a chest and footlocker, and a pool of blood underneath Elizabeth's body. Ms. Appel-Schumacher also described a smaller pattern of blood droplets at the top of the stairs, above a light switch. It appeared to have been flicked from a brush, whereas the blood down the wall was more of a tear drop pattern which increased in size further down the stairs. Ms. Appel-Schumacher said that she, her husband, and someone else, probably defendant, helped clean up the blood after Elizabeth's body was taken away. She also testified that on the Thursday before Elizabeth died, Elizabeth complained to her about headaches and had scheduled an appointment with a doctor for the following week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Elizabeth's sister, Margaret Blair, testified that defendant called her later in the day on 25 November 1985 and informed her of Elizabeth's death. He said she accidentally fell down the stairs and died. Sometime near the funeral, Margaret spoke with defendant regarding the events surrounding her sister's death. Defendant told her that he and his wife had the Ratliff family over for dinner and he returned with them to help get the girls to bed and take out the trash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Margaret Blair also testified that Elizabeth had planned a trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, over the upcoming Christmas vacation. She further testified that pursuant to Elizabeth's will defendant and Patty became guardians of Martha and Margaret Ratliff. Defendant received various household goods and benefits associated with the two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On 27 November 1985 an autopsy performed by the United States military determined Elizabeth's cause of death to be \"[i]ntracranial hemorrhage, cerebellar-brain stem secondary to Von Willebrand coagulation abnormality ... [s]calp lacerations secondary to terminal fall.\" The military investigation concluded there were \"no indications of foul play.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On 14 April 2003 Elizabeth's body was exhumed and an autopsy performed by Dr. Deborah Radisch revealed contradictory findings. Dr. Radisch determined the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the head. Dr. Radisch noted multiple injuries, including marks on the head, seven distinct lacerations, and injuries to the left hand, forearm, and back. Dr. Radisch opined that the \"intracranial hemorrhages noted at the first autopsy were primarily the result of blunt trauma rather than any underlying natural disease process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred in admitting this evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b). Ultimately, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Article IV of the Rules of Evidence deals with the relevancy of evidence. Rules 401 and 402 establish the broad principle that relevant evidence - evidence that makes the existence of any fact at issue more or less probable - is admissible unless the Rules provide otherwise. Rule 403 allows the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence if, among other things, \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" Rules 404 through 412 address specific types of evidence that have generated problems. Generally, these latter Rules do not flatly prohibit the introduction of such evidence but instead limit the purpose for which it may be introduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Huddleston v.

The State concedes in its brief that the prosecutor's characterization of the State's witnesses as unbiased because they work for the State of North Carolina was \"excessive and inappropriate.\" Defendant points out that the trial court's curative instruction was given at a later point and not immediately following these comments. Thus, defendant argues, the curative instruction was incomplete and ineffective to cure prejudice from the prosecutor's personal opinions unsupported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   We cannot agree with defendant that the court's curative instruction failed to prevent prejudice from the State's remarks.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

In particular, other competent and properly admitted evidence established that the Petersons were under some degree of financial strain; that Kathleen gave defendant's e-mail address to Ms. Prislinger and that an e-mail from Ms. Prislinger was sent to this account the night of Kathleen's death, and the possibility that defendant's bi-sexual interests indicated that the Peterson marriage was less than idyllic. In light of the foregoing, we note that the evidence tainted by the impermissible warrant was merely duplicative. In addition, we held herein that the evidence surrounding Elizabeth Ratliff's death and its similarities to the circumstances of Kathleen's death was properly admitted to show the absence of accident with respect to Kathleen's death. The evidence introduced pursuant to the invalid warrant simply had no discernable effect upon the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   VII.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Defendant failed to argue in his brief the remaining assignments of error; therefore, they are deemed abandoned.

Thus, inasmuch as our legislature has uniquely empowered a judge of the North Carolina Court of Appeals to certify questions to our Supreme Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   I certify by dissent the following issues for briefing and argument before our Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   I. Where the State's brief and argument before this Court fail to show that a constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, should this Court hold the State to its burden under North Carolina General Statute section 15A-1443(b) to \"\n   <em>\n    demonstrate,\n   </em>\n   beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless.\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   II. Did the trial court properly admit (under North Carolina Rule of Evidence 404(b)) seventeen-year-old circumstantial evidence and a newly formed expert opinion on the unrelated death of Elizabeth Ratliff in Germany; if so, was it unduly prejudicial in violation of North Carolina Rule of Evidence 403; and,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   III. Were the prosecutor's improper remarks during closing arguments prejudicial to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The majority and I agree that the third search warrant in this case \"woefully fails to pass constitutional muster.\" Upon examining the State's efforts to meet its statutory burden of showing this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, I find that it fails to do so as demonstrated in its brief and oral argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I therefore conclude that Mr. Peterson is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   As the majority finds, the third search warrant was defective because the affidavit on which it was based was conclusory and thus inadequate to meet the totality of the circumstances analysis.\n   <em>\n    See Illinois v.

Therefore, we must apply the majority view in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   that a good faith exception is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Second, at oral argument, the entirety of the statements that the State made to meet its burden of demonstrating that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   [E]ven if the warrant was improperly issued for the computer [] it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because there was similar evidence that was introduced, the evidence of Brad Brent Wolgamott. That evidence . . . was found in the desk drawer. Now that may have been his desk but . . . Kathleen Peterson had her own business records in that same drawer. She had as I recall her cell phone records or telephone bill and so forth. It's mentioned in the brief, this is an issue that Mister Barnwell covered, that there was similar evidence that was in that desk drawer. Moreover, we had Brent Wolgamott's testimony and his testimony was duplicative of the things that were seized off of the computer from the second - from the second search warrant. If it's sexual images that he's talking about then there was comparable evidence that was introduced. Moreover, its not as though this was blown up, any of these images were blown up in big eight by tens or whatever like that and the defendant had thoroughly prepared during jury selection, had thoroughly prepared the defense or rather the jury to understand that there may be evidence of the defendant's bisexuality there may be homosexual evidence coming in. So in any event, I would say to the court that the material seized from the computer was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   This showing, like the showing in the State's brief, falls short of demonstrating that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Significantly, though the majority contends that the evidence derived from the constitutionally infirm search warrant was \"nothing more than repetition of other properly admitted evidence,\" it fails to note that, while there were several e-mails between Mr. Peterson and Brent Wolgamott as well as nude photographs of Brent Wolgamott found in the desk drawer, there was no other evidence presented of pornographic images and web sites. Nor does the majority address the fact that there was no other evidence presented regarding Mr. Peterson's requests for financial help for expenses for his sons and Martha Ratliff. Nor does the majority consider that there was no other evidence of an e-mail from Mr. Peterson to Ms. Peterson, sent less than a week before her death, regarding his desire to work on their marriage. Indeed, the e-mail from Helen Prislinger to Ms. Peterson the night she died would also have been inadmissible. The State used this e-mail to show that Ms. Peterson had access to Mr. Peterson's e-mail account and computer and could have accessed it just prior to her death, thus perhaps discovering evidence of Mr. Peterson's bisexuality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The record shows that there was a significant amount of evidence that could have come only from the illegally obtained computer and was not presented elsewhere by the State. The following evidence admitted at trial was seized pursuant to the unconstitutional search warrant: the testimony of Todd Markley, an expert in the field of forensic computer examination employed by CompuSleuth, Incorporated, who examined Mr. Peterson's computer; the disk drive from Mr. Peterson's computer; an e-mail from Tom Ratliff to Mr. Peterson regarding Martha's college expenses; an e-mail from Mr.\n   Peterson to Patricia Peterson regarding their sons' expenses; an e-mail from Mr. Peterson to Ms. Peterson regarding his desire for them to work on their marriage; an e-mail from Dirk Yates, who runs an Internet service for homosexual pornography, to Mr. Peterson; e-mails between Mr. Peterson and Brent Wolgamott regarding meeting for sexual services; an e-mail from Helen Prislinger to Ms. Peterson sent to Mr. Peterson's e-mail account on 8 December 2001; numerous pictures of sexual activity from Internet browsing; Todd Markley's testimony that he recovered 2500 pictures of sexual activity from Mr. Peterson's computer; list of web site addresses, many pornographic in nature, with twenty or more occurrences; Todd Markley's investigation report, which included when files were deleted from Mr. Peterson's computer; and the Internet homepage for Nine West.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Thus, contrary to the majority's finding that \"the evidence introduced pursuant to the invalid warrant was nothing more than repetition of other properly admitted evidence\" and was therefore \"merely duplicative,\" the record shows that a not insubstantial amount of evidence, some of it potentially highly inflammatory, resulted directly from the defective search warrant. The cumulative effect of this evidence was not merely \"prejudicial to the defendant in the sense that any evidence probative of the State's case is always prejudicial to the defendant,\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As the evidence in this case was interpreted differently by experts for the State and for the defense, the credibility of expert witnesses was crucial. Essentially, which experts the jury found more credible was determinative to the verdict.
