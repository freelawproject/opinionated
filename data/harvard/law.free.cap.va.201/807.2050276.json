Dykeman who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced in accordance with the verdict of the jury to one year in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">We are asked to reverse the judgment on two grounds, (1) that the defendant\u2019s plea of former jeopardy was improperly overruled; and (2) that the court erred in admitting certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\"> The record discloses that Dykeman, a twenty-year-old soldier, was involved in an automobile accident on Hampton Boulevard in the City of Norfolk, about 1:30 ami., on October 3, 1958. In the accident Frances Duncan, a passenger in the death car, was killed. The car was registered in the name of Dykeman\u2019s mother but in actuality it belonged to the defendant. At the time of the accident the car was occupied by Edward Williams, John Whitehead, Joan Brannon, the defendant, and the deceased girl Frances Duncan.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Williams and Whitehead were soldier-companions of the defendant. It is conceded that all parties involved were either under the influence of alcohol or had been drinking heavily. At the time of the accident the automobile was traveling at a rate of speed in excess of 80 miles per hour and went out of control near Hampton Boulevard bridge where it left the road and turned over several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">When the police officers arrived they found the three men outside the automobile and the two girls inside. At this time a controversy arose as to the driver\u2019s identity. Dykeman and Whitehead were immediately taken to the hospital. Williams was taken to police headquarters. At police headquarters, while under interrogation by the police officers, Williams gave a written statement (hereinafter referred to) naming the defendant as the driver of the automobile. Later Williams and the defendant were charged with both reckless driving and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">It is stated in the brief filed by the defendant that on October 17, 1958, he was tried in the Traffic Court of the City of Norfolk for reckless driving, where he was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and given twelve months in jail. He was also ordered held for action by the grand jury on the manslaughter charge and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>subsequently indicted for that offense. It is also alleged that an appeal was taken from the reckless driving conviction and he was acquitted; that at the trial on the reckless driving charge \u201cthe defendant based his defense solely and entirely upon the contention that he was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">On the 24th day of February, 1959, the defendant was brought to trial on the indictment charging him with manslaughter, at which time he filed a motion to quash the indictment based on his plea of former jeopardy. Iii this plea the defendant maintained that since the jury had acquitted him of reckless driving based on the theory that he was not the driver of the death vehicle he was being twice tried for the same offense. The motion was overruled and exception noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">This ruling brings under review the first question presented, <em>i.e., </em>was the defendant\u2019s plea of former jeopardy improperly overruled?</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Our conclusion is that the court properly overruled the motion. In the first place, an examination of the record indicates that there is no copy of the warrant in the reckless driving case contained in the record and this in itself would preclude us from reviewing the alleged error for we are unable to ascertain the exact charges placed against Dykeman in the prosecution by the City of Norfolk. <em>Burford </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>179 Va. 752, 20 S. E. 2d 509. But even if a copy of the warrant were in the record the defendant\u2019s acquittal on the reckless driving charge would not constitute a bar to his prosecution on the involuntary manslaughter charge. Reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter are two separate and distinct offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">The defendant is attempting to come within the protection given by the first sentence of Code, \u00a7 19-232, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\">\u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, or of two or more municipal ordinances, or of one or more statutes and also one or more ordinances, conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">This statute deals with a \u201cconviction\u201d. Dykeman was found not guilty on the reckless driving charge and therefore the section does not apply. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>129 Va. 757, 759, 105 S. E. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">The defendant next contends that the Commonwealth was barred from prosecuting him because of the protection afforded by Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u201cHe shall not be deprived of life or liberty, except by the law of the land or the judgment of his peers; nor be compelled in any criminal proceeding to give evidence against himself, nor be put twice in jeopardy for the' same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">As heretofore stated, reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter are two separate and distinct offenses. The City of Norfolk was prosecuting Dykeman on the reckless driving charge under its ordinance in the first instance, whereas the Commonwealth of Virginia was prosecuting him on the involuntary manslaughter charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">It is manifest that two separate and distinct offenses may arise out of the same occurrence. <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 449, 451, 69 S. E. 2d 336, 337, 338; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>181 Va. 582, 26 S. E. 2d 54; 15 Am. Jur., Criminal Law, \u00a7 390, pp. 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">This brings us to the second assignment of error, <em>i.e., </em>the court erred in admitting certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">This question is paraphrased by the defendant as follows: \u201cDid the court err in allowing a written statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, Edward Williams, to be read to the jury, when he, Williams, was present in court and available to testify? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">The admission of this statement arose in the following manner: Detective Woods of the Norfolk police department was on the witness stand. The detective testified that when Dykeman was returned from the hospital \u201che came into the Homicide office where Detective O\u2019Neal, Williams, and myself were. We told Dykeman that he had been implicated by Williams in his statement in the operation of the vehicle in which Frances Duncan was killed. * # * We asked him did he have any statement to make regarding the accident. He said that he did not know anything about the accident, that he was asleep. * * *\u201d The statement was then, at the request of the officers, read by Williams to Dykeman, after which Dykeman stated \u201che did not remember anything after the accident.\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">The officer was then asked to read the Williams statement to the jury, at which time the attorney for the defendant vigorously objected to the statement being introduced in evidence, asserting that Williams was present in court and could testify as to what transpired, and that the statement was purely hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">The objection was overruled by the court, exception noted, and Detective Woods was ordered to read the statement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>We hold that the admission of the statement under the circumstances was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The general rule is that when a statement accusing one of the commission of an offense is made in his presence and hearing and is not denied, both the statement and the fact of his failure to deny are admissible in a criminal proceeding against him as evidence of his acquiescence in its truth. It is based on the.theory that the natural reaction of one accused of crime is to deny the accusation if it is unjust or untrue. The accusation and his silence thereunder to be admissible must, however, have been under such circumstances as would naturally call for a reply or denial and such as would afford a favorable opportunity for denial. The character of the incriminating statement made to the accused would render it inadmissible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>hearsay except for the fact that the statement is not offered in evidence as proof of a fact asserted but as a predicate to the showing of' the reaction of the accused thereto. In all instances caution must be exercised in receiving evidence of a statement made to the accused and his failure to deny it. The test is whether men similarly situated would have felt themselves called upon to deny the statements affecting them in the event they did not intend to express acquiescence by their failure to do so. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 196 </em>Va. 433, 436, 83 S. E. 2d 738, 740; 20 Am. Jur., Evidence, \u00a7 570, pp. 483, 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In this instance Williams was present in court and could testify as to what transpired and thus have been subjected to cross-examination. It will be observed that when the statement was read to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>accused his reply was \u201cI do not remember\u201d. Such answer can neither be construed as remaining silent nor admitting guilt. It will also be observed that there is much in the statement dealing with matters other than who was the driver of the death car. Jurors tend to accord added significance to the exhibition of a written statement. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Morris, Administratrix, </em>200 Va. 413, 417, 105 S. E. 2d 829, 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The admission of statements such as here contended for by the Commonwealth is fully discussed in <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 689, 43 S. E. 2d 895. We adhere to the views there expressed. However, that case is readily distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In this instance the defendant did not remain silent, neither did he admit his guilt. His answer was \u201cI do not remember.\u201d He has consistently contended that he was not the driver of the death car.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Under the related circumstances the statement was hearsay and improperly admitted. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra; Plymale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>195 Va. 582, 592, 79 S. E. 2d 610, 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">For the reasons stated the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-12\"> Statement of Edward Williams, RA 17436580, white male, in regard to the fatal accident in which Frances Duncan, white female, eighteen, died as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>accident at the intersection of Hampton Boulevard and Claude Lane, approximately l:4i a.m., October 3, 1958, as made to Detectives M.

We were arguing with Keri about his driving. On the far side of the overpass, on the downhill side of the bridge, Dykeman left the controls of the car. We were going approximately 80 miles an hour. I told Dykeman to slow down or either stop the car and let me drive, and Fran said the same thing. We argued for about a minute. Ir does not take you any time to go down the bridge. He said \u201cTo hell with it, you drive,\u201d and left the wheel. He got away from the wheel and came over to where I was on the far side of the car. I told him to get back to the wheel, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>he said, \u201cTo hell with it\u201d again. We hit the wedge, the telephone pole and the guy wire, then the shrubbery, and wound up alongside the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Question: While you were in this group how much had you people had to drink?</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Answer: Over a fifth of Vodka and a six-pak of beer.- It was five cans of beer and at least a fifth of Vodka; well over a fifth of Vodka and a six-pak of beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Question: Who was the first person out of the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Answer: I was.

That is the reason I had to come through the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Question: How did you get on the left hand side of the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">Answer: I could not say. I don\u2019t know.
