Lawson, each containing two counts. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>indictment charged him with forging and uttering a check for $100, and the other with forging and uttering a check for $400, Code \u00a7 18-26. Qn his trial to a jury, the two cases being heard together, he was found guilty on both indictments and sentenced to two years in the penitentiary on each, the sentences to run concurrently. We granted him a writ of error to determine his complaint that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was not sufficient to sustain either of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Both of the checks were made by J. W. King, Broker, to the order of Rachel L. Taylor. Her name was endorsed by Lawson on the back of each check and immediately under her name he signed his own name and wrote his address. He cashed both checks and received the money. The issue is whether the evidence offered by the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had no authority from Mrs. Taylor to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The Commonwealth called Mrs. Taylor as its witness to furnish the essential proof of defendant\u2019s lack of authority to endorse her name on the checks. She was obviously a reluctant witness and many of her answers were in response to leading questions. The material parts of her testimony may be stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">She had a contingent interest in some property in Roanoke owned by her husband, from whom she had been divorced. J. W. King, a broker, was effecting a sale of the property and had offered $100 for the release of her interest. Prior to that time Mrs. Taylor had been employed part time in Lawson\u2019s office doing secretarial work over a period of about two years. She engaged Lawson to take care of the matter and he was able to secure an offer of $500 for her interest. He communicated this offer to her in Maryland; she came to Roanoke, signed the contract of sale, and on August 13, 1958, went with Lawson to King\u2019s home where Lawson delivered the contract while she waited in the car. At that time King delivered to Lawson the $100 check payable to Rachel L. Taylor. Soon afterwards a deed for the property was executed and delivered and on August 21, 1958, King gave to Lawson the additional check for $400, payable to Rachel L. Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">As stated, Lawson endorsed the name of Rachel L. Taylor on each of these checks and got the money but did not tell her that he had received either the checks or the money. For two weeks after the contract was signed she did not work for Lawson but after that period she went back and continued working for him until about November 7, and in that period she asked Lawson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>several times about the money she was to receive and he would tell her that the deal had not gone through \u201cor something or another.\u201d In November she found out from King that the transaction had been completed and he showed her the two checks which had been paid to Lawson on or within a day or two after their dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Mrs. Taylor was then asked, \u201cDid you ever authorize or tell anyone that they could sign your name to these checks?\u201d She replied, \u201cWell, I imagine he was taking care of the matter. I felt that he probably should have. # * # He probably should have signed them if I owed him the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Again the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked, \u201cState whether or not you ever authorized anyone, or did you give anyone the power or the authority to sign your name to these checks?\u201d Again she answered, \u201cWell, Mr. Crush, I authorized him to look into this matter by going there and taking care of it and I imagine it would all pertain to the same thing.\u201d She explained that Lawson advised her that the $100 offer for her interest was too small and when due to his efforts it was increased to $500 it was understood between them that they would divide that sum. After she signed the contract he gave her $70 at one time and $30 at another, but she did not then know this was money from the sale of the property but \u201che may have told me that the deal had gone through or stated it was the money against my property and I probably didn\u2019t hear him.\u201d She said that due to her deafness she did not always understand what was being said to her, and that Lawson could have said when he gave her the money that it was for her interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">She testified further that Lawson had made advancements to her in other instances when she did not fully understand from him the source of the money or for what purpose it was given to her. She said also that Lawson had agreed to pay a $200 dental bill for her which she could repay by her work, and she thought he had also paid some medical bills when she was in a hospital for an operation. She also could not say that she had paid in full his fee for investigative work in connection with her divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">She was asked whether she had ever received from Lawson an accounting for the $500 represented by the two checks and her answer was, \u201cWell, speaking of what money he had paid me and everything now, I think it\u2019s accumulating more than that.\u201d When the question was repeated she said again, \u201cWell, he had advanced me money periodically. When I now had time to think it over, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>has accumulated to that amount\u2014maybe more.\u201d It may be inferred that she referred here to the fact that on November 12, 1958, she made complaint and information under oath to the Judge of the Roanoke Municipal Court that Lawson did, on or about August 21, 1958, \u201cfeloniously take and receive money in the sum of $500.00, as an agent for Rachel L. Taylor, and convert the said money to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">After the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney several times had failed to get from her a statement that she had not authorized Lawson to endorse her name on the checks, he asked her whether that was her signature on the checks. She replied that she did not sign them herself. He then asked, \u201cDid you give anyone permission to sign it for you?\u201d She answered, \u201cWell, Mr. Crush, I feel like he was taking care of the transaction in the house matter; he was entitled to do-to take what action was necessary\u2014whatever action was necessary.\u201d In a further effort to get a specific answer these questions were asked and these answers made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cQ. Now, I\u2019m not asking that you told him to handle the transaction; I\u2019m asking, did you ever tell him in words to the effect, \u2018You sign my name,\u2019 or words to that effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t recall but anyway, Mr. Crush, I had written him from Maryland and it seems like I did mention something in the letter, \u2018Would he take care of the matter.\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether I stated to sign my name or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cQ. Then I\u2019m asking you again, do you have any recollection of ever having told him to sign your name; do you recall doing it? If you don\u2019t remember, say so; if you do, say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201cQ. Ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-11\">\u201cA. I do not remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">J. W. King and a Captain of detectives also testified for the Commonwealth but their evidence added nothing to the point of tvhether Lawson had authority to endorse the name of Mrs. Taylor on the checks. The defendant moved that the court strike the evidence of the Commonwealth, the motion Avas overruled and he offered no evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">The court instructed the jury that the burden was on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not have authority to endorse the name of Rachel L. Taylor on the two checks in question. There was no objection to the instruction and it is not controverted here that it correctly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the burden of proof. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>114 Neb. 257, 207 N. W. 207; <em>Owen </em>v. <em>People, </em>118 Colo. 415, 195 P. 2d 953; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State, </em>Tex. Cr. App., 53 S. W. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In the last-named case Roberts was charged with forging the name of one Polly to an order for the purchase of alcohol. Polly testified he did not write the order or authorize Roberts to do so, \u201cthat he had any recollection of.\u201d The conviction of Roberts was reversed on the ground that Polly did not swear positively that he did not give Roberts authority, but that the substance of his testimony was that he did not recollect whether he did or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The evidence against Lawson was not sufficient to support the burden of proof resting on the Commonwealth. Admittedly Lawson signed the name of Mrs. Taylor on the checks, but without more the presumption is that he did so by the authority of Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor would not testify that he did not have such authority. The general tenor of her testimony was that he probably did have authority, or that possibly she had given him express authority, but at best she did not remember whether she had or not. At the time she swore out the warrant charging him with embezzlement she evidently believed that Lawson had received and possessed money that belonged to her, but in her testimony she indicated that she had changed her mind about that and was rather of opinion that he had a right to have it. Her evidence in this case was too indefinite and uncertain to warrant Lawson\u2019s conviction of the charges in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The judgments appealed from are accordingly reversed and the cases are remanded for new trials if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
