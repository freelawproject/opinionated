John F. Kidder was the president of the defendant corporation. During his lifetime George Fletcher, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, was secretary of the corporation. From time to time Kidder acquired stock of the corporation and upon the surrender of the old certificates caused the new certificates to be issued in the name of \u201cJohn F. Kidder, Trustee.\u201d George Fletcher died upon March 6, 1901, and John F. Kidder, who had been very ill for about a year immediately preceding his death, died upon April 10, 1901. The complaint is surprisingly deficient in its averments as to the nature of the trust. It neither sets up any agreement showing the existence of a voluntary trust, nor does it set up the payment by George Fletcher of any part of the purchase price of the stocks so acquired by Kidder, but contents itself with allegations to the effect that on such and such a day \u201csaid John F. Kidder and said George Fletcher became the owners of certificate,\u201d etc. It is alleged further only that the certificates issued to John F. Kidder as trustee were so issued to him as trustee for himself and George Fletcher. After trial the court found against the existence of the trust and rendered judgment accordingly. From the order denying his motion for a new trial plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Upon the appeal it is argued that the word \u201ctrustee\u201d on the stock certificates held by John F. Kidder, was evidence of ownership outside of Kidder himself. Authorities from other states are cited to this effect, but the rule is here to the contrary. \u201cThe mere addition of the word \u2018trustee\u2019 after the name in the certificate is not in this state of itself, nothing more appearing, to be deemed constructive notice of the equities of the secret owner of the stock.\u201d <em>(Brewster </em>v. <em>Sime, 42 </em>Cal. 144; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Toland, </em>48 Cal. 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Certain entries on the books of the corporation, which entries were made by George Fletcher, secretary of the corporation, were refused admission in evidence. Thus, in the Stock Ledger and Assessment book in the account of \u201cJohn F. Kidder, Trustee,\u201d is found heading a list of stock the words \u201cStock owned jointly by John F. Kidder and George Fletcher.\u201d In the Stock Transfer book is a like entry. The ruling was proper. These were not entries like those considered in <em>Mountain Water Works Co. </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>49 Colo. 412, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>[113 Pac. 501], where the entries were such as the secretary in the performance of his duty was required to make, and where it was held that under these circumstances the fact that they were in the secretary\u2019s handwriting did not forbid their admission in evidence in his favor. Here the entries were not such as the secretary was required to make, had no proper place in the books where they were entered, and the effort to prove them amounted to no more than an effort to prove self-serving declarations by hearsay. (See Civ. Code, sec. 378.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The only other evidence to establish this trust is that of George H. Fletcher, corroborated by John H. Goughian, ticket agent and assistant to the auditor of the railroad company. Mr. Fletcher\u2019s testimony is that a few days after his father\u2019s death, on March 10, 1901, he called upon Mr. Kidder, who was in bed and very ill, and had with him the following conversation :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cHow do you do, Mr. Kidder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cHow do you do, Herbert? Herbert, I intend to place this whole matter in the hands of the probate judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-8\">\u201cMr. Kidder, how much of this \u2018trust\u2019 stock did my father own?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">\u201cHe owned 838 shares.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">\u201cWhere is that stock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-11\">\u201cIn Wells Fargo\u2019s bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Goughian testifies that he heard Mr. Kidder say: \u201cYes, Herbert, half of that stock is your father\u2019s.\u201d Mr. Kidder at the time of this conversation was very ill, was on his death bed, and died thirty days thereafter. This is absolutely all of the evidence in the case, saving that Goughian also testifies that in 1900, when a difference arose between Mr. Kidder and Mr. Fletcher because Mr. Kidder had from the east telegraphed for ten thousand dollars with which to buy cars and the money had not been sent, Kidder upon his return declared to Fletcher: \u201cI want my orders obeyed\u201d and Fletcher replied \u201cI have as much to say as you, and we didn\u2019t have the money and I didn\u2019t send it.\u201d It is thus made to appear that no facts and circumstances going to the creation of a trust are in evidence, no pretense is made that Fletcher ever paid any part of the purchase price of the stock, thus raising an involuntary trust in' his favor, nothing is shown to establish any equity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the claim of Fletcher, and the whole case, so far as the establishment of the trust is concerned, rests upon the asserted acknowledgment of it made by a very sick man a few days before his death. From its findings the court manifestly concluded that this, to its mind, was not the clear and convincing evidence without which such a trust\u2014particularly after the death of the asserted trustee\u2014should not be declared. It follows herefrom that there were no errors and that the evidence supports the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The order appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Melvin, J., and Lorigan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
