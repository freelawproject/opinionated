E. 2d, 209), this court affirmed the conviction of the defendant for an assault with intent to rape. In the present case, the same defendant has appealed to this court from a judgment of the same co\u00fcrt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>denying an extraordinary motion for new trial growing out of that same case. The extraordinary motion is based solely on the ground of newly discovered evidence. The gist of such evidence, which is contained in the affidavit of Theron Aldridge, is that he (Aldridge) was an employee of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and was present at the time the prosecutrix made her complaint to G. H. Lunceford, Sheriff of Wilkes County, that the defendant, a taxicab driver, had taken her beyond her stated destination; and, that\u2014after the prosecutrix had finished talking to the sheriff, in which conversation no mention was made by the prosecutrix of any improper remarks having been made by the defendant or his having made any attempt to have sexual intercourse with her forcibly and against her will\u2014he (Aldridge) asked the prosecutrix, \u201cDid the driver place his hands on your person?\u201d to which she replied, \u201cHe did not\u201d; that to his question, \u201cHow did your clothing get torn?\u201d she replied, \u201cThe clothing was torn when I jumped from the taxi\u201d; and to his question, \u201cDid the driver of the taxi make any proposals to you to have sexual relations with him?\u201d she replied, \u201cNo, the only thing he said to me was, \u2018We are going to Whitehall,\u2019 when I asked him if we were going on the right road.\u201d Aldridge also swore that, although counsel or the defendant made inquiry of him concerning the complaint by the prosecutrix to the sheriff when he was present, he did not tell counsel of the prosecutrix\u2019s denial of any overt action toward her by the defendant until after his conviction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b393-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>C\u00e1eosle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEE\">Where, upon an extraordinary motion for a new trial in a criminal case, based solely on the ground of newly discovered evidence, the State makes a counter-showing, and the. trial court, as trior of the facts, is authorized to find from the affidavits and evidence submitted that the evidence was not newly discovered, but even if newly discovered, was merely impeaching in character, and there otherwise appears no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion, its judgment denying the extraordinary motion will not be disturbed by this court on appeal. <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>State, </em>93 <em>Ga. </em>304 (20 S.

The State also submitted a copy of the cross-examination of the prosecutrix by defendant\u2019s counsel on the trial of the charge of assault with intent to rape, which, having been reported in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, will not be repeated here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
