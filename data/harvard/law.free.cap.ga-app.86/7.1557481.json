The defendant filed a plea in bar, alleging: that the commissions sued for were due for sales by the plaintiffs, as brokers for the defendant, of cotton futures contracts; that the plaintiffs were thereby dealing in securities; that, during the period in which the sales were made, the plaintiffs were not licensed as dealers in securities as provided by Title 97 of the Code of Georgia; that at the time the defendant did not know that the plaintiffs were not so licensed; that dealing in securities without having first obtained a license as provided by the Code constituted a crime in Georgia, and that therefore the plaintiffs were not entitled to any commissions. The defendant also filed a cross-action for the commissions already paid to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer to the plea in bar and the cross-action was sustained, the plea and cross-action were dismissed, and the defendant excepted pendente lite. On the trial of the case the jury found for the plaintiffs, and a judgment was entered accordingly. The defendant assigns error on its exception pendente lite and on the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-5\">Eelton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXQ\">Code \u00a7 97-102 defines a \u201cdealer\u201d as used in Title 97 of the Code as one \u201cwho deals in futures or differences in market quotations of prices or values <em>of securities </em>or accepts margins on purchases or sales or pretended purchases or sales <em>of securities.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Therefore, one who deals in commodity futures such as cotton futures is not a dealer in securities as defined by Code \u00a7 97-102, and is not required to be licensed under Title 97 of the Code in order to carry on the business of trading in cotton futures; and, in view of this, the court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to and in striking the plea in bar and cross-action, and in allowing the case to proceed to trial and judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A_z\">\n<em>Sutton, C.J., and Worrill, J., concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
