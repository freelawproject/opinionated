Pledger was indicted for an assault with intent to murder Willie Lee Kelly, but upon the trial was found guilty of stabbing him. The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, based upon the usual general grounds and one special ground, was overruled and he excepted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-12\">In his brief, on appeal to this court, counsel for the defendant expressly abandoned all assignments of error except that contained in the one special ground to the effect that the trial court erred in reproving a witness for the defendant during the following examination of that witness as to the reputation of the prosecuting witness:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-13\">\u201cQ.

Yes, sir, he married Marion\u2019s wife\u2019s daughter. Q. Do you know his reputation for peace or violence? A. Yes, sir. Q. Is it good or bad? A. About the worst I have ever known.
