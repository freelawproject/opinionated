L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a), </em>and its application to acts of cyberharassment among others. Specifically, we consider whether a pattern of harassing conduct that includes both communications made directly to the targets of the harassment and false communications made to third parties through Internet postings solely for the purpose of encouraging those parties also to engage in harassing conduct toward the targets can be constitutionally proscribed by the statute. We also consider whether, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the extent that this pattern of conduct includes speech, that speech is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or is unprotected speech integral to the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The defendants, William and Gail Johnson, were both convicted of criminal harassment. William<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was also convicted of making a false, or \u201cfrivolous,\u201d report of child abuse, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (c). Among other things, the defendants\u2019 conduct included posting information about the victims online along with false statements about items that the victims allegedly either had for sale or were giving away, with the object of encouraging unwitting third parties to repeatedly contact and harass the victims at their home and on their telephone. The defendants also anonymously sent hostile and ominous communications directly to the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">William claims that the criminal harassment statute is facially unconstitutional, arguing that it regulates protected speech and does not provide sufficient notice of the type of conduct that is proscribed. Additionally, both defendants argue that the statute is-unconstitutional as applied to their conduct because they did not engage in \u201cfighting words,\u201d an unprotected category of speech that we held could be constitutionally proscribed under the statute in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80 (2005), abrogated on another ground by <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Borowski, </em>461 Mass. 415 (2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, both defendants contend that their conduct did not meet the statutory requirements because their actions were not actually directed at the victims and there was inadequate evidence that their conduct caused any serious alarm to the victims. We conclude that the Legislature drafted a sufficiently specific statute that is not unconstitutional on its face; that the defendants\u2019 conduct included speech that was not protected by the First Amendment, but rather was integral to criminal conduct; and, accordingly, that the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to the defendants. We also conclude that the defendants\u2019 conduct as established at trial met all of the statutory requirements for a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts that the jury could have found, reserving certain details for our analysis of the issues raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>on appeal. The victims, James \u201cJim\u201d J. Lyons, Jr., and his wife, Bernadette, have lived on the same street as the defendants in Andover since around 2000. In 2003, the defendants acquired a tract of land abutting the Lyonses\u2019 property and intended to subdivide and develop it. The Lyonses, along with other neighbors, objected to the proposed development and years of litigation ensued between the parties. By 2008, the relationship between the families had become strained and communication between them was infrequent.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Gerald Colton, a childhood friend of the Johnsons, did not know the Lyons family prior to 2008. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, William hired Colton to work as a handyman on an hourly basis and to identify lots for potential real estate development. If William later developed a lot Colton had identified, Colton would collect a finder\u2019s fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In either late February or early March, 2008, William telephoned Colton and enlisted him to play a series of \u201cpranks\u201d on Jim. The ideas for these \u201cpranks\u201d were generated in several ways: (1) William would directly instruct Colton or convey ideas through Gail; (2) the Johnsons would provide information about the Lyons family to Colton so that he could use this information to harass them; or (3) the Johnsons would prompt Colton to think of ideas.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Over the course of thirty-five days in late March and early April, 2008, the defendants, directly and through Colton, engaged in a series of acts directed at the Lyons family. The Commonwealth alleged four separate acts of harassment in addition to the false report of child abuse, and Colton was called as its key witness at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The first alleged act occurred on March 18, 2008, when Colton posted from his computer an advertisement that appeared on the Internet site \u201cCraigslist.\u201d The advertisement provided the Lyonses\u2019 home telephone number and address and stated that there were free golf carts available at this location on a \u201cfirst come, first serve\u201d basis. The Lyonses did not own any golf carts and had never used Craigslist. When Bernadette arrived home at 2:30 p.m. that same day, there were strangers in both her driveway and on the street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>near her home. These individuals informed her about the advertisement and explained that they were looking for golf carts. In total, about thirty to forty people arrived at the Lyonses\u2019 house that afternoon, causing Bernadette to be \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cfearful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">When Jim arrived home later that evening, he telephoned the police, as Bernadette was in a state of \u201cuneasiness\u201d and Jim felt the incident was \u201creally unusual\u201d and \u201cbizarre.\u201d Andover police Sergeant Chad Cooper responded and advised Jim to contact Craigslist to remove the advertisement and get the Internet protocol address for the computer that posted it. In Sergeant Cooper\u2019s presence, Jim received numerous telephone calls from people inquiring about the golf carts. When William learned that the Craigslist advertisement had been removed, he asked Colton to \u201cput it back up\u201d and Colton complied. After reposting, Colton testified that he and William \u201claughed\u201d about it and Colton said that he would post another advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The second alleged act occurred on March 19, when Colton posted a different Craigslist advertisement, selling \u201cmy late son\u2019s\u201d motorcycle and directing interested parties to call Jim on his cellular telephone after 10 p.m.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Colton then told William about the posting. That night, Jim received \u201cnon-stop\u201d telephone calls regarding the advertisement, approximately twenty every ten minutes. Sergeant Cooper responded again. These late night calls continued for months after the posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The third alleged act occurred one week later on March 26, when Colton sent an electronic mail (e-mail) message to the Lyonses from a fictitious account. The subject of the message read, \u201cIt\u2019s just a game for me,\u201d and the text stated, \u201cLet The Games Begin!\u201d The message contained Jim and Bernadette\u2019s personal identifying information, including names, home telephone number and address, Social Security numbers, e-mail address, bank name and location, and Jim\u2019s date of birth and cellular telephone number. At the bottom, the message stated: \u201cRemember, if you aren\u2019t miserable, I oint happy! Let\u2019s Play.\u201d Colton testified that Gail had sent him an e-mail message with the Lyonses\u2019 personal information.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The following evening, William arrived at Colton\u2019s home and told Colton that he wanted to call and \u201cturn [Jim] in.\u201d William had a piece of paper with a hotline telephone number written on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>it and proceeded to use Colton\u2019s home telephone to call the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to file a false report alleging child abuse by Jim. William later telephoned Colton to report that a police cruiser and another vehicle were at the Lyonses\u2019 home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Investigator Carrie Riley of the DCF testified that an after-hours \u201cchild abuse hotline\u201d had received a call from someone using fictitious information and reporting that Jim was physically abusing his son. Riley and another investigator arrived at the Lyonses\u2019 home at 10:30 p.m. and said they had to examine their son. Jim testified that he and Bernadette were \u201cpanicked\u201d and \u201cfrightened,\u201d but that, acting on the advice of their attorney, he awakened their son and permitted Riley to inspect him. Riley examined his body for marks and bruises. The DCF case was closed as the son denied any abuse and the investigators found no signs of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The fourth alleged act occurred on April 3, 2008, when Colton sent another anonymous e-mail message to the Lyonses from another fictitious e-mail account. The subject line was \u201cBrian,\u201d and the text read, \u201cWhat have you done James? . . . or . . . Why James? You stole the innocence of a young man.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Jim received a letter by postal mail purportedly sent from an individual named \u201cBrian.\u201d Brian claimed to have worked for Jim when he was fifteen years of age, accused Jim of sexually molesting him as a teenager, and threatened to press charges against him. Colton testified that William told Colton that he had sent the letter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even though the allegations were false, reading the letter was \u201cvery tough\u201d and \u201cabsolutely alarmed [Jim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Throughout this entire time period, Colton consistently kept in contact with both defendants, letting them know what he was doing or had done to the Lyons family. William and Gail acquiesced to Colton\u2019s conduct and encouraged him to do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\"><em>Procedural history. </em>Police traced the relevant Internet activity back to Colton, who was charged on June 5, 2008, with stalking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and identity fraud. Colton spent seventeen days in jail before posting bail. On August 14,2008, Colton made a statement taking responsibility for the Internet postings and e-mail messages and implicating the defendants in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On October 16, 2008, the Johnsons were charged in Lawrence District Court with making a false report of child abuse (G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A [c]); identity fraud (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37E); conspiracy (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 7); and criminal harassment (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A [a]). Colton entered into a written plea agreement with the Commonwealth in exchange for his testimony against the Johnsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">During pretrial proceedings, the defendants filed motions to dismiss, asserting that (1) the Commonwealth failed to provide discovery; (2) there was no probable cause that the defendants had committed any crime; (3) the destruction of evidence caused by the Commonwealth warranted dismissal; (4) the defendants\u2019 right to a speedy trial was violated; (5) venue for the charge of making a false report was improper; and (6) there was prosecu-torial misconduct. All of these motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the Johnsons moved for required findings of not guilty on all of the charges. The judge entered a finding of not guilty on the charge of identity fraud, but denied the defendants\u2019 motion in all other respects. The judge also denied the defendants\u2019 motion at the close of all of the evidence. The charge of conspiracy was dismissed at the Commonwealth\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">On December 1, 2011, a jury convicted the defendants of criminal harassment and convicted William of making a false report of child abuse. On the harassment charge, William was sentenced to two and one-half years in the house of correction, eighteen months to be served with the balance suspended until December 1, 2014, with probation conditions; on the charge of making a false report of child abuse, he was fined $1,000. Gail was sentenced to two years in the house of correction, six months to be served with the balance suspended until December 1, 2014, with probation conditions, and fined $1,000. We transferred the defendants\u2019 appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the defendants make multiple claims of error regarding the Commonwealth\u2019s compliance with discovery rules, alleged prosecutorial misconduct, choice of venue, evidentiary rulings at trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, statements made in closing argument, and the right to a speedy trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>We conclude that the judge\u2019s rulings were correct and these claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">We begin, however, with a discussion of the defendants\u2019 challenges to the constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A (a) (\u00a7 43A [a]), both facial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and as applied to them. Such constitutional challenges are questions of law that we review de nova. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 Mass. 291, 301 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">A criminal conviction under \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>requires proof that \u201c(1) the defendant engaged in a knowing pattern of conduct or speech, or series of acts, on at least three separate occasions; (2) the defendant intended to target the victim with the harassing conduct or speech, or series of acts, on each occasion; (3) the conduct or speech, or series of acts, were of such a nature that they seriously alarmed the victim; (4) the conduct or speech, or series of acts, were of such a nature that they would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress; and (5) the defendant committed the conduct or speech, or series of acts, \u2018willfully and maliciously\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>462 Mass. 236, 240 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Although this court has previously construed the criminal harassment statute, it has not yet considered its application to the type of conduct at issue here. An analysis of whether the defendants\u2019 actions amounted to criminal harassment necessarily includes the consideration whether their conduct satisfied the statutory requirements and whether they engaged in constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">1. <em>Facial challenge. </em>William argues that \u00a7 43A (a) is both unconstitutionally overbroad and vagu\u00e9. He contends that the statute is dangerously susceptible of application to constitutionally protected speech and is so vague that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits. His challenge fails on two accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">First, the claim is raised for the first time on appeal, and consequently is waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 632-633 (1989). Although, as the defendant notes in his reply brief, we are nevertheless not prevented from considering his claim, we \u201crarely exercise[]\u201d this power and only do so in instances where a \u201cserious and obvious\u201d mistake poses a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 94-95 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Second, the challenge fails because the statute is neither over-broad nor vague. William bears the burden of showing \u201c \u2018from the text of [the law] and from actual fact\u2019 . . . that substantial overbreadth exists\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Virginia </em>v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 122 (2003). As an initial matter, \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>is a statute directed at a course of conduct, rather than speech, \u201cand the conduct it proscribes is \u2018not necessarily associated with speech\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrovic, </em>701 F.3d 849, 856 (8th Cir. 2012) (considering similar statute). In particular, \u00a7 43A (a) specifically criminalizes \u201ca knowing pattern of <em>conduct </em>or series of <em>acts . </em>. . directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress\u201d (emphases added). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Osinger, </em>753 F.3d 939, 944 (9th Cir. 2014), when considering a similar statute, because \u00a7 43A (a) \u201cproscribes harassing and intimidating conduct, the statute is not facially invalid under the First Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Further, as the statute requires both malicious intent on behalf of the perpetrator and substantial harm to the victim, \u201cit is difficult to imagine what constitutionally-protected speech would fall under these statutory prohibitions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Petrovic, </em>701 F.3d at 856. Contrary to William\u2019s claim, the statutory elements such as \u201cseriously alarms\u201d \u201care not esoteric or complicated terms devoid of common understanding.\u201d <em>Osinger, supra </em>at 945. Rather, these elements are similar to those that have led courts in other jurisdictions to uphold their criminal harassment statutes as constitutionally permissible. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>207 Ariz. 231 (Ct. App. 2004); <em>Bouters </em>v. <em>State, </em>659 So. 2d 235 (Fla.), cert, denied, 516 U.S. 894 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Together the component parts of the statute provide adequate notice and safeguards to prevent its application to protected speech. Contrary to William\u2019s claim that the statute leaves it to the hearer of the speech to determine what conduct is criminal, the Commonwealth must prove that a defendant knew he or she was engaged in a pattern of conduct that <em>intentionally </em>targeted a victim for the purpose of harassment with acts of such a nature that they would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress. This scienter requirement undermines William\u2019s claim that he could be liable under \u00a7 43 A <em>(a) </em>if his actions were accidental and that putative harassers are at the mercy of a hearer\u2019s sensitivities. Moreover, William has offered no mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ingful evidence to show that the statute has a real and substantial deterrent on protected speech or that it actually denies fair notice of what conduct is proscribed. The required elements are clearly delineated such that \u00a7 43A (a) leaves no putative harassers wondering what is prohibited. Accordingly, William\u2019s facial challenge to \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">2. <em>As-applied challenge. </em>The defendants\u2019 as-applied constitutional challenge also fails because the conduct in question was not protected speech, but rather a hybrid of conduct and speech integral to the commission of a crime. Accordingly, \u00a7 43A <em>(a), </em>as applied to the defendants, does not implicate constitutionally protected speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u201c[I]t has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sayer, </em>748 F.3d 425, 433 (1st Cir. 2014), quoting <em>Giboney </em>v. <em>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., </em>336 U.S. 490, 502 (1949). The defendants do not claim that creating fictitious Internet postings and sending a letter falsely accusing someone of a crime constitute legal conduct. Their conduct served solely to harass the Lyonses by luring numerous strangers and prompting incessant late-night telephone calls to their home by way of false representations, by overtly and aggressively threatening to misuse their personal identifying information, and by falsely accusing Jim of a serious crime. Where the sole purpose of the defendants\u2019 speech was to further their endeavor to intentionally harass the Lyonses, such speech is not protected by the First Amendment. \u201cThe [F]irst [A]mendment does not provide a defense to a criminal charge simply because the actor uses words to carry out his illegal purpose.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>667 F.2d 835, 842 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In this respect, we are guided by the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court and several circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals. In <em>Giboney, </em>336 U.S. at 498, cited with approval in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S. 460,468-469 (2010), the United States Supreme Court held that speech or writing used as an integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute is not protected by the First Amendment. Following the holding in <em>Giboney, </em>in <em>Sayer, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the defendant\u2019s posting of fictitious Craigslist advertisements to induce anonymous third parties seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ing casual sexual encounters to harass the victim amounted to unprotected speech integral to the criminal conduct proscribed by the Federal cyberstalking statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2261A (2012 &amp; Supp. I 2013).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 748 F.3d at 433-434.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Similarly, in <em>Petrovic, </em>701 F.3d at 854-856, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded that \u00a7 2261A was properly applied to a defendant who created a Web site with links to images of the victim nude or engaged in sex acts with him, where the sole purpose of the communications was to carry out the defendant\u2019s threats to harass and humiliate the victim if she ended their sexual relationship. As integral to the commission of the crime of cyberstalking, the defendant\u2019s communication, although speech, fell outside the purview of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The speech here, much as the speech at issue in <em>Giboney, Sayer, </em>and <em>Petrovic, </em>was also \u201cintegral to criminal conduct,\u201d serving only to implement the defendants\u2019 purpose to harass and cause substantial emotional distress to the Lyonses in violation of \u00a7 43A (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants point to no lawful purpose of their \u201ccommunications\u201d that would take them outside of the exception delineated in <em>Giboney. </em>To the extent that any of the harassing contacts were composed of words, they were used \u201cso close in time and purpose to a substantive evil as to become part of the ultimate crime itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>761 F.2d 549, 552 (9th Cir. 1985), cert, denied, 476 U.S. 1120 (1986). In such instances, \u201cwhere speech becomes an integral part of the crime, a First Amendment defense is foreclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the content of the speech in question certainly affected the Lyonses, much of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>alarming impact was the product of the frightening number, frequency, and type of harassing contacts with which the defendants bombarded the Lyonses. In these circumstances, the application of \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>to the defendants fully withstands constitutional scrutiny.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Nonetheless, the defendants attempt to argue that they are entitled to a required finding of not guilty on the criminal harassment charge because none of their speech constituted \u201cfighting words,\u201d which they contend was the only form of speech punishable at the time of the offense under our interpretation of the statute in <em>Welch. </em>See generally 444 Mass, at 93-100. This argument is meritless. While the focus of our decision in <em>Welch </em>was centered on the \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine, we expressly noted that \u201c[a]ny attempt to punish an individual for speech not encompassed within the \u2018fighting words\u2019 doctrine <em>{or within any other constitutionally unprotected category of speech) </em>would of course offend our Federal and State Constitutions\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 99. These well-defined and limited categories of speech \u201care not protected because they are \u2018no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth\u2019 that whatever meager benefit that may be derived from them is \u2018clearly outweighed\u2019 by the dangers they pose.\u201d <em>Borowski, </em>461 Mass. at 422, quoting <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942). Speech integral to criminal conduct is one such long-standing category that is constitutionally unprotected, directly applicable to the defendants\u2019 conduct here, and permissibly proscribed by \u00a7 43A (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the denial of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ants\u2019 motion for a required finding of not guilty on the basis that they engaged in protected First Amendment activity was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">3. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>The defendants contend that there was insufficient evidence of their joint venture to criminally harass the victims, arguing that both the \u201cdirected at\u201d and \u201cseriously alarms\u201d prongs of the statute were not met. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt all of the statutory elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">a. <em>\u201cDirected at\u201d prong. </em>Section 43A (a) requires that the Commonwealth prove three or more predicate acts of harassment that were \u201cdirected at a specific person.\u201d See <em>McDonald, </em>462 Mass. at 240. The defendants argue that the Craigslist postings (two of the four acts supporting the harassment charge) were not directed at the victims, but were merely directed at the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">This argument is without merit. As a factual matter, the jury clearly could have concluded that the \u201cdirected at\u201d prong was met. While the defendants\u2019 methods were indirect, the false information in the Craigslist postings was intended solely to ensure that the victims were harassed as a consequence by unwitting third parties contacting them at all hours of the night by telephone and showing up at their home. Essentially, the \u201csole immediate object\u201d of the false advertisements was to create a marketplace for the guaranteed harassment of the victims. See <em>Giboney, </em>336 U.S. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The defendants cite to <em>Welch </em>for the contention that statements made to a third party are not speech directed at a specific person. 444 Mass, at 92-93 (shouting abusive epithets in one\u2019s apartment and speaking in normal tone of voice to third party outside does not satisfy requirements of \u00a7 43A [a]). The defendants\u2019 acts in the instant case are appreciably different from those at issue in <em>Welch. </em>The Craigslist postings were the equivalent of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>recruiting others to harass the victims and the victims alone. The causation link is satisfied. The defendants cannot launder their harassment of the Lyons family through the Internet to escape liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">b. <em>\u201cSeriously alarms\u201d prong. </em>Section 43A (a) also requires the Commonwealth to prove that the acts of alleged harassment \u201cseriously alarm[ed]\u201d the victims. The serious alarm required under \u00a7 43A (a) is a \u201cdemanding, subjective element of harm\u201d that must be satisfied by a victim\u2019s testimony rather than conjecture. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braica, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 247 (2007). The defendants argue that (1) the Commonwealth offered insufficient proof that the victims were seriously alarmed, and (2) the victims did not experience serious alarm separately for each act, as required, rather than cumulatively as the result of the pattern of harassing acts. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">First, the Lyonses\u2019 subjective feelings of fear and anxiety were actual (not hypothetical), significant, and well documented at trial. As a general matter, Jim and Bernadette testified that they felt \u201cbombarded,\u201d \u201cattacked,\u201d and \u201cvery frightened\u201d throughout the ordeal. Jim described the thirty-five-day \u201codyssey\u201d in which the defendants would \u201ctorture [them],\u201d stating that he was concerned about the safety of his family and himself: \u201cThe[y] attacked my business. They attacked my family. And they tried to take my kids away from me.\u201d Bernadette described the situation as \u201cvery traumatic,\u201d stating that her family was in a \u201csiege mentality where [e]very day something was happening so [they] got afraid.\u201d The Lyonses were sufficiently alarmed to call the police \u201cright away\u201d after the very first harassing act. Jim testified that the second act \u201cstepped it up a notch\u201d and made him feel \u201c[t]errible,\u201d and that the correspondence that he received alleging sexual molestation was \u201cvery tough\u201d and \u201cabsolutely alarmed\u201d him. The police took notice of and corroborated Jim\u2019s testimony that the defendants\u2019 conduct took a substantial emotional toll on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The Lyonses\u2019 testimony of feeling frightened, tortured, and attacked more than meets the \u201cseriously alarms\u201d standard. The victims testified to an abundance of distressing and alarming conduct that amounted to a serious invasion of their emotional tranquility. Unlike the victims in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>442 Mass. <em>770,113-774 </em>(2004), who offered no proof that they were \u201cactually \u2018alarmed or shocked,\u2019 \u201d but rather just \u201coffended\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the defendant\u2019s indecent exposure, the Lyonses testified to having a level of fear and anxiety similar to the victims in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 105, 108 (2005) (serious alarm requirement met where, as result of harassment, victim felt vulnerable, son\u2019s grades dropped due to nervousness, and family felt constantly under surveillance). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 294 (2006) (defendant\u2019s letters and telephone calls seriously alarmed victim who felt \u201cconcem[ed]\u201d and \u201cvery scared,\u201d and asked State officials for assistance). Here, the Lyons family did not merely experience uneasiness associated with day-to-day living, but rather, as the ominous and hostile acts perpetrated by the defendants continued to escalate, the totality of the situation evoked the type of \u201cserious negative emotional experience\u201d required under the statute. <em>Kessler, supra </em>at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">As for whether serious alarm must be shown for each individual act or may be measured cumulatively, we conclude that the statute\u2019s wording ties the requirement to the over-all pattern of conduct. The statutory language of \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>requires that the \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d or \u201cseries of acts\u201d \u201cseriously alarms.\u201d As a general rule of statutory construction, \u201cwords importing the plural number may include the singular.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Fourth. Accordingly, \u201cacts\u201d might refer to a single act as well as multiple acts. However, the rules of grammar and proper subject-verb agreement instruct a reading of \u201calarms\u201d to modify the singular noun of one \u201cpattern\u201d or one \u201cseries,\u201d rather than the noun \u201cacts.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The evidence at trial was sufficient to support the verdict rendered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">4. <em>Pretrial motions. </em>In three joint motions before the trial court, the defendants unsuccessfully asked for the case to be dismissed, alleging prosecutorial errors that caused undue delay and prejudice. Specifically, they contended that dismissal was appropriate based on the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201closs\u201d of Colton\u2019s telephone records and the Commonwealth\u2019s delayed disclosure of (1) promises, rewards, and inducements made to Colton in exchange for his cooperation; (2) Colton\u2019s statements regarding the location of the DCF call; and (3) a diary that Colton kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">While the Commonwealth has a duty to disclose all material, exculpatory evidence in its possession, see <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 404-405 (1992), we agree with the motion judge that the Commonwealth did not withhold any such evidence here and that delays in disclosure did not result in prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Colton\u2019s telephone records were potentially significant to the case because they could corroborate (or not) that a call was made from his telephone to the DCF hotline falsely reporting child abuse, and was not made from William\u2019s telephone. In November, 2009, the Commonwealth subpoenaed these records from Verizon and was notified that Colton\u2019s correct telephone service provider was Comcast. However, it was not until June of 2010 that the prosecutor attempted to obtain Colton\u2019s records from Comcast. By then, the subpoenaed records were no longer available as they were outside the company\u2019s retention period. The defendants argue that this \u201closs\u201d of records was prejudicial to their defense strategy. We agree that the Commonwealth could have and should have attempted to obtain Colton\u2019s telephone records earlier, but, ultimately, these records would not have provided any exculpatory information and their \u201closs\u201d was not prejudicial. The Commonwealth had already disclosed the DCF hotline records to the defendants, which identified the telephone number of the caller as Colton\u2019s, thus establishing that a call was made to DCF from Colton\u2019s telephone number, not William\u2019s, precisely what Colton\u2019s telephone records would have established. Further, the defendants had considerable opportunity and bases for cross-examining Colton even without his telephone records, \u201c \u2018effectively\u2019 removing]\u201d any prejudice (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Molina, </em>454 Mass. 232, 236-237 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Regarding promises, rewards, and inducements, well before trial, the prosecutor acknowledged Colton\u2019s preliminary discussions with the government. Once an agreement was formalized on September 22, 2010, the prosecutor properly disclosed its terms and filed a discovery packet including all of the Commonwealth\u2019s documents. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>462 Mass. 53, 62-63, cert, denied, 133 S. Ct. 796 (2012) (prosecutor informed defendant before trial of formalized cooperation agreements). Until the agreement was formalized, Colton received no promises, rewards, or inducements that the Commonwealth was obligated to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">With respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s delayed disclosure of a later statement Colton made about the DCF call, we disagree with the defendants that this statement was a critical change in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>story. In his initial statement to the police, Colton did not provide specific information about the location from which the DCF telephone call was made, and, later, Colton asserted that William had made the call from Colton\u2019s home telephone. The defendants had adequate notice of this assertion in the Commonwealth\u2019s bill of particulars, a supplemental police report, and Colton\u2019s follow-up interview report. The information was provided long before trial, permitting ample time for the defense to weave it into its over-all strategy and counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Colton. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165, 175 (1982) (\u201cdisclosure was sufficiently timely to allow the defendant \u2018to make effective use of the evidence in preparing and presenting his case\u2019 \u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Regarding the alleged delay in disclosing Colton\u2019s diary, the prosecutor promptly disclosed it to the defendants on learning of its existence in May, 2011, again, well before trial. This provided the defendants with a sufficient opportunity to investigate its contents and conduct a meaningful cross-examination of Colton.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Finally, the defendants\u2019 due process rights were adequately protected given the defendants\u2019 unhampered ability to extensively cross-examine Colton and the jury\u2019s instruction to carefully weigh his testimony. The defendants have not demonstrated that any delays in receiving information legitimately prejudiced their opportunity to effectively prepare their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">5. <em>Venue. </em>During pretrial proceedings and prior to jury empan-elment, William moved for dismissal of the charge of making a false report of child abuse, asserting lack of jurisdiction and improper venue under G. L. c. 277 \u00a7 57A.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He argued that since the telephone call to DCF (located in Suffolk County) was made from Colton\u2019s home (in Middlesex County), the charge should have been tried in either Suffolk or Middlesex County. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Article 13 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights grants the Legislature \u201cdiscretion ... to establish venue requirements for criminal trials,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 883, 897 (1977), but acknowledges \u201cthat fairness to a defendant normally requires that the defendant not be transported far away for trial but rather be tried where there is access to witnesses and evidence for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brogan, </em>415 Mass. 169, 174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(1993). Since the statute at issue, G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A (c), does not include a venue provision, the question of venue here \u201cis one of common law within any limitation that art. 13 may impose.\u201d <em>Brogan, supra </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The defendant has made no showing that the trial in Essex County \u201cwas in any way prejudicial to [his] defences on the merits, or otherwise disadvantageous to [him].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>358 Mass. 617, 620 n.2 (1971). It is not as though the crime is unrelated to Essex County: William lived in Essex County, as did the victims, and the child abuse investigation became fully manifested there. William has not demonstrated that he was \u201cunduly hampered by being required to appear\u201d in Essex County. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adelson, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 589 (1996).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">6. <em>E-mail authentication. </em>The defendants moved in limine on the first day of trial to exclude e-mail correspondence between Gail and Colton, arguing that the circumstances were insufficient to permit authentication or confirm Gail\u2019s identity as the sender. During voir dire on the issue, Colton testified that the defendants shared a joint e-mail account with which he had exchanged many friendly messages for nearly a decade. Regarding the proposed evidence, Colton testified that he understood these messages to be from Gail, on William\u2019s behalf, as they were sent after William had enlisted Colton in the scheme, were signed using Gail\u2019s typical signature, and referenced Colton\u2019s responses to inquiries about the harassment scheme.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge ruled that the preponderance of the evidence authenticated the messages and laid a foundation for their admissibility. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u201cEvidence may be authenticated by direct or circumstantial evidence, including its \u2018[ajppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>459 Mass. 442, 447-448 (2011), quoting Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 901(b)(4) (2013). The voir dire of Colton presented sufficient evidence that some of the messages sent to Colton were authored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>by Gail given the long-standing relationship between Colton and the defendants, the defendants\u2019 prior use of the e-mail address at the time of the scheme, and the referencing of the harassing acts in the messages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">7. <em>Closing argument. </em>In summarizing the evidence for the jury, the prosecutor stated: \u201cNow, how in the world can the Johnsons explain to you why . . . .\u201d William argues on appeal that this statement could be interpreted as a comment on the defendants\u2019 failure to take the stand. Viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical question was merely an attempt to illustrate the point that the defendants\u2019 conduct could not be reconciled with their defense. It was a \u201cfair, unemotional response to defense counsel\u2019s argument,\u201d grounded in both the evidence and its reasonable inferences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duguay, </em>430 Mass. 397, 404 (1999). There was no improper burden shifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Additionally, William contends that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence in two instances, amounting to reversible error. Specifically, the prosecutor mistakenly stated that people came to the Lyonses\u2019 home in response to the motorcycle advertisement (they only had telephoned), and that the Lyonses received the letter alleging sexual molestation before rather than following the e-mail message sent by \u201cBrian.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s two misstatements of fact did not result in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The facts were many and varied, and none of the misstatements \u201cwent to the heart of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 731 (2002). Further, the judge properly instructed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. Consequently, reversal is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">8. <em>Speedy trial claim. </em>Approximately two years after the defendants were charged, they moved for a dismissal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 36, as amended, 422 Mass. 1503 (1996), due to speedy trial violations. The motion judge acted well within his discretion in declining to accept defense counsels\u2019 unsworn representations regarding various continuances, and in denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>motion. We agree with the motion judge that the defendants did not undertake a proper rule 36 calculus or sufficiently develop their argument, leaving the judge unable to adequately assess their claim. Accordingly, it is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The defendants and the victims are both married couples.

This ultimately proves irrelevant given our holding that the speech at issue falls under another category of speech not subject to First Amendment protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention that their conviction of criminal harassment rests solely on incidents of pure speech. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 86-87 (2005), we noted that courts have long recognized that speech and conduct \u201cfrequently overlap and may be incapable of precise differentiation\u201d and that \u201cthe criminal harassment statute was intended to proscribe harassing conduct encompassing \u2018speech.\u2019 \u201d It is apparent that cyberharassment will consistently involve a hybrid of speech and conduct. There is content within the communications, but the very act of using the Internet as a medium through which to communicate implicates conduct. In <em>Welch, supra </em>at 99 n.15, we did \u201cnot suggest that incidents of harassment that consist of more than pure speech should be exempted from punishment.\u201d Here, the conduct and speech together \u201cconstituted a single and integrated\u201d course of action in violation of a valid law. See <em>Giboney </em>v. <em>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., </em>336 U.S. 490, 498 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">To the extent that the defendants read our holding in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Borowski, </em>461 Mass. 415 (2012), to establish the principle that no constitutionally unprotected category of speech can be proscribed under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>{a), </em>unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>we have explicitly articulated so in a previous case, they are misguided.
