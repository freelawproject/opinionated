L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5), and, derivatively, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (1), when the city unilaterally reduced its percentage contribution to retired employees\u2019 health insurance premiums without engaging in collective bargaining over the matter with current employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the city and the school committee did not violate these statutory provisions. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (board), which reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>Our resolution of the present dispute is based on the interplay between G. L. c. 150E and G. L. c. 32B. General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 2, protects the rights of public employees to self-organization and collective bargaining. Pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, \u201c[t]he employer and the exclusive representative . . . shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards [of] productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment....\u201d General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 10, states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201c(a) It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employer or its designated representative to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">\u201c(1) Interfere, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right guaranteed under this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201c(5) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative as required in section six . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">\u201cUnder the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, municipalities of the Commonwealth may choose to provide health insurance coverage to their employees.\u201d <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>468 Mass. 260, 261 (2014). See <em>Cioch </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Ludlow, </em>449 Mass. 690, 695 (2007). General Laws c. 32B is a so-called \u201clocal option\u201d statute that governs the provision of health insurance to active and retired employees of a municipality once that entity has voted to accept the terms of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Middleborough, supra; Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. 315, 316 (1997). See generally D.A. Randall &amp; D.E. Franklin, Municipal Law and Practice \u00a7 10.25 (5th ed. 2006 &amp; Supp. 2014). When enacted, see St. 1956, c. 730, \u00a7 1, G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, authorized municipalities to offer certain eligible persons and their dependents group indemnity health insurance coverage. Beginning in 1971, municipalities were given the option of making available to such individuals the services of a health maintenance organization (HMO) by accepting G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 16, inserted by St. 1971, c. 946, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Pursuant to G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9, retirees bear the full cost of their health insurance premiums unless a municipality has accepted the more generous provisions of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A or 9E. If a municipality accepts G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A, then it may elect to pay fifty per cent of a retiree\u2019s premium for health insurance coverage. If a municipality accepts G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, then it may elect to pay \u201ca subsidiary or additional rate\u201d greater than fifty per cent of a retiree\u2019s health insurance premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">2. <em>Factual and procedural background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as stipulated by the parties in lieu of a hearing before the board. The city is a public employer within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1. The school committee is the collective bargaining agent of the city for the purpose of dealing with school employees. The Somerville Teachers Association, Somerville Police Superior Officers Association, Somerville Administrators Association, and Somerville Municipal Employees Association (collectively, the unions) are employee organizations within the meaning of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 1,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and they are the exclusive bargaining representatives for various individuals employed by the school committee and the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In 1979, the city accepted G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, by a vote of the board of aldermen, thereby authorizing the city to pay more than fifty per cent of a retired employee\u2019s monthly premium for an indemnity health insurance plan. From that point forward until August 1, 2009, the city contributed ninety-nine per cent of the premium for a retired employee\u2019s health insurance coverage under the indemnity plan offered by the city. Retired employees contributed the remaining one per cent of the premium. In addition, the city offered active and retired employees health insurance coverage through several HMOs. The city paid fixed percentages of the total premium costs, which varied between eighty and ninety per cent, depending on the particular plan. Employees and retirees paid the remainder of the premium costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">On or about July 1, 2009, the city had approximately 1,262 retirees who were participating in the city\u2019s group health insurance plans. The majority of these individuals had retired from positions in the unions\u2019 bargaining units. Effective August 1, 2009, the city decreased the percentage of its contribution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>retired employees\u2019 health insurance coverage under the indemnity plan from ninety-nine per cent to sixty per cent, and it decreased the percentage of its contribution for retired employees\u2019 health insurance coverage under all other insurance plans to seventy-five per cent. These changes were approved by the board of aldermen after a properly noticed public hearing at which the new rates were proposed by the mayor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Neither the city nor the school committee provided the unions with notice of or an opportunity to bargain over the decision to change contribution rates. None of the collective bargaining agreements between the city and the various bargaining units addressed the contribution rates for retired employees\u2019 health insurance coverage, and such rates had never been a subject of negotiation between the city and the bargaining units. At all material times, the city has maintained that the authority to set the contribution rates for retirees\u2019 health insurance coverage is vested exclusively with the board of aldermen and the mayor, and that such contribution rates are not a mandatory subject of bargaining with current employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On September 10, 2009, the Somerville Teachers Association filed two prohibited practice charges with the division of labor relations (division).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It alleged that the city and, separately, the school committee had violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (5), and, derivatively, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (1), by \u201cfailing to provide notice and an opportunity to bargain over the future benefits [on retirement] of active employees when the City announced at the meeting of the Board of Aldermen, on May 28, 2009 that effective August 1, 2009 the percentage contribution rate for all retirees would be increased.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Based on essentially the same grounds, the Somerville Police Superior Officers Association filed a prohibited practice charge with the division on December 21, 2009; the Somerville Administrators Association filed two prohibited practice charges with the division on January 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>2010;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Somerville Municipal Employees Association filed a prohibited practice charge with the division on April 13, 2010. The division investigated the allegations and found probable cause to believe that statutory violations had occurred. The division issued complaints with respect to all six matters, and, on July 30, 2010, they were consolidated for hearing. Pursuant to G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11 00, the parties petitioned to have the consolidated complaints heard by the board in the first instance (rather than by a hearing officer),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the request was granted. The parties then stipulated to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">By decision dated October 19, 2011, the board concluded that the city and the school committee had failed to satisfy their statutory bargaining obligations before unilaterally reducing contributions for retired employees\u2019 health insurance premiums. In the board\u2019s view, health insurance contributions for municipal retirees are a mandatory subject of bargaining. The board rejected the city\u2019s claims that current employees have no right to bargain over such contributions made on behalf of retirees, and that, pursuant to G. L. c. 32B, health insurance rates for retirees must be established through the local governmental process, not the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The board ordered the city and the school committee to cease and desist from failing and refusing to bargain collectively in good faith with the unions over changes to future retirees\u2019 health insurance contribution rates. Further, the board ordered the city and the school committee to restore the terms of the retirement health insurance benefit that was in effect prior to August 1, 2009, for the unions\u2019 bargaining unit members who were active employees before that date and retired thereafter. In addition, the board ordered the city and the school committee to make whole those bargaining unit members who retired after August 1, 2009, for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral change in retirement health insurance contribution rates, plus interest. The city and the school committee appealed the board\u2019s decision, the case was entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred it to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the board\u2019s decision in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>dance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), governing appeals from final administrative agency decisions. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11 (/). See also <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>438 Mass. <em>177, </em>180 (2002). The board\u2019s decision will be set aside only if it is \u201c[arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (g). We defer to the board\u2019s specialized knowledge and expertise. See <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>However, the duty of statutory interpretation rests ultimately with the courts. See <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006), citing <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>The thrust of the arguments made by the city and the school committee is that current public employees do not have the right to bargain collectively over the issue of health insurance contribution rates for retirees. They contend that, pursuant to G. L. c. 32B, such contribution rates are to be determined solely by the local government. In their view, a contrary conclusion would give the unions veto power over decisions made by a municipality acting in accordance with its statutory authority. Therefore, they continue, neither the city nor the school committee violated G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5), and, derivatively, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (1), when the city unilaterally reduced its percentage contributions to retirees\u2019 health insurance premiums. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">When Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, it exempted public employers \u2014 States and their political subdivisions \u2014 from the obligation to engage in collective bargaining. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2) (2012). See also <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>443 Mass. 315, 326 n.5 (2005). States and their political subdivisions were \u201cfree to regulate their labor relationships with their public employees.\u201d <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Washington Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>551 U.S. 177, 181 (2007). However, as was the case in most States, public employees in the Commonwealth \u201chad virtually none of the rights that had been widely guaranteed since the nineteen thirties to employees in private business to organize and bargain collectively and to be protected in the associated activities of asserting and negotiating grievances.\u201d <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 392, 396 (1974). \u201c [Traditional hostility to organizational rights on the part of public employees gradually diminished in the post-war period, and in 1958 Massachusetts was among the first States ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>afford a measure of recognition to those rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397. See St. 1958, c. 460, inserting G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178D. See also St. 1964, c. 637, inserting G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 178F; St. 1965, c. 763, \u00a7 2, inserting G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178G-178N. In 1973, the public sector collective bargaining law, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 178D, 178F-178N, was repealed and replaced with G. L. c. 150E, see St. 1973, c. 1078, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, as comprehensive legislation designed to provide organizational and collective bargaining rights to public employees.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local 66, </em>374 Mass. 79, 93-95 (1977); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 691, 693 (1977). Thus, the scope of matters for negotiation has been defined, albeit somewhat broadly, by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 6, provides that the public employer and the employee organization \u201cshall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards [of] productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d These matters, subject to limited exceptions, are deemed to be mandatory subjects of bargaining.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Local 1652, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Firefighters </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>442 Mass. 463, 467 (2004). See also <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>438 Mass. at 180-181 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(certain types of managerial decisions must, as matter of policy, be reserved for public employer\u2019s discretion). The failure of a public employer to negotiate in good faith over mandatory subjects of bargaining is a prohibited practice. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(5). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. 124, 127 (1989) (\u201cA public employer has a duty to bargain in good faith and, short of impasse, it may not unilaterally implement changes to a mandatory subject of bargaining without negotiation\u201d); <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 572 (1983). The commission of a prohibited practice is remediable through the enforcement procedures set forth in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The issue here is whether the city\u2019s contribution rate for retired employees\u2019 health insurance coverage is a mandatory subject of bargaining such that its unilateral reduction constitutes a prohibited practice in violation of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (5). As a general proposition, health insurance coverage for public employees is \u201can unearned benefit, no different in concept from holidays, future sick leave, or other similar benefits.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Plymouth, </em>430 Mass. 719,724 (2000). \u201cAs an unearned benefit, health insurance, like \u2018wages, hours . . . and . . . other terms and conditions of employment\u2019 is subject to mandatory collective bargaining between public employers and public employees.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Cambridge Pub. Health Comm\u2019n, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 911 (2012), quoting <em>School Comm. of Medford </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 140 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 932 (1980). See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Wrentham, </em>406 Mass. 508, 511 (1990) (municipality\u2019s contribution to unionized employees\u2019 group health insurance premiums is mandatory subject of collective bargaining). The language of G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, governs the terms and conditions of the public employee\u2019s existing employment. It goes without saying that a retiree cannot bargain over the percentage contributions made by a municipality to the retiree\u2019s health insurance premiums, given that the retiree is no longer employed. With respect to current employees, a municipality\u2019s contributions to the health insurance premiums of retirees is not a term or condition of employment that is subject to mandatory collective bargaining where the Legislature expressly has conferred authority over the provision of such a benefit on the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Legislature, by way of G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9, has stated that retirees \u201cshall pay the full premium cost\u201d of their health insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>anee, subject to the provisions of either G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9A, or G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, which, if accepted by a municipality, permits the municipality to pay a portion of the retirees\u2019 premiums. The authority conferred on a municipality to decide whether and how much to contribute to the monthly health insurance premiums of retired employees (within defined statutory percentages) would be wholly undermined by an obligation to collectively bargain the matter. See, e.g., <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>Somerville Mun. Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>451 Mass. 493, 494 (2008) (explicit legislative directive of G. L. c. 115, \u00a7 10, that city\u2019s director of veterans\u2019 services \u201cshall be appointed ... by the mayor, with the approval of the city council,\u201d precluded challenged appointment from being proper subject of collective bargaining); <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 448, 453, cert, denied, 515 U.S. 1161 (1995) (where Legislature reserved for itself in G. L. c. 32A, \u00a7 8, power to change percentage of Commonwealth\u2019s agreed-to contribution to employees\u2019 health insurance premiums, such reserved power could not be overridden by collective bargaining); <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347, I.A.F.F. </em>v. <em>Watertown, 316 </em>Mass. 706, 714 (1978) (characterization of matter as term or condition of employment does not require its submission to collective bargaining if to do so will \u201cdefeat[] a declared legislative purpose\u201d). See generally <em>Energy Reserves Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>459 U.S. 400, 411 (1983), quoting <em>Hudson Water Co. </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>209 U.S. 349, 357 (1908) (\u201cOne whose rights ... are subject to [Sjtate restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the State by mating a contract about them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Except as provided in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>which we shall discuss next, \u201c[tjhere is no obligation to engage in collective bargaining as to matters controlled entirely by statute.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 183 (1997).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>126; <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Local Rl-162 </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 542, 544 (1984). Here, current public employees cannot bargain over how the city should exercise the authority conferred on it by G. L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, because such bargaining effectively would negate the Legislature\u2019s purpose in entrusting the matter to the city. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 184. Cf. <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Middleborough, </em>468 Mass. at 271 (board of selectmen has statutory authority to establish percentage of total monthly premium for HMO coverage that is to be paid by town\u2019s retired employees); <em>Yeretsky </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>424 Mass. at 323-324 (municipal contribution rate for HMO premiums for retired nonunionized employees determined at local government level). In our view, the Legislature conferred authority on municipalities to decide whether and how much to contribute to retirees\u2019 health insurance premiums in recognition of the fact that, as public employers, they must balance the needs of their retired workers with the burdens of safeguarding their own fiscal health, thereby ensuring their ability to provide services for all of their citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"AFn\">If we were to conclude that the city\u2019s percentage contribution to retirees\u2019 health insurance premiums is a mandatory subject of bargaining, we would have to confront the import of the so-called \u201cconflicts\u201d statute, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d). </em>See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>461 Mass. 602, 607-608 (2012). General Laws c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>provides that, with respect to matters within the scope of negotiations under G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6, the terms of a collective bargaining agreement prevail over contrary terms in certain enumerated statutes. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>supra; <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Office &amp; Professional Employees Int\u2019l Union, Local 6, </em>441 Mass. 620, 625-626 (2004). Generally speaking, those enumerated statutes \u201ccontain specific mandates regarding terms and conditions of employment of public employees.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 607 n.11. See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d); School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. at 566. General Laws c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, is not among the enumerated statutes. It is well established that \u201cstatutes not specifically enumerated in \u00a7 7 <em>(d) </em>will prevail over contrary terms in collective bargaining agreements.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>404 Mass. at 126.

L. c. 32B, \u00a7 9E, would prevail, and the city could unilaterally change the percentage of its contribution in accordance with the statute. <em>See National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Local R1-162 </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>17 Mass.

L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 (a) (5), or, derivatively, G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(1), when the city unilaterally reduced its percentage contribution to retired employees\u2019 health insurance premiums without engaging in collective bargaining over the matter with current employees. Accordingly, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-15\">A municipality and a school committee are a single entity for purposes of collective bargaining.
