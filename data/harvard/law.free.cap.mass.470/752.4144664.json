Sheridan, for driving a minivan with an unilluminated headlight. During the stop, the officers saw in the vehicle a portion of what an officer identified as \u201cabout a [one]-ounce bag\u201d of marijuana, protruding from under a rumpled T-shirt lying on the floor between the vehicle\u2019s two front seats. The officers ordered the defendant out of the vehicle, handcuffed him, and conducted a search of the minivan. Lifting the T-shirt, an officer found, in addition to the bag previously partially seen, another one-ounce bag of marijuana and a third, smaller bag of marijuana. The defendant was arrested and taken to the police station. After he was booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, officers seized and searched his cellular telephone, finding several text messages that they identified as consistent with sales of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the marijuana seized from his vehicle and the text messages found on his telephone. In Massachusetts, \u201cpossession of one ounce or less of marihuana [is] only ... a civil offense,\u201d punishable by a \u201ccivil penalty of one hundred dollars and forfeiture of the marihuana.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L. Because it is not a crime, police observation of one ounce or less of marijuana is insufficient, by itself, to give rise to the probable cause necessary to conduct a search. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. 746, 752 (2013) <em>(Daniel). </em>A judge of the District Court nevertheless denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. He concluded that the police were permitted to enter the minivan to effect the forfeiture of the marijuana that they saw, and that the discovery of the additional marijuana, the defendant\u2019s arrest, and the subsequent seizure and search of the defendant\u2019s telephone followed from the initial lawful entry into the defendant\u2019s vehicle. We conclude that the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle and of the cellular telephone violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as found by the District Court judge, supplemented by uncontroverted evidence derived from the testimony of witnesses that the judge explicitly or implicitly credited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isaiah </em>I., 448 Mass. 334, 337 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 818 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Sean Glennon, an officer of the Quincy police department, initiated the stop of the defendant\u2019s minivan at approximately 2:50 a.m. Glennon approached the driver\u2019s side window and requested the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration. Glennon observed that the defendant looked extremely nervous; his hands shook as he fumbled for his driver\u2019s license and registration, and, although he readily produced his license, he at first provided an expired registration. He eventually provided a current valid registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Scott Walker, a State police trooper who happened to be patrolling the area, also stopped at the scene shortly after Glennon had stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle. As Glennon was conversing with the defendant, Walker approached the vehicle\u2019s passenger side window. Walker observed, on the floor between the vehicle\u2019s two front seats, the corner of a plastic sandwich bag that appeared to contain marijuana, protruding from under a T-shirt. Walker discreetly indicated to Glennon the apparent presence of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Glennon ordered the defendant to step out of the vehicle and performed a patfrisk, during which he found $285 in cash and a cellular telephone. After returning the money and the telephone to the defendant, Glennon asked whether there was \u201canything illegal in the car.\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Glennon requested permission to search the vehicle; the defendant declined. Glennon then informed the defendant that Walker had seen a bag of marijuana in the vehicle. The defendant \u201cslumped forward\u201d and a \u201cdejected type of look\u201d crossed his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Glennon handcuffed the defendant, whose hands by that point were \u201cshaking uncontrollabl[y],\u201d and began to search the vehicle. Glennon saw a bag he described as \u201cconsistent with about a [one]-ounce bag\u201d of marijuana, partially visible under a T-shirt on the floor between the vehicle\u2019s front seats. He lifted the T-shirt and observed two additional bags of marijuana, one approximately equal in size to the first bag, and one smaller. The officers searched the remainder of the minivan, and also requested a narcotics-trained canine to perform a sniff search, but located no additional drugs or contraband and no other evidence of illegal activity. The defendant was transported to the police station, where he was booked on charges of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. During booking, officers again seized the defendant\u2019s money and cellular telephone. Glennon viewed text messages stored on the telephone and saw \u201cseveral text messages that appeared to be orders to purchase marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>b. <em>Procedural history. </em>The defendant was charged with possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32, and a civil motor vehicle infraction based on the broken headlight. The defendant filed a motion to suppress all of the physical evidence seized as a result of the search and the arrest, including the marijuana, the telephone, and the text messages found on the telephone. The defendant argued that the officers lacked probable cause to believe that the minivan contained more than one ounce of marijuana, rendering the search impermissible. A District Court judge held an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, at which both Glennon and Walker testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The judge denied the motion to suppress. He observed that \u201c[t]he issue of whether the police could ascertain whether the initial bag of marijuana, because it was partially hidden, contained more or less than one [ounce] of material was . . . contested ... at the hearing.\u201d The judge concluded, however, that \u201cit is irrelevant whether Glennon or Walker could make such a determination.\u201d Stating that, \u201cwhile possession of less than [one ounce] of marijuana is not criminal, any quantity is \u2018contraband,\u2019 \u201d the judge determined that \u201cthe police are entitled to issue an \u2018exit order\u2019 to completely ensure their safety (and for convenience) while they are in a vulnerable position reaching into the vehicle to seiz[e] the drugs.\u201d Furthermore, the judge concluded that, \u201conce the police removed the shirt to seize the initial bundle of marijuana, a second one ounce bag as well as a smaller bag were revealed,\u201d giving rise to probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of a criminal quantity of marijuana. Finally, the judge concluded that \u201c[t]he seizure of the [telephone [was] incident to the arrest,\u201d and that \u201cthe information obtained [from the search of the telephone\u2019s contents] [was] allowed as inevitable discovery during the investigation of whether the more than one [ounce] of marijuana were possessed with intent to distribute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The single justice granted the defendant\u2019s application for leave to file an interlocutory appeal to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), and allowed the defendant to amend his filing to include a challenge to the search of the cellular telephone. We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>fact absent clear error but conduct an independent review of [the judge\u2019s] ultimate findings and conclusions of law\u201d (quotation omitted). <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass. at 748-749.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">b. <em>The search of the vehicle, </em>i. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights similarly protects against \u201cunreasonable searches, and seizures, of [one\u2019s] person, [one\u2019s] houses, [one\u2019s] papers, and all [one\u2019s] possessions.\u201d While \u201c[generally, a warrant is required\u201d for a search to be reasonable, \u201cseveral well-recognized exceptions exist.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. 459, 473 (2011) <em>(Cruz). </em>\u201cUnder the automobile exception, a warrantless search of an automobile is permitted when police have \u2018probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle on a public way contains contraband or evidence of a crime, and exigent circumstances make obtaining a warrant impracticable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-474, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 901 (1990). \u201c[W]hen an automobile is stopped in a public place with probable cause, no more exigent circumstances are required . . . beyond the inherent mobility of an automobile itself to justify a warrantless search of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Motta, </em>424 Mass. 117, 124 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In 2008, voters in the Commonwealth approved a ballot initiative entitled \u201cAn Act establishing a sensible State marihuana policy.\u201d See St. 2008, c. 387. The initiative established that \u201cpossession of one ounce or less of marihuana shall only be a civil offense, subjecting an offender who is eighteen years of age or older to a civil penalty ... and forfeiture of the marihuana, but not to any other form of criminal or civil punishment or disqualification.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">In <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass, at 462, we first confronted the decriminalization initiative\u2019s impact on the automobile exception. There police officers, while conducting an otherwise permissible vehicle stop, smelled \u201ca \u2018faint odor\u2019 of burnt marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Before the enactment of the decriminalization initiative, we had held \u201cthat the odor of burnt marijuana is sufficient to believe that there is contraband in the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garden, </em>451 Mass. 43, 47 (2008). The validity of a warrantless search, however, is determined according to the same standard used by a magistrate in deciding to issue a search warrant. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 475, citing <em>Whiteley </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 566 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>(1971). In Massachusetts, the standard for the issuance of a search warrant demands probable cause to believe that a crime is being committed. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 475-476. Because the ballot initiative transformed the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana into a civil infraction, not a crime, we concluded in <em>Cruz </em>that a warrantless search of a vehicle is permissible only if police can establish \u201cprobable cause to believe that a <em>criminal </em>amount of contraband was present in the car\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Similarly, in <em>Daniel, supra </em>at 749, police smelled \u201cthe odor of freshly burnt marijuana\u201d while conducting a traffic stop. When an officer asked whether the vehicle\u2019s occupants had any marijuana, a passenger gave the officer two small bags, collectively containing less than one ounce of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>The officer then ordered the occupants out of the vehicle and searched it. <em>Id. </em>at 750. During the search, he found an unlicensed firearm in the glove compartment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We held that the officer lacked probable cause to search the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 751-752. Possession of the quantity of marijuana contained in the two small bags \u201cconstituted a civil infraction, not a criminal offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 751, and the vehicle\u2019s occupants \u201csurrendered [the] bags ... at the request of the officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, \u201c[a]bsent articulable facts supporting a belief that either occupant of the vehicle possessed a criminal amount of marijuana, the search was not justified by the need to search for contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\"><em>Cruz </em>and <em>Daniel </em>control the outcome of this case. Glennon testified that the bag that was partially visible under the T-shirt was \u201cconsistent with about a [one]-ounce bag\u201d of marijuana. Because the ballot initiative decriminalized \u201cpossession of one ounce or less\u201d of marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, the officer saw evidence of a civil infraction, not a criminal offense. Absent articulable facts supporting a belief that the vehicle contained an additional, criminal quantity of marijuana, the officers lacked probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed, and the search was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">ii. The Commonwealth offers two reasons in support of its argument that the officers had probable cause to believe that a criminal amount of marijuana was present in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s first argument hinges on the word \u201cabout.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that, because \u201c \u2018[ajbout\u2019 an ounce would include amounts both more and less than an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ounce,\u201d and because possession of more than an ounce of marijuana would constitute a criminal offense, the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The standard for probable cause demands that the officers know \u201cenough facts and circumstances \u2018to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing\u2019 \u201d the vehicle contained a criminal quantity of marijuana. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 650 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 895. Here Glennon testified that, based on his training and experience, he identified the amount of marijuana contained in the bag as \u201cabout. . . [one]-ounce,\u201d a noncriminal quantity. The Commonwealth identifies no facts or circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge that would have led a reasonable person to believe that Glennon underestimated the amount of marijuana contained in the bag. That belief would be particularly unwarranted because the officers could only see a small portion of the bag, the remainder being covered by the T-shirt. The imprecision in Glennon\u2019s estimate at best gives rise only to speculation that the quantity exceeded one ounce. It does not establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Next, the Commonwealth contends that, even if the observation of the marijuana alone were not sufficient to give rise to probable cause, the defendant\u2019s nervousness upon being stopped tipped the scales to probable cause. In <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. at 467, the Commonwealth similarly contended that the odor of burnt marijuana, when coupled with \u201cthe stop\u2019s location, a high crime neighborhood; the defendant\u2019s nervous demeanor; and the occupants\u2019 sharing of a cigar\u201d allegedly used to cover the odor of marijuana were sufficient to establish probable cause. Likewise, in <em>Daniel, </em>464 Mass, at 749, an officer testified that, when he approached the stopped vehicle, he observed the defendant \u201csitting in the passenger seat\u201d with \u201chis head down and his shoulders . . . \u2018rocking back and forth.\u2019 \u201d The officer in <em>Daniel, supra </em>at 750, also testified that he regarded the defendant\u2019s conduct in emptying his pockets and placing the contents on the dashboard as \u201csignificant ... because it was not common,\u201d and that it suggested to him that the defendant was \u201ctrying to conceal something.\u201d In both cases, we determined that manifestations of allegedly nervous or furtive behavior, in conjunction with indications that the defendants possessed some amount of marijuana, were not sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the defendants possessed a criminal quantity. \u201cIt is common,\u201d we observed, \u201cand not necessarily indicative of criminality, to appear nervous during even a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>mundane encounter with police.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. at 468. Because the Commonwealth identifies no additional factors supporting probable cause beyond the defendant\u2019s apparent nervousness and the noncriminal quantity of marijuana that the officers observed, we reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">iii. The decriminalization initiative transformed possession of one ounce or less of marijuana into a civil offense, subjecting the possessor to \u201ca civil penalty\u201d and \u201cforfeiture of the marihuana.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L. The District Court judge determined that the police officers were permitted to order the defendant out of his vehicle, and then to enter the vehicle themselves to effect this forfeiture. The Commonwealth echoes this argument on appeal, asserting that \u201c[t]he limited entry was reasonable as it effected the forfeiture as envisioned by G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In evaluating this argument, it is important to distinguish an officer\u2019s power to seize the marijuana from the officer\u2019s power to make an entry into the vehicle to effect that seizure. We agree with the District Court judge\u2019s determination that any quantity of marijuana is \u201ccontraband\u201d and is subject to seizure. We disagree, however, with the judge\u2019s conclusion that, to effect that seizure, the officers were entitled to make an entry into the vehicle that \u2014 lacking probable cause \u2014 they otherwise would be prohibited from making.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The Commonwealth contends that the seizure of the marijuana was proper because it was in \u201cplain view.\u201d \u201cUnder our plain view doctrine, a police officer may seize objects in plain view where four requirements are met: (1) the officer is \u2018lawfully in a position to view the object\u2019; (2) the officer has \u2018a lawful right of access to the object\u2019; (3) with respect to \u2018contraband, weapons, or other items illegally possessed, where the incriminating character of the object is immediately apparent\u2019 or, with respect to \u2018other types of evidence . . . where the particular evidence is plausibly related to criminal activity of which the police are already aware\u2019; and (4) the officer \u2018come[s] across the object inadvertently.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>469 Mass. 96, 102 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sliech-Brodeur, </em>457 Mass. 300, 306-307 (2010). There is no dispute here that the first and fourth requirements are met: the officers were lawfully in a position to observe the bag of marijuana, since the bag was visible from outside the vehicle where the officers were positioned in effecting a permissible, routine traffic stop; and the officers came across the marijuana inadvertently, since there is no contention that the officers effected the traffic stop to search for marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The Commonwealth, however, cannot satisfy the doctrine\u2019s second requirement, which demands that the officer have \u201ca lawful right of access to the object.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra. </em>In typical plain view cases, officers see and seize an object while conducting a permissible search, pursuant either to a warrant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sliech-Brodeur, supra </em>at 306, or to an exception to the warrant requirement, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stack, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 234-235 (2000). In those cases, police officers are already in the process of conducting a permissible search of a certain location (i.e. a vehicle, a house), and the plain view doctrine operates to allow officers to seize an object to which, by virtue of the search, they already have access. In other cases, police officers see, in plain view from a lawful vantage point outside a vehicle, an item that itself gives rise to \u201cprobable cause to believe that they would find \u2018the instrumentality of a crime or evidence pertaining to a crime\u2019 in the vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>461 Mass. 44, 49 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 55 (1974). Because the observation gives rise to probable cause to conduct a search, the subsequent entry into the vehicle and seizure of the item is permissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Here, although the officers could see the marijuana from their lawful vantage point outside the minivan, they did not have a \u201clawful right to access\u201d it from that vantage point. To seize the marijuana, the police officers had to enter the minivan. Because the observation of a noncriminal quantity of marijuana alone did not give rise to probable cause that the vehicle contained evidence of a crime, the validity of the officers\u2019 seizure of the marijuana turns on the existence of some other basis, besides probable cause, to justify the officers\u2019 entry into the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The Commonwealth characterizes the entry into the minivan as a \u201climited intrusion,\u201d and likens it to the intrusion involved in a police officer\u2019s request for license and registration documentation during a routine motor vehicle stop. The analogy is inapposite. In the context of traffic stops, we have never held that officers may routinely enter vehicles to acquire driver\u2019s license and registration documents, in the same way that the officers entered the defendant\u2019s vehicle here to seize the marijuana. On the contrary, we have stated that, \u201c[generally, the officer may simply direct the driver to retrieve his identification from the vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>455 Mass. 147, 160 (2009). Only when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>officers have \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that [the vehicle\u2019s occupants are] armed and dangerous\u201d are police officers permitted to order the occupants out of the vehicle and then conduct a limited search for the purposes of recovering the identification and registration documents. <em>Id. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>440 Mass. 62, 68 (2003) (police officers permitted to search \u201ccontainer that they reasonably fear may contain a weapon\u201d before returning it to defendant to locate his identification documentation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528-529 (1995) (concluding that, where circumstances of search \u201cjustified] heightened precautions for the officers\u2019 own safety[,] . . . the officers could properly have entered the passenger compartment, including the glove compartment, to retrieve the registration themselves\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Indeed, our jurisprudence has diverged from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in that we have held that art. 14 prohibits automatic exit orders during routine traffic stops. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662-663 (1999), with <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 109-110 (1977). Instead, we have concluded that a police officer must \u201chave a reasonable suspicion of danger before compelling a driver to leave his motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 662. Here the District Court judge acknowledged that, \u201cexcept for the extreme nervousness of the defendant, there [were] not present any other factors that would indicate a dangerous situation may exist.\u201d The judge never found that the officers\u2019 exit order and the patfrisk of the defendant that followed were based on any reasonable apprehension of danger. Rather, the record indicates that these events were precipitated solely by the officers\u2019 observation of what they believed to be a noncriminal portion of marijuana. Under these circumstances, the exit order and the patfrisk were impermissible, and the officers\u2019 entry into the vehicle to seize the marijuana cannot be justified under the logic that enables police officers to enter a vehicle to recover license and registration documentation in situations where the officer reasonably believes that the driver is armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Finally, the Commonwealth suggests that the officers\u2019 entry into the minivan was permissible under the logic that allows warrant-less administrative inspections to enforce certain regulatory schemes. Such searches, however, are typically confined to \u201ccommercial premises\u201d that are \u201cutilized in the context of a \u2018closely regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>lated\u2019 industry,\u201d where \u201can individual\u2019s expectation of privacy\u201d is \u201cparticularly attenuated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tart, </em>408 Mass. 249, 253-254 (1990). Where warrantless administrative searches for evidence of suspected regulatory violations have been upheld, moreover, typically \u201cthere is no possibility of criminal action and thus no necessity to comply with the more stringent standards of criminal probable cause\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frodyma, </em>386 Mass. 434, 442 (1982). Administrative searches are permissible because they are \u201cconducted as part of a general regulatory scheme in furtherance of an administrative purpose, rather than as part of a criminal investigation to secure evidence of crime.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>482 F.2d 893, 908 (9th Cir. 1973), overruled on other grounds, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Aukai, </em>497 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). They are not permissible, by contrast, where they serve as a \u201ctool for law enforcement.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>$124,570 U.S. Currency, </em>873 F.2d 1240, 1244 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The facts of this case aptly demonstrate how the type of intrusion that occurred here could become a tool for law enforcement to search for evidence of criminal activity despite the absence of probable cause. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s characterization, the search went beyond a \u201climited intrusion\u201d for the \u201csole purpose of seizing marijuana in [the officers\u2019] plain view.\u201d Upon entering the vehicle, the officers did not merely seize the one bag of marijuana that was partially in plain view under the T-shirt. Instead, they lifted the T-shirt, discovering and then seizing two additional bags. The judge made no factual finding that the officers had to lift the T-shirt to seize the bag, rather than simply grasping the portion of the bag that was partially visible. And although the District Court judge found that, \u201cin addition to the visible one-ounce bag of marijuana, other objects lay underneath the same t-shirt,\u201d the judge never found, and nothing in the officers\u2019 testimony supports a finding, that the officers had reason to believe that these other objects were other bags of marijuana, rather than innocuous, noncontraband items.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">For these reasons, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the officers here were permitted to effect a \u201climited intrusion\u201d into the defendant\u2019s vehicle to seize the marijuana. The officers observed a noncriminal quantity of marijuana from a lawful vantage point, and might well have informed the defendant that the possession of that marijuana constituted a civil offense, subjecting the possessor to a fine, and that the marijuana was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>forfeiture. They could have requested that the defendant turn the marijuana over to them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also could have issued a civil citation, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32N, and pursued the forfeiture of the marijuana, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 47. They did not do so. Instead, they entered the vehicle and conducted a search that went beyond even what would be necessary to seize the bag that they had seen. Because they lacked probable cause to believe that the van contained evidence of a crime, we conclude that their entry into the minivan was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">c. <em>The search of the cellular telephone. </em>Our determination that the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was impermissible resolves any question whether the subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone was permissible. The District Court judge concluded that the additional bags of marijuana that the officers discovered as a result of their entry into the minivan gave rise to probable cause to arrest the defendant; that the seizure of the cellular telephone was permissible as a seizure incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest; and that, once the telephone was seized, the search of the text messages contained on the telephone was permissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. In the District Court judge\u2019s analysis, then, the validity of the search of the cellular telephone ultimately turned on the validity of the officers\u2019 entry into the minivan. Because we have determined that the officers\u2019 entry into the minivan was impermissible, the thread leading to the search of the text messages is unwound, and the text messages must be suppressed. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 900 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">If there were any doubt about that result, the United States Supreme Court has set it to rest. After the District Court judge issued his decision in this case, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Riley </em>v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014). There, the Court held that \u201cthe search incident to arrest exception does not apply to cell phones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2494. For both of these reasons, the text messages obtained as a result of the search of the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the searches of his vehicle and of the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone is reversed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>matter is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">We leave to another day an examination of the consequences if the defendant had declined to turn over the marijuana on request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
