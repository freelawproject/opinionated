L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (/) (\u00a7 178E [/]). After a hearing, the judge denied the motion, thereby requiring the juvenile to register with the Sex Offender Registry Board (board). We consider here the juvenile\u2019s petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The principal issue he raises concerns the standard by which a Juvenile Court judge determines the risk of reoffense on the part of a juvenile under \u00a7 178E <em>(j), </em>an issue that this court considered in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ronald R., </em>450 Mass. 262, 267-268 (2007). We seek to provide additional guidance concerning that standard in this opinion. We affirm the order denying the juvenile\u2019s motion for relief from registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the afternoon of May 9, 2013, the juvenile, who was then sixteen years old, approached an adult woman from behind as she was walking her dog in Lynn and pulled down the sweatpants she was wearing to her thighs. The juvenile then made a vulgar comment about the victim\u2019s private parts, grabbed his own genitals, and ran away. The woman described her assailant to the Lynn police.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Eight days later, on the afternoon of May 17, 2013, a different woman was walking four children home from school in Lynn when she felt the juvenile touch her buttocks and pull her pants to the ground. The woman called the police and provided a description of her assailant, and soon thereafter, a Lynn police officer observed the juvenile, who fit this description, on a different street from where the incident had occurred. Lynn police patrol units then stopped the juvenile. At a showup identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>procedure soon thereafter, the second woman identified the juvenile as the person who had pulled her pants down. The juvenile was placed under arrest and taken to the Lynn police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">After having the opportunity to speak with his mother, the juvenile agreed to speak with the police. He admitted that he had pulled down the second woman\u2019s pants, and when the police mentioned the first woman to the juvenile, he admitted that he had pulled down her pants as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Discussing the second incident, the juvenile explained that he had bought and smoked some marijuana that morning (May 17), and then, while walking, he \u201cjust went up to [the second woman] and pulled down her pants.\u201d The juvenile did not give a reason for pulling down the second woman\u2019s pants, saying only that he \u201cjust felt the excitement.\u201d The juvenile also did not give a reason for targeting the first woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">On May 20, 2013, two complaints issued from the Essex County Division of the Juvenile Court Department charging the juvenile with two counts of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years of age or older and one count of disorderly conduct. On January 21, 2014, at a hearing before a Juvenile Court judge, the juvenile admitted to sufficient facts with regard to each charge and entered a plea that the judge accepted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Between this hearing and the final disposition of the case, the juvenile filed a motion for relief from the obligation to register with the board, and an evidentiary hearing on the motion was held on February 27, 2014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">At that hearing, the juvenile sought to establish that he did not \u201cpose a risk of reoffending or a danger to the public,\u201d and therefore should be relieved of the obligation to register. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (/). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>He offered the report and testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Barbara Qui\u00f1ones, a forensic psychologist. Qui\u00f1ones testified to having administered a \u201cguided clinical instrument\u201d called the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR), a test that she described as \u201cstrongly validated\u201d by substantial research as an appropriate risk assessment tool for juvenile sex offenders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Qui\u00f1ones, the ERASOR enumerates twenty-five factors that have been \u201cconsistently shown to be associated with risk of re-offense,\u201d and in administering the test to the juvenile, she scored each factor as \u201cpresent, not present, [or] partially present.\u201d She found that in the juvenile\u2019s case, four of the twenty-five risk factors were present,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> twenty risk factors were not present, no risk factors were partially present, and the presence of one factor was \u201cunknown.\u201d Based on her evaluation of the juvenile, which included a lengthy interview with him, a discussion with the juvenile\u2019s mother, the administration of the ERASOR test, and other evaluative processes, Qui\u00f1ones saw no sign of deviant sexual behavior in the juvenile, in part because in her opinion such a diagnosis requires a finding of six months of deviant behavior \u2014 a period of time far longer than that involved in the juvenile\u2019s case. She also stated that in her opinion, based on research she described, the juvenile\u2019s lack of insight into why he committed the two offenses was not indicative of a higher risk of reoffense. Based on her evaluation, Qui\u00f1ones concluded that the juvenile\u2019s \u201crisk to re-offend sexually is low,\u201d adding that, in forensic psychology, \u201cthere is no category of no risk,\u201d and that \u201c[o]nce someone has committed a sexual offense, the lowest category would be low.\u201d She opined that the juvenile\u2019s risk of reoffense was so low that he should not be required to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">At a hearing in April, 2014, the judge denied the juvenile\u2019s motion for relief from registration and proceeded to set out oral findings and reasons. She described in some detail the facts of the two assaults on the two women, and stated that she found Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s testimony \u201cthoughtful,\u201d but did not credit the expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>opinion about the juvenile\u2019s lack of sexual deviance. The judge also rejected Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the juvenile posed a low risk of reoffense, \u201cbased primarily on the facts and the circumstances\u201d of the offenses, which the judge characterized as \u201cegregious.\u201d She stated that this \u201cwas a broad daylight sexual assault on two strangers in our community with no apparent measure of restraint\u201d or \u201cany understanding of why he committed these offenses.\u201d The judge determined that the juvenile posed a risk of reoffense and would be required to register with the board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The juvenile thereafter filed in the county court his petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief with respect to the order denying him relief from the obligation to register as a sex offender. The single justice stayed the judge\u2019s order requiring registration and reserved and reported the matter to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Juvenile\u2019s petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a73. </em>Asa threshold matter, the Commonwealth contends that there is no issue properly before the full court for review, because the juvenile, in the Commonwealth\u2019s view, has abandoned the claim he raised in his petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, that he filed in the county court. The argument fails. Although this court has deemed an argument waived where it was not raised either before the trial judge or in a G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition for relief, see <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 124 n.3 (2003), cert, denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004), that is not the case here. The juvenile previously has raised the substance of the claims he presents to this court, either in the Juvenile Court or before the single justice. In any event, the single justice has reserved and reported the case to this court, and it is properly before us. See <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 157, 159 (1977). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 14-15 (2010).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>2. <em>Standard for obtaining relief from registration. </em>Under the sex offender registration act, G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P (act), sex offenders, whether adults who have been convicted of a \u201csex offense\u201d within the scope of the act or juveniles adjudicated as a youthful offender or delinquent on account of committing a qualifying sex offense, are required to register as sex offenders with the board, unless relieved of doing so under one of three statutory exemptions \u2014 of which \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>is one. See <em>Ronald R., </em>450 Mass, at 264 (\u201cthere is a presumption that sex offenders must register\u201d under act). Section 178E <em>(f) </em>provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">In the case of a sex offender who has been convicted of a sex offense or adjudicated as a youthful offender or as a delinquent juvenile by reason of a sex offense, on or after December 12, 1999, and who has not been sentenced to immediate confinement, the court shall, within [fourteen] days of sentencing, determine whether the circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history indicate that the sex offender does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public. If the court so determines, the court shall relieve such sex offender of the obligation to register under [\u00a7\u00a7] 178C to 178P, inclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The juvenile claims that due process requires a judge, in determining under \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>whether a juvenile should be relieved from the obligation to register as a sex offender based on his or her \u201crisk of reoffense,\u201d to assess the probability of such risk according to an articulated standard that itself is based on objective factors. His argument is that a delinquency adjudication of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>sex offense <em>together with </em>\u201cthe juvenile court\u2019s conclusion as to the propriety for excusing (or [not]) the juvenile\u2019s registration obligation\u201d as a sex offender form the \u201cfirst step\u201d in the statutory registration process; because this is so, the procedural due process requirements applicable to this registration process come into play; and these must include a requirement that a judge performing the assessment regarding risk of reoffense under \u00a7 178E (/) do so according to a defined, objective standard. This is especially important for juveniles, he claims, because of the \u201chistorical view of the juvenile justice system as primarily rehabilitative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We disagree that a judge\u2019s determination under \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>whether to relieve a juvenile sex offender from the act\u2019s registration requirements is properly characterized as an integral part of the registration system itself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 503, 505 (2005) (registration requirement is \u201cdecision made not by the trial court, but by the ... board\u201d). See also <em>Ronald R., </em>450 Mass, at 266. But there is no question that the statutory sex offender registration regime prescribed by the act imposes both burdensome and long-lasting requirements on a sex offender that implicate his or her liberty interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There also is no question that, in offering a juvenile sex offender who has not been sentenced to immediate confinement the opportunity to be relieved of the obligation to participate in the registration system in any way, \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>provides a significant benefit. Accordingly, it is important that the statute\u2019s standards be as clear as reasonably possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In <em>Ronald R., </em>after making a delinquency adjudication based on the juvenile\u2019s commission of a sex offense (rape of a six year old child), the Juvenile Court judge imposed a suspended sentence of commitment to the Department of Youth Services until the juvenile turned eighteen and placed the juvenile on probation. <em>Ronald </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>R., </em>450 Mass. at 263. The judge then held a separate nonevidentiary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>and denied the juvenile\u2019s motion for relief from the obligation to register as a sex offender. <em>Id. </em>at 264. The judge did not make findings, written or oral, but stated that he exercised his discretion under \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>not to relieve the juvenile from registration based on the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 267, 270. This court rejected the juvenile\u2019s argument that the judge abused his discretion and, quoting \u00a7 178E <em>(f), </em>stated that the judge\u2019s \u201csole task\u201d under the statute was \u201cto \u2018determine whether the circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the [juvenile\u2019s] criminal history indicate that the [juvenile] does not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public.\u2019 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u201c <em>Id. </em>at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The juvenile in this case argues that neither the text of \u00a7 178E <em>if) </em>nor <em>Ronald R. </em>offers any meaningful guidance about how a Juvenile Court judge is to determine the \u201crisk of reoffense,\u201d creating a statutory regime that permits the standardless and inconsistent exercise of judicial discretion in violation of fundamental concepts of fairness. Cf. <em>BMW of N. Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 588 (1996) (Breyer, J., concurring) (legal standards \u201cmust offer some kind of constraint upon a . .. court\u2019s discretion, and thus protection against purely arbitrary behavior\u201d). Particularly for children, for whom the requirement to register as a sex offender may have more profound consequences than for an adult,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and in light of the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile justice system, the juvenile claims that it is imperative that this court \u201cestablish the basic parameters of the term \u2018risk\u2019 \u201d in the statutory phrase \u201crisk of reoffense.\u201d He goes on to argue that at least in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>context of juvenile sex offenders, the phrase \u201crisk of reoffense\u201d should be measured by whether the offender is \u201clikely\u201d to re-offend, and determined by analyzing factors such as the \u201cseriousness of the threatened harm, the relative certainty of the anticipated harm, and the possibility of successful intervention to prevent that harm.\u201d In support of this standard, the juvenile points to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 276 (2002), a case involving the sexually dangerous person (SDP) statute, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">As previously stated, we agree with the juvenile on the importance of providing a more focused approach to the risk assessment that \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>calls for, but disagree with his proffered standard. The Commonwealth points out, correctly, that the Legislature did not use the words \u201clikely\u201d to reoffend in \u00a7 178E <em>(f), </em>as it did in the SDP statute. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1 (definition of \u201c[sjexually dangerous person\u201d). As the SDP statute demonstrates, if the Legislature had wanted to use the \u201clikely\u201d standard in \u00a7 178E GO, it could have done so. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>407 Mass. 70, 74-75 (1990) (Legislature\u2019s inclusion of particular language in certain statutes, and omission of such language in statute at issue, indicates affirmative choice not to include that language). Although registration imposes distinct burdens on a sex offender and perhaps particularly a juvenile sex offender, the infringement on personal liberty is far less than if adjudicated an SDP. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 27914 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 615 (2012). In the circumstances, it is not reasonable to infer that the Legislature intended the phrase, \u201cdoes not pose a risk of reoffense,\u201d in \u00a7 178E (/) to mean, even for a juvenile sex offender, that he or she was not \u201clikely to reoffend.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In attempting to give more definition to the standard regarding risk of reoffense incorporated into \u00a7 178E (/), it is useful to take a somewhat functional approach. We view the standard for determining \u201crisk of reoffense\u201d under \u00a7 178E <em>(f) </em>as having two components: (1) the level of risk warranting relief from registration, and (2) the basis on which the judge assesses this risk. We consider each component separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">a. <em>Level of risk. </em>Despite the statute\u2019s indication that the judge may relieve an offender from registration only if he or she \u201cdoes not pose a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public,\u201d we do not interpret this language to mean \u201cno risk,\u201d because the absence of any risk is impossible as a matter of logic and common sense. See In re Harold W, Ill. App. Ct., No. 2-12-1235 (2d Dist. Apr. 18, 2014) (unpublished) (interpretation of statute allowing termination of sex offender registration upon showing of \u201cno risk to the community\u201d; \u201cto require proof of the complete absence of any risk would mean that no one would ever be able to satisfy the statute beyond any doubt\u201d because \u201c[tjhere is always a possibility that sex offenders will reoffend\u201d). Moreover, there appears to be a consensus among experts that it is impossible to say that a person who has committed a sex offense \u2014 which by definition includes every person potentially subject to registration under the act \u2014 poses no risk of reoffense.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We will not attribute to the Legislature the purpose of rendering \u00a7 178E (/) meaningless by means of an insurmountable standard for obtaining relief from registration. See <em>Victory Distribs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayer Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mass. 136, 140 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>372 Mass. 91, 95 (1977) (refusing to construe statute such that it \u201cwould become a useless legislative exercise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Because \u00a7 178E (/) itself does not define clearly the appropriate level of risk warranting relief from registration under \u00a7 178E (/),</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>we seek guidance on the issue from other sections of the act. See <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985) (\u201cWhen the meaning of a statute is brought into question, a court properly should read other sections and should construe them together ... so as to constitute an harmonious whole consistent with the legislative purpose\u201d [citation omitted]). See also <em>Care &amp; Protection of Jamison, </em>467 Mass. 269, 276 (2014); <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004). General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1), in particular, is pertinent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This section directs the board to establish a system by which all sex offenders required to register are classified by risk of reoffense \u2014 low, moderate, or high \u2022\u2014 according to the factors spelled out in \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a)-{l), </em>and in the board\u2019s implementing regulations, 803 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 1.40 (2013). See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 68549 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>470 Mass. 102, 105 (2014) <em>(Doe No. 68549). </em>See also G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (ti)-(c). Section 178K (1) and (2) (a) establishes \u201clow\u201d risk of reoffense as the lowest level of risk classification and, therefore, the threshold level of risk requiring registration. See <em>Doe No. 68549, supra </em>at 112. See also <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 24341 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 387 (2009) <em>(Doe No. 24341). </em>A \u201clow\u201d risk of reoffense under \u00a7 178K (1) is \u201cnot merely a hypothetical or speculative potential risk.\u201d <em>Doe No. 24341, supra </em>at 388. Rather, it is a risk that is \u201ccognizable\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u2014 i.e., \u201cperceptible\u201d; \u201c[c]apable of being known, perceived, or apprehended by the senses or intellect\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u2014 and one that can and indeed must be able to be articulated and described based on affirmative evidence. See, e.g., <em>Doe No. 68549, supra </em>at 108; <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211m. Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 762-766 (2006) <em>(Doe No. 1211). </em>It follows that to qualify for exemption from registration under \u00a7 178E (/), a juvenile sex offender\u2019s risk of reoffense should be less than this \u201clow\u201d registration-triggering risk. In other words, it is a risk that is more than \u201cno risk\u201d \u2014 and therefore more than hypothetical or purely speculative \u2014 but not as definite as what qualifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>as \u201clow\u201d under \u00a7 178K (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">b. <em>Assessment of risk ofreojfense. </em>We turn to the basis on which a Juvenile Court judge is to make the assessment of risk of reoffense under \u00a7 178E (/). The statute specifies that the judge is to determine this risk based on \u201cthe circumstances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (/). However, it is silent on the relationship between these two factors and a predictive assessment of risk of reoffense, and in the case of a juvenile sex offender particularly, that relationship is not self-evident.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The link between the circumstances of the offense and criminal history and an offender\u2019s risk of reoffense may be illuminated, however, where, as was the case here, the juvenile presents expert evidence that focuses directly on the question of risk. In this case, for example, Qui\u00f1ones testified that the juvenile\u2019s targeting of strangers \u2022\u2014 shown by the circumstances of the two offenses \u2014 indicated a risk of reoffense, but that the juvenile\u2019s commission of two sexual offenses within a brief period (eight days) did not, in her opinion, increase his risk of reoffense because he committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the second offense without having been detected as having committed the first.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If a juvenile does offer expert evidence regarding his or her risk of reoffense \u2014 e.g., expert testimony or relevant research studies by experts in the field \u2014 the judge should consider that evidence in assessing the \u201ccircumstances of the offense\u201d and ultimately determining whether to exempt the juvenile from registration.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That the judge is not bound to credit proffered expert testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeMinico, </em>408 Mass. 230, 235 (1990), does not diminish the obligation to give it serious, reasoned consideration.

L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a)-(l), </em>and the board\u2019s implementing regulations. More particularly, it may be appropriate for the judge to evaluate the juvenile\u2019s criminal history and the circumstances of his or her offense through the lens provided by these statutory and regulatory risk factors. Consideration, for example, of the juvenile sex offender\u2019s status as a juvenile at the time of the offense and the significance of that status, see G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(e), </em>would seem critical in every case.

L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E <em>(e) </em>(on Commonwealth\u2019s motion, judge may find that offender need not register) and 178K (2) <em>(d) </em>(board may determine that offender need not register). Section 178K (2) <em>id) </em>specifies that, with respect to the board, it must support a decision to \u201crelieve [an] offender of any further obligation to register\u201d upon \u201cmaking specific written findings.\u201d The absence of similar language in \u00a7 178E (/) indicates that the Legislature did not intend to impose such a requirement. See <em>Ronald R., </em>450 Mass. at 270 (although sex offender may request written findings, decision whether to issue them rests in judge\u2019s discretion). Rather, by specifying that the trial (or plea) judge is to make the determination concerning the offender\u2019s \u201crisk of reoffense\u201d and exemption from the obligation to register within two weeks of imposing sentence, the Legislature appears to have contemplated that the judge would malee the determination not on the basis of a wholly independent proceeding, but essentially in connection with the resolution of the delinquency proceeding, informed by the knowledge and understanding of the circumstances of both the offense and the offender that the judge had acquired by virtue of being the trial (or plea) judge.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ventura, </em>465 Mass. 202, 212 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although a Juvenile Court judge is not obligated to issue written findings under \u00a7 178E <em>(f), </em>and although the judge\u2019s process of determining a juvenile sex offender\u2019s relief from registration under this section may be less formal than the process required by the board under \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d), </em>it is important none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>theless for the judge to explain on the record with some specificity the reasons for his or her assessment of risk of reoffense and resulting determination whether the juvenile should be relieved of the obligation to register.

As to the second point, the record also shows that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>did explain in general terms her disagreement with some of Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s opinions. In particular, the judge explained that she did not credit the expert\u2019s opinion that the juvenile\u2019s offenses were not connected to sexual deviance or that marijuana contributed to the juvenile\u2019s offense, based on the judge\u2019s determination that the juvenile committed \u201ca broad daylight sexual assault on two strangers in our community with no apparent measure of restraint\u201d or \u201cany understanding of why he committed these offenses.\u201d The judge stated that these circumstances led her not to have confidence in Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s opinion that the juvenile\u2019s level of risk of reoffending was low enough to relieve him from the requirement of registration. In both the judge\u2019s initial explanation of her reasons for requiring the juvenile to register and her later explanation of her denial of his motion for reconsideration, the judge emphasized that she had given careful consideration to Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s testimony and opinions. Although one might take a different view of Qui\u00f1ones\u2019s testimony and opinions from that of the judge, her rejection of certain of those opinions was neither unexplained nor without any basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Furthermore, the judge\u2019s focus in her findings on certain of the circumstances of the juvenile\u2019s offenses \u2014 the daylight attacks in the public street on two separate individuals without \u201capparent... . restraint\u201d and without insight into the reasons for doing so \u2014 reflects in substance some of the concerns included in the factors for assessing risk of reoffense set out in G.

In sum, we conclude that based on the record before her, the judge\u2019s ultimate determination that the juvenile should not be relieved of the obligation to register as a sex offender did not lie \u201coutside the bounds of reasonable alternatives,\u201d <em>Adoption of Mariano, 11 </em>Mass.

An appellate court\u2019s review of a trial judge\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion must give great deference to the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion; it is plainly not an abuse of discretion simply because a reviewing court would have reached a different result.
