L. c. 265, \u00a7 21. Evidence was presented at trial that the defendant and another man intimidated victims into withdrawing funds from an automated teller machine (ATM) and handing those funds over to the defendant and the unidentified coventurer. The defendant argues that these facts do not support a finding that he had the purpose required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21. We reject this argument. We agree, however, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>defendant\u2019s alternative assertion that the trial judge erred by failing to inquire into credible information that one of the jurors had slept through important portions of the evidence. Because this was a structural error, we vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The facts supported by the evidence at trial included the following. In May, 2010, the defendant and his coventurer accosted the victims, James Fletcher, Thomas Brown, and John Wentworth, as they were walking toward their vehicle in a Worcester parking lot. The defendant and his coventurer accused the victims, in a hostile and menacing manner, of being \u201cup to trouble\u201d and selling drugs. They then ordered the victims to get into the vehicle. The victims were frightened, and they cooperated with the defendant and his accomplice in the hope that they would not be hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Fletcher drove. The defendant, who was aggressive and intermittently yelling, directed Fletcher to an ATM. The defendant told Fletcher to get out of the vehicle, led Fletcher to the ATM, and ordered Fletcher to withdraw $150 from it. Fletcher was scared; he withdrew $140 and gave it to the defendant, stating that was all the money he had. The defendant said, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s good enough.\u201d The defendant and Fletcher returned to the vehicle. While they had been gone, the coventurer had told Brown and Wentworth that the defendant would shoot them if they did not cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The coventurer then instructed Brown to get out of the vehicle. He grabbed Brown\u2019s arm and forced Brown toward the ATM. Brown withdrew twenty dollars and gave it to the coventurer, who told Brown to \u201cget back in there\u201d and to give him one hundred dollars. Brown testified that he complied, overdrawing his account in so doing. Brown and the coventurer returned to the vehicle. The defendant again directed Fletcher where to drive, and at some point the defendant and the coventurer got out of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Fletcher telephoned the Worcester police department that night and reported the incident in person the next day. The three victims subsequently identified the defendant from a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The defendant was tried on three counts of aggravated kidnapping, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26; two counts of armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17; and two counts of \u201cconfining to commit a felony,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty as to all the charges. The motion was denied. The jury acquitted the defendant on all counts of aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery, and convicted him on the two counts of confining to commit a felony. The defendant appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">2. <em>G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21. </em>At the prosecution\u2019s request, the jury instructions concerning G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21, were based on the first part of that statute,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which subjects to imprisonment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201c[wjhoever, with intent to commit larceny or any felony, confines, maims, injures or wounds, or attempts or threatens to kill, confine, maim, injure or wound, or puts any person in fear, for the purpose of stealing from a building, bank, safe, vault or other depository of money, bonds or other valuables . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the final requirement of this statute, namely, a \u201cpurpose of stealing from a building, bank, safe, vault or other depository of money, bonds or other valuables,\u201d was satisfied. His argument is, in essence, that the phrase \u201cstealing from\u201d a \u201cbank, safe, vault, or other depository\u201d denotes, in this case, stealing property owned by the ATM. The evidence, according to the defendant, supported only a finding that the defendant had a purpose of stealing property owned by the victims, not the ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\u201cWe review a question of statutory interpretation de nova ....\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perella, </em>464 Mass. 274, 276 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co., </em>463 Mass. 258, 264 n.9 (2012). \u201c[Cjriminal statutes must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth,\u201d but \u201c[tjhis does not mean that we read unambiguous statutory language to favor defendants; it means simply that. . . ambiguity must be resolved in favor of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>defendant\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>426 Mass. 391, 394 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\u201c[Statutes must be read as [a] whole to produce internal consistency.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perella, </em>464 Mass. at 279-280, citing <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 601 (2010), <em>S.C., </em>465 Mass. 297 (2013). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 681 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). Read as a whole, the \u201cpurpose of stealing\u201d required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21, cannot reasonably be understood to be limited to stealing property owned by a bank or an ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The purpose required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21, encompasses not only theft from a bank or an ATM, but also theft from a \u201cbuilding,\u201d a \u201csafe,\u201d or a \u201cvault.\u201d A \u201cbuilding,\u201d in this context, includes a dwelling. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>335 Mass. 555, 566-567 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skalberg, </em>333 Mass. 255, 255-256 (1955); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 940, 941 (1994), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 194-195 (6th ed. 1990) (defining \u201cbuilding\u201d as \u201ca structure or edifice inclosing a space within its walls and usually .. . covered with a roof\u2019 [omission in original]). A person stealing \u201cfrom\u201d a building or a safe necessarily would not be stealing the property of a building or a safe. It is thus unambiguous that the phrase \u201cstealing from\u201d in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21, does not mean \u201cstealing the property of.\u201d Rather, a purpose of stealing property \u201cfrom\u201d a location, in this context, indicates that the property was situated in that location when it was to be stolen. General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 21, thus admits of no ambiguity that need be resolved in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The defendant argues further, however, that his purpose, according to the evidence, also was not to steal property situated at the ATM. According to the defendant, the evidence showed that he had no intention of taking any money until after it had been extracted from the ATM; by that time, the defendant argues, the money was to be located on the victims\u2019 persons, not at any of the locations enumerated in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Several of the circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals have reached conflicting conclusions when presented with analogous arguments under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2012), the Federal offense of bank robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>406 F.3d 460, 463 (7th Cir. 2005), overruled on other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>grounds, <em>United States </em>v. Parker, 508 F.3d 434 (7th Cir. 2007), with <em>United States </em>v. Burton, 425 F.3d 1008, 1010-1012 (5th Cir. 2005). We share the view, articulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, that \u201c[i]f the depositor is robbed of the money he has just withdrawn after he leaves the bank, that is not a [robbery from the bank]. But if. . . the robber forces the bank\u2019s customer to withdraw the money, the customer becomes the unwilling agent of the robber . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McCarter, supra, </em>citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van, </em>814 F.2d 1004, 1006-1008 (5th Cir. 1987), and <em>Embrey </em>v. <em>Hershberger, </em>131 F.3d 739 (8th Cir. 1997) (en banc), cert, denied, 525 U.S. 828 (1998). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>645 F.3d 883, 893 (7th Cir. 2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 1537,132 S. Ct. 1538 (2012); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>670 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1321 (M.D. Fla. 2009), aff\u2019d, 385 F. App\u2019x 977 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In essence, the evidence indicated that the defendant\u2019s purpose was to steal money that was located in the ATM. The fact that he planned to do so by forcing Fletcher to take the money out for him does not negate the existence of the purpose required by</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 21, just as this purpose would not have been undermined if the defendant had planned to have a confederate remove the money from the ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">3. <em>Sleeping juror. </em>On the first day of trial, testimony was taken from two of the three victims, Fletcher and Brown. The next morning, juror no. 6 (reporting juror) told a court officer that there had been an issue with juror no. 7 (identified juror) on the previous day. The reporting juror was brought before the judge and the parties, and she provided the following account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">\u201cMy concern was [that] through most of the morning proceedings I heard a lot of snoring going on; and I looked at the person, and the person wasn\u2019t paying any attention to the testimony going on. After lunch when we came in, the snoring continued extremely loudly, to the point where it was interrupting me listening. I kind of went like this [indicating] to the person next to me to show the person \u2014 \u2018Look at this person,\u2019 and they were sound asleep through most of the afternoon trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Both the prosecutor and defense counsel stated that they had not noticed that a juror had been sleeping; but they both noted that they had not been focused on the jury. The reporting juror repeated that the woman next to her also had noticed the identified juror sleeping. The judge pointed out that \u201c[s]ome people, when they concentrate, they close their eyes.\u201d The reporting juror responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">\u201cI agree with that, and that\u2019s why I questioned it for a while. But when the snoring came; and there was one other thing that came after that. It was \u2014 you know when you wake up after a nap, the head nod, the bad breath. That\u2019s what really hit me, was \u2018Wow, he\u2019s really sleeping there.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">After hearing from the reporting juror, the judge said, \u201cMaybe I should examine him,\u201d referring to the identified juror. The judge then explained, however, \u201cI have questioned jurors before, if I\u2019ve observed them [sleeping], I haven\u2019t; so I\u2019m kind of hesitant.\u201d The prosecutor said, \u201cI think her description is fairly clear as to snoring. I think it may be something we want to ask.\u201d Defense counsel said, \u201cI would ask that you inquire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">After hearing from the parties, the judge said, \u201cWell, I would rather observe this individual now, and see what happens. If he looks like he\u2019s not paying attention, we can take steps right now.\u201d Defense counsel asked the defendant, who was present at this discussion, \u201cAre you okay with that... ?\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">At the end of the trial, the prosecutor stated that he had observed the identified juror \u201cthroughout the course of the trial, and he appeared to be awake and paying attention, taking notes.\u201d The judge remarked that he had tried to watch the identified juror but had not been able to because of the juror\u2019s position in the jury box. The judge added for the record, \u201c[B]ecause of basically my failing to observe any sleepiness during the evidence, we have done nothing with him in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s failure to inquire into the identified juror\u2019s ability to deliberate and decide the case on the evidence was a structural error that necessitates a new trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Defendants, as well as the public, have \u201ca right to decisions made by alert and attentive jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. 61, 78 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 181 (2009). Accordingly, \u201c[a] judicial ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>servation that a juror is asleep, or a judge\u2019s receipt of reliable information to that effect, requires prompt judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is true that \u201cnot every complaint regarding juror attentiveness requires a voir dire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. at 78. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 904, 905 (2009). Rather, if a judge receives a complaint or other information suggesting that a juror was asleep or otherwise inattentive, the judge must first determine whether that information is \u201creliable.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 181. In making this determination, the judge must consider the nature and source of the information presented, as well as any relevant facts that the judge has observed from the bench. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>453 Mass. 40, 47 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rzepphiewski, </em>431 Mass. 48, 54 (2000), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keaton, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 86-88 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">If a judge reaches a preliminary conclusion that information about a juror\u2019s inattention is reliable, the judge must take further steps to determine the appropriate intervention. Typically, the next step is to conduct a voir dire of the potentially inattentive juror, in an attempt to investigate whether that juror \u201cremains capable of fulfilling his or her obligation to render a verdict based on all of the evidence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 181. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>469 Mass. 266, 281 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>467 Mass. 115, 139 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 905. Judges have substantial discretion in this area, however. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. at 78, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The burden is on the defendant to show that the judge\u2019s response to information about a sleeping juror was \u201carbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass at 78, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>364 Mass. 471, 476 (1973). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>467 Mass. at 138-139. The judge\u2019s decision can best be assessed if the judge makes a record of his or her findings, initially as to the reliability of the information presented, and subsequently \u2014 if the judge finds the information reliable \u2022\u2014 as to whether the juror in question was indeed asleep or inattentive, and what portions of the evidence the juror may have missed. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>App. Ct. at 182 (where record did not reveal details of judge\u2019s observations concerning sleeping juror, record was to be developed by way of motion for new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In the current case, the judge declined to conduct a voir dire of the identified juror, or to take any other steps to determine if that juror was fit to deliberate. So far as the record reveals, the information relayed by the reporting juror showed reliably that the identified juror had slept through important portions of the trial. The reporting juror stated that the identified juror had been snoring loudly during the portion of the trial at which two of the three victims testified, and had later nodded his head as if awakening; a third juror reportedly had confirmed the reporting juror\u2019s observations. There was no apparent cause to doubt the reliability of this account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s reason for taking no further action, except to \u201cobserve [the identified juror] now, and see what happens,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was essentially that he had not himself seen the juror sleeping. But other reliable information besides a judge\u2019s observations also \u201crequires prompt judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. at 78, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 181. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>86 Mass. App. Ct. 253, 255 (2014), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 905; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyous, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 513 n.4 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Because the judge conducted no further inquiry to determine whether and, if so, when the identified juror was sleeping, \u201cthere is serious doubt that the defendant received the fair trial to which he is constitutionally entitled.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 906. The serious possibility that a juror was asleep for a significant portion of the trial is \u201c[a] structural error . . . that so infringes on a defendant\u2019s right to the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>components of a fair trial that it can never be considered harmless\u201d (omission in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass.
