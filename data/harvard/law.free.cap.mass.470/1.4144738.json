She had died \u201cquite some time\u201d earlier of multiple stab wounds. When the victim\u2019s body was discovered, the defendant and his fourteen year old daughter, who lived with the victim, were in Florida visiting one of the defendant\u2019s older daughters. In June, 2005, Steven Stewart, the man who stabbed the victim, was convicted of murder in the first degree; this court reversed his conviction in 2009 based on errors in the admission of testimony by a key witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 527-528 (2009). The defendant was indicted in July, 2010, after Stewart entered into a plea agreement under which he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, agreed to testify against the defendant, and was sentenced to time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant, who was in the midst of a highly contentious divorce from the victim, had engaged in a murder-for-hire scheme with Stewart and their mutual friend Richard Grebauski.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Grebauski, the alleged middleman, arranged to hire Stewart for $5,000 after accepting the defendant\u2019s offer of $10,000 to kill his wife. The Commonwealth\u2019s case relied heavily on evidence introduced through Stewart, who testified both to his own actions and to out-of-court statements by other asserted members of the joint venture, including Grebauski. The remainder of the evidence was based largely on out-of-court statements introduced by witnesses to those statements, such as the defendant\u2019s friends and neighbors Russell Breault, Charles Berryman, and David Phinney. A police report and a letter sent to the police, containing additional statements, were introduced in evidence by stipulation. In May, 2012, a Superior Court jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree on theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-10\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the admission of a number of out-of-court statements introduced through Stewart\u2019s testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>many under the joint venture exception to the hearsay rule; the defendant contends that the Commonwealth did not prove the existence of a joint venture, and also that some of the statements were made outside the period in which the joint venture allegedly occurred. The defendant maintains further that errors in the admission of impermissible and highly prejudicial propensity evidence, the judge\u2019s decision not to allow testimony concerning purportedly exculpatory statements made by Grebauski, and improper remarks in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument require a new trial. The defendant objected to certain of the evidentiary rulings and to some of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at trial; other asserted errors were unpreserved. The defendant also requests that we exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to grant him a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">We conclude that there was no prejudicial error or substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in any of the challenged evidentiary rulings, or in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. After careful review of the record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we discern no reason to order a new trial or to reduce the degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\"><em>Trial evidence. </em>We recite facts the jury could have found, reserving additional detail for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">In the months prior to the killing, the defendant and his wife were engaged in a hotly contested divorce. The defendant told a number of his friends that his wife intended to take the marital home and \u201ceverything else\u201d in the divorce. At one point, he told Grebauski, in Stewart\u2019s presence, that he had offered his wife money to \u201cjust go away,\u201d but she refused. Approximately two to three months before the victim was killed, the defendant, Breault, and Berryman were at Berryman\u2019s house, drinking beer, when the defendant asked if they wanted to \u201cmake some money.\u201d When Berryman responded affirmatively, thinking the defendant meant a job installing vinyl siding, the defendant explained that it was not a siding job, but that he would pay $2,000 for killing his wife, because she was going to take everything in the divorce. The defendant also said that, \u201c[i]f [his] wife takes a dime, ... he would pay $1,000 to get it back.\u201d Breault and Berryman thought that the defendant was joking. At some point either during or shortly after this conversation, Phinney arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">In December, 1979, when the defendant was at Grebauski\u2019s house, he asked if Grebauski \u201cknew anyone big, big and black that would go in there and do things to his wife that she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>never forget\u201d while the defendant was in Florida with his fourteen year old daughter, Ginger Kirby. Both Stewart and Shannon Glover Grebauski, Grebauski\u2019s then girl friend,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> heard the defendant talking about the divorce and his desire that his wife were dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">At some point thereafter, Grebauski approached Stewart, saying that he \u201c[had] a deal for\u201d Stewart, and that the defendant had offered Grebausti $5,000 to kill the defendant\u2019s wife. Stewart initially declined the offer, but, after continued \u201cprodding\u201d by Grebauski, eventually agreed to kill the defendant\u2019s wife because he owed Grebauski $500 for purchases of cocaine. Approximately a week before the victim was stabbed, Stewart told his friend Stephen Tracy that \u201cGrebauski had somebody who wanted him to do his old lady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Around December 10, 1979, a week before school vacation was to begin, the defendant and his daughter Kirby, who lived with the victim, left to visit the defendant\u2019s older daughter, Linda McCraney, who lived in Florida. Kirby stayed with McCraney in McCraney\u2019s mobile home,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the defendant stayed with his girl friend and her family. During that time, the defendant made a number of derogatory comments about his wife, including telling McCraney several times that her mother \u201cwas a whore\u201d who was sleeping with everyone on Cape Cod, and that, \u201cif [she] continued with the divorce she would be sorry for what she had done.\u201d McCraney thought that her father and sister would return to Massachusetts before school resumed on January 3 or 4,1980, but, on January 3, they had not left and showed no signs of leaving. When McCraney asked the defendant about his plans, the defendant said that \u201cit was none of [her] goddamn business and that he [would] leave whenever he[ was] ready to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">On January 3, 1980, the day planned for the killing, Stewart went to Grebauski\u2019s house. Grebauski received a telephone call from the defendant in Florida; the defendant said that \u201cit had to be done that night\u201d because Kirby needed to return to school. Grebauski gave Stewart one of two fillet knives that were kept on the kitchen windowsill, and a pair of gloves. Grebauski told Stewart that the victim would be alone in the house, because her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>son would be working and her daughter was in Florida. He told Stewart to just walk into the house and stab the victim in the heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">When Stewart drove to the victim\u2019s house for the first time that evening, no one was at home; he went to a nearby grocery store parking lot and returned shortly thereafter to see a vehicle in the driveway. He entered as Grebauski had instructed, and found the victim upstairs in the bathroom. He started to choke the victim, and she slipped and hit her head on the radiator. Stewart then stabbed the victim in the heart and left her on the floor with her head leaning up against the side of the tub. While he was moving the victim\u2019s body, he inadvertently cut her arm. He threw the knife and gloves in the Cape Cod canal, then drove to his grandmother\u2019s house in Brockton, where he telephoned Grebauski to tell him that \u201cit\u2019s done.\u201d Grebauski came to the grandmother\u2019s house, and he and Stewart discussed plans for an alibi; Stewart planned to say that he had been with Grebauski in Brockton when the victim was killed. Grebauski said that he could not pay Stewart until the defendant returned from Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">That same day, Berryman telephoned the defendant in Florida, looking for Phinney. Berryman and Phinney had been working on a vinyl siding job that was almost completed when Phinney suddenly departed for a week-long vacation in Florida. When the client contacted Berryman, angry that the job was not finished, Berryman attempted to reach Phinney at the defendant\u2019s house in Florida. Berryman asked Phinney when he would be returning to Massachusetts to complete the job, and Phinney replied, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it\u2019s going to happen tonight. Listen to your radio, watch the TV. She\u2019s going to die tonight.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Edmond Garriere, III, the son of the victim and the defendant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contacted McCraney and Kirby in Florida to tell them that their mother had been killed; they flew to Massachusetts, while the defendant drove back. At the victim\u2019s funeral service, the defendant did not go inside the church, but remained outside, sitting near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>his parked automobile. Kirby testified that the family did not want the defendant at the funeral because they believed that he had harmed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">At some point shortly after the victim\u2019s death, Stewart and Grebauski were playing pool in Grebauski\u2019s house when the defendant telephoned to say he was coming over with the money. When the defendant arrived, he said he was pleased that his wife was dead (\u201cthe bitch was out of the way\u201d), but was very angry that his son had not been killed and that the body had not been removed from the house so that it would not be discovered. After an angry exchange during which the defendant told Grebauski he would not pay all of the agreed amount, the defendant and Grebauski resolved their differences and the defendant threw $10,000, in a stack of bills bound in an elastic band, onto the pool table. When the defendant left, Grebauski and Stewart had a heated discussion about the amount Stewart would be paid. Stewart had believed that the full amount offered by the defendant was $5,000, not $10,000. Eventually, Stewart agreed to accept $4,500 for the killing, representing the $5,000 Grebauski had discussed, minus a $500 deduction for the cocaine debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">A few months after the victim was killed, Berryman encountered the defendant on the driveway at Phinney\u2019s house. The defendant approached Berryman, put his arm around Berryman\u2019s shoulder, and said, \u201cCharlie, I hear you\u2019re doing a lot of flapping.\u201d When Berryman inquired what the defendant meant by this, he responded, \u201cYou know what I mean. You keep it up, you\u2019re going to end up just like my wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Several years after the victim\u2019s death, in 1994, the defendant encountered Edmond and Edmond\u2019s wife, Sharon Cope Garriere, at a fair in the Onset section of Wareham. The defendant approached them, but Edmond refused to speak to him, claiming that the defendant was not his father. The defendant then engaged in a loud and angry verbal confrontation with Cope Garriere, saying, among other things, that Edmond had had a sexual relationship with his mother and should have been killed with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>The defendant challenges the introduction or exclusion of testimony to which there was an objection at trial, as well as testimony which was introduced without objection. Where the error was preserved, we review for prejudicial error and consider \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 23 (1999). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Commonwealth \u201cbears the risk of doubt when any exists as to the error being nonprejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reversal is not necessary if the error \u201cdid not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cruz, 445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). Where the error was unpreserved, we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>469 Mass. 447 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">2. <em>Admission of out-of-court statements. </em>\u201cOut-of-court statements by joint venturers are admissible against the others if the statements are made during the pendency of the criminal enterprise and in furtherance of it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>450 Mass. 55, 63 (2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 340 (1983). Such statements of coventurers are considered to be reliable, and are deemed \u201cequivalent to a statement by the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>454 Mass. 527, 535 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708 (1976). Before statements by coventurers may be admitted, the Commonwealth first must establish the existence of the joint venture (and the defendant\u2019s involvement in it) by a preponderance of the evidence, independent of the out-of-court statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 844 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 709 n.7. If the judge is satisfied that the Commonwealth has met this burden, the statement may be admitted, and the jury are instructed that they may consider the statements only if they find that a joint venture existed independent of the statements, and that the statements were made in furtherance of that venture. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bright, </em>463 Mass. 421, 427 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 693 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 844-846.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Here, numerous out-of-court statements made by Grebauski, Stewart, and Phinney were introduced under the joint venture exception to the hearsay rule, the majority through Stewart\u2019s testimony. The defendant argues that the Commonwealth did not establish the existence of a joint venture between the defendant and Grebauski, Stewart, or Phinney, and therefore that many of the out-of-court statements should not have been admitted. The defendant argues also that, even if the evidence was sufficient to establish a joint venture among himself, Grebauski, and Stewart, Grebauski\u2019s statements should not have been admitted because they were testimonial and introduced in violation of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Turning first to this later argument, the claim is unavailing. A defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront the witnesses against him, see <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>\u201cdoes not bar the admission of statements that a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would not objectively foresee as being used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, supra </em>at 63-64, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>445 Mass. 1, 12-13 (2005), cert, denied, 548 U.S. 926 (2006). This inquiry looks to the intent of the declarant and the specific circumstances of the statement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 12. \u201cCertainly, just after the murder, in the privacy of [a residence], neither [coventurer] would have reasonably foreseen [his] statements being used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burton, supra </em>at 64. \u201cMany other jurisdictions have reached a similar conclusion, holding in general that statements of joint venturers (or coperpetrators or coconspirators) are the type of remarks that the <em>Crawford </em>Court deemed nontestimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 56 (\u201cstatements in furtherance of a conspiracy\u201d are not testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">a. <em>Evidence of existence of joint venture. </em>The defendant challenges as improper hearsay testimony the introduction of Stewart\u2019s description of statements Grebauski made to him concerning the defendant\u2019s plan to kill his wife, particularly that, on the night of the killing, Grebauski told Stewart that the defendant had said during a telephone call from Florida that \u201cit had to be done that night\u201d because the defendant\u2019s daughter had to return to school. The defendant also contests testimony by Stewart\u2019s friend Stephen Tracy describing what Stewart told him about someone wanting Grebauski \u201cto do his old lady\u201d a few weeks before the victim\u2019s death; Berryman\u2019s testimony regarding the substance of the telephone call with Phinney in Florida on the day of the stabbing; and State police Sergeant Paul White\u2019s testimony that Phinney told him that he went to Florida in part to provide an alibi for the defendant. The defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude Tracy\u2019s testimony, and thereafter objected when it was introduced at trial. Defense counsel objected to portions of Stewart\u2019s and Berryman\u2019s trial testimony; the defendant did not object to White\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The Commonwealth maintains that the evidence of joint venture was stronger in this case than in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 534-536, in which the court concluded that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sufficient evidence of a joint venture among the defendant, Grebauski, and Stewart, but insufficient evidence of Phinney\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">We conclude that the evidence in this case was more than sufficient to permit the jury to find that the defendant entered into a joint venture with Grebauski and Stewart to kill his wife. Therefore, save for a few exceptions that we discuss <em>infra, </em>the statements by Grebauski and Stewart were admissible as made in furtherance of the joint venture to kill the defendant\u2019s wife.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bright, supra </em>at 426-427; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra. </em>Moreover, the defendant\u2019s own statements made in furtherance of the joint venture to kill his wife are not hearsay, and were admitted properly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bright, supra </em>at 426 n.8, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 365-366 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">b. <em>Scope of joint venture. </em>We turn to consideration of particular statements that the defendant contends were, even if we conclude that there was sufficient evidence of a joint venture, beyond its scope. The defendant maintains that certain statements were inadmissible because they were made before the joint venture was formed, or after it ended. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 452 (1988) (statements of joint venturer not admissible after joint venture has ended). The inquiry to determine if a statement is made during the pendency of the joint venture, however, \u201cfocuses not on whether the crime has been completed, but on whether a joint venture was continuing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 537, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>449 Mass. 316, 322 (2007). Statements made prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>formation of a joint venture may be admissible if they were made in furtherance of a joint venture that formed thereafter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 248 (2000) (\u201cMatters surrounding the history of the conspiracy, including statements of coconspirators, may be admissible even if they predate the conspiracy\u201d). Statements made in an effort to conceal a crime, made after the crime has been completed, may be admissible under the joint venture exception because the joint venture is then ongoing, with a purpose to ensure that the joint venture itself remains concealed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braley, supra </em>at 322; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 211 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The defendant challenges Stewart\u2019s testimony about Grebauski\u2019s initial $5,000 offer, and Tracy\u2019s statement that Stewart said Grebauski had someone who wanted Grebauski to \u201cdo his old lady\u201d as having been made before the joint venture was formed. The challenged statements, however, were probative of the defendant\u2019s intent to kill his wife and of the defendant\u2019s, Stewart\u2019s, and Grebauski\u2019s actions in furtherance of that intent several months later. The judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that these statements concerning the formation of the joint venture were not \u201ctoo remote to be relevant.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rankins, </em>429 Mass. 470, 474 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendant also challenges Stewart\u2019s testimony regarding the theft of two truckloads of lumber, in which he, the defendant, and Grebauski were involved, as being outside the scope of the joint venture to kill the victim. The testimony was introduced to support a finding that the three would have been involved in a subsequent joint venture to perpetrate the killing. We agree that this testimony should not have been admitted on this ground. The ' lumber theft took place in 1977, several years before the defendant told his friends and acquaintances that he was seeking someone to kill his wife, and did not form any part of the later joint venture to perpetrate the killing. The testimony about another criminal enterprise in which the defendant was involved thus was not relevant to any issue in the case, and served only to suggest that the defendant was likely to engage in criminal activity. Because the Commonwealth contends in its brief that the testimony was also admissible to show motive and intent, we reserve for later discussion, see part 4, <em>infra, </em>our consideration whether the admission of this unobjected-to testimony was error resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">3. <em>Propensity evidence. </em>The defendant asserts that certain of his statements and testimony concerning his conduct after his wife\u2019s death should not have been admitted because the evidence was more prejudicial than probative and was introduced merely to paint a negative portrait of his character. We consider each challenged statement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">a. <em>Statements that defendant wanted his son killed. </em>The defendant asserts error in the admission of testimony that, in addition to his wife, the defendant sought to have his son killed. This evidence included testimony by Stewart that when Grebauski initially made the $5,000 offer to Stewart to kill the defendant\u2019s wife, Grebauski said that the defendant also wanted his son killed, but Stewart refused to have anything to do with the son or with moving the wife\u2019s body. The evidence also included testimony by Stewart that, at Grebauski\u2019s house after the stabbing, the defendant was reported to have been angry that his son had not been killed; and testimony by the defendant\u2019s daughter-in-law that, in 1994, she and the defendant\u2019s son encountered the defendant at a fair in Onset, where the defendant told the son that he should have been killed just like his mother. The Commonwealth sought to introduce this evidence under the joint venture exception, maintaining that a plan to kill the defendant\u2019s son was part of the joint venture among Stewart, Grebauski, and the defendant to kill his wife. In its brief, the Commonwealth asserts also that the evidence is relevant to the defendant\u2019s motive to kill his wife. The defendant did not object to the admission of most of this testimony at trial, but did object to certain statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">We conclude that the evidence was not sufficient to support the existence of a joint venture to kill the defendant\u2019s son. The only evidence of the defendant\u2019s solicitation of participants in a joint venture to kill his son, or of others\u2019 possible agreement to participate in such a venture, was introduced through Stewart. Stewart testified that, when Grebauski initially had asked him about killing the defendant\u2019s wife, Stewart told Grebauski that he refused to have anything to do with killing the son or moving the wife\u2019s body. The plan between Grebauski and Stewart proceeded with the killing of the defendant\u2019s wife. Stewart also testified that he \u201cassumed\u201d that the conversation about the son meant that the defendant and Grebauski had discussed the matter previously. Stewart further testified that, after the killing, Grebauski said the defendant was angry that the son had not been killed and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>wife\u2019s body had not been moved. Because Stewart explicitly refused to participate in any plan to kill the son (which apparently went by the wayside upon Stewart\u2019s refusal), Stewart was not a member of a joint venture to kill the son, and his statements about any such venture, if one existed, do not fall under the joint venture exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Nor was there sufficient evidence independently to support the existence of a joint venture to kill the defendant\u2019s son. The only evidence of such a joint venture was the hearsay statements by Stewart. The statements by the defendant at the fair in Onset, years after the killing, that his son should have been killed like the defendant\u2019s wife, do not indicate anything about the defendant\u2019s involvement in a joint venture years earlier that might have been formed with an intent to kill the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The Commonwealth asserts also that the defendant\u2019s hostility toward his son is probative of the defendant\u2019s hostility toward the victim. Evidence of a defendant\u2019s hostility towards his spouse may be admissible to show a defendant\u2019s motive to kill the spouse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dung Van Tran, </em>463 Mass. 8, 15 (2012). Here, however, evidence of the defendant\u2019s hostility towards his son does not render the desired inference of the defendant\u2019s hostility toward the victim and intent to kill her more probable than it would have been absent such evidence without asking the jury to make impermissible inferences concerning the defendant\u2019s character. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989). The defendant\u2019s motive to kill his wife is unrelated to any motive he may have had to kill his son. The two crimes were separate and distinct. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive to kill his wife hinged on her refusing to give him a divorce or to accept money to \u201cjust go away,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s belief that his wife would take everything he owned in a divorce. There was no such motive for the defendant to want to kill his son. Furthermore, statements made years after the victim\u2019s death were not, as the Commonwealth argues, \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the plan to kill the defendant\u2019s wife. We agree that the evidence that the defendant said he wanted his son killed was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Moreover, the evidence was not crucial to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Although the evidence of the defendant throwing $10,000 on the pool table, and his argument with Grebauski about whether the whole amount should be paid, was part of the course of the joint venture, the argument also involved the defendant\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>pressed anger over the manner in which the victim had been killed, and the fact that her body had not been removed from the house as he had told Grebauski he wanted done. Likewise, Stewart\u2019s argument with Grebauski over the $5,000 he believed had been offered for the stabbing, and the amount of $10,000 that the defendant had discussed with Grebauski, did not involve the defendant\u2019s son. Thus, the Commonwealth could have presented its case effectively without statements about a hypothetical crime that never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Nonetheless, given the extensive, properly admitted testimony about the defendant\u2019s statements that he wanted his wife killed, and his efforts to hire someone to do so; his trip to Florida and his statements while in Florida; and his actions following the victim\u2019s death, the admission of the testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s statements about his son was unlikely to have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>435 Mass. 569, 578-579 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">b. <em>Evidence of defendant\u2019s hostility toward victim. </em>The defendant contends also that other testimony, both objected to and not objected to at trial, was unduly prejudicial and introduced to attack his character by portraying him as what the defendant characterizes as an \u201cevil\u201d man who did not like his family (a \u201ccold monster or devil. . . who cared so little about his wife and children\u201d). The challenged testimony includes the statement by the defendant\u2019s daughter McCraney that the defendant said her mother was a \u201cwhore\u201d who was engaging in sex with \u201ceveryone on Cape Cod\u201d; that while McCraney and the defendant\u2019s younger daughter flew back from Florida upon being told of the victim\u2019s death, the defendant instead chose to drive back; and that the defendant did not attend his wife\u2019s funeral. The defendant also challenges the admission of statements by Glover Grebauski, Grebauski\u2019s then girl friend, that, approximately one month before the stabbing, the defendant had asked if Grebauski \u201cknew anyone big, big and black that would go in there and do things to his wife that she would never forget.\u201d The Commonwealth maintains that this evidence was admitted properly to show the defendant\u2019s state of mind and intent toward the victim, and that the judge\u2019s instruction on prior bad acts was sufficient to cure any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Evidence of a defendant\u2019s adversarial or hostile relationship with a spouse may be admissible to show a defendant\u2019s motive to kill the spouse. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dung Van Tran, </em>463 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Mass. 8, 15 (2012) (evidence that defendant was abusive to estranged wife and children and had threatened to kill them prior to starting fire in wife\u2019s house was admissible because it \u201ctended to show the defendant\u2019s long-standing and persistent anger and hostility toward\u201d his family and thus was relevant to establish motive and intent); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>441 Mass. 459, 464 (2004) (defendant\u2019s use of cocaine and association with prostitutes admissible to show motive to kill wife, because it supported inference that defendant would seek money from wife\u2019s inheritance to support these habits); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>416 Mass. 831, 837 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 651 (1998) (out-of-court statements concerning witness\u2019s conversation with victim admissible to show hostile relationship between defendant and victim, in order to establish defendant\u2019s state of mind and motive to kill victim); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gil, </em>393 Mass. 204, 215 (1984) (evidence of hostile relationship between defendant and spouse may be admissible as relevant to defendant\u2019s motive to kill spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Although the derogatory statements about the defendant\u2019s wife were prejudicial to the defendant, they were not unfairly prejudicial. The defendant\u2019s intent, and his participation in the planning of the killing that was carried out by Stewart and Grebauski, were key issues in the case, and the statements were clearly probative on those issues. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>463 Mass. 378, 387-388 (2012). The statement concerning \u201csomeone big, big and black,\u201d who would do things his wife would never forget, is similarly relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind and his hostility toward the victim. Although, as the defendant emphasizes, the statement contained both racial and sexual overtones, it was not of such an unduly inflammatory nature as to require a conclusion that the judge abused his discretion in allowing its admission, where its probative value concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind was strong. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>452 Mass. 284, 294 (2008) (that evidence on material matter is \u201cgruesome\u201d or \u201cinflammatory\u201d does not necessarily render it inadmissible). There was also no error in the judge\u2019s decision to permit the introduction of evidence that the defendant drove rather than flew home after being informed of his wife\u2019s death, and that he did not attend the victim\u2019s funeral. Evidence of a defendant\u2019s behavior after a victim\u2019s death may be admissible where it is probative of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the killing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, supra </em>at 466-467; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardarelli, </em>433 Mass. 427, 434 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">4. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>Stewart testified that, approximately two years before the killing, he and Grebauski stole two truckloads of lumber from a lumberyard in Wareham, at the behest of the defendant, with Stewart acting as the driver, and that Grebauski paid him $2,500 for the job. In addition to his argument that testimony concerning the theft of the two truckloads of lumber was beyond the scope of the joint venture, see part 2, <em>supra, </em>the defendant argues that the testimony was not relevant to any issue in the case, and was introduced impermissibly only to attack his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Evidence of prior bad acts \u201cis not admissible to show a defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity to commit the charged crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dwyer, 448 Mass. 122, 128 (2006). It may, however, \u201cbe admissible if relevant for other purposes such as \u2018common scheme, pattern of operation, . . . identity, intent or motive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. 61, 80 (2010) (evidence of misconduct or prior bad acts may be admissible to show defendant\u2019s motive, intent, or state of mind). Even if such evidence is relevant for other purposes, its probative value must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>456 Mass. 182, 192 (2010); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We conclude that, in addition to not supporting the formation of a later joint venture to kill the defendant\u2019s wife, the testimony concerning the lumber theft also should not have been admitted to show motive or intent. The lumber theft was too remote in time to make the formation of a joint venture among the defendant, Stewart, and Grebauski to kill the victim more likely, and bore little, if any, probative value on a motive to kill the victim. It served therefore merely to paint the defendant as someone prone to criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Nonetheless, there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in the erroneous admission of this evidence. In the context of the other evidence at trial concerning the brutal killing and the victim\u2019s efforts to defend herself, the theft of materials from a lumber yard was a relatively minor offense. Furthermore, Stewart testified that Grebauski, who was \u201cinto everything,\u201d and not the defendant, paid him to be a driver in the lumber yard theft. Moreover, defense counsel made use of the lumber theft evidence as part of his defense strategy. In both opening statement and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>closing argument, defense counsel argued that Grebauski, not Stewart, killed the victim, and that the lumber theft gave Gre-bauski an independent motive to want the victim dead, because both the victim and the defendant\u2019s son Edmond were planning to testify against Grebauski at his upcoming trial on charges stemming from the lumber theft.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">5. <em>Exclusion of statement by deceased joint venturer. </em>The defendant argues that his right to due process was violated when the judge denied his motion to admit, as a statement against penal interest, testimony from David Mello that, while he and his friend Grebauski were driving past the victim\u2019s house at some point within a month of the stabbing, Grebauski said, \u201cSee that white house there? I offed the bitch. She was getting to be too much trouble and I killed her. I had to wait until her daughter went to Florida with her father before I could kill her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">A defendant has a constitutional right to present a defense, and to offer evidence that another person committed the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galloway, </em>404 Mass. 204, 208-209 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>392 Mass. 558, 562 (1984). An out-of-court statement \u201cis admissible under the penal interest exception if (1) the declarant\u2019s testimony is unavailable; (2) the statement so far tends to subject the declarant to criminal liability that a reasonable person in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true; and (3) the statement, if offered to exculpate the accused, is corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>428 Mass. 672, 677 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 73 (1986). A judge determining whether to admit such a statement \u201cshould not base his determination on an assessment of the proffered witness\u2019s credibility,\u201d but rather should consider several factors, including the relationship between the declarant and the witness, the reliability and character of the declarant, and \u201cthe credibility of the declarant and the credibility and probativity of his statement\u201d to assess whether \u201cthere is some reasonable likelihood that the statement could be true\u201d given the other evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 75-76 (citation omitted). Where the question of corroboration of the declarant\u2019s credibility or trustworthiness is a close one, a judge should err in favor of allowing the statement to be admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tague, </em>434 Mass. 510, 516-517 (2001), cert, denied, 534 U.S. 1146 (2002) (judges should favor admission of statements against penal interest and leave assessments of credibility and weight to jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The judge denied the motion to admit Mello\u2019s testimony on the ground that Grebauski\u2019s statement did not meet the third prong of the requirements for a statement against penal interest, that the statement be corroborated by circumstances clearly indicating its trustworthiness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, supra. </em>The judge noted that, in addition to being Mello\u2019s cocaine supplier, Grebauski had engaged in a number of criminal ventures with Mello, including selling drugs, stealing, and automobile theft. He concluded that there was no corroborating evidence, and that nothing in the circumstances indicated the proffered testimony was trustworthy. Given a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence, and that, in considering a statement against penal interest, \u201c[t]he jury, rather than the judge, should evaluate the credibility of the witness,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, supra </em>at 76, Mello\u2019s proffered testimony should have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tague, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">There was no prejudice, however, in the decision not to leave the question of Mello\u2019s or Grebauski\u2019s credibility to the jury. Grebauski\u2019s statement that he \u201coffed\u201d the victim was not exculpatory and did nothing to undermine the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that Grebauski participated in the killing at the defendant\u2019s request, while the defendant was the mastermind. Whether Grebauski killed the victim himself, or hired Stewart to do so, did not exculpate the defendant; under either theory of the crime, the defendant asked Grebauski to kill the victim, and paid him for having done so. Given the other evidence of Grebauski\u2019s involvement, the statement would have \u201chad but very slight effect\u201d on the jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">6. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that a new trial is required based on two improper aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. He maintains first that the prosecutor misstated the law and impermissibly shifted the burden of proof by several of his remarks. The defendant maintains further that certain of the prosecutor\u2019s comments were highly inflammatory and not based on the evidence, but rather were inappropriate efforts to attack the defendant\u2019s character and to portray him as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201cmastermind,\u201d a \u201cpuppet master,\u201d and the \u201carchitect of a murder for hire\u201d who wished to \u201cenvelop\u201d himself in \u201ca cloak of darkness\u201d and a \u201cveil of secrecy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Prosecutors may not \u201cmisstate the evidence or refer to facts not in evidence\u201d or \u201cplay ... on the jury\u2019s sympathy or emotions, or comment on the consequences of a verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516-517 (1987). They may, however, argue \u201cforcefully for a conviction based on the evidence and on inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516. \u201cRemarks made during closing arguments are considered in the <em>context of </em>the entire argument, and in light of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>450 Mass. 132, 140 (2007). The absence of an objection at trial may be viewed as \u201csome indication that the tone [and] manner ... of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s argument were not unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 380 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 360 (1985). \u201c[Ijnstructions may mitigate any prejudice in the final argument.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">a. <em>Statements concerning Commonwealth\u2019s burden. </em>As he did at trial, the defendant challenges certain of the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the defendant maintains were misstatements of law that shifted the burden of proof away from the Commonwealth, or that would have resulted in juror confusion as to the standard of proof necessary for a conviction. He points particularly to the prosecutor\u2019s comment that it was the jury\u2019s duty to \u201cdetermine what happened or what didn\u2019t happen,\u201d and \u201cto determine what version [of events] is the correct version. What is it that happened?\u201d He also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he term \u2018verdict\u2019 comes from the Latin \u2018veritas,\u2019 truth; and \u2018dicta,\u2019 to speak. Speak the truth. Thirty-two years is a long time; and now it\u2019s time for you, jurors, to speak the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Following closing arguments, the defendant sought a curative instruction as to these statements. He argued that telling the jury that their job is to decide \u201cwhich version is correct. . . shifts the burden,\u201d and, \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for the truth here. They\u2019re looking to see whether the Commonwealth has proved their case [beyond a reasonable doubt].\u201d The judge declined to give such an instruction. In his final charge, however, the judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201c[Y]our function as the jury is to determine the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>case. You are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You alone will determine, What evidence do I accept? How important any evidence is that you do accept. And what conclusions you can draw from all of the believable evidence in this case. After that, you must apply the law as I\u2019m going to state it to you to the facts as you have determined them to be in order to decide whether the Commonwealth has, as it must, proven this particular Defendant guilty of the offense known as murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u201cIt is improper for a prosecutor to equate a guilty verdict with justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra </em>at 140. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 328-329 (2000) (request to jury to \u201cdo your job\u201d and, implicitly, to find defendant guilty, was not permissible argument). Even assuming that certain of the prosecutor\u2019s statements could be seen as implicitly urging the jury to do their job and find the defendant guilty, the majority of the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the defendant characterizes as burden-shifting did not suggest that the Commonwealth\u2019s burden was less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or that the jury could do their duty only by reaching a guilty verdict. Indeed, early in his argument the prosecutor noted that the defendant\u2019s counsel had misspoken at one point and suggested that the burden of proof rested on defense counsel; the prosecutor then correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">\u201cBut many times, he also said the burden is on the Commonwealth. And folks, make no mistake about that. That is absolutely 100 percent true. The burden is on the government here to prove this case to you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement regarding the jury\u2019s duty to determine what happened, and to seek the truth, were not improper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 471-472 (1998) (prosecutor may urge jury to \u201cdo [their] duties as jurors to return a just verdict\u201d). It is appropriate for counsel to \u201cimpress upon the jury their duty to act with . . . impartiality.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>La-Corte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 707 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">A few of the prosecutor\u2019s comments were more questionable. The remark that the jury had to determine which of two stories was the true version of events did not, standing alone, inform the jury that their duty was to decide whether the Commonwealth had proved the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>than to pick between two scenarios proffered by the attorneys.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Viewed in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s entire closing argument, however, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra, </em>there was no prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, supra </em>(prosecutor\u2019s remark that jury were courageous and that he believed they would return truthful verdict not improper). Immediately before and after making this statement, the prosecutor informed the jury correctly that the Commonwealth had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that it was their exclusive province to determine what the facts were. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was followed by the judge\u2019s detailed and proper instructions that explained the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; the instructions also emphasized that opening statements and closing arguments are not evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra </em>at 140-141 (prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cjustice delayed is justice denied\u201d was improper, but error did not create substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice because jury knew that thirty years had passed since killing occurred and argument was followed by appropriate jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>instructions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, supra </em>at 232, and cases cited (where prosecutor made improper burden-shifting comments in closing, defendant must show that effect on jury was sufficiently prejudicial to merit reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">b. <em>Inflammatory remarks. </em>\u201cA prosecutor must limit comment in closing statement to the evidence and fair inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 646 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 270 (1994). Nonetheless, a prosecutor may argue zealously in support of inferences favorable to the Commonwealth\u2019s case that reasonably may be drawn from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. 745, 748-749 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 376 (1989) (\u201cto the degree the recitation of the evidence was inflammatory, that was inherent in the odious . . . nature of the crime[ ] committed\u201d). Although forceful, the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the defendant seems to have been based properly on reasonable inferences that could have been drawn from the evidence. The suggestion that the defendant was a \u201cmastermind\u201d and the \u201carchitect of a murder for hire\u201d was grounded in the evidence of months of planning by the defendant to arrange his wife\u2019s killing in Massachusetts while he was with friends and relatives in Florida; the characterization of the defendant as a \u201cpuppet master,\u201d while perhaps hyperbolic, also rested on this evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 472-473, and cases cited (\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s remarks were characteristic of \u2018enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,\u2019 and did not cross the line between fair and improper argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Moreover, even if certain of the remarks might have been better avoided, there was no error giving rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Given the properly admitted evidence, the comments that the defendant wanted someone else to \u201cdo the dirty work\u201d so that he could have an alibi, or that he \u201cwishe[d] to envelop\u201d himself \u201cin a cloak of darkness, in a shroud of secrecy,\u201d did not step over the line of zealous advocacy. Furthermore, during his final charge immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s closing, the judge instructed that closing arguments are not evidence, but \u201cmerely an opportunity for [the attorneys] to sum up from their perspective what they felt the evidence might suggest or mean to you.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, supra </em>at 140-141; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 517 (\u201cinstructions may mitigate any prejudice in the final argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>6. <em>Review pursuant to G.

Therefore, Berryman\u2019s testimony concerning Phinney\u2019s statement over the telephone, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it\u2019s going to happen tonight. Listen to your radio, watch the TV. She\u2019s going to die tonight,\u201d should not have been admitted. The objected-to admission of this evidence, however, did not result in prejudicial error. The statement was cumulative of substantial other evidence of the defendant\u2019s plan to kill the victim on January 3, and also was cumulative of other evidence that Phinney unexpectedly traveled to Florida with his family a few days previously, inferably in part to provide an alibi for the defendant. Moreover, at trial, Phinney denied having made the statement, and said that he had told Berryman after being notified of the victim\u2019s death to watch the news for further details if Berryman did not already know them. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Testimony suggested that the defendant was estranged from Edmond in part because of Edmond\u2019s plan to testify against Grebauski.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Although the defendant made no mention of this statement, we note that, toward the end of his closing, having summarized the evidence and immediately after his statement that thirty-two years is a long time, the prosecutor said, \u201cEdmond Garriere, Jr. is guilty of murder in the first degree under the theory of deliberate premeditation; and he\u2019s guilty of murder in the first degree by extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d A prosecutor may not \u201cinterject his personal belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d into his closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>461 Mass. 198, 206 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Good, </em>409 Mass. 612, 623 (1991). In the context of the surrounding statements, however, the jury reasonably could have understood this statement as the prosecutor arguing permissibly that they should find the defendant guilty based on the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 424-425 (1990). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>425 Mass. 491, 500 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244,277 (1982) (jury \u201ccould be expected to take both arguments with a grain of salt\u201d and would be able to sort out excessive claims made by prosecutor).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">In any event, even if the statement were improper, it resulted in no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. At the beginning of his closing, the prosecutor himself said that the jury must find the facts and that their collective memories alone would determine what the facts were, not the attorneys\u2019 views of the evidence. Later, before summarizing the evidence, he argued properly, \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that you will be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In addition, the closing was followed by the judge\u2019s forceful instructions on the attorneys\u2019 arguments being merely their view of the evidence, and his instructions on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and the jury\u2019s duty to determine the facts and how much, if any, of the witnesses\u2019 testimony they believed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
