It is a term often used, probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). So begins the venerable <em>Webster </em>charge on reasonable doubt. The <em>Webster </em>charge informs the jury that a reasonable doubt exists when \u201cthey cannot say they feel an <em>abiding conviction, </em>to a <em>moral certainty, </em>of the truth of the charge\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>For more than 150 years, this charge has delivered the preferred language for explaining reasonable doubt to jurors sitting on criminal trials in the Commonwealth. Yet, it has never been required and, in this case, it was eschewed in favor of an instruction that permitted a conviction if the jury were \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The defendant was acquitted on eighteen counts of statutory rape, but convicted on seven counts of the lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen. He appeals his convictions on grounds that the charge on reasonable doubt was constitutionally inadequate and that the lesser included offenses should not have been submitted to the jury. With respect to the former, he argues that, even if the charge was constitutionally sound, we should exercise our general superintendence power to require the <em>Webster </em>charge in all criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review and now conclude that the judge\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt passed constitutional muster and that there was no error in the submission of the lesser included offenses to the jury. Nonetheless, we also conclude that, pursuant to our superintendence power, a modernized version of the <em>Webster </em>charge must be given in criminal trials on a prospective basis. The defendant is not entitled to a special retroactive application of this new rule. Consequently, we affirm the judgments of conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence presented at trial, reserving certain details for discussion of the issues on appeal. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>1980, the defendant, who was then the boy friend and later the husband of the victim\u2019s mother, began living with the victim and her family. The victim was six years of age at that time. According to the victim, it was not long before the defendant began sexually abusing her. It began with the defendant\u2019s touching of the victim\u2019s breasts and vaginal area while she was in the bathtub. The victim testified that the abuse steadily became more invasive: the defendant placed his fingers between the folds of her genital opening, rubbed his penis between her buttocks and in her vaginal area, performed oral sex on her, and required her to perform oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The victim also testified that, over the course of the abuse, she observed the defendant choke, slap, and punch her mother, throw objects at her, and rip hair out of her head. The defendant told the victim that he would stop abusing her mother if the victim submitted to his advances. He said that if she. told anyone about his sexual advances, the victim and her siblings would be placed in foster homes and their mother would go to jail. Nonetheless, in 1985, the victim told her mother that the defendant had been \u201ctouching\u201d her. The victim\u2019s mother confronted the defendant, who denied the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The character of the abuse escalated in May, 1987, when the victim was approximately thirteen years of age. It was then, the victim alleged, that the defendant began having full vaginal intercourse with her in addition to the other acts previously described. The final act of abuse occurred on October 31, 1989. As a condition to going out on Halloween, the victim alleged that she was required to perform oral sex on the defendant. The victim did not return home, instead seeking the refuge of a friend \u2014 to whom she then revealed her history of sexual abuse at the hands of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On September 19, 1990, an Essex County grand jury returned six indictments, each charging the defendant with three counts of statutory rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. Each indictment reflected a distinct period of time during which the rapes were alleged to have occurred, with each charge representing a distinct mode of rape during the time frame of the corresponding indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather than stand trial, the defendant fled to Mexico and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>return until 2010. In 2012, the defendant was tried by jury in the Superior Court. The judge instructed the jury, sua sponte and over the defendant\u2019s objection, on the lesser included charge of indecent assault and battery as to seven counts reflecting the earliest incidents of alleged penile and digital penetration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge reasoned that, \u201cgiven [the victim\u2019s] state of development... there may be an issue as to whether there was penetration or not. That does not include those charges that specify oral intercourse . . . because there, again, there\u2019s not a real issue of penetration there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The judge also gave what he said was his \u201ctraditional instruction\u201d as to what is meant by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel objected to the instruction, specifically requesting the language of the <em>Webster </em>charge that in order to convict the jurors must feel \u201can abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charges.\u201d The judge overruled the objection and submitted the case to the jury. During deliberations, the jury asked for clarification of the reasonable doubt standard. Defense counsel again asked that the jury be given the <em>Webster </em>charge. The judge again denied the request, electing instead to repeat his initial instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">On each of the eighteen counts of statutory rape, the jury found the defendant not guilty. However, on each of the seven counts of indecent assault and battery on a child, the jury found the defendant guilty. The defendant was sentenced to three consecutive and three concurrent terms of not less than nine but not more than ten years in the State prison, as well as a consecutive term of five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>The reasonable doubt instruction. </em>In a criminal case, due process requires that the Commonwealth prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 342 (1995), citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). The defendant in this case contends that the judge\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights by diluting the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and by shifting it, in part, to the defendant. \u201cA constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt instruction amounts to a structural error which defies analysis by harmless error standards.\u201d <em>Pinckney, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u201c[T]he Constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. at 342, quoting <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 5 (1994). However, the words used must \u201cimpress[] upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Pinckney, supra </em>at 344. See <em>Victor, supra </em>at 15, quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315 (1979). In 1850, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw elaborated on the proof required to create such near certitude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cThen, what is reasonable doubt? It is a term often used, probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined. It is not mere possible doubt; because every thing relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case, which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge. The burden of proof is upon the prosecutor. All the presumptions of law independent of evidence are in favor of innocence; and every person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. If upon such proof there is reasonable doubt remaining, the accused is entitled to the benefit of it by an acquittal. For it is not sufficient to establish a probability, though a strong one arising from the doctrine of chances, that the fact charged is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>more likely to be true than the contrary; but the evidence must establish the truth of the fact to a reasonable and moral certainty; a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfies the reason and judgment, of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it. This we take to be proof beyond reasonable doubt; because if the law, which mostly depends upon considerations of a moral nature, should go further than this, and require absolute certainty, it would exclude circumstantial evidence altogether.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><em>Webster, </em>5 Cush, at 320. These carefully selected words became known as the <em>Webster </em>charge, which, with minor modification, has since been \u201cthe preferred and adequate charge on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>433 Mass. 539, 546-547 (2001).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">That is not to say, however, that the <em>Webster </em>charge \u2014 and, in particular, its \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language \u2014 has been immune to criticism. In <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 13-16, the United States Supreme Court traced the lineage of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe common meaning of the phrase has changed since it was used in the <em>Webster </em>instruction, and it may continue to do so to the point that it conflicts with the <em>Winship </em>standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Notwithstanding this admonition, the Court held that, in the context of the <em>Webster </em>charge as a whole, the phrase did not suggest \u201ca standard of proof lower than due process requires or as allowing conviction on factors other than the government\u2019s proof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In a concurring opinion in the <em>Victor </em>case, Justice Ginsburg extolled the virtues of the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction 21 (1998), which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There are very few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>things in this world that we know with absolute certainty, and in criminal cases the law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt. If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you must find him guilty. If on the other hand, you think there is a real possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 27 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part), quoting Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction 21. According to Justice Ginsburg, the \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d standard of Instruction 21 represents a marked improvement over the \u201canachronism of \u2018moral certainty\u2019 \u201d set forth in the <em>Webster </em>charge. <em>Id. </em>at 26. Several State supreme courts and Federal circuit courts have likewise endorsed Instruction 21.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Here, the trial judge\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt, which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> incorporated elements of both the <em>Webster </em>charge and Instruction 21. Notably, he omitted the \u201cmoral cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tainty\u201d and \u201cabiding conviction\u201d language found in the <em>Webster </em>charge and, in its place, inserted the \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d and \u201creal possibility\u201d language found in Instruction 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The defendant argues that the firmly convinced standard is too similar to the clear and convincing evidence standard, which sets the burden of proof higher than a preponderance of the evidence but lower than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 871 (1975). This position finds support in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>90 Haw. 113,128-129 (Ct. App. 1998), aff\u2019d in relevant part, 90 Haw. 65, 67 (1999). In that case, the Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawaii opined that \u201cit is possible to be firmly convinced of a fact, yet still retain a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128. Under Hawaii law, the clear and convincing evidence standard is satisfied by a \u201cfirm belief of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the similarity of that phrase to the phrase \u201cfirmly convinced,\u201d the court concluded that the latter communicated a burden of proof below proof beyond a reasonable doubt as required under the due process clause of the Hawaii Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The reasoning of the <em>Perez </em>case has not gained traction in other jurisdictions. Some courts have distinguished the <em>Perez </em>case as unique to Hawaii law. See, e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>724 N.E.2d 1093, 1096 &amp; n.2 (Ind. 2000). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>283 Conn. 111, 120-124 (2007), the Connecticut Supreme Court flatly rejected it, noting the growing support for Instruction 21 and the unlikelihood that jurors in a criminal case even would be aware of the clear and convincing standard. Moreover \u2022\u2014 and akin to the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of moral certainty in <em>Victor </em>\u2014 the <em>Jackson </em>court observed that, in the context of the entire charge, there was not a reasonable likelihood that use of the phrase \u201cfirmly convinced\u201d lowered the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 124-125.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">We join those courts in declining to follow the <em>Perez </em>case. In addition to Justice Ginsburg\u2019s endorsement of Instruction 21, see <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 26-27, the Federal circuit courts have consistently upheld it under the due process clause. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>162 F.3d 135, 146 (1st Cir. 1998), cert, denied, 526 U.S. 1152 (1999); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Artero, </em>121 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir. 1997), cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1133 (1998); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>73 F.3d 975, 980 (10th Cir. 1995); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 F.3d 125, 131-132 &amp; n.4 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 513 U.S. 891 (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>F.2d 1551, 1557 (D.C. Cir. 1993). It bears noting, however, that the question under the Federal Constitution \u201cis whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the <em>Winship </em>standard.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 6. In contrast, in evaluating a reasonable doubt instruction under art. 12, we employ a standard that is more favorable to the criminal defendant, looking instead \u201cfor possible misunderstandings by reasonable jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 27 n.10 (1996), and cases cited. We do not perceive such a possibility in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Unlike the Hawaii standard for clear and convincing evidence, our cases and instructions on clear and convincing evidence are not cast in terms of the \u201cfirmness\u201d of the jury\u2019s conclusions. Rather, the instructions endorsed by this court in <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>372 Mass. 582, 588 (1977), inform the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cThe burden [of persuasion] is not a burden of convincing you that the facts which are asserted are certainly true or that they are almost certainly true, or are true beyond a reasonable doubt. It is, however, greater than a burden of convincing you that the facts are more probably true than false. The burden imposed is to convince you that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist. If then you believe upon consideration and comparison of all the evidence in the case that there is a high degree of probability that the facts are true you must find that the fact[s] have been proved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 588 n.3, quoting McBaine, Burdens of Proof: Degrees of Belief, 32 Cal. L. Rev. 242, 263-264 (1944). Even if the jury in this case were familiar with the clear and convincing evidence standard, they specifically were instructed that even a \u201cstrong probability\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt would not support a conviction. See <em>Jackson, </em>283 Conn, at 123-124 (jury unlikely to confuse firmly convinced standard with clear and convincing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Moreover, we disagree with the defendant that requiring a \u201cfirm\u201d conviction of guilt sets a lower burden of proof than requiring an \u201cabiding\u201d conviction. The word \u201cfirm\u201d is defined as \u201cnot subject to change, revision, or withdrawal,\u201d \u201cfixed,\u201d \u201csettled,\u201d \u201cdefinite,\u201d and \u201cestablished.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 856 (2002). The word \u201cabiding\u201d is de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>fined as \u201ccontinuing or persisting in the same state without changing or diminishing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. In short, the words convey the same concept to the jury. Viewed in context, we do not think a reasonable juror would have misunderstood the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to be anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We also disagree with the defendant that the \u201creal possibility\u201d language diluted and shifted the burden of proof in this case. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>162 F.3d at 145, the jury were instructed that \u201c[e]v-erything in our common experience is open to some possible or imaginary doubt____On the other hand, if you think there is a real possibility that the defendant is not guilty of the charges, you must give the defendant the benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty.\u201d The court explained that a \u201ctrial judge may require a \u2018real possibility\u2019 of doubt because \u2018[a] fanciful doubt is not a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, quoting <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 17. Viewing the charge in its totality, the court concluded that \u201cthe likelihood of juror confusion or mistake [was] extremely remote.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra. </em>See <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 27 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part) (\u201c \u2018firmly convinced\u2019 standard for conviction, repeated for emphasis, is further enhanced by the juxtaposed prescription that the jury must acquit if there is a \u2018real possibility\u2019 that the defendant is innocent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Putz, </em>266 Neb. 37, cert, denied, 540 U.S. 1016 (2003), the jury were \u201cinstructed several times that the burden of proof rested on the State, and . . . explicitly told that this burden never shifts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. The Nebraska Supreme Court concluded that in light of \u201cthe context of the overall charge to the jury considered as a whole, the jury could not have interpreted the \u2018real possibility\u2019 language as shifting the burden of proof to [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Williams, </em>724 N.E.2d at 1096, quoting <em>Taylor, </em>997 F.2d at 1557 (\u201cthe trial court had \u2018charged the jury on the presumption of innocence and the government\u2019s burden of proof, thus eliminating any concern that the jury might think the defendant was required to show a \u201creal possibility\u201d of his own innocence\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Here, the instructions accompanying the \u201creal possibility\u201d language were not unlike those in the <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Putz </em>cases. The jury were instructed that \u201c[p]roof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt, for everything in the lives of human beings is open to some possible or imaginary doubt\u201d; and that \u201c[t]here are very few things in this world that we know with absolute certainty, and in criminal cases, the law does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt.\u201d The jury also were reminded repeatedly that the Commonwealth bore the sole burden of proof of each of the crimes charged and that the defendant did not have to prove anything. In light of these instructions, it is clear that the phrase \u201creal possibility\u201d was offered in contrast to the possibility of \u201cimaginary doubt.\u201d See <em>Rodriguez, </em>162 F.3d at 146. A reasonable juror listening to the entire charge would not have mistaken the level or locus of the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Consistent with the clear majority view, we conclude that the charge on reasonable doubt given by the judge in this case adequately \u201cimpress [ed] upon the [jury] the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 15, quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 315. See Welch, \u201cGive Me That Old Time Religion\u201d: The Persistence of the <em>Webster </em>Reasonable Doubt Instruction and the Need to Abandon It, 48 New Eng. L. Rev. 31, 44-45 (2013) (collecting cases). As such, the instruction met the minimum requirements of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and art. 12. See <em>Victor, </em>511 U.S. at 15; <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Yet, mere threshold adequacy is not a sufficient basis to endorse an instruction of such importance \u2014 particularly where a preferable alternative is readily available. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>161 Wash. 2d 303, 315 (2007) (en banc) (\u201cWhile the instruction may meet constitutional muster, it does not mean that it is a good or even desirable instruction\u201d). The reasonable doubt standard \u201cprovides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence \u2014 that bedrock \u2018axiomatic and elementary\u2019 principle whose \u2018enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Winship, </em>397 U.S. at 363, quoting <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In <em>Bennett, </em>161 Wash. 2d at 312-313, the Supreme Court of Washington reviewed a similar reasonable doubt instruction derived from Instruction 21. Finding no constitutional error, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 318. Nonetheless, the court observed that, \u201c[e]yen if many variations of the definition of reasonable doubt meet minimal due process requirements, the presumption of innocence is simply too fundamental, too central to the core of the foundation of our justice system not to require adherence to a clear, simple, accepted, and uniform instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317-318. Relying on its inherent supervisory power, the court then directed the Washington trial courts to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>only the approved pattern jury instructions on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We agree with the reasoning of the <em>Bennett </em>case. We have cautioned that \u201c[wjhere issues as important as reasonable doubt are concerned, judges would do well to follow approved models,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>433 Mass. 266, 271 n.9 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 81 (1997), and that individualized embellishments among judges \u201ccan only create uncertainty and breed needless appeals.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203, 208 (1976). Although we have previously declined to require the use of particular words, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>433 Mass. 399, 405 (2001), such a requirement is well within the scope of our general superintendence power over the courts. See G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 448 (2004) (mandating jury instruction pursuant to superintendence power).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">For more than a century, the <em>Webster </em>charge has served as the gold standard against which instructions on reasonable doubt have been measured. See <em>Watkins, </em>433 Mass. at 546-547. The enduring virtue of the <em>Webster </em>charge has been that it conveys to the jury not only the degree of certitude required, but also \u201cthe proper solemn consideration,\u201d in reaching a judgment of conviction. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. at 29. Indeed, it is \u201chard to imagine, without recourse to prolixity, a charge more reflective of the solemn and rigorous standard intended.\u201d <em>Lanigan </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>853 F.2d 40, 43 (1st Cir. 1988), cert, denied, 488 U.S. 1007 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The air of solemnity imparted by the <em>Webster </em>charge underscores the moral consequence of sitting in judgment of one\u2019s peers, while \u201cprevent[ing] the jury from disregarding the high standard of proof required or from improperly determining guilt based on the ethics or morality of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>433 Mass, at 547. The jury aptly have been described as \u201cthe oracle of the citizenry in weighing the culpability of the accused, and should [they] find him guilty [they] condemn[] him with the full legal and moral authority of the society.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilliam, </em>994 F.2d 97, 101 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 510 U.S. 927 (1993). The United States Supreme Court has deftly explained how a juror\u2019s duty to determine the facts intertwines with his or her moral authority to determine the defendant\u2019s guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201cEvidence thus has force beyond any linear scheme of reasoning, and as its pieces come together a narrative gains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>momentum, with power not only to support conclusions but to sustain the willingness of jurors to draw the inferences, whatever they may be, necessary to reach an honest verdict. . . . Jury duty is usually unsought and sometimes resisted, and it may be as difficult for one juror suddenly to face the findings that can send another human being to prison, as it is for another to hold out conscientiously for acquittal. When a juror\u2019s duty does seem hard, the evidentiary account of what a defendant has thought and done can accomplish what no set of abstract statements ever could, not just to prove a fact but to establish its human significance, and so to implicate the law\u2019s moral underpinnings and a juror\u2019s obligation to sit in judgment. Thus, the prosecution may fairly seek to place its evidence before the jurors, as much to tell a story of guiltiness as to support an inference of guilt, to convince the jurors that a guilty verdict would be morally reasonable as much as to point to the discrete elements of a defendant\u2019s legal fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>Old Chiefs. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 187-188 (1997), citing <em>Gilliam, </em>994 F.2d at 100-102. We conclude that it would be imprudent to endorse a reasonable doubt instruction that glosses over the moral underpinnings of the jury\u2019s work in a criminal case, and we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We appreciate the risk, articulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, that \u201c[mjoral certainty could be interpreted to mean that the certainty is based on a feeling, i.e., moral conviction, rather than facts.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indorato, </em>628 F.2d 711, 721 n.8 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1016 (1980). Accordingly, we have recognized that \u201creferences to \u2018moral certainty\u2019 made in isolation and without further explanation may amount to an erroneous instruction on reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Denis, </em>442 Mass. 617, 622 (2004). By the same token, our cases hold that the \u201cuse of the term does not constitute reversible error when the instruction includes other language giving the term an appropriate context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the traditional <em>Webster </em>charge has been and continues to be a constitutionally sufficient source of such context, we are mindful of the criticism surrounding some of the outmoded language employed therein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>For all of these reasons, we now exercise our inherent supervisory power to require a uniform instruction on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that uses more modern language, but preserves the power, efficacy, and essence of the <em>Webster </em>charge. G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We conclude that the model <em>Webster </em>charge nearly accomplishes this task, but would benefit from further clarification of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d See Instruction 2.180 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009). Therefore, going forward, Massachusetts judges sitting on criminal trials are to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cThe burden is on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the charge(s) made against him (her).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cWhat is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? The term is often used and probably pretty well understood, though it is not easily defined. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt, for everything in the lives of human beings is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. A charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt if, after you have compared and considered all of the evidence, you have in your minds an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, that the charge is true. When we refer to moral certainty, we mean the highest degree of certainty possible in matters relating to human affairs \u2014 based solely on the evidence that has been put before you in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201cI have told you that every person is presumed to be innocent until he or she is proved guilty, and that the burden of proof is on the prosecutor. If you evaluate all the evidence and you still have a reasonable doubt remaining, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and must be acquitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201cIt is not enough for the Commonwealth to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>probability, even a strong probability, that the defendant is more likely to be guilty than not guilty. That is not enough. Instead, the evidence must convince you of the defendant\u2019s guilt to a reasonable and moral certainty; a certainty that convinces your understanding and satisfies your reason and judgment as jurors who are sworn to act conscientiously on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u201cThis is what we mean by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In consequence of this decision, the traditional <em>Webster </em>charge should no longer be used as the instruction on reasonable doubt in this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 666-667 (2005), the defendant contends that he is entitled to the benefit of this new instruction because he preserved the issue below and argued for it on appeal. It is clear, however, that \u201cthere is no constitutional requirement that the new rule or new interpretation be applied retroactively, and we are therefore free to determine whether it should be applied only prospectively.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 721 n.10 (2004), cert, denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005). In this vein, the Commonwealth casts the <em>Adjutant </em>case as an exception applied only in the context of some prejudicial error otherwise avoidable by application of the new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In the <em>Adjutant </em>case, a defendant on trial for manslaughter was precluded from introducing evidence of the victim\u2019s prior acts of aggression. The court created a new rule of evidence allowing trial judges the \u201cdiscretion to admit evidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.\u201d <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. at 664. Had this new rule been applied at trial, \u201cit may have been enough to create reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666. Given that the defendant argued for the new rule on appeal, we concluded that he was entitled to a new trial with the benefit of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">We are persuaded that the <em>Adjutant </em>case is distinguishable and that the defendant is not entitled to the exception triggered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>circumstances of that case. Unlike in <em>Adjutant, </em>here we are not concerned that in the absence of the new rule there may have been a miscarriage of justice because, as explained above, a reasonable jury would not have misunderstood the reasonable doubt instruction that was given. To the extent that the omission of the \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and \u201cabiding conviction\u201d language stripped that instruction of the solemnity so strongly reinforced by the <em>Webster </em>charge, we \u201cview the charge in its entirety since the adequacy of instructions must be determined in light of their over-all impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Although, in other circumstances, we have disapproved of instructions that \u201ctrivialize the awesome duty of the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s guilt was proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 129 (1977), in this case, other aspects of the charge adequately expressed the seriousness of the proceedings to the jury.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant suffered no prejudice by the instructions given. Contrast <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. at 666. The only commonality between this case and the <em>Adjutant </em>case is the successful request for a new rule, which, standing alone, is insufficient to merit a retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>b. <em>Lesser included offense instruction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge committed error by instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of indecent assault and battery. Although the defendant seems to have invited the instruction by moving for a required finding of not guilty on grounds of insufficient evidence of penetration, he preserved the issue by objecting to the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. 326, 334 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u201cOur case law on lesser included offense instructions has consistently inquired \u2018whether the evidence at trial presents a rational basis for acquitting the defendant of the crime charged and convicting him of the lesser included offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. 526, 536 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donlan, </em>436 Mass. 329, 335 (2002). Where, as here, \u201cthe issue is whether the judge erred in giving a lesser included instruction rather than whether the judge erred by failing to give such an instruction: it is not error to give a lesser included offense instruction \u2018if on any hypothesis of the evidence, the jury could have found the defendant!] guilty of [the lesser included offense]\u2019 and not guilty of the greater offense.\u201d <em>Porro, supra </em>at 537, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>418 Mass. 130, 132 (1994). \u201cIn determining whether there was a hypothetical basis for the jury to conclude that the defendant was guilty of the lesser included offense, but not the offense charged, the judge may consider the possibility that the jury reasonably may disbelieve the witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding an element required of the greater, but not the lesser included, offense.\u201d <em>Porro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The defendant points out that, in <em>Donlan, </em>436 Mass. at 337-338, we held that an indecent assault and battery instruction was inappropriate on similar facts. Yet, in that case, error was alleged in the omission of a lesser included offense instruction, <em>id. </em>at 338, a posture in which relief \u201cdepends not only on the existence of a possible factual scenario justifying a conviction of the lesser but not the greater offense, but also on evidence of a dispute at trial about the element that distinguishes the two offenses.\u201d <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass, at 536. In contrast, we have held that giving \u201ca lesser included instruction is not error where, for example, a jury reasonably could be convinced by the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant sexually assaulted her but not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that penetration occurred, even where the victim was not cross-examined as to penetration and the defense attorney did not mention it in closing argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The Commonwealth submits that this case fits squarely within the paradigm described in the <em>Porro </em>case, as the victim testified not only to acts of penetration, but also to more general contact between the defendant and the victim\u2019s vaginal area. Defense counsel\u2019s strategy was to suggest that the victim fabricated the allegations of abuse in order to protect her mother from the physical abuse being inflicted on her by the defendant. The Commonwealth reasons that this strategy was partially successful, as the verdicts suggest that the jury credited the allegations of abuse but discredited the testimony regarding penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant contests that conclusion, reciting the familiar rule that \u201cthe jury\u2019s right to selective credibility does not permit [them] to distort or mutilate any integral portion of the testimony to permit them to believe an unfounded hypothesis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>390 Mass. 308, 314 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>442 Mass. 1019 (2004). The defendant cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. 449, 458 (2009), which we find instructive. In that case, we held that the jury reasonably could not believe testimony that the shooter was positioned to the right of the victim, where the evidence unequivocally established that the victim was shot in the left side of the head. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Here, the defendant characterizes the case put to the jury as \u201ca pure \u2018up or down\u2019 question on credibility \u2022\u2014 whether the alleged conduct did or did not occur.\u201d We disagree. Unlike in the <em>Zanetti </em>case, evidence of penetrating contact would not have made it illogical for the jury in this case to conclude that there was also evidence of non-penetrating contact. If there was indeed evidence of both non-penetrating and penetrating contact, the jury were free to believe the former and disbelieve the latter. See <em>Porro, </em>458 Mass. at 537 n.10. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunton, </em>168 Mass. 130, 132 (1897) (\u201cjury are absolutely free to believe what is unfavorable to a prisoner in his statement, and to disbelieve all that is favorable, if the character of the statement has that effect upon their minds\u201d). We therefore turn to the evidence put before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">With respect to the charges in question, there was certainly evidence of penetration. The question, then, is whether there also was sufficient evidence to support inferences of indecent touching that fell short of penetration. On the second and third charges, the victim testified that the defendant \u201ctouched me with his fingers on my vaginal area\u201d and \u201crubb[ed] up against me with his penis area.\u201d On the fifth charge, she testified that, \u201cit started right back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>up \u2014 the abuse on me. . . . [T]he touching, the fondling, the above, all that stuff started again.\u201d On the eighth and ninth charges, she testified that the abuse was \u201c[m]ore of the same \u2014 touching, fond \u2014 fondling . . . rubbing his penis on me \u2014 my butt . . . [a]nd in my vagina area.\u201d On the eleventh and twelfth charges, she testified that it was \u201c[m]ore of the same\u201d; \u201cit was never anything really different\u201d; and [i]t was a lot of groping, like, I don\u2019t know how to say \u2014 rubbing against my \u2014 on my butt [and] ... on my \u2014 in my \u2014 like in between my legs from behind, penis to my vagina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Viewing the victim\u2019s testimony as a whole, we agree with the Commonwealth that a reasonable jury could have found indecent touching that fell short of penetration. Although the victim did not testify expressly to non-penetrating contact during each period, the jury could have inferred such contact from her testimony that \u201cthe above, all that stuff started again,\u201d that the touching was \u201cmore of the same,\u201d and that it \u201cwas never anything really different.\u201d The jury also could have inferred that the defendant\u2019s penis came into contact with the victim\u2019s vaginal area \u2014 without penetrating her vagina \u2014 when he was rubbing up against her and placing his penis between her legs and buttocks, a finding consistent with other testimony that he \u201crubb[ed] his penis ... in [her] vagina area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Moreover, with respect to the testimony regarding actual penetration, the jury properly could have considered the age of the victim, who was between six and fifteen years old, depending on the indictment. The jury also could have had reasonable doubt as to the extent of the contact described by the victim. For example, at one point the victim testified that the defendant would \u201cput[] his fingers inside me in my vagina.\u201d When the prosecutor sought clarification: \u201cHis fingers, you said, in your vagina?,\u201d the victim replied: \u201cNot \u2014 not completely penetrating yet.\u201d The prosecutor again asked for clarification: \u201cNot yet?,\u201d to which the victim repeated: \u201cNot yet.\u201d A reasonable juror could have taken this to mean that the victim was exaggerating when she stated that the defendant placed his fingers \u201cinside [her] in [her] vagina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Although exaggeration was not the defendant\u2019s precise theory of the case, it is not necessarily inconsistent with that theory. The jury may have thought that the victim exaggerated the penetration aspects of her account because her first complaint \u2014 that the defendant \u201ctouched\u201d her \u2014 failed to induce her mother to leave the defendant. Contrast <em>Zanetti, </em>454 Mass. at 458. We need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>tarry long, however, on the jury\u2019s deliberative process. \u201cIt is sufficient that the evidence permitted the inference which the jury obviously drew . .. . \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Nelson, 370 Mass. 192, 203 (1976). Compare Porro, 458 Mass. at 537 n.10 (\u201cjury reasonably could be convinced by the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant sexually assaulted her but not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that penetration occurred\u201d), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass. 415,425 (2012) (\u201cno view of the evidence\u201d supported instruction on lesser included offense).

Rev. 31, 31-32 (2013) (\u201cDespite the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s reverence for the definition of \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 as described in the 1850 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster </em>decision, courts should use the cut and paste feature on their word processors, abandon the outmoded portions of that instruction, and define this most important concept in comprehensible, everyday language\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\">It follows that the model instructions on reasonable doubt presently in effect, as well as the instructions on reasonable doubt found in Martin Glennon &amp; O\u2019Sullivan Smith, Instructions Common to All Criminal Cases, Massachusetts Superior Court Criminal Practice Jury Instructions \u00a7 1.1 (Mass. Cont. Legal Educ. 2d ed. 2013), should no longer be used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\">For example, the judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">\u201cYou have heard the closing arguments of counsel, you have heard all the evidence, and you are about to decide this case. But I think it\u2019s appropriate for you and I to stand alone, together in this courtroom, to reflect upon our roles in this trial. You have noticed that whenever you come into the courtroom, everyone else stands up. Why do they show you that sign of respect? ... It\u2019s out of respect for your role here. Because you and I are the only ones who have taken an oath to decide this case. I\u2019ve taken an oath to decide the legal aspects of the case fairly. You have taken an oath to decide the facts of this case fairly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">\u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, that is a burden that we place on you, because no one likes to sit in judgment. No one does. But we know, ladies and gentlemen, that you can meet that burden, that you can handle that responsibility. And why do we know that? Well, history teaches us that. Because for over 200 years here in Essex County, jurors just like you have been listening to evidence just like this, looking at and listening to the same types of witnesses, the same types of evidence, and then using your common sense to determine, what do I believe, what is important, what\u2019s a reasonable inference to draw. They search for the truth. And there\u2019s no reason to think you can\u2019t do that just as well as all those jurors who have come before you. You are asked to be responsible citizens, placed in a responsible situation, and there is no reason to think you can\u2019t do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
