L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M (\u00a7 34M), the \u201cpersonal injury protection\u201d (PIP) statute, provides in part that an injured person claiming PIP benefits \u201cshall submit to physical examinations by <em>physicians </em>selected by the insurer as often as may be reasonably required\u201d in order \u201cto assist in determining the amounts due\u201d (emphasis added). The threshold question in this case is the meaning of the word \u201cphysicians\u201d in this provision. More particularly, the question is whether the word \u201cphysicians\u201d refers solely to medical doctors licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 2, or whether the term includes additional types of licensed health care practitioners. We interpret the statute to intend the broader definition of the word because it is the one most consonant with the statutory purpose. Adopting this interpretation, we affirm the order of a Superior Court judge dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), but for somewhat different reasons from those that the judge provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Facts.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In June of 2011, the plaintiff, Flor Ortiz, was injured in an automobile accident in Massachusetts while riding in a car that Progressive Insurance Company (Progressive) insured. Following the accident, Ortiz notified Progressive that he sought PIP benefits available under the insurance policy to pay for medical expenses that resulted from the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Progressive then engaged the defendant, Examworks, Inc. (Examworks), to arrange an independent medical examination (IME) of Ortiz. To this end, Examworks separately notified Ortiz and his lawyer in writing that Ortiz was scheduled to undergo a \u201cPhysical Therapy Medical Evaluation\u201d on August 25, 2011, to be conducted by \u201cEugene R. Boeglin, Jr., DPT, OCS,\u201d whom the notification characterized as the \u201cExamining Physician.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ortiz did not attend the August 25 appointment; Examworks then sent Ortiz and his lawyer a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>notice regarding the medical examination, which was rescheduled for September 13, 2011. Like the first notice letter, the second notice letter indicated that the scheduled examination was a \u201cPhysical Therapy Medical Evaluation,\u201d to be conducted by \u201cExamining Physician\u201d Eugene R. Boeglin, Jr., DPT, OCS.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Boeglin was a licensed physical therapist, but not a licensed medical doctor under the Commonwealth\u2019s physician licensing statute, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 2. Ortiz attended the September 13 examination conducted by Boeglin, who thereafter prepared a report of the IME that indicated that he took Ortiz\u2019s history, physically examined Ortiz, and reviewed Ortiz\u2019s medical records. Boeglin\u2019s report included his opinion of the extent of Ortiz\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\"><em>Procedural background. </em>On June 13, 2012, Ortiz sent a demand letter to Examworks alleging multiple violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Examworks timely responded in a letter dated July 10, 2012. Soon thereafter, Ortiz filed this action in the Superior Court on behalf of himself and similarly situated persons. The putative class consists of those injured in an automobile accident who sought PIP benefits, received a notice from Examworks of a scheduled IME to be conducted by a \u201cphysician\u201d who was not actually a licensed medical doctor, and then attended an IME conducted by that person. The complaint alleges violations of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 8A, G. L. c. 93A; \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9; and G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. It seeks declaratory relief, equitable relief, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Examworks moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court allowed Examworks\u2019s motion. The judge agreed with Ortiz that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the term \u201cphysicians,\u201d as used in the third sentence of \u00a7 34M, third par., is limited to licensed medical doctors. The judge allowed the motion to dismiss, however, on the ground that Ortiz did not sufficiently allege a claim of invasion of privacy, and failed to allege an injury resulting from Examworks\u2019s alleged unfair or deceptive practice as needed to sustain his claim under G. L. c. 93A. We transferred Ortiz\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\"><em>Statutory framework. </em>Section 34M is a \u201ccritical part\u201d of the Commonwealth\u2019s no-fault automobile insurance law, enacted to \u201creduce the amount of motor vehicle tort litigation, control the costs of automobile insurance, and ensure prompt payment of claimants\u2019 medical and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d <em>Fascione </em>v. <em>CNA Ins. Cos., </em>435 Mass. 88, 94 (2001). See <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>383 Mass. 195, 198 (1981). Section 34M, first par., requires that all motor vehicle liability policies in Massachusetts provide PIP benefits. The term \u201cpersonal injury protection\u201d is defined as \u201cprovisions of a motor vehicle liability policy . . . which provide for payment to the named insured,\u201d or to any passenger of the insured\u2019s car, \u201cof all reasonable expenses incurred within two years from the date of accident for necessary medical, surgical, x-ray, and dental services ... as a result of bodily injury\u201d caused by the accident, limited to $8,000 \u201con account of injury to . . . any one person.\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">When an injured person files a claim for PIP benefits, \u00a7 34M, third par., directs that the person \u201csubmit to physical examinations by <em>physicians </em>selected by the insurer as often as may be reasonably required and shall do all things necessary to enable the insurer to obtain medical reports and other needed information to assist in determining the amounts due\u201d (emphasis added). The physical examinations referred to are IMEs. See <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>451 Mass. 192, 195 n.3 (2008). PIP benefits are due \u201cupon receipt of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of expenses and loss incurred.\u201d \u00a7 34M, fourth par. If benefits are due and payable and not paid within thirty days, any \u201cunpaid party\u201d is entitled to bring an action for payment in the District Court, the action is to be heard on an expedited basis, and if the unpaid party prevails, the party is entitled to recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Meaning of \u201cphysicians.\u201d </em>The judge, as indicated, ruled that the term \u201cphysicians\u201d in \u00a7 34M, third par., refers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>only to medical doctors licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> an interpretation that Ortiz also advances. We consider this question of statutory interpretation de nova. <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The term \u201cphysicians\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 34M. Accordingly, we give the term its \u201cusual and accepted\u201d meaning, so long as it is \u201cconsistent with the statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Seideman </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>452 Mass. 472, 477-478 (2008). We determine a word\u2019s \u201cusual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors,\u201d such as dictionary definitions. <em>Id. </em>at 478, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). The term \u201cphysicians\u201d appeared in \u00a7 34M as originally enacted in 1970. See St. 1970, c. 670, \u00a7 4. The term \u201cphysician\u201d was defined at that time as a \u201cperson licensed to practice medicine; medical doctor\u201d, and as \u201c[a]ny person who heals or exerts a healing influence.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 989 (1969). This meaning has remained largely the same in the years since the enactment of \u00a7 34M.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The term, therefore, includes medical doctors and, more generally, those who engage in the healing arts. We consider which of these common meanings of the term \u201cphysician\u201d most appropriately suits the intent and purpose of \u00a7 34M. See <em>Dominguez </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>429 Mass. 112, 115 (1999), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">A primary objective of the no-fault automobile insurance statutory scheme was, and is, to \u201cprovide an inexpensive and uncomplicated procedure for obtaining compensation for injuries sustained in automobile accidents.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>429 Mass. at 115. In addition, as the provisions of \u00a7 34M, fourth par., make obvious, speed in securing the payment of PIP benefits associated with treating such injuries is of great importance: the benefits are due as expenses are incurred, and if not paid within thirty days after they become due and payable, the claimant who remains unpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>is entitled to bring suit to recover them; the litigation is to be put on a fast track. At the same time, PIP benefits are payable for necessary medical and dental services related to a motor vehicle accident generally \u2014 the statute does not limit the benefits to certain types of medical assistance, services, or procedures<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 and in this regard, an insurer is specifically entitled under \u00a7 34M, third par., to require that a claimant undergo IMEs in order for the insurer to determine what benefits are properly due. See <em>Boone, </em>451 Mass. at 195 (IMEs \u201cassist insurers in determining the amounts due\u201d); <em>Brito </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 37 (1997) (insurer that \u201chas reason to doubt its liability\u201d may require injured claimant to undergo IME). If every IME were required to be performed by a licensed medical doctor, it is obvious that achievement of the no-fault statutory goals of inexpensive, uncomplicated, as well as timely payment of benefits to cover medical expenses would suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Moreover, in at least one respect \u2014 where PIP benefits to pay for necessary dental services are involved \u2014 requiring IMEs to be performed solely by licensed medical doctors would render the statute unworkable. Licensed medical doctors do not have the professional authority or competence to evaluate dental services, and would not be able to do so. See <em>Boone, </em>451 Mass. at 198. See also <em>Hartunian </em>v. <em>Pilgrim Ins. Co., </em>86 Mass. App. Ct. 670, 672 &amp; n.3 (2014). In our view, an interpretation of \u201cphysicians\u201d in \u00a7 34M, third par., to mean solely licensed medical doctors would create an unreasonable result that the Legislature did not intend. <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982) (\u201cWe assume the Legislature intended to act reasonably\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Ortiz argues that the language of \u00a7 34M and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Boone </em>support his argument. He points to the fact that in \u00a7 34M, fourth par., the Legislature provided specifically that before an insurer could refuse to pay a bill for which PIP benefits were sought based only on a medical review of the bill or the medical services \u201cunderlying the bill,\u201d the insurer was obligated to have the record review conducted by a licensed practitioner holding the same type of professional license as the practitioner whose bill was in dispute; this obligation is referred to in <em>Boone </em>as \u201cthe same profession requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Boone, </em>451 Mass. at 195-196 &amp; n.4. The thrust of Ortiz\u2019s argument is that, by embracing the same profession requirement in the record review of bills or services and rejecting it in the context of IMEs, the Legislature intended to restrict those who may conduct IMEs to medical doctors, regardless of the specialty of the practitioner treating the injured claimant, and that <em>Boone </em>supports this reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u201cWith respect to [PIP] benefits,... no insurer shall refuse to pay a bill for medical services submitted by a practitioner registered or licensed under [G. L. c. 112], if such refusal is based solely on a medical review of the bill or of the medical services underlying the bill, which review was requested or conducted by the insurer, unless the insurer has submitted, for medical review, such bill or claim to at least one practitioner registered or licensed under the same section of [G. L. c. 112] as the practitioner who submitted the bill for medical services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>We disagree with both components of the argument. We begin with <em>Boone. </em>In that case, a chiropractor treated the plaintiff, who had been injured in an automobile accident, for approximately nine months, and the chiropractor\u2019s bills were paid on behalf of the plaintiff by the defendant insurer as PIP benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 193. Thereafter, at the insurer\u2019s behest, an orthopedic surgeon performed an IME on the plaintiff and determined that the plaintiff did not require continued medical treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 193-194. The insurer terminated further PIP benefits relating to chiropractic services as a result. <em>Id. </em>at 194. The question raised in the case concerned the meaning and scope of the same profession requirement in \u00a7 34M, fourth par. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 195-196. Based on the language of the statute as well as pertinent legislative history, the court concluded that the same profession requirement, which the fourth paragraph made applicable when an insurer seeks to terminate the payment of PIP benefits based \u201csolely\u201d on a medical record review, should not be read into the IME provisions of the third paragraph of \u00a7 34M. See <em>id. </em>at 196-199.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But in reaching this result, the court\u2019s focus was not on the fact that the practitioner who performed the IME was a medical doctor. In other words, although it was relevant that, as an orthopedic surgeon, the doctor performing the IME was presumably qualified to assess the need for continued chiropractic treatment, see <em>id. </em>at 198, the doctor\u2019s status as a person licensed to practice medicine was not the issue. Rather, the only question was whether an insurer permissibly could refuse to pay a bill based on an IME performed by a health care practitioner who was not licensed in the \u201csame profession\u201d as the practitioner whose bill was in dispute. See <em>id. </em>at 193,196 &amp; n.4. No question about the meaning of \u201cphysicians\u201d appearing in \u00a7 34M, third par., was raised, and the court did not discuss the word.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We turn to Ortiz\u2019s related point that if the Legislature had intended IMEs to be conducted by licensed nonphysicians, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>could have required injured claimants to submit to IMEs conducted by a \u201clicensed\u201d or \u201cregistered\u201d \u201cpractitioner\u201d in the third paragraph of \u00a7 34M, just as it used the term \u201cpractitioner\u201d in delineating the same profession requirement in the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 34M. Because such a reading would interfere substantially with the purposes of the no-fault automobile insurance program and the provision of PIP benefits in particular, we decline to interpret those language differences as meaning the Legislature intended \u201cphysicians\u201d in the third paragraph to restrict the performance of all IMEs to licensed medical doctors. \u201cIn so large a legislative enterprise [as the no-fault automobile insurance scheme], there are likely to be casual overstatements and understatements, half-answers, and gaps in the statutory provisions,\u201d and it is the role of the courts to \u201cinterweave the statute with decisions answering the difficulties and composing, as far as feasible and reasonable, an harmonious structure faithful to the basic designs and purposes of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 345 (1978).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In sum, we conclude that the word \u201cphysicians\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 34M, third par., encompasses not only medical doctors licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 2, but also other appropriate licensed or registered health care practitioners, including physical therapists licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 23B.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">2. <em>Disposition of motion to dismiss. </em>We review de nova the judge\u2019s dismissal of Ortiz\u2019s complaint under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6). <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers 1-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011). The question is whether the complaint\u2019s factual allegations are \u201c \u2018enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level\u2019 .... What is required at the pleading stage are factual \u2018allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\u2019 an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008), quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 557 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">a. <em>Claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. </em>The complaint alleges that Examworks\u2019s IME notice letters, and the subsequent examination of Ortiz, interfered with Ortiz\u2019s privacy interests in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB. With regard to injury, the complaint alleges that Ortiz was obliged to sacrifice his personal time to attend the IME, that Boeglin touched Ortiz during the IME without legal authorization to do so, and that Ortiz divulged information to Boeglin regarding his car accident, his injuries and his personal health information during the IME.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">\u201cTo sustain a claim for invasion of privacy [under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB], the invasion must be both unreasonable and substantial or serious.\u201d <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Salem State College, </em>446 Mass. 525, 536 (2006). See <em>Schlesinger </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>409 Mass. 514, 517-518 (1991). The complaint fails to allege an actionable interference with Ortiz\u2019s privacy because \u00a7 34M, as we have interpreted it, authorized Examworks, on behalf of Progressive, to require Ortiz to undergo an IME conducted by a physical therapist to \u201cassist in determining the amounts due.\u201d \u00a7 34M, third par. See <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 519, 521 (action not \u201cserious\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d interference with privacy if, among other things, it \u201chad a legitimate business purpose\u201d); <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 520 (1984) (\u201clegitimate countervailing business interests . . . may render the disclosure of personal information reasonable and not actionable under\u201d \u00a7 IB). Because the examination was authorized under \u00a7 34M, the invasions of privacy associated with its taking place were \u201cjustified.\u201d See <em>Schlesinger, supra </em>at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">b. <em>Claim under G. L. c. 93A. </em>The complaint alleges that the IME notice letters that Examworks sent to Ortiz representing that Boeglin was an \u201c[examining [p]hysician\u201d violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 9, because they \u201cintentionally deceived\u201d Ortiz and led him to attend an IME conducted by Boeglin who was not, in fact, a licensed medical doctor, even though \u00a7 34M required that he be such a person to conduct an IME. It further alleges that Examworks violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 8A, resulting in an additional violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The complaint incorporates into the c. 93A claim the injuries alleged in the interference with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>privacy claim \u2014 that Ortiz took personal time to submit to the IME, divulged personal information during the examination, and was touched by Boeglin, who did not have the statutory authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Assuming for argument that a claim based on an alleged violation of \u00a7 34M properly may be raised against a company, like Examworks, that is not itself an insurance company, we agree with the judge that the complaint does not sufficiently allege actionable unfair or deceptive conduct on the part of Examworks. Examworks\u2019s IME notice letters on which this claim depends state that Ortiz had been scheduled to undergo a \u201c[pjhysical [tjherapy [mjedical [evaluation,\u201d and that the \u201c[ejxamining [pjhysician\u201d was \u201cEugene R. Boeglin, Jr., <em>DPT, OCS\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Ortiz does not claim that Boeglin was not a licensed doctor of physical therapy or that he was not an orthopedic clinical specialist. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The notice letters, therefore, accurately described Boeglin\u2019s qualifications.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Gossels </em>v. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>453 Mass. 366, 373 (2009) (bank did not violate c. 93A by accurately telling presenter of check that presenter was not required to indorse check). That he was described as the \u201c[ejxamining [pjhysician\u201d does not render the notice letters unfair or deceptive, as opposed to somewhat confusing. In any event, if, as appears to be the case, Ortiz\u2019s claim is that the notice letter was actionably deceptive because it led him to believe that Boeglin was a licensed medical doctor as (he claims) \u00a7 34M required, the claim must fail because \u00a7 34M does <em>not </em>require the IME to be performed by a medical doctor licensed under G.

L. c. 93A demand letter, attached to the complaint, indicates that Ortiz suffered injuries to his neck and back and underwent physical therapy as a result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In relevant part, the notice sent by Examworks, Inc. (Examworks), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\">\u201cExamining Physician: Eugene R. Boeglin, Jr., DPT, OCS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Exam Type: Physical Therapy Medical Evaluation\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">The notice did not define the initials following Boeglin\u2019s name, but there is no disagreement by the parties that the initials \u201cDPT\u201d signify \u201cdoctor of physical therapy,\u201d and the initials \u201cOCS\u201d signify \u201corthopedic clinical specialist.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\">Boeglin\u2019s report is not in the record before us, and no information has been provided concerning the substance of Boeglin\u2019s opinion about the nature or extent of Ortiz\u2019s injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b802-14\">The demand letter asserted that Examworks\u2019s first notice of examination violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, in that it deceived Ortiz by indicating that Boeglin was a \u201cphysician.\u201d The letter further claimed that this \u201cdeception,\u201d coupled with the medical examination of Ortiz, interfered with Ortiz\u2019s privacy in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 IB, and constituted a violation of c. 93A, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">PIP benefits are to be paid \u201cregardless of fault in the causation of the accident.\u201d <em>Pinnick </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>360 Mass. 1, 6 (1971).

See <em>Barron Chiropractic &amp; Rehabilitation, P. C. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Group, </em>469 Mass. 800, 801-802 (2014) (insurer required claimant to undergo IME conducted by licensed chiropractor); <em>Hartunian </em>v. <em>Pilgrim Ins.

L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M (\u00a7 34M), but we note that the word \u201cphysician\u201d also is used in the statute\u2019s fourth paragraph. The first sentence of \u00a7 34M, fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>par., provides: \u201cPersonal injury protection benefits ... shall be due and payable as loss accrues, upon receipt of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of expenses and loss incurred provided that upon notification of disability from a licensed physician, the insurer shall commence medical payments within ten days or give written notice of its intent not to make such payments . . . .\u201d We conclude that the statutory purpose of making available efficient, timely, and relatively inexpensive medical, dental, and related services is best served if \u201cphysician\u201d in the fourth paragraph of \u00a7 34M is, like \u201cphysicians\u201d in the third paragraph, interpreted to include not only medical doctors licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a72, but other licensed health care practitioners as well, including physical therapists. See <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>1998 Mass. App. Div. 184 (1998) (adopting broad definition of \u201cphysician\u201d in \u00a7 34M, fourth par., to include range of licensed health care providers, and rejecting insurer\u2019s claim that term refers only to medical doctors licensed under G. L. c. 112, \u00a72: under narrow reading of \u201cphysician,\u201d \u201ca dentist, oral surgeon or other c. 112 practitioner who provided necessary medical treatment to an insured injured in an automobile accident would never be entitled to PIP payments unless the practitioner, or the insured, took the additional step and incurred the extra expense of obtaining and filing a disability certificate from a physician licensed under c. 112, \u00a7 2[,] prior to submitting any PIP bill or claim to the insurer\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Section 34M, fourth par., provides in relevant part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Accordingly, the defendant insurer was entitled to refuse to pay PIP benefits based on an IME conducted by a practitioner licensed in a different specialty than the treating practitioner. See <em>Boone </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>451 Mass. 192, 193 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Ortiz suggests there is language in <em>Boone </em>indicating that only a medical doctor may conduct an IME. See <em>Boone, </em>451 Mass. at 196, 197 n.6. We do not read these references as indicating that the court was opining in any way on the question whether the term \u201cphysicians\u201d in \u00a7 34M, third par., refers only to licensed medical doctors. This question simply was not raised by the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Ortiz also contends, in accordance with the judge\u2019s reasoning, that as other statutes demonstrate, if the Legislature had intended the term \u201cphysicians\u201d to include certain nonphysician practitioners, it would have said so explicitly. He points to a statute in which the Legislature specifically has indicated that the term \u201cphysician\u201d includes other practitioners. See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G (defining \u201cphysician\u201d to include \u201cchiropodists, chiropractors, optometrists, osteopaths, physical therapists, podiatrists, [and] psychologists\u201d). Certainly, we \u201cmay turn to similar statutes to construe the meaning of words\u201d (quotation and citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jean-Pierre, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 164 (2005). Regardless of the manner in which the word \u201cphysicians\u201d is defined elsewhere in the General Laws, however, the task at hand is to construe the word in light of the intent and purpose of the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 34M, see <em>Baccanti </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>434 Mass. 787, 794 (2001); the definition or scope of the term in other statutes is not dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 8A, prohibits a person \u201cwho is not registered by the board of registration in medicine as a physician under\u201d G.
