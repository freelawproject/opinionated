L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7, and G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 39 (c); their focus is on the financial institution excise tax (MET) liability of the taxpayer GATE Holdings, Inc. (Gate), that was at all relevant times a wholly owned subsidiary of the taxpayer The First Marblehead Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>(FMC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its decision, the board accepted Gate\u2019s position that it qualified as a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1, and was entitled to apportion its income pursuant to G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A (\u00a7 2A). The board, however, disagreed with Gate that in applying the apportionment rules of \u00a7 2A, all of Gate\u2019s taxable property, which consisted of securitized student loans, should be assigned to States outside the Commonwealth. Rather, the board determined that all such property was properly assigned to Massachusetts, resulting in a greater FIET liability than Gate had calculated. We affirm the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><em>Facts </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At issue here are the tax years ending June 30, 2004; June 30, 2005; and June 30, 2006 (tax years at issue). FMC was a publicly traded Delaware corporation with its principal offices in Boston, and during the tax years at issue was the principal tax-reporting corporation for itself, Gate, and a number of other subsidiaries. FMC was involved in the growing industry facilitating private loans to students seeking to finance the cost of their postsecondary education. FMC did not make any loans directly to student borrowers but, rather, brought together various parties involved in lending, including postsecondary schools, banks that issued loans to borrowers (originating banks), loan guarantors, loan servicing entities (servicers), and underwriters. In particular, FMC and its subsidiaries facilitated and coordinated the issuance and securitization of student loans through a complex process in which loans were purchased from originating banks with financing obtained via the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS). The originating banks entered into agreements with FMC through which the banks issued loans to student borrowers and then sold portfolios of these loans to a number of different Delaware statutory trusts (trusts). To finance the purchases of loan portfolios, the trusts sold bonds, in the form of ABS, to underwriters that in turn sold the bonds to investors. Once the trusts acquired the loans, the loans became security for repayment of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Loans require loan servicing, an umbrella term that includes accounting for accrued interest on the loans, billing, receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and processing payments, and working with borrowers in various stages of delinquency. Neither FMC nor any of its affiliates was directly involved in loan servicing but instead outsourced these activities to independent entities in that business (servicers). A large percentage of the loans securitized by FMC were serviced by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA), with a principal office in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. A number of other servicers also serviced loans securitized by FMC and, like PHEAA, were located outside Massachusetts. The servicers were the custodians of the loan records and all paper documents relating to the loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Gate played an integral role in the FMC student loan securiti-zation process. Gate\u2019s purpose within this system was to hold residual beneficial interests in the trusts, either directly or through its own wholly owned subsidiary, National Collegiate Funding LLC. By the end of the tax years at issue, Gate held a beneficial interest in each of sixteen trusts that in turn held all of the student loans that had been securitized by FMC and its affiliates. These interests in the trusts constituted substantially all of Gate\u2019s assets. Income from the trusts, which consisted of interest on the student loans, passed through to Gate and comprised substantially all of Gate\u2019s gross income for these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Gate was essentially a holding company with no employees, payroll, tangible assets, or office space \u2022\u2014 either owned or leased. Gate\u2019s tax returns indicated that its principal office was located at the same Boston address as FMC, and Gate\u2019s corporate books and tax returns also were maintained and prepared in Boston. Indeed, there is no dispute that Gate\u2019s commercial domicile was in Massachusetts during the tax years at issue. Like Gate, the trusts also had no assets other than the loan portfolios, cash, and other related assets, and they had no employees, payroll, or offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\"><em>Procedural history. </em>On September 15, 2006, FMC and Gate filed a voluntary disclosure request with the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) reporting their conclusion that Gate was a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d not a corporation as they had previously treated it for Massachusetts excise tax purposes, and their intent to change Gate\u2019s tax filing status accordingly. Gate then filed a Massachusetts financial institution excise return (Form 63FI) for each of the tax years at issue, and also sought an abatement of corporate taxes previously filed for the tax year ending on June 30, 2004. The commissioner denied the application for an abatement in July, 2007, and in September, 2007, FMC appealed to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In December, 2009, following audits of the returns filed on behalf of FMC and Gate for the tax years at issue,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>the commissioner further assessed FMC and Gate for additional taxes based on the commissioner\u2019s conclusion that Gate was taxable as a foreign corporation or, in the alternative, that Gate owed additional taxes as a financial institution. FMC and Gate sought abatements of these assessments, which the commissioner denied in February and March, 2010, respectively. Later in March, 2010, both FMC and Gate appealed these denials to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The board heard the appeals and issued its findings of fact and report in April, 2013. It concluded that Gate was a financial institution as defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1, due to the fact that Gate derived more than fifty per cent of its gross income from \u201clending activities\u201d in substantial competition with other financial institutions. The board further agreed with FMC and Gate that as a financial institution with loans held by student borrowers in all fifty States, Gate was entitled to apportion its income according to the rules established in \u00a7 2A, and that Gate properly had reported its \u201creceipts factor\u201d for each of the tax years at issue as required under \u00a7 2A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the board found that Gate\u2019s \u201cproperty factor\u201d was one hundred per cent for each of the taxable years at issue, not zero as had been reported on Gate\u2019s tax returns, with the result that for each taxable year, fifty-one per cent of Gate\u2019s income was taxable in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The combined outcome of the board\u2019s conclusions was that FMC\u2019s taxes were abated in the amount of $8,134,549, and Gate\u2019s taxes were abated in the amount of $4,382,870. While these amounts are substantial, Gate\u2019s approved abatement was more than $4 million less than the amount it originally had sought.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>FMC and Gate timely appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Appeals Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cA decision by the board will not be modified or reversed if the decision \u2018is based on both substantial evidence and a correct application of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Capital One Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>453 Mass. 1, 8, cert. denied, 557 U.S. 919 (2009), quoting <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>443 Mass. 276, 285 (2005).

Finally, in circumstances where a taxpayer seeks an abatement of a tax, \u201c[t]he taxpayer has the burden of proving as a matter of law [its] right to an abatement\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 285. This burden has been found to be particularly heavy in the context of taxpayer challenges to an apportionment formula, because \u201cthe taxpayer must prove by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that the income attributed to the Commonwealth is in fact \u2018out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted\u2019 here or has \u2018led to a grossly distorted result.\u2019 \u201d See <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. 670, 679 (1997) (discussing challenges to corporate tax apportionment under G.

Povich to Governor William F. Weld and Lieutenant Governor Paul Cellucci (July 26, 1995) (Povich memorandum) (regarding House Bill No. 4975, \u201cAn Act relative to the equitable taxation of financial institutions\u201d). See also Memorandum from Barbara Kessner Landau, Assistant General Counsel, Executive Office of Economic Affairs, to Governor\u2019s Legal Office (July 26, 1995) (same). Section 2A sets out income apportionment rules that define how \u201c[t]he commissioner shall determine the part of the net income of a financial institution derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.\u201d See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A <em>(b)-(g). </em>These rules incorporate a formula crafted by the Multistate Tax Commission (commission),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see Povich memorandum, <em>supra, </em>and apply only to financial institutions that are taxable both in the Commonwealth and in other States. They allocate income to the Commonwealth for tax purposes by multiplying the taxpayer\u2019s income by the \u201capportionment percentage\u201d that is \u201cdetermined by adding the taxpayer\u2019s receipts factor, property factor and payroll factor together and dividing the sum by three.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A (b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Each of these listed factors is a fraction, the numerator of which reflects the taxpayer\u2019s receipts, property, or payroll located within the Commonwealth for the taxable year in question, and the denominator of which reflects the taxpayer\u2019s receipts, property, or payroll both within and without the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 2A <em>(d)-(f). </em>In this way, the apportionment formula attempts to \u201capproximate the net income derived from business carried on within the commonwealth.\u201d See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A (g). See also Final Report of Hearing Officer Regarding Proposed Multistate Tax Commission Formula for the Uniform Apportionment of Net Income from Financial Institutions 20, 21 (Apr. 28, 1994), available at http://www.mtc.gov/uploadedFiles/Multistate_ Tax_Commission/Uniformity/Uniformity_Projects/A_-_Z/Final% 20HO%20Rpt%20FinInst.pdf [http://perma.cc/99CH-XSDX] (Final Report) (apportionment formula is designed to \u201cfairly represent the taxpayer\u2019s business activities in the state,\u201d i.e., to approximate the \u201cincome-producing activities of the taxpayer in the state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In this appeal, no party challenges the board\u2019s ruling that Gate qualified as a \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d was taxable in both the Commonwealth and in other States, and was thus entitled to apportion its income according to the mies in \u00a7 2A. There is also no challenge to Gate\u2019s determination, approved by the board, of its receipts factor for each of the years in question,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as well as Gate\u2019s position that it had no payroll factor. The only issue presented is how Gate\u2019s property factor is to be calculated. Specifically, we must determine whether the loan portfolios that represented substantially all of Gate\u2019s property for the tax years at issue should be treated as having been located in whole or in part within the Commonwealth, and thus included in the numerator of Gate\u2019s property factor fraction, or outside the Commonwealth, and therefore excluded from the numerator and included only in the denominator of the fraction. The answer to this question has a significant impact on Gate\u2019s total tax liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the relevant years: if all of Gate\u2019s loans are treated as having been located within the Commonwealth, as the board found, then Gate\u2019s property factor was one hundred per cent. If, however, as FMC and Gate claim, all the loans were located outside the Commonwealth, then for purposes of \u00a7 2A, Gate\u2019s property factor would be zero.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The rules for determining a taxpayer\u2019s property factor are contained in \u00a7 2A <em>(e), </em>and property consisting of loans is the focus of \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi). This section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201c(vi) (A) (1) A loan is considered to be located within the commonwealth if it is properly assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer within the commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201c(2) A loan is properly assigned to the regular place of business with which it has a preponderance of substantive contacts. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201c(B) In the case of a loan which is assigned by the taxpayer to a place without the commonwealth which is not a regular place of business, it shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal by the taxpayer on a showing supported by the preponderance of evidence, that the preponderance of substantive contacts regarding the loan occurred within the commonwealth if, at the time the loan was made the taxpayer\u2019s commercial domicile, as defined in [G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1], was within the commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201c(C) To determine the state in which the preponderance of substantive contacts relating to a loan have occurred, the facts and circumstances regarding the loan at issue shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and consideration shall be given to such activities as the solicitation, investigation, negotiation, approval and administration of the loan.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">General Laws c. 63, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cregular place of business\u201d as \u201can office at which the taxpayer carries on its business in a regular and systematic manner and which is consistently maintained, occupied and used by employees of the taxpayer.\u201d The parties agree that Gate, which had no offices or employees, had no \u201cregular place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of business\u201d either within or outside the Commonwealth. Thus, the loans could not have been assigned under \u00a7 2A (e) (vi) (A) to a regular place of business belonging to Gate. However, Gate argued before the board and continues to argue, essentially, that under \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) and (C), the loans can and should be assigned to the locations of the servicers, because those locations were where the \u201cpreponderance of substantive contacts\u201d relating to the loans occurred. As next discussed, the board rejected this argument, as do we.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">1. <em>Presumption of commercial domicile. </em>First, the board concluded that \u00a7 2A (&lt;?) (vi) (B) creates a rebuttable presumption that where a taxpayer seeks to assign loans to a location that is <em>not </em>a regular place of business of that taxpayer, the loans should be assigned to its commercial domicile. We agree. We view the language of \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to be unambiguous in establishing the rebuttable default presumption described by the board. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999) (court follows language of statute \u201cwhen its language is plain and unambiguous, and its application would not lead to an absurd result, or contravene the Legislature\u2019s clear intent\u201d [quotations and citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Gate notes the presence of the words \u201cat the time the loan was made\u201d in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and contends that this means the presumption of commercial domicile applies only in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of an original lender, and that the presumption exists specifically to prevent such a taxpayer from \u201cartificially assigning\u201d a loan that originated at the taxpayer\u2019s actual place of business to another State where it has no place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Reading the language of this provision as narrowly as Gate proposes, however, renders the statute unworkable for a taxpayer like Gate. This is because \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) contemplates only two assignment alternatives for a taxpayer\u2019s loans: the loans will be assigned to a regular place of business of the taxpayer, either within or outside the Commonwealth \u2014 the alternative described in \u00a7 2A (e) (vi) (A) (1) and (2); or the loan will be assigned outside the Commonwealth to a place that is not a regular place of business of the taxpayer \u2014 the alternative described in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B). If the \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) alternative were to apply only to taxpayers who are original lenders, the statute would provide no guidance when the taxpayer, like Gate, is not an original lender but has no regular place of business. Such a reading would leave open the possibility that loans qualifying as property of the taxpayer could exist without being assigned anywhere. This is clearly an unintended and ultimately absurd result. A more reasonable interpretation is that the phrase \u201cat the time the loan was made\u201d is present in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) to resolve any ambiguity in the case of a taxpayer whose commercial domicile may have changed from within to outside the Commonwealth during the life of the loan. No such ambiguity exists here. Accordingly, the board properly ruled that the presumption in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) applied to Gate without regard to the sites of origination of the loans in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">2. <em>Preponderance of substantive contacts of Gate\u2019s loans. </em>Under \u00a7 <em>2A (e) </em>(vi), to determine the proper assignment of a loan for apportionment purposes, it is necessary to determine whether \u201cthe preponderance of substantive contacts regarding the loan\u201d was within or outside the Commonwealth. Because Gate\u2019s commercial domicile was in the Commonwealth, application of the \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) presumption to Gate means that \u201cthe preponderance of substantive contacts regarding the loan occurred within the commonwealth\u201d for purposes of calculating Gate\u2019s property factor, unless the presumption was rebutted. And \u00a7 2A (e) (vi) (B) places the burden of rebuttal squarely on Gate as the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>In seeking to rebut the presumption, Gate points to \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C), quoted <em>supra, </em>and specifically its language indicating that the \u201cpreponderance of substantive contacts of a loan\u201d must be determined on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d The section goes on to say that the required determination is to include consideration of activities such as the \u201csolicitation,\u201d \u201cinvestigation,\u201d \u201cnegotiation,\u201d \u201capproval,\u201d and \u201cadministration\u201d of the loan. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A (e) (vi) (C) (l)-(5).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>&gt;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The board stated, and Gate agrees, that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>these five listed activities, only \u201cadministration\u201d could possibly apply to Gate\u2019s loans because all the other factors listed relate to the origination of loans and Gate played no role in loan origination. The statute defines \u201cadministration\u201d as \u201cthe process of managing the account,\u201d \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) (5), including bookkeeping, payment collection, customer correspondence, and addressing situations of default \u2014\u25a0 which are essentially the activities performed by the loan servicers in the FMC securitization system.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The board rejected Gate\u2019s claim that because the servicers \u201cadminister\u201d the loans owned by the trusts (and therefore Gate), the servicers\u2019 loan administration activities \u2014 all performed in States other than Massachusetts \u2014 were attributable to Gate. The board reasoned that, as a factual matter, Gate had not proved the servicers were agents of the trusts (or derivatively Gate), and that Gate had not offered any other legal basis for attributing the activities of the servicers to Gate. Accordingly, the board disregarded the activities of the servicers in determining whether Gate had any \u201csubstantive contacts\u201d with the loans outside the Commonwealth and, finding none, applied the presumption of commercial domicile in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) to all the loans in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Gate challenges the board\u2019s determination. It asserts that the board unilaterally, and improperly, inserted the concept of agency into the analysis of \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B), and that even if agency is the appropriate test, the loan documents make clear that the servicers in fact were agents of the trusts and therefore of Gate as the holder of a beneficial interest in each of the trusts. We conclude, however, that an analysis whether the servicers were agents of Gate and, if so, what type of agents they were, is unnecessary in order to locate the \u201cpreponderance of substantive contacts\u201d of the loans. This is because none of the types of \u201cactivities\u201d regarding a loan that \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) (l)-(5) describes \u2014 the SINAA factors (see note 21, supra) \u2014 reasonably can be understood to encompass the activities of an entity other than the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We begin with \u201cadministration.\u201d After identifying the types of actions that collectively comprise the \u201cactivity\u201d of loan administration, \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) (5) states expressly that \u201c[sjuch activity is located at the regular place of business which oversees this activity.\u201d As previously discussed, \u201cregular place of business\u201d is defined specifically in the statute as \u201can office at which <em>the taxpayer </em>carries on its business in a regular and systematic manner and which is consistently maintained, occupied and used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>by employees of <em>the </em>taxpayer\u201d (emphases added). G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 1. Thus, the language of \u00a7 2A (&lt;?) (vi) (C) (5) appears to contemplate that when loan administration is used to determine the \u201cpreponderance of substantive contacts\u201d of a taxpayer\u2019s loan or loans, only the loan administration activities of the taxpayer are taken into consideration; work performed by agents or independent contractors of the taxpayer, at least where the agents or contractors are separate businesses with their own places of business and their own staff, do not fit within the equation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, it is irrelevant whether the servicers were or were not agents of Gate, because in either case, their actions were not appropriately included within the concept of administration as defined in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) (5).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">It is true that this reading of loan administration as requiring activity at the regular place of business of the taxpayer leads to the conclusion that the loans appear to have had no \u201csubstantive contacts\u201d as that concept is described in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) (l)-(5). But \u00a7 2A contains within it a straightforward solution to this problem, which is application of the presumption of commercial domicile as specified in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Nor does our reading of \u00a7 2A create an absurd result when viewing the statute as a whole. The statute expressly recognizes that its provisions regarding the receipts, property, and payroll factors may not reasonably fit the nature of all financial institutions\u2019 business models, and it has a separate provision to accommodate this circumstance. Specifically, \u00a7 2A <em>(g) </em>provides that \u201c[i]f the provisions of subsections <em>(a) </em>to <em>(f), </em>inclusive, are not reasonably adapted to approximate the net income derived from business carried on within the commonwealth, a financial institution may apply to the commissioner, or the commissioner may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>require the financial institution, to have its income derived from business carried on within this commonwealth determined by a method other than that set forth in subsections <em>(a) </em>to <em>(f), </em>inclusive.\u201d Here, although the board found that Gate qualified for taxation purposes as a financial institution, Gate is unlike many if not most financial institutions contemplated in the statute, in that Gate\u2019s narrow role within FMC\u2019s loan securitization business is very different from traditional concepts of banking.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Given this fact, application of an alternative apportionment approach as permitted under \u00a7 2A <em>(g) </em>may well have offered a reasonable option in this case, avoiding what might appear as an exercise of fitting a square peg into a round hole. In fact, the record indicates that the commissioner raised the idea of applying an alternative approach under \u00a7 2A <em>(g) </em>to determine the proper apportionment of Gate\u2019s income, albeit using an approach that resulted in all or substantially all of Gate\u2019s income being apportioned to Massachusetts. Ultimately, however, Gate rejected the proposal to apply \u00a7 2A <em>(g), </em>asserting instead \u2014 incorrectly, we conclude \u2014 that the FIET was specifically designed for taxpayers such as Gate. In these circumstances, Gate\u2019s complaints regarding what may seem like an awkward result arising from application of the provisions of \u00a7 2A (&lt;?) (vi) to the loans in this case ring somewhat hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">As has been discussed, the rules set out in \u00a7 2A seek to produce a reasonable approximation of a financial institution\u2019s net income related to the business it carries on in the Commonwealth. Gate\u2019s business was to assist in the EMC securitization program through participating in the formation of the trusts and holding residual beneficial interests in those trusts. It was a holding company, with no employees of its own, and appears to have exerted no direct control over the work of the servicers in servicing the student loans. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that the servicers\u2019 activities in administering the student loans not be attributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Gate for the purpose of determining the \u201cpreponderance of substantive contacts\u201d regarding the loans under \u00a7 2A (&lt;?) (vi) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In sum, we agree with the board that the presumption established in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (B) has not been rebutted, and all the loans were properly located at Gate\u2019s commercial domicile in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">3. <em>Constitutional considerations. </em>In support of its argument that the servicers\u2019 loan administration activities should have been attributed to Gate, Gate invokes decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this court concerning constitutional standards for attributing activities of a taxpayer\u2019s representative to the taxpayer for taxation-related purposes. While the Supreme Court and this court have identified constitutional issues bearing upon tax apportionment (as we discuss below), all of the cases that Gate cites relate to a State\u2019s capacity to assert jurisdiction over an out-of-State taxpayer for purposes of imposing a tax. See <em>Scripto, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>362 U.S. 207, 208 (1960) (considering whether out-of-State taxpayer had \u201csufficient jurisdictional contacts\u201d with Florida to justify imposition of Florida tax). See also <em>Tyler Pipe Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Washington State Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>483 U.S. 232, 249, 251 (1987) (activities of taxpayer\u2019s in-State representatives adequately supported Washington\u2019s jurisdiction to tax out-of-State taxpayer);<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Jafra Cosmetics, Inc., </em>433 Mass. at 255-256, 261-263 (in-State activities of sales representatives justified sales and use taxation of out-of-State taxpayer). The issue of State jurisdiction to tax in this case is different. The jurisdictional question here is whether any State besides the Commonwealth could theoretically impose a tax on Gate. It is a threshold question that relates only to whether Gate was allowed to apportion its income in accordance with the formula laid out in \u00a7 2A; if a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d like Gate does not have income that is taxable in another State, all of its income is taxable in the Commonwealth. See G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 2A <em>(a). </em>As noted earlier, the board found that Gate was taxable in all fifty States, and thus was entitled to apportion its income. Neither party has appealed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">With respect to apportionment, both the United States Supreme Court and this court have found that the due process clause and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the commerce clause require fairness in apportioning the income of a business that may be taxed in multiple States. See <em>Container Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 169; <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue, </em>447 U.S. 207, 219, 227-228 (1980); <em>Gillette Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>425 Mass. at 680. While the Federal Constitution \u201cimposes no single [apportionment] formula on the States,\u201d apportionment must produce at least a \u201c \u2018rough approximation\u2019 of the corporate income that is \u2018reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gillette Co., supra </em>at 680-681, quoting <em>Exxon Corp., supra </em>at 223. However, if a taxpayer seeks to challenge the appropriateness of an apportionment formula on this basis, it is incumbent upon the taxpayer to show by \u201c \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that the income attributed to the State is in fact \u2018out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted ... in that State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Container Corp. of Am., supra </em>at 170, quoting <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons </em>v. <em>North Carolina ex rel. Maxwell, </em>283 U.S. 123, 135 (1931). See <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n, </em>443 Mass. at 285; <em>Gillette Co., supra </em>at 679-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Two elements of fairness arising under the due process clause have been identified in this context and relate to the present case. \u201cThe first... component of fairness in an apportionment formula is what might be called internal consistency \u2014\u2022 that is, the formula must be such that, if applied by every jurisdiction, it would result in no more than all of the unitary businesses] income being taxed. The second and more difficult requirement is what might be called external consistency \u2014 the factor or factors used in the apportionment formula must actually reflect a reasonable sense of how income is generated.\u201d <em>Gillette Co., </em>425 Mass. at 680, quoting <em>Container Corp. of Am., </em>463 U.S. at 169.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Considering the first factor, we have no reason to conclude that application of the apportionment statute as we have interpreted it produces duplicative taxation of Gate\u2019s income, given that Gate\u2019s Massachusetts apportionment percentage for the tax year at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>was approximately fifty-one per cent, and the record reflects that Gate filed tax returns only in Massachusetts and Florida for the relevant years.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">With respect to the second factor \u2014 whether the apportionment scheme reasonably reflects how a business generates income \u2014 as previously mentioned, the underlying economic activity giving rise to Gate\u2019s income was FMC\u2019s loan securitization program. As the board\u2019s findings reflect, the purpose of Gate\u2019s existence was to hold interests in trusts containing loans as part of FMC\u2019s securitization process. Furthermore, because Gate had no offices or employees of its own, and because it was a wholly owned subsidiary of FMC, it makes more sense to view the income-producing activity of Gate as connected to FMC, its parent company, rather than as connected to the servicers, which were independent and unrelated entities. Viewed this way, we think an outcome that locates all of the loans at Gate\u2019s and FMC\u2019s commercial domicile, rather than at the place of business of the servicers, results in the most appropriate approximation of how Gate generated income.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Gate argues that it was unreasonable to allow Gate\u2019s property factor to increase its over-all apportionment percentage from approximately two per cent to more than fifty per cent, given that the loans did not appear to have any \u201csubstantive contacts\u201d with Massachusetts in the sense described by the SINAA factors. In addition, they argue that Department of Revenue Letter Ruling 87-9 (Sept. 18, 1987) permitted a trust consisting of thousands of loans, only a small percentage of which had connections to Massachusetts, to apportion its income based solely on the percentage of income received from interest on the Massachusetts loans, and that Gate should be entitled to do the same. We disagree. The first point assumes a particular interpretation of \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) \u2014\u2022 specifically that loans must have some \u201csubstantive contacts\u201d of the kind described in \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi) (C) \u2014 that we have concluded is incorrect for the reasons previously discussed. The analogy to the trust described in Letter Ruling 87-9 is also unpersuasive, because the income of that trust was to be apportioned using the formula that applied to corporations, which involved three factors (property, payroll, and sales), of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>trust claimed to have none. Letter Ruling 87-9. Thus, the trust proposed a unique method of apportionment that would apply only to the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d of that case. <em>Id. </em>Again, as noted above, FMC and Gate have not requested alternative apportionment under \u00a7 2A <em>(g), </em>and instead have argued that the general apportionment formula under \u00a7 2A <em>(b) </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In short, Gate has not met its burden to show that apportionment as applied in this case was unfair or unreasonable; we discern no violation of the due process or commerce clause as a result of the decision we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">4. <em>Notice. </em>Finally, Gate argues that the board improperly resolved this case in favor of the commissioner based on a legal theory that the commissioner did not raise before the board, specifically, that an agency relationship was required between Gate and the servicers in order to attribute the servicers\u2019 activities to Gate. Gate claims that this action by the board violates G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7, which states in pertinent part: \u201cthe board shall not consider, unless equity and good conscience so require, any issue of fact or contention of law not specifically set out in the petition upon appeal or raised in the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In this case, it was Gate that put forward the theory that Gate had \u201csubstantive contacts\u201d with the loans through the activities of the servicers. While Gate clearly did not argue that an agency relationship was required in order to attribute the servicers\u2019 activities to Gate, the board was within its authority to consider Gate\u2019s argument concerning the servicers and to determine whether it fit within an appropriate interpretation of \u00a7 2A <em>(e) </em>(vi). The quoted limitation in G. L. c. 58 A, \u00a7 7, has been interpreted to prohibit more surprising or unexpected legal turnabouts, such that one party could not have been expected to adequately advance their position under the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Deveau </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 420-421, 426-428 (2001) (board decided taxpayers\u2019 appeals based on new theory first advanced by commissioner on morning of hearing; court suggested, without needing to decide, that this approach would violate G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7). We conclude that Gate had sufficient notice of the basis of the board\u2019s decision pursuant to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The First Marblehead Corporation (FMC) sold Gate in 2009, which was after the tax years at issue in this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Multistate Tax Commission (commission).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The facts are taken from the decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board), which was in turn based on the parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts and attached exhibits as well as witness testimony and other exhibits admitted during the hearing before the board.
