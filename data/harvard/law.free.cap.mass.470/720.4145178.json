In July, 2005, the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office in Middlesex County located the trial exhibits, including the victim\u2019s blue jeans and underpants. They had been stored in plastic bags since the trial. Beginning in January, 2006, the defendant filed a series of motions to test the evidence for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). These motions were granted and the State police crime laboratory (crime laboratory) and Orchid Cellmark (Cellmark), an independent laboratory, performed DNA testing on the victim\u2019s clothing. The defendant subsequently moved for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (1995), relying on the affidavit of Eric Carita (Carita), a forensic analyst employed by the Connecticut State laboratory,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who opined that the defendant was excluded as the source of the male DNA on the victim\u2019s jeans based on \u201cpotential alleles.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****In July, 2010, a judge in the Superior Court (motion judge) held a two-day evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief, at which Carita and Christine Lemire, the crime laboratory analyst who performed the DNA analysis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Subsequently, on March 28, 2011, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial in a detailed memorandum of decision and order. In an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed the denial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. DiCicco, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 1128 (2014). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review and conclude that the motion judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that, under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 25-26 (1994), Carita\u2019s opinion was not sufficiently reliable to be placed before a jury, and the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>Background. </em>We consider the facts as set forth in the motion judge\u2019s findings after an evidentiary hearing, which are supported by the evidence in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stephens, </em>451 Mass. 370, 372 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">1. <em>Evidence at the 1984 trial. </em>In August, 1983, the victim was walking home through a parking lot in Waltham sometime after 1:30 a.m. when she was attacked by two men. One of these men, later identified as Vincent Park, <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> grabbed the victim and forced her to the ground. While Park pinned the victim down, the second man, subsequently identified as the defendant, pulled the victim\u2019s jeans and underwear down to her ankles. As she struggled, the second man raped her vaginally. The first man called the second man \u201cChick\u201d and said something about his \u201cturn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">While the rape was occurring, a van entered the parking lot and illuminated the area with its headlights such that the victim could see the second man. This man then stood up and urinated on and around the victim. The two men then ran from the parking lot with the van in pursuit. The victim had trouble getting up because she kept slipping on the urine, but on doing so, she ran to a telephone booth and called her father. The police were called and the victim went to the hospital, where evidence was collected and the victim was interviewed. Two hours after the rape, the victim told police that she thought she had seen the second man before and that his name was Robert or \u201cChico.\u201d Additionally, she provided the police with a physical description of the second man. The police took the evidence, including the victim\u2019s clothing, when leaving the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Later that morning, the victim went to the police station, looked through two books of photographs, and positively identified the defendant as the person who had raped her. The police located the defendant at a local shelter at 6:45 a.m. Although the defendant had been scheduled to be at the shelter the previous night, he did not arrive until shortly before the police looked for him there. The defendant fit the description of the second man provided by the victim. At trial, the victim identified the defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">At trial, the parties stipulated that Mark Grant, a State police chemist, would testify to facts contained in his October, 1983, report, that chemical tests conducted on a stain on the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>underwear did not exclude the defendant as the source, but were inconclusive as to anything further. The tests, conducted both on the stain and on a vaginal smear slide taken from the rape kit administered to the victim after the attack, were positive for the presence of a substance characteristically found in semen, but no sperm cells were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The defendant was convicted and sentenced to a term of not more than twenty years or less than eighteen years in State prison. On April 26, 1985, the Appeals Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiCicco, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (1985). After completing his sentence, the defendant was found to be a sexually dangerous person and was committed to the Nemansket Treatment Center at Bridgewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">2. <em>Postconviction proceedings. </em>In January, 2006, after the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office located the trial exhibits,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant filed a motion for necessary access to test evidence for DNA, a motion for funds to do comparison DNA testing, and a request for discovery and access to the smear slide. These motions were granted subject to the parties\u2019 filing a stipulation as to protocols for handling and testing the DNA evidence and subject to the availability of the smear slide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In July, 2006, the defendant\u2019s motion for funds for a defense expert, Thomas Fedor of the Serological Research Institute, to observe the inventory and evidence assessment at the crime laboratory was granted. Later that month, the Commonwealth filed a stipulation for release and testing of the evidence, wherein the parties agreed that portions of the victim\u2019s jeans and underpants would be released for testing. This stipulation was approved and Fedor was present in November, 2006, when the clothing was examined at the crime laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">a. <em>Results of the crime laboratory DNA testing. </em>In December, 2006, the victim\u2019s clothing was examined at the crime laboratory. No sperm cells or seminal fluid residue was detected in the stains on the victim\u2019s underpants. Several stains were observed on the exterior and interior of the jeans, and sperm cells were detected in three of them. Cuttings were then taken from these three stains (stains 9, 13, and 14). Only stains 13 and 14 are relevant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The crime laboratory<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> extracted DNA from the above mentioned cuttings and performed short tandem repeat (STR) testing/ typing (specifically Y-STR testing) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on stains 13 and 14. The Y-STR DNA testing is conducted first by subjecting the sample to a process of \u201cdifferential extraction\u201d which separates any sperm cells (sperm fraction) from epithelial cells (nonsperm fraction). On stain 13, the crime laboratory concluded that the defendant was excluded as the source of the nonsperm fraction DNA,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but that there was insufficient DNA for analysis in the sperm fraction, as the only result was a single \u201cpotential allele,\u201d falling below the threshold at which alleles can be positively identified, at locus DYS456.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As for stain 14, the crime laboratory concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>there was a mixture of more than one male source in the nonsperm fraction, which yielded inconclusive results for comparison with the defendant\u2019s DNA, that is, he could not be included or excluded as one of the contributors. With respect to the sperm fraction, there was insufficient DNA for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">b. <em>Motion for postconviction relief </em>In November, 2007, the defendant filed a motion for postconviction relief, arguing that the results of the comparative DNA testing done by the crime laboratory exonerated him. In March, 2008, the defendant filed a substitute motion for funds and access to do comparison DNA testing by the defendant\u2019s expert, or, in the alternative, for further testing by the Commonwealth and for funds for observation of such testing by the defendant\u2019s expert.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On September 24, 2008, after a hearing, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for funds to have Cellmark take custody of the useable samples from the crime laboratory and subject them to further DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">With respect to stain 13, Cellmark concurred with the crime laboratory\u2019s conclusion as to the nonsperm fraction, that the defendant was excluded as the source. With respect to the sperm fraction, where the crime laboratory testing had revealed a single potential allele, insufficient for analysis, Cellmark\u2019s testing detected no male DNA at all. Cellmark\u2019s testing of the stain 14 sample also detected no male DNA in the sperm fraction, and concurred with the crime laboratory that the defendant could not be excluded as a contributor of the male DNA detected in the nonsperm sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In March, 2010, the defendant filed a document entitled \u201cSubmission of New Forensic Analysis and Motion for Immediate, Relief,\u201d together with an affidavit of Carita. The defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>retained Carita to review the test data from the analyses of the crime laboratory and Cellmark. In his affidavit, Carita stated an opinion that excluded the defendant as the source of DNA found in both stain samples (13 and 14) taken from the victim\u2019s jeans. The Commonwealth filed an opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion along with an affidavit of Lemire. In April, 2010, the judge found that, notwithstanding certain limitations, the Carita affidavit stated an opinion that might be admissible in evidence. Accordingly, she ordered an evidentiary hearing, explaining that the defendant would have the burden of establishing both the admissibility of Carita\u2019s opinion and that any DNA evidence that would be admissible satisfied the standard for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">3. <em>Evidentiary hearing. A </em>two-day evidentiary hearing was held, at which both Carita and Lemire testified<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the laboratory reports were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">a. <em>Carita\u2019s testimony. </em>Consistent with his affidavit, Carita testified that the defendant was excluded as the donor of DNA extracted from the nonsperm fractions of stains 13 and 14. Although both laboratory reports and Lemire concurred that the defendant was excluded as the source of the nonsperm fraction of stain 13, only Carita testified that the defendant was also excluded as the donor of DNA extracted from the nonsperm fraction of stain 14. Although he agreed with the crime laboratory (and Cellmark) that the DNA from the nonsperm fraction of stain 14 was a mixture from more than one male, Carita based his opinion of exclusion on the fact that \u201ctwo possible genetic markers\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>identified by the crime laboratory as potential alleles at one location (DYS458) were inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s allele at that location.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Additionally, Carita testified that the defendant also was excluded as the donor of the DNA extracted from the sperm fraction of stain 13. His opinion was based on the single potential allele, measured at approximately seventy relative fluorescent units (RFUs), at DYS456, far below the \u201ccall\u201d threshold of 165 RFUs established by the crime laboratory. See notes 12 and 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Carita acknowledged in his testimony that his opinion was not in accord with the crime laboratory\u2019s Y-STR interpretive guidelines, and offered no evidence that the Scientific Working Group DNA Analysis Methods (DNA working group) Y-STR guidelines explicitly permit an exclusion to be based on a single potential allele. He contended, however, that his conclusions were nevertheless permissible under the provisions of the DNA working group\u2019s Y-STR guidelines, which state that \u201cthe interpretation of the results of casework is a matter of professional judgment and expertise . . . not every situation can or should be covered in a preset rule.\u201d Carita went on to testify that he relied on the Connecticut State laboratory interpretive guidelines, which bind him in his consulting work, to form his opinion, but these were not introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">b. <em>Motion judge\u2019s ruling. </em>After hearing, the judge ruled that, given the limited data from the low-level DNA procured from the victim\u2019s clothing, Carita\u2019s opinions with respect to the sperm fraction of stain 13 and the nonsperm fraction of stain 14, which were based exclusively on potential alleles, were not sufficiently reliable to be placed before a jury. With respect to the sperm fraction of stain 13, the judge found that Carita cited no authority for the proposition that an exclusion may be based on a single potential allele in the absence of any other data, and that the potential allele on which he relied did not meet \u201cthe requirements of the laboratory\u2019s calling threshold, which gives absolute confirmation that a genetic marker is DNA and not a possible artifact.\u201d The judge also found that although Carita agreed that the detected DNA in the nonsperm fraction of stain 14 was a mixture, he cited no authority for the proposition that an exclusion may be based on two potential alleles at one locus in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>mixed sample where the possibility of stutter<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> cannot be eliminated. Although the judge acknowledged that it is permissible to use potential alleles in the interpretation of a DNA profile, \u201c[i]n this case . . . given the minimal amount of DNA, Carita is not using potential alleles to interpret results. His opinions are based solely on peaks identified as potential alleles in the context of very limited data obtained from low-level DNA.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">After concluding that Carita\u2019s opinions with respect to the sperm fraction of stain 13 and the nonsperm fraction of stain 14 would not be admitted in evidence, she went on to find that the newly discovered DNA evidence which would be admissible lacked the materiality, weight, and significance necessary to demonstrate that it would likely have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cMotions for a new trial are addressed to the \u2018sound discretion\u2019 of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiBenedetto, </em>458 Mass. 657, 663-664 (2011), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De Christoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 542 (1971). See also Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). \u201cJudges are to apply the standard set out in Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b) rigorously,\u201d and \u201cgrant such a motion only if it appears that justice may not have been done\u201d (quotations and citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 504 (1992). \u201c[A]n appellate court will examine the motion judge\u2019s conclusion only to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>DiBenedetto, </em>458 Mass. at 664, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wolinski, </em>431 Mass. 228, 235 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">1. <em>The exclusion of Carita\u2019s opinion. </em>In <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass, at 25-26, we adopted, in part, the standard for the admissibility of expert testimony delineated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993). In so doing, we held that \u201ca proponent of scientific opinion evidence may demonstrate the reliability or validity of the underlying scientific theory or process by some other means, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>that is, without establishing general acceptance,\u201d <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 26, as \u201cthe touchstone of admissibility is reliability, and not necessarily general acceptance within the scientific community.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vao Sok, </em>425 Mass. 787, 796 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>424 Mass. 184, 185-186 (1997). However, we noted that, \u201cin most cases general acceptance will be the significant, and \u2018often the only, issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 310 (2000), quoting <em>Lanigan, supra. </em>Accordingly, \u201ca party seeking to introduce scientific evidence may lay an adequate foundation either by establishing general acceptance in the scientific community or by showing that the evidence is reliable or valid through an alternate means.\u201d <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Under <em>Daubert-Lanigan, </em>the motion judge, in her role as gatekeeper, \u201chas a significant function to carry out in deciding on the admissibility of a scientific expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. at 25. Conclusions based on personal observation or clinical experience are subject to this analysis. <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. at 313. The expert\u2019s opinion must \u201chave a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his discipline,\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592, and the motion judge must assess \u201cwhether the reasoning or methodology underlying [an expert witness\u2019s] testimony is scientifically valid and whether that reasoning or methodology is properly applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 26, quoting <em>Daubert, supra </em>at 592-593.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Accordingly, if the process or theory underlying an expert\u2019s opinion lacks sufficient reliability or an expert cannot provide a reliable factual basis for his conclusions, the trial judge must exclude the opinion from reaching the trier of fact. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. at 25-26. See <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. at 315.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant, as the proponent of the expert testimony at issue, has the burden to establish that Carita\u2019s opinion is reliable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sliech-Brodeur, </em>457 Mass. 300, 328 n.41 (2010), citing <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. at 314. We review a judge\u2019s determination to admit or exclude expert testimony under <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>for an abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>462 Mass. 827, 844 (2012). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pytou Heang, </em>458 Mass. 827, 844 (2011). As we have held previously, \u201cthe admissibility of DNA test results should be determined on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>450 Mass. 858, 871 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 (1991).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">a. <em>Stain 13. </em>The defendant argues that Carita\u2019s opinion regarding the sperm fraction of stain 13 is admissible for a few reasons. First, he contends that the opinion meets the <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>standard as it is \u201cbased on reliable data from which [Carita] drew a logical conclusion.\u201d The defendant notes that the motion judge never found that the potential allele found in the sperm fraction of stain 13 was unreliable. Further, both Carita and Lemire testified that potential alleles were used in the work of DNA analysts. Both individuals additionally agreed that the potential allele was correctly designated and that it had the hallmarks of correct binning and good peak morphology. See note 13, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the potential allele occurred at a smaller locus, making it more efficiently amplified and, the defendant contends, reliable. The defendant argues that excluding Carita\u2019s opinion because of factors such as potential DNA degradation<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is improper, as both experts agreed that degradation would not change the defendant\u2019s allele at DYS456.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Second, the defendant argues that Carita\u2019s opinion was reasonable, and that Carita\u2019s reliance on a single potential allele is \u201cmerely application of accepted methodology to a specific context.\u201d He contends that Carita did follow the Y-STR interpretation guidelines set forth by the DNA working group, as promulgated in January, 2009, which state that interpreting evidence is a matter of \u201cprofessional judgment and expertise\u201d and \u201c[n]ot every situation can or should be covered by a preset rule.\u201d Further, the defendant contends that Carita\u2019s conclusion aligns with \u00a7 1.1.1.1. of the DNA working group\u2019s Y-STR guidelines, which states that the \u201canalytical thresholds are defined as the minimum and maximum intensity thresholds between which data are reliable for use in allele designations.\u201d Accordingly, he contends that the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>a specific DNA working group guideline governing exclusion on single potential alleles is of no import.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Last, the defendant argues that the motion judge misunderstood her gatekeeping role under <em>Daubert-Lanigan. </em>He contends that the motion judge\u2019s issue with Carita\u2019s interpretation of the data and her concerns over factors such as possible degradation ought to have gone only to the opinion\u2019s weight, rather than its admissibility, and remained a question for a jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">After reviewing the record before the judge below, we cannot say that she abused the discretion afforded to her under <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>in excluding Carita\u2019s testimony. Carita\u2019s opinion that the defendant was excluded as the contributor of the sperm fraction of stain 13 was based solely on a single below-threshold peak. He acknowledged that this potential allele did not meet the crime laboratory\u2019s calling threshold, which would have provided \u201cabsolute confirmation that a genetic marker is DNA and not a possible artifact,\u201d but nevertheless was \u201cprobably true\u201d DNA.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although it is undisputed that such potential alleles may be used for interpretational purposes along with other data when examining an individual\u2019s DNA profile, it was not an abuse of discretion to find that, in the absence of any authority substantiating Carita\u2019s opinion, a single potential allele without any other data is not enough to exclude an individual. As Lemire testified, \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s just not enough data ... to generate any comparison . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Based on the record on appeal, Carita provided virtually no support for his opinion except to testify that the DNA working group does not explicitly prohibit this practice and that he once before had rendered a similar exclusion opinion based on a single potential allele. Aside from this testimony, the defendant offered no evidence to establish that Carita\u2019s opinion was generally accepted by the relevant scientific community or otherwise was sufficiently reliable. Carita cited to no scientific authority, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>either his affidavit or his hearing testimony, to support his ultimate conclusion, instead relying solely on his \u201cjudgment and expertise.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nor did the defendant supply the judge with written guidelines for Carita\u2019s laboratory in Connecticut or any other laboratory which supported the reliability of Carita\u2019s opinion. See <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. at 315, quoting <em>Kumho Tire Co. </em>v. <em>Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 157 (1999) (no rule requires court \u201cto admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Carita pointed to no error in Lemire\u2019s analysis and did not challenge Cellmark\u2019s conclusions that it found no DNA at all in the sperm fraction of stain 13. Although it is accurate that Lemire agreed that the potential allele in question was likely real human DNA, she explained that, under the DNA working group and the crime laboratory\u2019s protocols, she could not confirm this conclusion, as the potential allele registered below the call threshold and she had no other results to interpret. She explained that although the peak in question resembled real DNA, it could have just been noise given its registration below the call threshold. Further, while acknowledging that a potential allele may be used for interpretation, Lemire repeatedly testified that in order to use potential alleles below threshold in her analysis she would need additional information at any given profile in order to utilize that information for an interpretation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This was all the more convincing to the judge given Lemire\u2019s testimony that the tested sample is \u201clow template DNA,\u201d and it is possible that inhibition<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>and degradation may have been factors in the sample.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">b. <em>Stain 14. </em>The defendant also argues that Carita\u2019s opinion regarding the nonsperm fraction of stain 14 ought to be admissible. Testing indicated that this fraction was likely a mixture of DNA from more than one male. Data were retrieved at just four loci and only two alleles (out of a potential seventeen or eighteen) were called. Of these two called alleles, one at DYS393 matched the defendant, while the other at DYS389I was inconsistent with his profile. Two other potential alleles (one at DYS389I and the other at DYS391) were also consistent with the defendant. Of chief significance to Carita\u2019s opinion was the identification of two additional potential alleles at another locus, DYS458, which did not match the defendant. Lemire and Carita agreed that the presence of these two potential alleles at the same location likely indicated a mixture of DNA from more than one source. Carita, however, inferred from these two potential alleles that the defendant definitively could be excluded as the contributor of the nonsperm fraction of stain 14. Lemire, on the other hand, testified that the data obtained were insufficient for comparison. Cellmark\u2019s test results agreed with Lemire\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">As with the sperm fraction from stain 13, discussed above, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for the judge to rule Carita\u2019s opinion inadmissible. As an initial matter, the two potential alleles at DYS458 that form the basis of Carita\u2019s opinion were just fifteen RFUs above the crime laboratory\u2019s noise threshold. Lemire testified that sufficient DNA was not found such that one could eliminate the possibility of \u201cstutter\u201d from this mixed sample.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> She explained that the two potential alleles in question, at just fifteen RFUs, gave rise to the possibility of a peak which would be consistent with the defendant\u2019s known DNA profile at DYS458 in a \u201cstutter\u201d position.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> She explained that if there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>sufficient DNA in the sample, which there was not, an analyst could determine whether there was DNA present from something other than a stutter artifact. However, Lemire explained that here the defendant could not be excluded because the data were too limited to evaluate whether there was something more than stutter present.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Carita testified that \u201cthere was no stutter available for evaluation,\u201d as it was a \u201clow-level sample.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The appellate record is devoid of any reliable authority to support Carita\u2019s conclusion that an individual can be excluded as a donor based on these two potential alleles that (1) are in a low-level mixed sample, (2) register merely fifteen RFUs above the noise threshold, and (3) may represent a stutter peak. He does not point to any DNA working group or crime laboratory guideline or other scientific authority that permits his conclusion. Carita did not merely use these potential alleles to aid in his over-all interpretation of a DNA profile, but instead he made below-threshold peaks the sole basis for his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">2. <em>Admissible evidence as factor injury deliberations. </em>We also must consider whether the defendant has established that the DNA evidence that is admissible casts meaningful doubt on the justice of his conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Grace, 397 Mass. 303, 305 (1986); Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b) (\u201ctrial judge . . . may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 516 (2001), overruled on other grounds by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>455 Mass. 230 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 Mass. 212, 218 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The relevant question is not whether the verdict would have necessarily been different, but \u201cwhether the new evidence would probably have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. at 306. Additionally, the new evidence must demonstrate such materiality, weight, and significance that the motion judge could find that \u201cthere is a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As rule 30 (b) motions are attacks on final decisions, they are \u201cgranted only in extraordinary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>stances,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comita, </em>441 Mass. 86, 93 (2004), and the defendant has the burden of producing a \u201ccredible reason\u201d to reverse the final decision that \u201coutweighs the risk of prejudice to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 662 (1998), quoting <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Both the crime laboratory and Cellmark agreed that the defendant was excluded as the source of the DNA recovered from the nonsperm fraction of stain 13. The defendant argues that this stain must have been deposited by the assailant\u2019s urine at the time of the attack, by virtue of the victim\u2019s trial testimony that the assailant urinated \u201con and around me\u201d and that she slipped in urine while attempting to stand.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant argues that because these cells indisputably do not belong to him, he could not have been the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">However, as noted by the judge, there is no scientific method of ascertaining whether these cells were deposited by the assailant or by any one of the many individuals who handled the evidence after the commission of the crime. The pants in question were taken from the victim at the hospital, turned over to the police, and admitted in evidence at trial. For over twenty years the evidence was indisputably stored in plastic bags, an environment incapable of protecting against contamination.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument that the epithelial cells present in stain 13 necessarily came from the assailant\u2019s urine is a statement of conjecture, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">It remains the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate the importance of newly available evidence, see <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. at 306, and there is simply no way of determining when and under what circumstances the male DNA obtained from the nonsperm fraction of this stain was deposited. Lemire specifically testified that she was unable to draw any conclusions as to the time or manner by which the DNA was deposited and she had no scientific way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>of assessing whether the evidence had been contaminated prior to its arrival at the crime laboratory. Accordingly, the judge could not determine whether the exclusion of the defendant as the contributor of this DNA had any significant probative value, thereby diluting the defendant\u2019s argument of materiality and undermining claims that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In sum, the newly available, admissible evidence would have shown that (1) the DNA, if any, contained in the sperm cells of both stains and the nonsperm cells of stain 14 were insufficient to either include or exclude the defendant as their donor; and (2) it is not possible to determine the significance of the fact that the defendant was excluded as a source of the nonsperm cells in stain 13. We agree with the judge that this evidence would not be capable of casting meaningful doubt on the jury\u2019s verdict that the defendant was the perpetrator of the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">3. <em>Additional expert funds. </em>The defendant first filed a motion for funds to do comparison DNA testing in January, 2006. In May of that year, the motion was granted in the amount of $4,000. Subsequently, in July, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for funds in the amount of $5,000 for his defense expert at the time (Fedor) to observe the inventory and assessment of evidence at the crime laboratory. This motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Nearly two years later, in March, 2008, the defendant filed a substitute motion for funds and access to do comparison DNA testing by the defendant\u2019s expert, or, in the alternative, for further testing by the Commonwealth and for funds for observation of such testing by the defendant\u2019s expert. A second motion for funds was filed in September, 2008, and the judge permitted the defendant\u2019s motion in the amount of $6,575 to have Cellmark take custody of usable samples from the crime laboratory and subject them to independent DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In October, 2009, the defendant moved for funds in the amount of $5,500 for the attendance of Fedor and \u201ca like amount\u201d for the attendance of a representative from Cellmark at an evidentiary hearing. As of March, 2010, the motion judge did not believe, based on the record as it existed (which included an affidavit submitted by Fedor as well as reports from both the crime laboratory and Cellmark), that the defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">Subsequently, the defendant filed a document entitled \u201cSubmission of New Forensic Analysis and Motion for Immediate Relief,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>alongside the aforementioned Carita affidavit. The defendant had not sought court approval to retain Carita, and according to his affidavit, Carita had reviewed test data from the crime laboratory\u2019s analysis on a voluntary basis up until that point. The Commonwealth filed an opposition, but in April, 2010, the judge found that, notwithstanding certain limitations, the Carita affidavit stated an opinion that might be admissible in evidence. Accordingly, the motion judge granted an evidentiary hearing, ordering the parties to \u201cexplore the possibility of minimizing the cost to the Commonwealth\u201d by taking video testimony of Fedor and a Cellmark representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The defendant filed, and the judge allowed, a motion for funds for the attendance of an expert witness in the amount of $4,500 for Carita to attend the evidentiary hearing. In his motion, the defendant made clear that this request was \u201can all inclusive authorization, covering preparation, travel, and court time.\u201d The hearing took place on July 9 and 23, 2010, at which both Carita and Lemire testified. As discussed above, the motion judge ultimately found that Carita\u2019s opinions would not be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Approximately one year later, in May, 2011, the defendant sought additional funds to cover the remainder of Carita\u2019s bill, explaining that the original funds sought constituted an underestimate based on an expected one-day evidentiary hearing. The motion judge denied the motion without prejudice to renew. On September 1, 2011, the defendant filed a renewed motion for funds with an accompanying affidavit detailing Carita\u2019s dates of service, work performed, and time spent traveling. The defendant asserted that Carita was retained because the cost of transporting Fedor and an expert from Cellmark was \u201csubstantial,\u201d and counsel had been \u201cunsuccessful\u201d in making video conferencing arrangements. The motion judge denied this motion as well, basing her decision on the defendant\u2019s failure to seek prior approval to retain Carita and her view that Carita\u2019s testimony was unreliable, inadmissible, and put forth solely \u201cto supplement an inadequate record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Rule 30 (c) (5) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), and as explained by the Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 30, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1710-1711 (LexisNexis 2014), \u201cgives judges discretion to allow for the payment of costs associated with the preparation and presentation of a new trial mo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>tian\u201d (quotations and citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>438 Mass. 535, 555, cert, denied, 539 U.S. 907 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>439 Mass. 184, 204, cert, denied, 540 U.S. 923, and cert, denied, 540 U.S. 973 (2003). Further, where an indigent defendant seeks to obtain additional evidence in connection with a motion for postconviction relief that would likely raise a meritorious defense warranting a new trial, the judge has discretion to grant a motion for funds to hire an expert. See <em>Mitchell, </em>438 Mass, at 555. A judge considering such a motion for expert funds must consider \u201cnot only the potential admissibility of the expert\u2019s testimony and its cost, but also the \u2018desirability or necessity\u2019 of the testimony to the requesting party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>441 Mass. 146,153 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass. 156, 161 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The judge likely factored the above considerations into her assessment when granting the initial $4,500 for Carita to appear and testify at the evidentiary hearing, given that she ordered the hearing only after receiving Carita\u2019s affidavit and finding that Carita presented an opinion that \u201cmight be admissible.\u201d At that point, the motion judge had before her the substance of Carita\u2019s testimony, which did not vary at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Although the judge would have had discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s initial request for funds, see <em>Zimmerman, </em>441 Mass. at 152-153, her initial approval strongly supports the inference that she deemed Carita\u2019s services to be reasonably necessary. And although the defendant did not seek explicit permission to retain Carita, the judge implicitly provided such permission when granting $4,500 for Carita to appear and testify at the evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Accordingly, it appears that the judge predicated the grant of additional expert funds on whether she ultimately agreed with the substance of Carita\u2019s opinion, and when denying the defendant\u2019s renewed motion for funds, she explicitly stated that \u201c[h]ad the Court realized the extent to which the opinions of Mr. Carita that led to the evidentiary hearing were not based on any accepted or reliable scientific methodology, the Court would not have allowed\u201d the original funds for Carita\u2019s attendance and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Carita adequately documented the services he performed and the time spent assisting the defendant\u2019s case. He testified on behalf of the defendant over the course of an (unanticipated) two-day evidentiary hearing and assisted defense counsel in draft<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ing proposed findings of fact. Additionally, although the judge took issue with the fact that the defendant did not obtain explicit permission to retain Carita, up until the point at which the defendant sought and the judge granted funds, Carita had provided his services pro bona. Once the judge granted the funds requested by the defendant so that Carita could attend the evidentiary hearing, it was not unreasonable for the defendant to believe he had the judge\u2019s permission to retain Carita. Although the defendant\u2019s initial request assured the judge it would be an \u201call inclusive authorization,\u201d the evidentiary hearing lasted one day longer than anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">It was only in hindsight, after her ultimate finding on the admissibility of his opinion, that the judge denied additional funds. This is impermissible. See <em>Zimmerman, </em>441 Mass. at 152-153 (judge should consider not only potential admissibility of expert testimony, but also \u201cdesirability or necessity\u201d to requesting party\u2019s case). See also <em>Lockley, </em>381 Mass, at 161. Accordingly, it was an abuse of discretion to deny the defendant\u2019s supplemental request to pay Carita for additional services rendered.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed and the denial of supplemental expert funds is reversed.

The crime laboratory also established a \u201ccall thresh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>old,\u201d which is the level at which the laboratory would identify or report a peak as an allele given the strength of the result.

Until he filed the Carita affidavit in March, 2010, the defendant had relied on an affidavit submitted by Fedor. Fedor did not personally analyze the DNA, but he had reviewed the test data from the crime laboratory. Fedor agreed with the crime laboratory that the defendant was excluded as the source of the DNA on the nonsperm fraction of stain 13. He disagreed, however, with the crime laboratory\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient data to include or exclude the defendant as the source of the DNA from the nonsperm fraction of stain 14, concluding that the defendant was excluded as its source. Fedor did note that, \u201c[ajdmittedly, there is the problem of \u2018extraneous DNA,\u2019 \u201d but qualified this statement given his speculation that the cuttings were taken from the area of the victim\u2019s jeans that would have been \u201cpotentially soaking in the assailant\u2019s urine.\u201d Fedor did not address the crime laboratory\u2019s conclusion that the partial DNA profile obtained from stain 14 indicated the presence of more than one source.

We note that this is possible, as a crime laboratory\u2019s chemist averred in her report that the failure to detect semen and urine is unremarkable, given that such fluids do not have cell walls and break down more easily than epithelial cells.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">The crime laboratory\u2019s DNA Y-STR report states, \u201c[e]xtraneous DNA may be present on common articles such as clothing, shoes, etc. This extraneous DNA often manifests itself as a low level minor male contributor in a DNA result, and may have no probative value in a case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">It would have been permissible for the judge to deny the request for additional funds if they were not justified because the additional expenses had been foreseeable (but not approved in advance) or because the amount was unreasonably high for the services rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
