A Superior Court jury found the defendant guilty of mayhem, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A <em>(b); </em>and breaking and entering a vehicle in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge erred by giving the model jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification that we adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296, 310-311 (Appendix) (1979), rather than the instruction he requested, which would have informed the jury about various scientific principles regarding eyewitness identification. We conclude that the judge did not err by declining to instruct the jury about these principles where the defendant offered no expert testimony, scholarly articles, or treatises that established that these principles were \u201cso generally accepted that ... a standard jury instruction stating [those principles] would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. 837, 845 (1997), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass. 815, 818-819 (1995). Therefore, we affirm the convictions of mayhem and of breaking and entering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>However, now that we have the benefit of the Report and Recommendations of the Supreme Judicial Court Study Group on Eyewitness Evidence (Study Group Report),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the comments in response to it,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that there are scientific principles regarding eyewitness identification that are \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it is appropriate in the future to instruct juries regarding these principles so that they may apply the principles in their evaluation of eyewitness identification evidence. We include as an Appendix to this opinion a provisional jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification evidence, and we invite comments regarding its content and clarity before we declare it a model instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This provisional instruction should be given, where appropriate, in trials that commence after issuance of this opinion until a model instruction is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>Background. </em>At approximately 1:30 a.m. on September 10, 2011, the defendant, who appeared intoxicated, walked into a gasoline station convenience store in Pittsfield, bumped into a customer, Lindsay Holtzman, and asked the employee who was working the cash register, Jordan Wilson, for a box of matches. Wilson asked the defendant to apologize to Holtzman. In response, the defendant cursed and stared at Wilson, and challenged him to a fight. Wilson laughed and gave the defendant a box of matches. The defendant left the store, but continued to yell at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Wilson to meet him outside to fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">When the defendant left the store, the victim and his friend, Gerald Mortensen, were sitting in the victim\u2019s automobile, which was parked in a well-lit portion of the store\u2019s parking lot, approximately ten to fifteen feet from the front door of the store. The victim was in the driver\u2019s seat with the window down. After the victim and the defendant made eye contact, the defendant approached the vehicle and said to the victim, \u201cWhat the fuck are you looking at, tough guy?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cI\u2019m not looking at anything.\u201d The defendant then pulled a box cutter from his back pocket, reached inside the vehicle with his left arm, and slashed the victim with the blade behind the victim\u2019s ear and down his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Mortensen, who was sitting on the passenger\u2019s side, ran inside the store, said that his friend had been cut, and told a store clerk to call for help. Mortensen and Holtzman then left the store and watched as the defendant walked backwards toward a corner of the parking lot, still staring at the victim. The victim was taken to a hospital where he received approximately thirty stitches.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">On September 15, Wilson went to the Pittsfield police station to meet with Detective Timothy Koenig. Wilson said that he had seen the person who injured the victim before and could identify him. Detective Koenig created a pool of 975 archived photographs that fit Wilson\u2019s description of the person. Wilson used a computer, which displayed twelve photographs per page, to look through the pool. He eventually selected the defendant\u2019s photograph. When he made the identification, he reported that he was \u201c110 per cent positive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Detective Koenig then created a simultaneous array containing eight photographs, one of which depicted the defendant, and presented the array that same day to Mortensen and the victim separately.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mortensen stated that none of the photographs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>showed the assailant. The victim said that he did not think the assailant \u201c[wa]s anyone in these photos,\u201d but added that if he had to choose somebody, it would be the man with a chin similar to that of the assailant; that man was the defendant. Holtzman did not view a photographic array, although Detective Koenig attempted to reach her by telephone more than once to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On September 18, Holtzman, Mortensen, and the victim were driving together, and stopped for gasoline at a different service station in Pittsfield.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Holtzman and the victim entered the convenience store while Mortensen stayed inside the victim\u2019s vehicle. The victim testified that he briefly left the store to retrieve exact change from his automobile to purchase drinks and cigarettes. When he reentered the store, he immediately saw the defendant and recognized him as the assailant. After he put down his change, the victim and Holtzman left the store together, and confirmed with each other that the man in the store was the assailant. The victim then told Mortensen that the defendant was inside the store. When the defendant left the store, Mortensen agreed that the defendant was the assailant and the victim called the police on his cellular telephone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As the victim spoke with the police, the defendant left the gasoline station in someone\u2019s automobile. The victim and Mortensen followed the defendant to an apartment complex in Pittsfield, with the victim communicating the defendant\u2019s location to the police as he was driving. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived at the apartment complex and asked the victim and Mortensen to perform a showup identification; they identified the defendant as the assailant. After the defendant\u2019s arrest, Detective Koenig interviewed Holtzman, who confirmed that the person in the convenience store on September 18 had been the same person she saw at the other convenience store on September 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Before trial, the defendant filed motions to suppress Holtzman\u2019s and the victim\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial judge denied the motions. At trial, the defendant argued that he had been mistakenly identified as the assailant, and offered the testimony of his father, Earl Kirchner, who said that he lived with the defendant and that the defendant did not leave his apartment on the evening of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The defendant\u2019s requested eyewitness identification instruction. </em>The defendant requested that the judge provide a jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification that essentially mirrored a model instruction that had become effective in New Jersey approximately one week before the defendant\u2019s trial commenced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The proffered jury instruction was considerably longer and more detailed than the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction. It would have instructed the jury on various principles regarding eyewitness identification and human memory, most importantly that (1) human memory does not operate like a video recording that a person can replay to recall what happened;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) a witness\u2019s level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of confidence in an identification may not indicate its accuracy;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) high levels of stress can reduce the likelihood of making an accurate identification;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (4) information from other witnesses or outside sources can affect the reliability of an identification and inflate an eyewitness\u2019s confidence in the identification;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (5) viewing the same person in multiple identification procedures may increase the risk of misidentification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The judge denied the request and gave an identification instruction consistent with the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction. The judge reasoned that the principles included in the defendant\u2019s request were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>more appropriate for expert testimony or for closing argument.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Furthermore, the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\u201c[Tjhis [proposed instruction] adds facts in. The process of remembering consists of three stages. That may be true. That may not be true. I have no idea myself but there is no information given to the jury that that is in fact accurate. So I cannot instruct them as a matter of law that that\u2019s what the law is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The defendant objected to the omission of that part of his requested instruction, which recited these five scientific principles, so we review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The issue before us is not whether the judge had the discretion to give the proffered instruction, but whether he abused his discretion by refusing to do so. See <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass, at 818-819 (no error in declining to instruct on cross-racial identification, but giving proposed instruction \u201cmay be appropriate in the judge\u2019s discretion\u201d). We conclude that, given the record before him, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We have long recognized that \u201ca principle concerning eyewitness identifications may become so generally accepted that, rather than have expert testimony on the point, a standard jury instruction stating that principle would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. at 845. See <em>Hyatt, supra </em>(\u201cWe recognize that, based on a trial record or on the published results of studies, or both, some new principle concerning the process of eyewitness identification may become sufficiently reliable so as to justify formulating a jury instruction that should be given in particular circumstances on request, in addition to those instructions that we identified in <em>[Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass, at 310-311,] and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 619-620 [1983]\u201d). The defendant here did not provide the judge with any expert testimony, scholarly articles, or treatises that would reasonably have enabled the judge to determine whether the principles in the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction were \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it would be appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>priate to instruct the jury regarding them.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where the defendant failed to furnish such information, and where there was an instruction approved by this court that was not erroneous but, at worst, inadequate and incomplete, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the proffered instruction and charging the jury in accordance with the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction. See <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass, at 595 n.4, 598, 600 (no error in judge\u2019s refusal to give jury instruction that \u201cthere is no proven relationship between a witnesses] confidence in his identification and the accuracy of the witnesses] identification\u201d where defendant did not call expert witness and \u201cthere was no hearing or testimony regarding the reliability of these scientific studies or their general acceptance in scientific community\u201d); <em>Hyatt, </em>419 Mass, at 818 (\u201cThe defendant points to no relevant empirical study that assessed the relative reliability of cross-racial and non-cross-racial identifications in confrontations of the sort involved here\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Although we conclude that the judge in this case did not abuse his discretion, and therefore affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions of mayhem and of breaking and entering a vehicle in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, we take this opportunity to revisit our jurisprudence regarding eyewitness identification jury instructions in general and the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction in particular. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 604 n.16 (2011), we recognized that \u201ceyewitness identification is the greatest source of wrongful convictions but also an invaluable law enforcement tool in obtaining accurate convictions,\u201d and declared our intention to convene the Study Group to consider, among other matters, \u201cwhether existing model jury instructions provide adequate guidance to juries in evaluating eyewitness testimony.\u201d We noted that our creation of the Study Group reflected \u201cour willingness to revisit our jurisprudence\u201d regarding eyewitness identification evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 606. With the Study Group Report completed and the comments to that report received, it is now time to do what we declared we were willing to do with respect to eyewitness iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>tification jury instructions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">2. <em>Model jury instruction. </em>The <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction derives from the model set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Telfaire, </em>469 F.2d 552, 555 (D.C. Cir. 1972), which recognized the \u201cspecial problems\u201d with the reliability of eyewitness identifications and the need for an identification instruction that \u201cemphasizes to the jury the need for finding that the circumstances of the identification are convincing beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. at 302. We adopted the <em>Telfaire </em>model \u201cto assist a jury in evaluating the reliability of a positive identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime by a witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass. 895, 910 (2013). Over time, we have modified and supplemented it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 640 (1993) (removing language that risked suggesting that witness\u2019s first sighting of offender was always accurate); <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass, at 845 (omitting language emphasizing \u201cstrength of the identification\u201d). See also <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass, at 620 (establishing supplemental instruction on \u201cpossibility of an honest but mistaken identification\u201d); <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass, at 912 (judge should provide, on request, identification instruction where eyewitness gave partial identification). At its core, though, the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction delineates factors for the jury to consider when evaluating an eyewitness identification, such as (1) the opportunity the witness had to observe the offender; (2) the length of time between the crime and the identification; (3) the witness\u2019s prior familiarity with the offender; (4) the circumstances surrounding any identification procedure; (5) whether the identification procedure was a lineup or photographic array rather than a single-person showup; (7) whether the witness failed to make an identification or made an inconsistent identification before identifying the defendant; and (8) the credibility of the witness.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It focuses the jury on factors they \u201cshould consider\u201d that may affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the accuracy of an eyewitness\u2019s positive identification of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>defendant, and poses questions the jury should ask themselves. It generally does not instruct the jury as to <em>how </em>those factors may affect the accuracy of the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The New Jersey model instruction, as earlier noted, goes well beyond the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction by telling the jury what principles have emerged from the research regarding eyewitness identification. We now consider, first, what it means for a principle of eyewitness identification to be \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it is appropriate to include in a model instruction, and, second, whether the five principles at issue in this case are \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it is appropriate that they now be included in a revised model jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">a. <em>\u201cSo generally accepted.\u201d </em>The phrase \u201cso generally accepted\u201d sounds like the test in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923), for the admissibility of expert testimony based on scientific knowledge, which asks \u201cwhether the community of scientists involved generally accepts the theory or process,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 24 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curnin, </em>409 Mass. 218, 222 (1991), and which was once the exclusive test governing the admissibility of expert testimony. See <em>Lanigan, supra </em>at 25-26 (adopting standard in <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 [1993], while maintaining <em>Frye </em>standard as alternative means to establish reliability of expert testimony). But satisfaction of the <em>Frye </em>test meant only that expert testimony would be admissible in evidence. It did not mean that the jury were required to accept the scientific principles that had gained general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>450 Mass. 1, 12 n.7 (2007) (model instruction on expert testimony, stating, \u201cit is completely up to [the jury] to decide whether [they] accept the testimony of an expert witness, including the opinions that the witness gave\u201d). In contrast, where a principle is included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>in a jury instruction, it becomes part of a judge\u2019s instructions of law, which the jury generally must accept. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>441 Mass. 1, 7 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997) (\u201cWe presume that a jury follow all instructions given to [them] .. .\u201d). Therefore, the <em>Frye </em>test cannot define \u201cso generally accepted\u201d in this context; the standard for including a principle of eyewitness identification in a model jury instruction must be higher than a standard that would simply permit a judge to admit expert testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">To determine when a principle of eyewitness identification is \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it is appropriate to incorporate into a model instruction, we focus on the instruction\u2019s underlying purpose and the concerns it is intended to alleviate. The accuracy of an eyewitness identification is often the critical issue in a criminal case, the difference between a conviction and an acquittal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cabagbag, </em>127 Haw. 302, 313 (2012) (\u201cWithout appropriate instructions from the court, the jury may be left without sufficient guidance on how to assess critical testimony, sometimes the only testimony, that ties a defendant to an offense\u201d). We have long recognized that the mistaken eyewitness identification of a defendant whom the witness had never seen before the crime \u201cis the primary cause of erroneous convictions, outstripping all other causes combined.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(2006) (Cordy, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass, at 909; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>465 Mass. 834, 848-849 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>390 Mass. 89, 100 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Our jury instructions are intended to provide the jury with the guidance they need to capably evaluate the accuracy of an eyewitness identification. See <em>Francis, </em>390 Mass. at 101 (\u201cWe permit, indeed require, the judge to instruct the jury concerning factors that bear on the reliability of eyewitness identification\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 742 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>378 Mass. 296 (1979). If we were to define \u201cso generally accepted\u201d so narrowly that none of the scientific principles regarding eyewitness identification could survive the test, we would continue to use the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction, which generally identifies factors a jury may consider in applying their common sense, and would require the results of the relevant research to be communicated to the jury solely through expert testimony, where such testimony is offered. The problem with this approach is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the research makes clear that common sense is not enough to accurately discern the reliable eyewitness identification from the unreliable, because many of the results of the research are not commonly known, and some are counterintuitive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Guilbert, </em>306 Conn. 218, 234-235 (2012) (there is \u201cnear perfect scientific consensus\u201d that \u201ceyewitness identifications are potentially unreliable in a variety of ways unknown to the average juror\u201d); <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 274 (juror surveys and mock-jury studies \u201creveal generally that people do not intuitively understand all of the relevant scientific findings\u201d). See also <em>Perry </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>132 S. Ct. 716, 739 (2012) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (\u201cStudy after study demonstrates that eyewitness recollections are highly susceptible to distortion by postevent information or social cues; that jurors routinely overestimate the accuracy of eyewitness identifications; that jurors place the greatest weight on eyewitness confidence in assessing identifications even though confidence is a poor gouge of accuracy; and that suggestiveness can stem from sources beyond police-orchestrated procedures\u201d [footnotes omitted]).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If the research regarding eyewitness identification could be communicated to the jury only through expert testimony, very few juries would hear it, because expert testimony is not often proffered in cases where eyewitness identification is at issue, and because the admission of expert testimony is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 257 (2009) (\u201c[Ejxpert testimony concerning the reliability of eyewitness identification is not admissible as of right, but is left to the discretion of the trial judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Having balanced the importance of instructing juries about the generally accepted principles that can inform their understanding of eyewitness identification with the risks of requiring them to accept principles that may still be suspect or in flux, we conclude that a principle is \u201cso generally accepted\u201d that it is appropriate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>include in a model eyewitness identification instruction where there is a near consensus in the relevant scientific community adopting that principle. After reviewing the scholarly research, analyses by other courts, amici submissions, and the Study Group Report and comments, we conclude that there are various principles regarding eyewitness identification for which there is a near consensus in the relevant scientific community and that it is appropriate to revise the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction to include them. See Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 17 (\u201cThe scientific studies have produced a consensus among experts about the . . . variables that have been shown to affect the reliability of eyewitness identification\u201d). See also <em>Guilbert, </em>306 Conn, at 234-236; <em>Cabagbag, </em>127 Haw. at 310-311; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. 724, 740 (2012); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clopten, </em>223 R3d 1103, 1108 (Utah 2009); Report of the Special Master, State vs. Henderson, N.J.

New Jersey has done so most comprehensively, promulgating a ten-page model instruction after concluding that its previous model, which was similar to the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction, see <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 226-227, \u201coverstate^] the jury\u2019s inherent ability to evaluate evidence offered by eyewitnesses who honestly believe their testimony is accurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 298-299.

Memory is, rather[,] a constructive, dynamic and selective process.\u201d Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 15, quoting Special Master\u2019s Report, <em>supra </em>at 9. See E.F. Loftus, J.M.

Rather, memories are made through a three-stage process: \u201cacquisition \u2014 \u2018the perception of the original event\u2019; retention [or storage] \u2014 \u2018the period of time that passes between the event and the eventual recollection of a particular piece of information\u2019; and retrieval \u2014 the \u2018stage during which a person recalls stored information.\u2019 \u201d Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 16, quoting <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">ii. <em>An eyewitness\u2019s expressed certainty in an identification, standing alone, may not indicate the accuracy of the identification, especially where the witness did not describe that level of certainty when the witness first made the identification. </em>We have long questioned the reliability of a witness\u2019s certainty as a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>flection of accuracy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 110 n.9 (1996); <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass. at 846 (\u201c[T]here is significant doubt about whether there is any correlation between a witness\u2019s confidence in her identification and the accuracy of her recollection\u201d); <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass, at 597-600 (court stated it was prepared to consider in future whether weak confidence-accuracy relationship warrants instruction).

See Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 19.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This does not mean that eyewitness certainty is never correlated with accuracy; it means simply that the existence and strength of the correlation depends on the circumstances. After viewing the crime but <em>before </em>the identification procedure, an eyewitness\u2019s expressed level of certainty does not correlate with accuracy. See Study Group Report, <em>supra-, Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 254 n.7.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Where an eyewitness makes a positive identification and expresses a level of certainty <em>immediately after </em>the identification procedure, there is some correlation between certainty and accuracy, but there is not yet a near consensus regarding the strength of that correlation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is, however, a near consensus in the research that, where an eyewitness during an identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>procedure did not express certainty when first asked to make an identification, a subsequent claim of certainty by that witness deserves little weight in evaluating the accuracy of that identification. See <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 254 (\u201cConfirmatory feedback can distort memory. As a result, to the extent confidence may be relevant in certain circumstances, it must be recorded in the witness\u2019[s] own words before any possible feedback\u201d); <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 745 (\u201cRetrospective self-reports of certainty are highly susceptible to suggestive procedures and confirming feedback, a factor that further limits the utility of the certainty variable\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Although the research regarding the correlation (or lack of correlation) between eyewitness certainty and accuracy is complex and still evolving, it is necessary to inform a jury about this tenuous relationship because there is a near consensus that jurors tend to give more weight to a witness\u2019s certainty in evaluating the accuracy of an identification than is warranted by the research. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>470 Mass. 255, 264 n.14 (2014), quoting Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 20 (\u201cStudies show that eyewitness confidence is the single most influential factor in juror determinations regarding the accuracy of an eyewitness identification\u201d); <em>Cabagbag, </em>127 Haw. at 311; <em>Clopten, </em>223 P.3d at 1108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(\u201cIndeed, juries seemed to be swayed the most by the confidence of an eyewitness, even though such confidence correlates only weakly with accuracy\u201d).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Therefore, it is necessary to inform the jury that an eyewitness\u2019s expressed certainty in an identification, standing alone, may not indicate the accuracy of an identification, and that this is especially true where the witness did not describe that level of certainty when the witness first made an identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">iii. <em>High levels of stress can reduce an eyewitness\u2019s ability to make an accurate identification. </em>\u201c[A]n eyewitness under high stress is less likely to make a reliable identification of the perpetrator.\u201d Special Master\u2019s Report, <em>supra </em>at 43. \u201c[Hjigh levels of stress significantly impair a witness\u2019s ability to recognize faces and encode details into memory.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 769 (Appendix).

See B.L. Garrett, Convicting the Innocent: Where Criminal Prosecutions Go Wrong 48-49 (2011) (reviewing trial records for 161 wrongful convictions involving eyewitness misidentification and finding that seventy-eight per cent involved police contamination of identification). This outside information, known as \u201cfeedback,\u201d affects witnesses\u2019 memory differently depending on whether the witness receives feedback before or after making an identification. See Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 21-22; <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 253. \u201cJurors, however, tend to be unaware of . . . how susceptible witness certainty is to manipulation by suggestive procedures or confirming feedback.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 778 (Appendix).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Preidentification feedback may contaminate the witness\u2019s memory. For instance, suggestive wording and leading questions prior to participating in an identification procedure can influence the process of forming a memory. See Study Group Report, <em>supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>at 21; <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 786-788 (Appendix).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Postidenti-fication feedback is information unrelated to the witness\u2019s actual memory that suggests to the witness that he or she correctly identified the suspect. See Study Group Report, <em>supra </em>at 22; <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 255; <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 744. This confirmatory information may boost the witness\u2019s level of certainty without increasing the likelihood of an accurate identification. See <em>Lawson, </em>supra; Special Master\u2019s Report, <em>supra </em>at 33 (\u201cA number of studies have demonstrated that witnesses\u2019 confidence in their identifications, and their memories of events and faces, are readily tainted by information that they receive after the identification procedure\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Although police officers are common potential sources of feedback, feedback from co witnesses and other private actors also can influence a witness\u2019s memory. \u201cWhen a witness is permitted to discuss the event with other witnesses or views another witness\u2019s identification decision, the witness may alter his or her own memory or identification decision to conform to that of the co witness.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>352 Or. at 788 (Appendix).

We have made the jury instruction provisional to allow for public comment and possible future revision before we declare it a model, but it should be given, where appropriate, in trials that commence after issuance of this opinion until a model instruction is issued. We intend the new instruction to have no retroactive application. See <em>Santoli, </em>424 Mass, at 845 (declining retroactively to apply new rule to omit \u201cstrength of the identification\u201d language). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ashley, 427 </em>Mass. 620, 628 (1998) (declining retroactively to apply <em>Santoli); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>426 Mass. 692, 698 (1998) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Our provisional instruction updates the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction with principles relevant to the evaluation of eyewitness testimony for which there is at least a near consensus in the relevant scientific community. It will provide juries with more comprehensive guidance to evaluate and weigh eyewitness identifica-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tians, but we recognize that not every principle regarding eyewitness identification that has attained a near consensus in the relevant scientific community is included; nor are the included principles set forth in great detail. We aspired in drafting the instruction for clarity, brevity, and balance, recognizing that an eyewitness identification instruction is only one of many instructions in a jury charge. We also understand that the longer the jury instruction, the greater the risk that it will implicitly communicate the message that all eyewitness identifications should be viewed as unreliable rather than simply evaluated with caution and care, so we have balanced this risk with the need to educate jurors.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> See National Academies, <em>supra </em>at 29 (noting concern that \u201cjury instructions cause jurors to become more suspicious of all eyewitness identification evidence\u201d). The provisional instruction is longer than the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction, but it will be the rare case where the entirety of the instruction need be given, because a judge need only give the portions of the provisional instruction that are relevant to the eyewitness identification evidence involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We expect that the new model instruction will provide at least one source of reliable information in cases where expert testimony is not offered. Jury instructions offer certain advantages over expert testimony: \u201cthey are focused and concise, authoritative (in that juries hear them from the trial judge, not a witness called by one side), and cost-free; they avoid possible confusion to jurors created by dueling experts; and they eliminate the risk of an expert invading the jury\u2019s role or opining on an eyewitness\u2019[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>credibility.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>208 N.J. at 298. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>689 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2012). But see <em>Clopten, </em>223 P.3d at 1110 (research \u201chas shown that a cautionary instruction does little to help a jury spot a mistaken identification\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Nevertheless, our provisional instruction is not intended in any way to preclude expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification or to discourage judges from exercising their discretion to permit such expert testimony. Cf. <em>Clopten, supra </em>at 1107 (\u201cIt was never the intent of this court to establish cautionary instructions as the sole means for educating juries about eyewitness fallibility\u201d). Expert testimony may be important to elaborate on the generally accepted principles in a model instruction and to explain how other variables relevant to the particular case can affect the accuracy of the identification. A judge also may allow an expert to challenge the generally accepted principles we incorporated, and, where the judge finds the expert\u2019s challenge to be persuasive, the judge may modify the model instruction accordingly. See part 2.a, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>In the circumstances of this case, based on the record before him, the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to give the New Jersey model jury instruction regarding eyewitness identification and instead giving the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction. Therefore, we affirm the defendant\u2019s judgments of conviction of mayhem and breaking and entering a motor vehicle in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony. We remand the case to the Superior Court to vacate the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon as duplicative of the mayhem conviction. Because the sentence to be vacated was less than the sentence of mayhem, and was ordered to be served concurrent with that sentence, we do not order resentencing of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Appendix.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">One of the most important issues in this case is whether the defendant is the person who committed [or participated in the commission of] the crime[s]. The Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant was in fact the perpetrator of the crime[s] alleged in the indictments].</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The identification of the defendant as the person who committed [or participated in the commission of] the crime[s] may be proved by direct evidence or circumstantial evidence, or by some combination of direct and circumstantial evidence, but it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is the person who committed [or participated in the commission of] the crime[s], you must find the defendant not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In evaluating eyewitness identification testimony, it is not essential that a witness be free from doubt as to the correctness of his or her identification of the defendant. However, you, the jury, must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, based on all of the credible evidence, that this defendant is the person who committed [or participated in the commission of] the crimefs] before you may convict him/her.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">As with any witness, you must determine the credibility of a witness identifying the defendant as the offender. If you conclude that the witness is not telling the truth regarding the person\u2019s identification, you shall disregard that testimony. If you conclude that the witness intended to tell the truth, you must also consider the possibility that the witness made a good faith error in identification. That is, you should consider whether the witness could be honestly mistaken in his or her identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Human beings have the ability to recognize other people from past experiences and to identify them at a later time, but research has shown that people sometimes make mistakes in identification. That research has focused on the factors that may affect the accuracy of an identification, including the nature of human memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Research has shown that human memory is not like a video recording that a witness need only replay to remember what happened.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ***&amp;Memory is far more complex. The process of remembering consists of three stages: first, a person sees or otherwise acquires information about the original event; second, the person stores in the brain the information about the event for a period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>until, third, the person attempts to recall that stored information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At each of these stages, memory can be affected by a variety of factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Relying on some of the research that has been done in this area, I am going to list some specific factors you should consider in determining whether the identification testimony is accurate. By instructing you on the factors to consider, I am not expressing any opinion about the accuracy of any specific memory of any particular witness. You, the jury, must decide whether the witness\u2019s identification is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">(1) <em>The witness\u2019s opportunity to view the event. </em>You should consider the opportunity the witness had to observe the offender at the time of the offense, how good a look the witness had of the offender, the degree of attention the witness was paying to the offender at that time, the distance between the witness and the offender, how good the lighting conditions were, and the length of time the witness had to observe the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">ADD ONLY IF RELEVANT TO THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">[IF DISGUISE WAS INVOLVED OR FACE WAS OBSCURED] whether the offender was disguised or had his/her features obscured in some way;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>[IF PERPETRATOR HAD DISTINCTIVE FACE OR FEATURE] whether the perpetrator had a distinctive face or feature;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">[IF A WEAPON WAS INVOLVED] and whether the witness saw a weapon during the event \u2014 the visible presence of a weapon may reduce the reliability of an identification if the crime is of short duration, but the longer the event, the more time the witness has to adapt to the presence of the weapon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">(2) <em>Characteristics of the witness. </em>You should also consider characteristics of the witness when the observation was made, such as the quality of the witness\u2019s eyesight, whether the witness knew the offender, and, if so, how well,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and whether the witness was under a high degree of stress \u2014 high levels of stress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>compared to low to medium levels, can reduce an eyewitness\u2019s ability to accurately perceive an event;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">ADD ONLY IF RELEVANT TO THE EVIDENCE IN THE CASE;</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">[IF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL WERE INVOLVED] whether the witness at the time of the observation was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and if so, to what degree;</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">[IF WITNESS AND OFFENDER ARE OF DIFFERENT RACES] and whether the witness and the offender are of different races \u25a0\u2014 research has shown that people of all races may have greater difficulty in accurately identifying members of a different race than they do in identifying members of their own race.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>(3) <em>The time elapsed. </em>You should consider how much time elapsed between the event observed and the identification.
