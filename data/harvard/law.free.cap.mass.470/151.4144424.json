L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (1), in connection with his removal of two lengths of steel pipe from a construction site located on private property in Pittsfield. He was convicted of that charge following a jury-waived trial in the District Court. The conviction was affirmed by the Appeals Court in a divided opinion, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Liebenow, 84 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 398 (2013), and we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">The defendant claimed as an affirmative defense at trial that he lacked the requisite specific intent to steal because he honestly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>albeit mistakenly, believed that the property he removed from the site was abandoned. The judge, however, erroneously viewed the affirmative defense as requiring proof that the defendant\u2019s belief was objectively reasonable. This misperception appears to have arisen from the conflation of two distinct concepts that have appeared over time in our jurisprudence: the concept of good faith belief, which is subjective, and the concept of reasonable belief, which is objective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We take this opportunity to resolve the resulting confusion. As the dissent in the Appeals Court correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201c[Wjith respect to specific intent crimes such as larceny, . . . [t]he question for the fact finder is not whether the defendant has behaved reasonably but instead whether he actually possessed the requisite mental state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201c[Wjhere a defendant puts at issue his belief that the property he took had been abandoned, ... the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant \u2018knew that he had no right to the property taken,\u2019. . . not merely that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have known\u201d (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebenow, supra </em>at 405, 409 (Milkey, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Here, the defendant adequately raised the defense of honest belief that the items he took were abandoned, and it was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s subjective belief was not honestly held but, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>stead, was a pretense or sham. Therefore, the conviction must be vacated and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence that the judge, as fact finder, could have found to support the charge of larceny. We then summarize the evidence introduced by the defendant, in the light most favorable to him, that a fact finder could have found to conclude that the defendant honestly believed that the property was abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">a. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. </em>On the morning of July 27,2010, the defendant was driving around Pittsfield in his sport utility vehicle (SUV), in search of junk metal that he could sell. He drove onto Amy Court, a privately owned cul-de-sac, which was the site of a proposed twenty-six-unit condominium complex then in the process of being constructed. Several signs stating \u201cno trespassing\u201d and \u201cprivate property\u201d had been posted, construction had been completed on only one unit, and the construction site contained company trucks, construction equipment, and a \u201cjob\u201d trailer. Constmction company workers had stacked leftover lengths of steel pipe and steel plates, intended for use on other projects, in an area at the bottom of the cul-de-sac where there was no construction. The items had been placed behind a pile of top soil to keep them from view, so that the area would appear attractive to prospective purchasers of the lots, and there were no trash receptacles or discarded materials in sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Kenneth Lufkin, an employee of the developer, observed the defendant drive down to the end of the cul-de-sac; because the tailgate of the defendant\u2019s SUV had been removed, Lufkin was able to see that the back of the SUV was empty. The defendant drove behind the pile of top soil and out of Lufkin\u2019s view, but Lufkin could hear what sounded like steel banging.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lufkin stopped the defendant as he was driving from the cul-de-sac toward the public street. When Lufkin asked the defendant what he was doing, the defendant said that he was just picking up some junk steel, and drove away. Lufkin turned around to see what was in the back of the SUV and saw several steel plates and lengths of steel pipe. He wrote down the defendant\u2019s license plate number and then contacted his employer and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Officer James Parise of the Pittsfield police department was dispatched to Amy Court, where he spoke with Lufkin and determined that there had been a larceny of some property from that location. The defendant\u2019s vehicle subsequently was located at a junkyard that purchased scrap metal. Parise went to the junkyard and spoke with the defendant, who admitted that he had taken the items he had in his vehicle, but said that they had not come from Amy Court. The defendant agreed to accompany Parise to Amy Court; Lufkin and the project developer, Amy Kroboth, met them at the construction site. Lufkin identified the material in the back of the defendant\u2019s vehicle as items that had been taken from the Amy Court property, and the defendant returned the items. Kroboth thereafter requested that the defendant be charged with larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding; his motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">b. <em>Evidence viewed favorably to defendant. </em>The defendant testified that he believed the construction debris and other items he had collected had been abandoned and did not belong to anyone. The defendant knew that people dumped trash at the end of Amy Court. During the mid-morning hours of July 27, the defendant drove his vehicle to the end of the Amy Court cul-de-sac in search of discarded metal items that had been left or dumped on a dirt trail leading into the woods that began at the end of the paved cul-de-sac. This was one of several places to which he drove that morning in search of junk metal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was unaware of the no trespassing signs, and did not know that Amy Court was then a private road that, according to Kroboth, had not yet \u201cbeen accepted by the city\u201d as a public street. The defendant made no effort to conceal what he was doing. He had driven to that location previously to collect junk metal, and he conducted his search for scrap metal during daylight hours. The defendant drove from the paved road onto a dirt trail leading into the woods, and saw two lengths of steel pipe, which he picked up and placed in his SUV, along with other items.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The defendant was leaving the area when he encountered Lufkin, who had driven down the road to meet him. The defendant stopped his vehicle, and Lufkin accused him of dumping.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the defendant replied that he was \u201cjust picking up junk steel,\u201d Lufkin said he did not have a problem with that, and the defendant drove off. Later, when he was met by Parise at the junkyard, the defendant admitted taking the steel pipes, and said he believed they had been abandoned. He also testified, as he had told Parise, that there were steel plates in his vehicle that did not come from Amy Court. At Parise\u2019s request, the defendant voluntarily returned to Amy Court. There, he met with Parise, Lufkin, and Kroboth. The defendant returned the two lengths of steel pipe Lufkin identified as belonging to the developer of Amy Court; he was not asked to return the steel plates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">c. <em>Closing arguments. </em>In closing, defense counsel directed the judge\u2019s attention to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. White, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 483 (1977), and argued that the case \u201cstands for the proposition that the defendant is not guilty of larceny if the defendant had a mistaken but honest belief the defendant was entitled to the property.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Counsel maintained that, because the defendant \u201chonestly thought he was entitled to have\u201d what he believed was abandoned property, and returned it when it was claimed by the owner, the Commonwealth failed \u201cto prove[ ] beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] intended to permanently deprive [the owner] of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The prosecutor argued that, even if the defendant\u2019s belief were an honest one, that belief also had to be objectively reasonable. He pointed to evidence that the construction materials had been hidden behind a pile of top soil, that signs stating the area was private property had been posted on trees in the vicinity of the dirt pile, and that the defendant had admitted to taking the items from that area as support for the prosecutor\u2019s claim that the defendant\u2019s belief was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">d. <em>Decision. </em>The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s argument. In announcing his decision, the judge stated that \u201cthe presence of the no trespassing sign puts [the defendant] on notice that the property was not for [him] to take. [The defendant\u2019s] honest belief at that point would not be relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The offense of larceny is defined in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 (1), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201cWhoever steals, or with intent to defraud obtains by a false pretence, or whoever unlawfully, and with intent to steal or embezzle, converts, or secretes with intent to convert, the property of another as defined in this section, whether such property is or is not in his possession at the time of such conversion or secreting, shall be guilty of larceny . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">To convict a defendant of larceny requires that the Commonwealth prove that a defendant took the personal property of another without the right to do so, and \u201cwith the specific intent to deprive the other of the property permanently.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>401 Mass. 771, 772 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">a. <em>Honest but mistaken belief. A </em>defendant has sufficiently raised the defense of mistaken belief \u201cif any view of the evidence\u201d would support a factual finding that the defendant honestly believed that the items he took were abandoned. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537, 541 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Here, in addition to the defendant\u2019s testimony that he believed that the property he took had been abandoned, there was evidence at trial, viewed favorably to the defendant, from which a fact finder could have inferred that, notwithstanding the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the no trespassing signs, the paved cul-de-sac named Amy Court, as well as the construction site surrounding it, were open to the public to permit inspection of the lots on which townhouses were to be constructed. The evidence also permitted the inference that the defendant\u2019s denials to Parise of having taken anything from \u201cAmy Court\u201d reflected a misunderstanding as to the location the officer meant when he referred to \u201cAmy Court\u201d; there was evidence that the defendant was unaware that the paved cul-de-sac was private property, or that the dirt trail at the end of that cul-de-sac was part of the Amy Court development then under construction. The leftover lengths of steel pipe taken by the defendant were behind a pile of soil, in an area where no construction was then taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">b. <em>Law on offense of larceny. </em>It has been long established that the specific intent to steal is negated by a finding that a defendant held an honest, albeit mistaken, belief that he was entitled to the property he took. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brisbois, </em>281 Mass. 125, 128-129 (1932) (jury correctly instructed that, if defendant \u201chonestly thought\u201d he had legal right to remove wooden building, \u201cthen there was no criminal intent to steal\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffy, </em>126 Mass. 467, 469, 471 (1879) (where defendant charged with statutory forerunner of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30 [1], trial judge erred in excluding evidence \u201ccompetent upon the issue of the defendant\u2019s belief\u2019 that money he took was due him); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray 492, 495 (1857) (court noted as \u201cclearly unexceptional\u201d jury instruction \u201cthat the defendant was not guilty of larceny, if she took the money under an honest belief that she had a legal right to take it\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>Thacher\u2019s Crim. Cas. 157, 163 (Boston Mun. Ct. 1827) (judge instructed, \u201cif [the defendant] honestly thought he had a right to the paper, it excludes the idea of a felonious taking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Twenty-five years before <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White </em>was decided, the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 271 (1952), that an honest, though mistaken, belief that property was abandoned is a defense to larceny.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Noting that stealing government property was a crime of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>intent, the Court held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s honest belief should have been presented to the jury, and reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">\u201c[I]t is not apparent how [the defendant] could have knowingly or intentionally converted property that he did not know could be converted, as would be the case if it was in fact abandoned or if he truly believed it to be abandoned and unwanted property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">\u201cWhether that intent existed, the jury must determine, not only from the act of taking, but from that together with [the] defendant\u2019s testimony [that he believed the spent casings to be abandoned] and all of the surrounding circumstances. . . . [On proper instructions, the jury] might have concluded that the heaps of spent casings . . . presented an appearance of unwanted and abandoned junk, and that lack of any conscious deprivation of property . . . was indicated by [the defendant\u2019s] good character, the openness of the taking, crushing and transporting of the casings, and the candor with which it was all admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">c. <em>Source of reasonable belief language. </em>The decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>appears to have departed from this settled principle when, in summarizing the law, the Appeals Court stated that the jury must acquit a defendant of larceny if they find \u201cthat the defendant honestly <em>and reasonably </em>believed that the money he took from [the victim] represented a debt actually due from [the victim] to the defendant\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The addition of a requirement of a reasonable belief is inconsistent with the <em>White </em>court\u2019s reliance on cases such as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffy, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weld, supra. </em>Indeed, the <em>White </em>court observed that the jury should have been instructed as the defendant had requested,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cbecause it was open to the jury to find on [the defendant\u2019s] testimony that he honestly believed that he was taking his own money from [another] and that if the jury had so found, they could not have found the requisite intent to steal and would have been obliged to acquit the defendant of larceny.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 486. Moreover, in framing the question of honest belief, the court noted that the implications of the cases on which it relied \u201care confirmed by the authoritative writers in the field of criminal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Among those authorities, the <em>White </em>court quoted R.M. Perkins, Criminal Law 271 (2d ed. 1969), for the proposition that, under the then-prevailing view of the law, \u201cno larceny is committed if the taking is open . . . and with a bona-fide belief in the right to collect the debt in that manner.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra. </em>That treatise also states, \u201c[S]o long as the claim [of mistaken belief] is genuine and sincere there is no larceny, even if it is quite ill-grounded.\u201d R.M. Perkins, Criminal Law, <em>supra </em>at 265-266. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The court in <em>White </em>also cited R.A. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7 456, at 90-91 (1957),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 88, at 638, and \u00a7 94, at 693-695 (1972),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for the same principle. As they continue to do to date, these authorities explicitly rejected a requirement that such an honest belief also must be objectively reasonable. See W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 88, at 638 (where person takes property under mistaken belief he owns it, it was abandoned, or he was given permission, \u201che lacks the intent to steal required for larceny, even though his mistaken but honest belief was unreasonable\u201d [footnotes omitted]).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Based on the foregoing, we do not think that the Appeals Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. White, <em>supra </em>at 488, intended to depart from the long-established principle that an honest belief need not be objectively reasonable to negate the specific intent required for larceny, despite its use of the phrase \u201chonestly and reasonably believed.\u201d The discussion of the cases and authorities in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White </em>reflects that court\u2019s understanding of \u201c[t]he rather simple rule that an honest mistake of fact or law is a defense when it negates a required mental element of the crime.\u201d W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 47, at 357. It is of some significance that the <em>White </em>court was not asked to focus specifically on the question whether reasonableness of belief was a concept separate from good faith belief, and reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s belief was neither raised nor discussed. As W.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>also notes, that \u201csimple rule\u201d may be misapplied \u201cbecause of uncritical acceptance of the general statement that the mistake must be reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Evidence of reasonableness may, however, be considered by the jury to assist in their determination whether to credit a defendant\u2019s honest belief.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cNeither juries nor judges are required to divorce themselves of common sense, but rather should apply to facts which they find proven such reasonable inferences as are justified in the light of their experience as to the natural inclinations of human beings.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tejeda, 974 </em>F.2d 210, 213 (1st Cir. 1992), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>BatistaPolanco, </em>927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991). See W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 88, at 638 (\u201cthe openness of the taking, as well as the reasonableness of the belief, though not conclusive, will buttress [a defendant\u2019s] claim of good faith\u201d); R.M. Perkins &amp; R.N. Boyce, Criminal Law 326 (3d ed. 1982) (\u201cA mere pretense advanced in bad faith will not prevent conviction of larceny . . . \u201d). See also <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. at 276 (considering evidence of defendant\u2019s awareness that \u201ccasings were on government property, his failure to seek any permission for their removal and his self-interest as a witness,\u201d jury could disbelieve his profession of innocent intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">d. <em>Ajfirmative defense of honest belief A </em>defendant may raise an honest, yet mistaken, belief as an affirmative defense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. at 540-541. A defendant\u2019s honest belief that the property he took was abandoned constitutes an affirmative defense to larceny. Abandoned property is property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cto which the owner \u2018has relinquished all right, title, claim, and possession, but without vesting it in any other person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel.

App. Ct. 387, 391-394 (2013), the Appeals Court relied on language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 488 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 867, 867-868 (1980), in support of the proposition that, as to the issue of belief, a defendant can be acquitted of larceny only if he honestly and reasonably believed that the money he took was his own. A number of other appellate decisions have cited with approval the reasonable belief language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anslono, supra, </em>in discussing the defense of mistaken belief in connection with the specific intent crimes of larceny and robbery.

Several signs stating \u201cDanger \u2014 Keep Out \u2014 Bombing Range\u201d were placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>range. The defendant loaded the casings into his truck in broad daylight, and testified that he believed the property was abandoned. <em>Id. </em>at 247-248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Low, </em>Thacher\u2019s Crim. Cas. 477 (Boston Mun. Ct. 1837), which is quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 486-487, makes use of the \u201creasonably believed\u201d language, and may have been one source of confusion. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Low, supra </em>at 480, 485, the jury were instructed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">\u201cThe question of [the defendant\u2019s] intention is for the jury in all cases, and it is to be inferred from all the circumstances of the case .... If the defendant has satisfied you, or you believe from all the evidence in the case, that [the defendant] acted with good faith on his part, that he <em>reasonably believed </em>that he had a good cause of action . . . , and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>might lawfully use this trustee process in this manner, to obtain security for his demand, that will negative the felonious intent, and will authorize you to give a verdict of acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In that case, the defendant, who was indebted to the victim, gave the victim notes as collateral security for the amount due plus interest. The Commonwealth alleged that, as part of a fraudulent scheme, the defendant obtained a writ of trustee process that was to be served on his codefendant as soon as the codefendant was able to obtain the notes from the victim, who was bringing them in anticipation of payment. The judge further instructed, \u201cA felonious taking supposes not only a trespass, but a fraudulent and wicked mind in the trespasser, acting against his own conviction of right, and the plain dictates of common honesty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 479, and that the jury could consider whether the defendant had a reasonable belief that he could take out the writ and obtain the notes in the way that he did. If the jury believed that the defendant had a \u201cfraudulent plan\u201d to transfer the notes from the victim\u2019s possession to his own, and that the defendant was \u201caware at the time that he committed a wrongful act, [the jury would] have the right to infer ... that the defendant had a preconcerted design to get the notes into his possession, with the intent to steal them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The defendant had requested an instruction that, \u201c[i]f the defendant believed that the money he had acquired from [the victim] was actually his money, [the] defendant is not guilty of a charge of larceny.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, supra </em>at 485.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> \u201cA defendant does not commit larceny if he takes property of another under the honest belief that it is his property----The defendant is not guilty of larceny if he has acted under a bona fide belief that a person giving him the permission to take the property had authority to do so, or that one whom he assists in the taking has a right thereto\u201d (footnotes omitted). R.A. Anderson, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law &amp; Procedure \u00a7 456, at 90-91 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u201c0ne may take the property of another honestly but mistakenly believing (1) that it is his own property, or (2) that it is no one\u2019s property, or (3) (though he knows it is another\u2019s property) that the owner has given him permission to take it as he did.\u201d W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 88, at 638 (1972). See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 94, at 693-695.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Since 1977, commentators have continued to state that the specific intent required to be found guilty of larceny may be negated where a defendant holds a mistaken but honest belief that the property he is charged with stealing was his to take. See 3 W.R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 19.5(a), at 88 (2d ed. 2003); R.M. Perkins &amp; R.N. Boyce, Criminal Law 326 (3d ed. 1982). See also Model Penal Code \u00a7 223.1(3)(a)-(b) (1980) (\u201cIt is an affirmative defense to prosecution for theft that the actor: [a] was unaware that the property or service was that of another; or [b] acted under an honest claim of right. . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">We note that the current version of Instruction 8.520, Supplemental Instruction 7, of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009) includes the same incorrect language on \u201creasonable belief\u2019:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cClaim of right. If the defendant took another person\u2019s property in an honest and reasonable belief that (he) (she) (another person on whose behalf he [she] was acting) had a legal right to it, then you must find the defendant not guilty, even if that belief was in fact mistaken, because he [she] lacked the intent to steal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Although we use the term affirmative defense, in this context the Commonwealth nonetheless bears the burden of proof because the defense addresses an element of the offense of larceny, the defendant\u2019s specific intent to steal. Once a defendant meets the burden of production, the burden of proof shifts to the Commonwealth to disprove the defense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537, 541 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
