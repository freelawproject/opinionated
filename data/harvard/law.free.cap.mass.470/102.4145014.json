His victims came forward many years after the fact, and in October, 2003, when Doe was thirty-one years old, he pleaded guilty to a number of sex offenses committed when he was a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">In March, 2006, a hearing examiner of the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) determined that Doe posed a moderate risk of reoffense and a moderate degree of dangerousness, and classified Doe as a level two sex offender. A Superior Court judge, determining that this classification was not supported by substantial evidence, remanded for further proceedings. In May, 2010, a successor hearing examiner (successor examiner) concluded that Doe poses a low risk of reoffense and a low degree of dangerousness. Doe was therefore classified as a level one sex offender, a classification that was upheld by a different judge of the Superior Court. Doe appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Doe contends that he should not be required to register as a sex offender. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a)-(d). </em>He argues that, in light of scientific research showing that adolescent brains are different from adult brains, and in light of the long period of time that has elapsed since his last offense, the successor examiner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. Doe contends also that the regulations enacted and applied by SORB are outmoded, in that they predate recent studies concerning adolescent brains and adolescent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>We conclude that, although Doe presented considerable information suggesting that he is no longer dangerous, the successor examiner took this information into account and reached a decision that was supported by substantial evidence in determining that Doe should be classified as a level one sex offender. We therefore conclude that there was no error in the successor examiner\u2019s classification of Doe as a level one sex offender, and affirm the Superior Court judge\u2019s decision upholding the successor examiner\u2019s classification determination. We emphasize, however, as we have done previously, that it is incumbent upon SORB to update its guidelines at reasonable intervals in order to take proper account of current scientific knowledge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>In prior cases, we described in detail the tapestry of statutes and regulations that governs the registration requirement imposed on sex offenders. See, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 205614 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>466 Mass. 594, 595-597 (2013) <em>(Doe No. 205614); Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 151564 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 612, 614-615 (2010) <em>(Doe No. 151564); Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 3844 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 768, 768-772 (2006) <em>(Doe No. 3844). </em>Here we reprise the essential elements of that scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">An individual is a \u201csex offender\u201d if he or she has been convicted of one or more statutorily enumerated offenses. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Sex offenders are classified into levels of dangerousness, increasing in severity from level one to level three. Each level is attended by different implications. Although SORB transmits information about all sex offenders to specific authorities, information about level one offenders is not available to the general public. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(a). </em>Information about level two and level three offenders is entered into a publicly accessible Internet database. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D. See <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>467 Mass. 598, 600-606, 616 (2014) (declaring unconstitutional the retroactive application of this provision to individuals classified as level two sex offenders on or before July 12, 2013). In addition, SORB and local police departments \u201cactively disseminate\u201d information about level three offenders to individuals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>organizations who are likely to encounter those offenders. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">SORB is required to consider a list of statutory factors in making its classification determinations. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a)-(l). </em>This list is not exhaustive, however, and SORB also must take into account any other information that is \u201cuseful in assessing the risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public by the sex offender,\u201d including information of this kind introduced by the offender. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1). See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10216 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 779, 787 (2006) <em>(Doe No. 10216), </em>citing <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750,762 n.9 (2006) <em>(Doe No. 1211); </em>803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.38(2) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">As mandated by statute, SORB has promulgated \u201cguidelines for determining the level of risk of reoffense and the degree of dangerousness posed to the public or for relief from the obligation to register.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1). These guidelines describe the manner in which SORB is to apply twenty-four factors increasing or decreasing risk, which are derived from the factors enumerated in the statute. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40 (2013) (guidelines). The guidelines require SORB to be guided by the \u201cdefinitions, explanations, principles, and authorities\u201d contained in the guidelines. See <em>id. </em>We have read the term \u201cauthorities\u201d to encompass studies conducted by researchers whose work is cited in the guidelines. See <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass. at 604; <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass. at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u201cThe registration and classification process is, essentially, a two stage process.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.38(3) (2013). First, SORB makes an initial \u201crecommendation\u201d concerning an offender\u2019s classification level. <em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1) <em>(a). </em>The offender may then object to SORB\u2019s recommendation, in which case he or she \u201cis provided an individualized hearing ... at which all relevant evidence is evaluated anew by a disinterested Hearing Examiner.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.38(4) (2013). See <em>Doe No. 3844, </em>447 Mass. at 772; G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178L (1), (2). At this hearing, SORB bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the offender has a duty to register, and what the offender\u2019s classification should be. 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.10(1) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">SORB \u201cmay . . . relieve [a] sex offender of any further obligation to register\u201d if the offender establishes that \u201cthe circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>stances of the offense in conjunction with the offender\u2019s criminal history do not indicate a risk of reoffense or a danger to the public.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (2) <em>(d). </em>The decision as to whether this provision should be applied must take into account \u201cfactors, including but not limited to, the presence or absence of any physical harm caused by the offense and whether the offense involved consensual conduct between adults.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We have emphasized that the sex offender registration requirement \u201cimplicates constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interests.\u201d See <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass. at 596, citing <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>426 Mass. 136, 144 (1997). Accordingly, \u201ccareful and individualized due process is necessary to sort sexual predators likely to repeat their crimes from large numbers of offenders who pose no danger to the public.\u201d <em>Doe No. 205614, supra, </em>citing <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 972 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>428 Mass. 90, 105 (1998) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">2. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts found by the successor examiner. These facts were relied upon by the Superior Court judge, and Doe does not dispute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Doe\u2019s cousins, a boy and a girl, emigrated from Ireland to the United States with their family. The cousins\u2019 family was, at first, dependent on Doe\u2019s family. During the years from 1986 through 1988, Doe, then a teenager, engaged in repeated sexual assaults against his male cousin and in one sexual assault against his female cousin. At the end of this period, Doe and the female cousin were sixteen years old. The male cousin was two years younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Doe\u2019s assaults against the male cousin, which began when the cousin was eleven years old, escalated in violence over time, from masturbation to digital and then penile rape. Doe\u2019s assault against his female cousin occurred when they were both sixteen years old. On that occasion, the female cousin was swimming in Doe\u2019s family\u2019s swimming pool, when Doe swam over and raped her digitally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Doe\u2019s cousins first disclosed the sexual assaults in 2000, twelve years after the assaults had ceased. The cousins explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>they had been afraid to complain earlier because of their parents\u2019 dependency on Doe\u2019s family, and because Doe had threatened that he would cause their family to be deported if they complained. Doe initially told police that he had engaged only in consensual acts with his male cousin. In October, 2003, however, he pleaded guilty to five counts of rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A; five counts of rape and abuse of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23; and two counts of rape, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">3. <em>Classification proceedings. </em>On March 1, 2005, SORB notified Doe that it was recommending that he be classified as a level two sex offender. Doe objected to this classification, and his matter was considered de nova by a SORB hearing examiner (original examiner). The original examiner held a hearing and heard testimony from two experts proffered by Doe, Dr. Bernard Katz and Dr. Barbara K. Schwartz. He also received from Doe an expert report of Dr. Joseph J. Plaud. On March 17, 2006, the original examiner ordered, as SORB had recommended, that Doe register as a level two offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Doe sought judicial review in the Superior Court. A Superior Court judge determined that the original examiner\u2019s classification decision was not supported by substantial evidence. He therefore entered judgment on the pleadings in Doe\u2019s favor, and remanded the matter to SORB.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On remand, two additional hearings were conducted by the successor examiner. The successor examiner took additional evidence, including an updated report and oral testimony from Schwartz, one of Doe\u2019s expert witnesses. The successor examiner made new, independent rulings and factual findings. Among other things, he excluded from the record a police report, which the original examiner had considered, describing a complaint against Doe by another woman, unrelated to Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The successor examiner noted that Doe had been \u201ca juvenile\u201d and \u201can adolescent\u201d when he committed his offenses. The examiner accepted the opinion of another of Doe\u2019s experts, Katz, that at the time of the offenses, Doe was \u201can unhappy, overweight and maladjusted teenager.\u201d In his decision, the successor examiner also considered as risk reducing the facts that Doe had not committed his offenses against strangers; had not reoffended since 1988; had enjoyed success in high school, in college, and in his work at a car dealership; was in a romantic relationship with an age-appropriate woman; had not abused alcohol in recent years; and had participated successfully in sex offender treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The successor examiner noted also that the experts proffered by Doe opined that the risk he presented was \u201cextremely low\u201d or none. In view of these facts, the successor examiner determined that Doe \u201chas made substantial progress towards \u2018no risk\u2019 status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">On the other hand, the successor examiner found that Doe\u2019s sex offenses, which included \u201chigh contact\u201d acts that had escalated \u201cover a three-year period,\u201d had been \u201crepetitive and compulsive.\u201d The successor examiner determined that there had been \u201ca disparity between [Doe] and his [v]ictims as regards age, size, strength, economic status, and citizenship\u201d; that Doe had been \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201chostile\u201d; and that Doe had \u201cvictimized his male cousin in an escalating, repetitive and predatory pattern.\u201d In addition, the successor examiner noted that when, as a twenty-eight year old, Doe was confronted by his aunt about his actions, he \u201cwondered . . . how many times he needed to apologize\u201d and then \u201ctold his aunt, T never liked you or your family. You\u2019re weak and you\u2019re stupid. As a matter of fact, that made it all the more enjoyable.\u2019 \u201d The successor examiner concluded that Doe presents \u201ccognizable low risk of reoffense and a low degree of dangerousness,\u201d and ordered Doe to register as a level one sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Doe again sought judicial review. This time, a different Superior Court judge affirmed the classification determination, stating that \u201c[ajlthough ... if considering the matter de nova, [the judge] might place more weight on the factors emphasized by Doe,\u201d the successor examiner\u2019s decision nevertheless was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">4. <em>Standard of review. </em>SORB\u2019s final classification of a sex offender is subject to judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This review is \u201cconfined to the record, except that in cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken in the court.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">A reviewing court will not disturb SORB\u2019s decision unless that decision was (a) in violation of constitutional provisions; (b) in excess of SORB\u2019s authority; (c) based upon an error of law; (d) made upon unlawful procedure; (e) unsupported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>evidence; (f) unwarranted by facts found by the court, where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact; or (g) arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Doe No. </em>151564,456 Mass, at 614-615. The court must \u201cgive due weight to [SORB\u2019s] experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge ... as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). In addition, SORB\u2019s guidelines \u201cmust be accorded all the deference due to a statute.\u201d <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass, at 602, quoting <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, <em>771 </em>(2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">5. <em>Analysis, </em>a. <em>Substantial evidence of Doe\u2019s dangerousness. </em>Doe\u2019s primary argument is that the successor examiner\u2019s decision to classify him as a level one sex offender was not supported by substantial evidence, particularly since \u201cthe offenses he committed occurred while he was a juvenile more than twenty years ago.\u201d In the circumstances, this argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">A decision of a SORB hearing examiner will not be upheld if it is \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(e). </em>See <em>Doe No. 10216, </em>447 Mass. at 787, citing <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>412 Mass. 416, 420 (1992). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). A decision does not satisfy the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement if \u201cthe evidence points to no felt or appreciable probability of the conclusion or points to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u201d <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 390-391 (1999), quoting <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). Any evidence may be considered and relied upon by the examiner \u201cif it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">A classification decision should not be based solely on the fact that an offender\u2019s underlying crime was sexual in nature. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 24341 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 383, 387 (2009), citing <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 8725 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>450 Mass. 780, 787, 790 (2008) <em>(Doe No. 8725). A </em>hearing examiner has discretion, however, to consider which statutory and regulatory factors are applicable and how much weight to ascribe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>each factor, and as stated, a reviewing court is required to \u201cgive due weight to [the examiner\u2019s] experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10800 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>459 Mass. 603, 633 (2011) <em>(Doe No. 10800), </em>citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 803, 812-813 (2006). Accordingly, \u201c[o]ur review does not turn on whether, faced with the same set of facts, we would have drawn the same conclusion as an agency or local board, but only \u2018whether a contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 638 (2005), quoting <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. 42, 43 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">As noted, the successor examiner took account of various factors that tended to alleviate the concern that Doe will reoffend. He considered, among other things, Doe\u2019s age at the time of the offenses; the fact that Doe knew his victims; Doe\u2019s subsequent educational, professional, and personal successes; and his completion of sex offender treatment. The successor examiner also considered, as required by the guidelines, \u201cthe length of time [that Doe] has had access to the community without committing any new offenses,\u201d see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(a), finding that, \u201csince 1988, [Doe] has not reoffended.\u201d Cf. <em>Doe No. 8725, </em>450 Mass. at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Nonetheless, the successor examiner\u2019s ruling was supported by evidence concerning multiple factors that did tend to indicate Doe\u2019s dangerousness. Much of this evidence is set forth above, including the repetitive, protracted, escalating, and \u201chigh contact\u201d nature of Doe\u2019s offenses. These are factors that, according to the guidelines, the successor examiner was required to consider. The guidelines state that offenders who \u201cmanifest their compulsive behavior by engaging in a continuing course of sexual misconduct involving separate incidents . . . present[ ] a greater risk to reoffend and . . . pas[e] an increased degree of dangerousness.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(2). See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(a) </em>(ii). \u201c[T]he level of physical contact between the offender and the victim during the sex offense is another important element to be considered in understanding the nature of the offense and in determining a level of dangerousness.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(7). Finally, \u201cSORB also considers the length or duration of the sex offending behavior as important and useful information in determining dangerousness.\u201d 803 Code Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(8). See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(b) </em>(iii) (mandating consideration of \u201cthe number, date and nature of prior offenses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The successor examiner also noted the following facts as indications, under the guidelines, of an increased risk of reoffense and degree of dangerousness: that Doe offended against both a male victim and a female victim, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(2), (9)(c)(ll); that his victims were children, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(12); that he engaged in a variety of different offending behaviors, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(10); that he has, in the past, had difficulties with substance abuse, see 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(16) and G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (g); and that, as evidenced by his remarks to his aunt twelve years after the offenses, Doe\u2019s acceptance of responsibility has been less than complete. See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(9)(c)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In sum, in the context of the record as a whole, the successor examiner\u2019s ruling was based on evidence that \u201ca reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d that Doe poses a low risk of reoffense and a low degree of dangerousness. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). Cf. <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">b. <em>Other issues concerning Doe\u2019s classification. </em>We have noted previously that, in some cases, a SORB hearing examiner \u201cmight greatly benefit from testimony or a report by an appropriately trained and qualified mental health professional.\u201d <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 89230 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>452 Mass. 764, 776 (2008). See <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass. at 623-624. Expert testimony is likely to be particularly valuable where a substantial period of time \u201chas elapsed since the guidelines were last revised,\u201d and where significant, relevant research has been conducted in the intervening period. See <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass. at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In this case, the hearing examiner heard evidence concerning Doe\u2019s degree of dangerousness from three experts. One of these experts, Schwartz, presented an updated report and updated testimony on remand. The successor examiner considered this evidence and, in large part, found it cogent. For instance, he was persuaded by Katz\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe sex offenses were causally related to the fact that during the offending era, [Doe] was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>overweight, teased and maladjusted adolescent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Ultimately, the successor examiner did not adopt the position advocated by Doe\u2019s experts, namely that Doe\u2019s risk of reoffense and his degree of dangerousness were less than \u201clow.\u201d The successor examiner\u2019s decision on this score was not erroneous. SORB is \u201cnot statutorily required to present expert testimony in support of its position before the examiner,\u201d <em>Doe No. 10216, </em>447 Mass, at 786, and \u201c[t]he opinion of a witness testifying on behalf of a sex offender need not be accepted by the hearing examiner even where the board does not present any contrary expert testimony.\u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 637, citing <em>Doe No. 1211, </em>447 Mass. at 764. The successor examiner\u2019s reasons for reaching a conclusion not shared by Doe\u2019s experts were, as described above, supported by the evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We have held also that a SORB classification decision will be deemed \u201c[arbitrary or capricious,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(g), </em>if it fails to take into account reliable evidence that a factor relevant to a given offender affects the likelihood that the offender will recidivate. For instance, <em>Doe No. 151564 </em>involved an offender who was sixty-one years old at the time of the hearing and where \u201c[tjhere was substantial evidence presented at the hearing concerning the effect of age on recidivism.\u201d 456 Mass, at 622. The SORB hearing examiner declined to take this evidence into account, reasoning that \u201cage is not considered as a factor in [the guidelines].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the examiner\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious, noting that the studies submitted by the offender in that case were \u201cwritten by many of the same authorities on whom the board relies in its [guidelines].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>the offender, a woman, presented \u201ccurrent, validated evidence demonstrating the relevance of gender in assessing the risk of reoffense.\u201d 466 Mass. at 607. Two hearing examiners disregarded this evidence, and we held their decisions, too, to be arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Doe argues that the successor examiner in his case also ig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>nored, in essence, a scientifically relevant factor, namely, that Doe was an adolescent when he committed his offenses. Doe cites recent scientific studies that, he asserts, establish that teenagers are more limited than adults in the soundness of their judgment in complex situations, in their capacity to control impulses, and in their ability to plan effectively. These limitations are due, in part, to organic differences between adult brains and adolescent brains.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Although the studies now cited by Doe were referred to briefly, and in general terms, in Schwartz\u2019s April, 2009, report, these studies were not relied upon or offered into evidence before SORB. Because our review is \u201cconfined to the record,\u201d the successor examiner\u2019s failure to address evidence that was not presented to him would not be grounds for disturbing his decision. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (5). See <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass. at 608 n.11, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>449 Mass. 227, 234 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Nonetheless, it would not have been proper for the successor examiner to disregard the fact that Doe was a youth when he offended, because the applicable statute and the guidelines require that this fact be considered. General Laws c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) <em>(e), </em>provides that one of the \u201c[f]actors relevant to the risk of reoffense\u201d is \u201cwhether the sex offender was a juvenile when he committed the offense.\u201d The guidelines, in turn, cite research pointing to \u201cnumerous differences between [juvenile offenders] and their adult counterparts.\u201d 803 Code Mass.' Regs. \u00a7 1.40(14). Accordingly, the guidelines specify whether each of the factors enumerated in them applies in whole, in part, or not at all to a \u201c[jJuvenile [o]ffender,\u201d namely \u201cany sex offender who was younger than [seventeen] years old at the time he [or she] committed all of his or her sex offenses.\u201d 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.39(4) (2013). See, e.g., 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(1) (\u201c[m]entai [abnormality\u201d factor does not apply to juvenile offenders); 1.40(6) (same for maximum term of incarceration); 1.40(9)(c)(6) (same for convictions of nonsexual violent offenses); 1.40(3) (\u201c[c]hild [v]ictim\u201d factor applies differently to adults and to juveniles); 1.40(7) (same for relationship between offender and victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">As noted, the successor examiner took into consideration Doe\u2019s young age at the time of his offenses. Implicitly, he did so by applying only those factors that, according to the guidelines, appropriately are considered with regard to juvenile offenders. The successor examiner also specifically applied the factor concerning an offender\u2019s relationship with his victims in the manner that the guidelines deem appropriate for juvenile offenders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>See 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(7). More explicitly, the successor examiner made repeated references to the fact that Doe was an \u201cadolescent\u201d and a \u201cjuvenile\u201d at the time of his offenses, and rested one of his evidentiary rulings on his \u201cappreciation of the fact that [Doe] was a juvenile at the time he committed the sex offenses.\u201d We do not conclude, therefore, that the successor examiner failed to take into account the mandatory consideration that Doe committed his offenses at a young age.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">c. <em>Validity of the guidelines. </em>Doe asserts that the factors and presumptions incorporated in the guidelines are \u201cout of date,\u201d in that they were developed prior to recent studies concerning the differences between adolescents and adults.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In none of the proceedings below did Doe argue that these scientific developments render the guidelines invalid. Nor would such a request have been proper at the current juncture. A challenge to the validity of a general regulation \u201ccannot be resolved by requesting declaratory relief in an appeal from an administrative agency decision because judicial review is confined to the administrative record.\u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 630, citing G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (5). See <em>Doe No. </em>205614,466 Mass, at 608 n.11. We nevertheless make the following observations concerning the effect of the passage of time on the guidelines\u2019 validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As noted, the guidelines \u201cmust be accorded all the deference due to a statute\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Doe No. 205614, </em>466 Mass. at 602. \u201cA party challenging the validity of a regulation must prove in a judicial proceeding \u2018that the regulation is illegal, arbitrary, or capricious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 629, quoting <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 722, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). We have cautioned that \u201cguidelines that fail to heed growing scientific consensus in an area may undercut the individualized nature of the hearing to which a sex offender is entitled, an important due process right.\u201d <em>Doe No. 205614, supra </em>at 608, citing <em>Doe No. 10800, supra </em>at 626. See <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass. at 623 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has described \u201cthree significant gaps between juveniles and adults,\u201d namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">\u201cFirst, children have a \u2018 \u201clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\u201d \u2019 leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. . . . Second, children \u2018are more vulnerable ... to negative influences and outside pressures,\u2019 including from their family and peers; they have limited \u2018contra[l] over their own environment\u2019 and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. . . . And third, a child\u2019s character is not as \u2018well formed\u2019 as an adult\u2019s; his traits are \u2018less fixed\u2019 and his actions less likely to be \u2018evidence of irretrievable] deprav[ity].\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455, 2464 (2012), quoting <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 569, 570 (2005). The Court explained that its view of juvenile behavior rests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201cnot only on common sense \u2014 on what \u2018any parent knows\u2019 \u2014 but on science and social science as well.... In <em>Roper, </em>we cited studies showing that \u2018 \u201c[o]nly a relatively small proportion of adolescents\u201d \u2019 who engage in illegal activity \u2018 \u201cdevelop entrenched patterns of problem behavior.\u201d \u2019... And in <em>Graham </em>[v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 68 (2010)], we noted that \u2018developments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds\u2019 \u2014 for example, in \u2018parts of the brain involved in behavior control.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\"><em>Miller, supra, </em>quoting <em>Roper, supra </em>at 569, 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The guidelines do not ignore the importance of the distinctions, discussed in <em>Miller, </em>between adult and juvenile offenders. Rather, as explained, the guidelines delineate in some detail the different ways in which they are to be applied to adults and to juveniles. See, e.g., G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K (1) (e); 803 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.40(1), (3), (6), (7), (9)(c)(6), (14).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">A question nevertheless remains, which cannot be answered on the record before us, whether the manner in which the guidelines differentiate between adults and juveniles is sound in view of current scientific research. \u201cSORB need not update its guidelines every time a new study is published,\u201d <em>Doe No. </em>205614,466 Mass. at 605, but \u201c[w]here, as here, scientific knowledge in a field is rapidly evolving, ... the applicable standards may require more frequent modification in order to reflect accurately the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>state of knowledge\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>456 Mass, at 623 n.6, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 27 (1994). Given that the most recent studies cited in the guidelines were published in 2001, there is reason for some concern as to whether the guidelines continue to reflect accurately the current state of scientific knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"><em>We </em>acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Youth Advocacy Division of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the Children\u2019s Law Center of Massachusetts, and Citizens for Juvenile Justice; and by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts and Citizens for Juvenile Justice in support of John Doe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>evidence of a sexual assault by Doe on another female victim was excluded by the successor hearing examiner in the more recent Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB) proceedings.
