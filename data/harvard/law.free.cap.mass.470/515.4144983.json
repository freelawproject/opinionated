At that time, Bay Colony operated several rail lines in southeastern Massachusetts, including rail lines between the town and Rochester, pursuant to a lease agreement with the Commonwealth. However, in the fall of 2007, the Commonwealth notified Bay Colony that, effective December 31, 2007, it would terminate Bay Colony\u2019s lease of the Cape Cod rail lines, which meant that Bay Colony would no longer be able to transport the town\u2019s waste to the facility by rail. Section 9 of the contract provided that, in the event the Commonwealth terminated Bay Colony\u2019s lease of the rail line, the town agreed to permit Bay Colony either to assign the contract to the railroad company that was awarded the lease of the rail line or to continue to transport the waste \u201cpursuant to the terms of the [contract] either under an arrangement with a successor operator or by other modes of transportation.\u201d Bay Colony notified the town by letter that, in accordance with the provisions of section 9, it intended to continue to transport waste under the contract \u201cby other modes of transportation,\u201d specifically, by truck rather than rail. The town, however, replied by letter that it intended to assign the contract to the railroad operating company that was awarded the relevant rail lease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In or about April 2008, the town began transporting its waste from the transfer station to the facility with that railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Bay Colony filed suit, contending, among other claims, that the town had committed a breach of the contract by terminating Bay Colony as the waste transporter. A Superior Court judge granted Bay Colony\u2019s motion for summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim, and declared that the contract granted Bay Colony \u201cthe right to assign its interest or fulfill the agreement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>alternate means of transportation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After trial, a Superior Court jury found that the town had committed a breach of the contract, and awarded damages of $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">On appeal, the town claims, first, that G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 70A, prohibited Bay Colony from transporting the town\u2019s waste by truck after it lost its rail lease, and the judge erred as a matter of law in concluding that \u00a7 70A was preempted by the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act (act); second, that the permit issued to the town by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for the operation of the town\u2019s waste transfer station prohibited the long-term trucking of waste, and the town had no obligation under the contract to seek a modification of the permit to allow its waste to be transported by truck; and third, that the town\u2019s contract with Bay Colony had terminated prior to the alleged breach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We transferred the appeal on our own motion. We reject each of the town\u2019s three claims and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Federal preemption of G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 70A. </em>Enacted in 1925, G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 70A, allows \u201crailroad corporation^] . . . [to] own, maintain and operate motor vehicles not running upon rails or tracks ... for the transportation of . . . freight.\u201d G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 70A, inserted by St. 1925, c. 125, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1932, c. 236. But the statute forbids a railroad corporation from operating trucks for the transportation of freight within the Commonwealth in areas that the railroad corporation does not \u201cserve[ ]\u201d by rail. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cMotor vehicles operated by a railroad corporation directly or through subsidiaries for the transportation of freight within the commonwealth shall be operated only in areas now served by such corporation\u201d). The town contends that Bay Colony could not lawfully perform the contract by truck once it lost its rail line lease because it would then be operating motor vehicles for the transportation of freight in areas where it no longer provides rail service, in violation of \u00a7 70A.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In 1994, however, Congress passed the act \u201cupon finding that [S]tote governance of intrastate transportation of property had become \u2018unreasonably burden[some]\u2019 to \u2018free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dan\u2019s City Used Cars, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Pelkey, </em>133 S.

The act completed the Federal deregulation of the trucking industry that had started with the enactment of the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1980 \u201cby expressly preempting [S]tote trucking regulation.\u201d <em>Dan\u2019s City Used Cars, Inc., supra. </em>The express preemption provision of the act provides, \u201c[A] State . . . may not enact or enforce a law . . . related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property.\u201d Pub.

Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>437 Mass. 241, 246 (2002), quoting <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>407 Mass. 559, 565 (1990). See <em>Altria Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Good, </em>555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008), quoting <em>Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485 (1996) (\u201c \u2018[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every pre-emption case\u201d). Here, Congress expressly stated that State law is preempted, but that \u201cdoes not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope of Congress\u2019[s] displacement of [S]tate law still remains.\u201d <em>Altria Group, Inc., supra. </em>See <em>Medtronic, Inc., supra </em>at 484, quoting <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 504, 517 (1992) (\u201cwe must nonetheless \u2018identify the domain expressly pre-empted\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The preemptive scope of the act\u2019s preemption clause is \u201cpurposefully expansive.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Delivery Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Coakley, </em>769 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir. 2014). The act preempts State laws \u201c <em>\u2018having a connection with, or reference to,\u2019 </em>carrier \u2018rates, routes, or services,\u2019 \u201d even if the \u201claw\u2019s effect on rates, routes, or services \u2018is only indirect,\u2019 \u201d and irrespective of \u201cwhether [the] law is \u2018consistent\u2019 or \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with [Fjederal regulation\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Motor Transp. Ass\u2019n, 552 </em>U.S. 364, 370 (2008), quoting <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 384, 386-387 (1992). See <em>Massachusetts Delivery Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 17-18. Congress\u2019s purpose was to avoid \u201ca State\u2019s direct substitution of its own governmental commands for \u2018competitive market forces\u2019 in determining (to a significant degree) the services that motor carriers will provide.\u201d <em>Rowe, supra </em>at 372, quoting <em>Morales, supra </em>at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The provision of \u00a7 70A at issue here \u2014 which provides that railroad-operated motor vehicles \u201cshall be operated only in areas now served by\u201d the railroad \u2022\u2014 is directly \u201crelated to a . . . route ... of any motor carrier,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1), in that it prohibits some motor carriers from servicing routes where they do not provide rail service. The provision also is \u201crelated to a . . . service of any motor carrier,\u201d <em>id., </em>in that the route prohibition restricts the trucking services that railroads can offer in the Commonwealth. Because these restrictions limit, a railroad\u2019s ability to compete freely with other motor carriers, preemption of their enforcement would be consistent with Congress\u2019s purpose to let \u201ccompetitive market forces\u201d determine what services motor carriers provide. <em>Rowe, </em>552 U.S. at 372, quoting <em>Morales, </em>504 U.S. at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The act, however, only preempts a State from enacting or enforcing laws \u201crelated to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of <em>property.\u201d </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501(c)(1) (emphasis added). Congress did not define the word \u201cproperty.\u201d \u201cNor is the meaning of \u2018property\u2019 perfectly clear from the context of the statute.\u201d <em>AGG Enters. </em>v. <em>Washington County, </em>281 F.3d 1324, 1329 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 822 (2002). The town offers two reasons why the solid waste transported to the facility is not \u201cproperty\u201d within the scope of \u00a7 14501(c)(1), and therefore why \u00a7 70A is not preempted with respect to the transportation of waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">First, the town contends that it is plain from the legislative history of the act that Congress did not intend to preempt State regulation of the transportation of waste. The town specifically relies on the following passage from the report of the conference committee that drafted the bill that became the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThe conferees further clarify that the motor carrier preemption provision does not preempt State regulation of garbage and refuse collectors. The managers have been informed by the Department of Transportation that under [Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)] case law, garbage and refuse are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not considered \u2018property\u2019. Thus, garbage collectors are not considered \u2018motor carriers of property\u2019 and are thus unaffected by this provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 85 (1994). Second, the town argues that the word \u201cproperty\u201d in \u00a7 14501(c)(1) should be read narrowly to avoid preempting the \u201chistorically [S]tote-regulated field of waste disposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We acknowledge that the regulation of local waste collection is a traditional exercise of the States\u2019 police powers. See <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>233 Mass. 275, 281 (1919) (\u201cit is within the well recognized limits of the police power\u201d for city to regulate who may collect garbage and refuse from public streets). And we presume that Congress did not intend to preempt the regulation of local waste collection. See <em>ACE Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>437 Mass. at 247, quoting <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977) (\u201c[W]e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress\u201d); <em>AGG Enters., </em>281 F.3d at 1330 (\u201cCongresses] intent <em>not </em>to preempt the area of solid waste collection [by means of the act] is unambiguous\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">But the railroad-operated motor vehicle restriction in \u00a7 70A does not regulate local waste collection; it regulates the operation of motor vehicles by railroad companies \u201cfor the transportation of freight,\u201d which is within the scope of the State regulation that Congress <em>did </em>intend to preempt through the act. The prohibition in \u00a7 70A against a railroad corporation operating trucks in areas not served by rail by that corporation applies regardless of what is transported by those trucks; it is not limited to trucks transporting waste. Because \u00a7 70A would prevent Bay Colony from transporting the town\u2019s waste solely because it is a railroad without a rail line in the relevant area (rather than because the freight being transported is waste), \u00a7 70A does not implicate the public health interest warranting local regulation of waste collection. In short, the act preempts enforcement of the railroad-owned motor vehicle restriction in \u00a7 70A against Bay Colony, because the restriction is an economic regulation relating to railroads and motor carrier services rather than a public health regulation relating to the transport of waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Moreover, even if we were to accept the town\u2019s premise that \u00a7 70A could be preempted by the act only where \u201cproperty\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>transported, it would still not spare \u00a7 70A from preemption in the circumstances of this case. Relying on ICC case law, the conference committee interpreted \u00a7 14501(c)(1) of the act to exclude \u201cState regulation of garbage and refuse collectors\u201d from the scope of preemption. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677 at 85.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bay Colony, however, did not contract with the town for the <em>collection </em>of garbage; rather, its contract was for the transportation of garbage from the transfer station to the facility <em>after </em>it had been collected. Garbage left out for collection may not be \u201cproperty,\u201d because it has been abandoned by its previous owner. But once the garbage has been collected, it becomes the property of the company that collected it, especially where that garbage may have economic value, whether for the recyclables contained within or, as here, because of the potential energy that may be extracted from that garbage at a waste-to-energy facility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As explained by one member of the Congress that enacted the act, the meaning of \u201cproperty\u201d under ICC case law is \u201cnot so broad as to cover garbage collection\u201d at curbside, but it is \u201cbroad enough to cover . . . recyclables being transported as part of a commercial transaction.\u201d 140 Cong. Rec. 29,402 (1994) (statement of Rep. Norman Y. Mineta). In other words, as the saying goes, \u201cOne man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We therefore conclude that Congress intended to include within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the preemptive scope of the act the State regulation of a railroad corporation\u2019s transportation by truck of a town\u2019s waste from the transfer station to a waste-to-energy facility. Accordingly, we conclude that the enforcement against Bay Colony of the provision of \u00a7 70A limiting the operation of railroad-operated motor vehicles to areas served by the railroad is preempted by the act. Consequently, the town\u2019s affirmative defense that it was barred by \u00a7 70A from allowing Bay Colony to transport its waste to the facility by truck after it lost its rail lease fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">2. <em>Compliance with the town\u2019s DEP permit. </em>As required by State regulation, the town held a permit to operate its waste transfer station that had been issued to the town by the DEP in 1991 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The permit stated that \u201c[t]he operation of the facility shall be in strict accordance with the approved plan,\u201d which we take to mean the \u201cManual of Operating Procedures\u201d (manual) that the town had submitted as part of the town\u2019s permit application. The permit also stated that \u201c[n]o deviation or modification thereto shall occur without [DEP] approval.\u201d The manual specified that tractor-trailers would be used to transport waste to the facility when Bay Colony \u201ccannot move trains on a short-term emergency basis.\u201d It also specified that \u201c[i]n the event that Bay Colony cannot move trains on a long-term (greater than 48-hour) basis, all incoming trucks will be directed to deliver their refuse directly to the SEMASS facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In its motion for summary judgment, and again in its motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the town claimed that its refusal to allow Bay Colony to transport the waste by truck after it lost its rail lease did not constitute a breach of contract because the long-term trucking of waste was not in compliance with its DEP operating permit and therefore would be in violation of law. The judge agreed that the DEP permit did not permit Bay Colony to truck the town\u2019s waste to the facility on a long-term basis, but he determined that a factual dispute existed for the jury to decide as to whether the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>reasonably could be amended through an application to DEP for a permit modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">At trial, the judge correctly instructed the jury that \u201cthere is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract,\u201d and that the implied covenant \u201cmeans that neither party may do anything that will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of that contract.\u201d See <em>T.W. Nickerson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank </em>456 Mass. 562, 569-570 (2010), quoting <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 471-472 (1991). The judge also instructed that, if the town committed a breach of the implied covenant, the town committed a breach of the contract. The judge instructed that the jury must determine whether the town had an obligation under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to apply for a modification of the DEP permit that would allow the long-term trucking of waste and, if so, whether the failure to apply for that permit was a violation of the implied covenant. He also instructed the jury that, for the town to establish a defense that it would have been illegal to allow Bay Colony to truck the waste based on the limitations in the DEP permit, the town had the burden of proving \u201cthat the modification of [the DEP] permit was beyond the reasonable control of\u2019 the town. The town did not request that the jury answer a special verdict question regarding this issue. However, from the jury\u2019s special verdict finding that the town committed a breach of its contract with Bay Colony, we can infer that the jury found that, under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the town was obliged after Bay Colony lost its rail lease to make reasonable efforts to apply for a modification of its DEP permit to allow for the long-term trucking of waste and that it was not beyond the reasonable control of the town to obtain such a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">On appeal, the town argues that it was not obligated to apply for a permit modification after Bay Colony lost its rail line lease because the contract did not expressly contain such an obligation, and because the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be invoked to \u201ccreate rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship.\u201d On the facts of this case, we disagree. Section 9 of the contract gave Bay Colony the right to elect to transport waste by truck if its rail lease were terminated. Where the town\u2019s manual contained a provision prohibiting long-term trucking of the town\u2019s waste to the facility, where the town (not the DEP) had originally written this provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sion, and where the town could have applied to DEP for a permit modification, it was permissible for the jury to find that the town owed a duty under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to make a good faith effort to obtain a modification of its DEP permit to allow Bay Colony to transport the town\u2019s waste by truck after the town learned that Bay Colony had elected this option under the contract. Where the town made no effort to obtain such a modification and made no mention of the DEP permit prohibition until Bay Colony had filed suit for breach of contract, a reasonable jury could have found that the town had committed a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and was using the DEP permit as a post-hoc \u201cpretext\u201d for abandoning the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">There was also abundant evidence at trial to support the finding that the breach caused harm to Bay Colony because DEP would have allowed the town\u2019s permit to be modified to permit the trucking of waste if the town had sought such a modification. The section chief for the DEP\u2019s division of solid waste management testified that obtaining a permit modification can be a \u201cstraightforward\u201d process. He also testified that most waste transfer stations in southeastern Massachusetts transport their waste by truck, and that DEP does not in general have a problem with a transfer station transporting solid waste by truck rather than by rail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Therefore, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence at trial to support the finding that the town\u2019s DEP permit did not render Bay Colony legally unable to perform the contract after it lost its rail lease, and that the jury reasonably rejected this affirmative defense to the town\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">3. <em>Duration of the contract. </em>In 1985, the town entered into a waste acquisition agreement with SEMASS in which the town agreed to deliver to the facility (and SEMASS agreed to accept) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>certain quantities of solid waste each year. Even though G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 4 prohibited municipalities from entering into a contract for \u201cdisposal of garbage, refuse and offal by incineration\u201d for a period exceeding twenty years,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the waste acquisition agreement specified that it ran for twenty-three years \u2014 until January 1, 2008 \u2014 and granted the town an option to extend the agreement through January 1, 2015. The twenty-year limitation in \u00a7 4 was repealed in 1990, see St. 1989, c. 687, \u00a7 7, and on October 26, 2004, the town exercised its option to extend the agreement to 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Section 7 of the contract between the town and Bay Colony states that the term of the contract would \u201ccontinue until the expiration of [the t] awn\u2019s [waste acquisition agreement] with SEMASS.\u201d The town argues that the contract terminated as a matter of law on December 31, 2004, because when the waste acquisition agreement became effective on January 1, 1985, \u00a7 4 prohibited municipalities from making contracts for the \u201cdisposal of waste\u201d for a period greater than twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The flaw in the town\u2019s argument is that, even accepting the town\u2019s claim that the original term of the waste acquisition agreement only ran for twenty years, it would have remained enforceable until December 31, 2004, and the town exercised its option to extend the original term of the waste acquisition agreement to 2015 on October 26, 2004, before it would have expired. When the option was exercised, \u00a7 4 was no longer effective, so no statute barred the continued enforceability of the waste acquisition agreement to 2015. There was sufficient evidence to permit the jury reasonably to conclude that the parties to the contract intended section 7 to mean that the duration of the contract would be the same as the duration of the waste acquisition agreement, including any extension of the latter\u2019s duration permitted by that agreement. Most telling, the original draft of the contract provided for a twenty-year term, but the town asked to revise that term because, as the town stated in its letter to Bay Colony, the town wanted the contract to \u201crun for the same length (with time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>extension abilities) as\u201d the waste acquisition agreement. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to conclude that the contract remained in effect at the time of the town\u2019s breach in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judge did not err in concluding as a matter of law that enforcement of G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 70A, against Bay Colony would have been preempted by the act, and that Bay Colony therefore would not have been acting in violation of an enforceable State law if it transported the town\u2019s waste by truck after it lost its rail lease. There was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to reject the town\u2019s affirmative defense that it could not allow Bay Colony to truck its waste under its DEP permit, because the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing obligated the town to make a good faith effort to apply for a modification of its permit and such a modification likely would have been allowed if sought. There was also sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s implicit finding that the contract remained in effect at the time of the town\u2019s breach. For these reasons, the judgment against the town is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The town of Yarmouth (town) actually did not assign the contract but instead entered into a new contract to transport waste to the facility with the railroad company that was awarded the rail lease that Bay Colony had lost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The judge denied the town\u2019s and Bay Colony\u2019s motions for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, concluding that genuine issues of material fact remained to be resolved at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The town does not challenge on appeal the declaratory judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The preemption provision includes a variety of exceptions not relevant here.

The Congress that enacted the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (act) recognized that the term \u201ctransportation of property\u201d \u201chad its exact legal meaning refined over the years through\u201d ICC case law, and was \u201cusing the term \u2018transportation of property\u2019 [in the act] consistent with its meaning in the Interstate Commerce Act and the related precedents.\u201d 140 Cong.

In 1995, the town represented to Bay Colony that its solid waste <em>could </em>be trucked to the facility on a long-term basis, when the town told Bay Colony that it wanted to negotiate lower rates under the contract because \u201c[r]ecent truck handling proposals indicate trash could be hauled to SEMASS less expensively over the road via trash trucks.\u201d The town made similar representations publically in 2012 when it published a \u201crequest for proposals\u201d seeking a private operator of its transfer station (to start in 2015), stating that \u201cthe successful offeror will be allowed to accept delivery of [solid waste] ... for transfer to either rail or truck,\u201d and \u201cmay seek a ... permit modification to allow a truck to truck transfer\u201d of solid waste.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In 1985, G.
