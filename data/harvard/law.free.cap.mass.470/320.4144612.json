Twenty-three years later, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from samples taken from the victim\u2019s body and clothing soon after her death and run through a national computerized database. A match was found with the defendant\u2019s DNA. The defendant was tried for murder in the first degree. His defense at trial was that he had had consensual sex with the victim but had not been the killer. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on theories of premeditation, extreme atrocity or cruelty, and felony-murder. The defendant appeals from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, and that other errors in the proceedings require a new trial. These include the judge\u2019s exclusion of evidence purported, by the defendant, to show that police had investigated the case inadequately or that the crime might have been committed by a third party; the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, in his closing argument, that there had been no evidence that the victim had engaged in \u201crisky behavior\u201d; and the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury, after one original juror had been discharged, that an alternate juror should get \u201cup to speed\u201d about a question that had been posed by the jury and answered by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Having reviewed the entire record pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we discern no error requiring reversal, and no cause to exercise our authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction to a lesser degree of guilt or to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for later discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">In December, 1984, the victim\u2019s body was found by a passerby in a vacant lot in Boston. She had been eighteen years old. An autopsy revealed that the victim had suffered multiple blunt impact injuries to her head, fractures to her skull, lacerations and contusions to her face, and fractured and loosened teeth. A sock had been tied as a ligature around the victim\u2019s neck. She had been alive when her injuries were inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">Although the victim was identified, the case remained unsolved for many years. After being contacted by the victim\u2019s sister in 2006, the Boston police department reopened the case. Police reexamined evidence collected in the original investigation, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>eluding the victim\u2019s clothing and vaginal and anal swabs taken from her body at the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The vaginal and anal swabs, as well as a stain from the victim\u2019s skirt, were found to contain sperm cells. DNA testing was performed on those cells, and the DNA pattern found in the cells was run through a national database.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The database returned a match with the defendant\u2019s DNA. The likelihood that the DNA pattern shared by the defendant and by the tested samples would be found in a random individual was one in at least 430 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The evidence reexamined by police also included a pair of underwear found on the ground about five or six feet away from the victim\u2019s body. DNA matching the victim\u2019s DNA was found on the underwear. No sperm cells were detected on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The defendant was living and working in Boston at the time of the victim\u2019s death. By 2008, when the case was again being investigated, he was living in Atlanta, Georgia. Boston police detectives traveled to Atlanta in late 2008 to arrest the defendant. After he was arrested and brought back to Boston, the defendant said to a detective, \u201cI have to face the music now.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">At trial, the theory of the defense was that the defendant had had consensual sex with the victim prior to her death, but that he was not her killer. The defendant sought to introduce evidence suggesting that the victim might have been killed by third parties or that the police investigation had been lacldng. As discussed in detail <em>infra, </em>the judge excluded much, though not all, of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The victim\u2019s sister and the victim\u2019s friend and former neighbor testified that they had never heard of the defendant and that the victim had never been with older men or with men who did not speak Spanish.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s sister also testified that the victim had been at home during the nights of the week of Christmas, 1984, including the night before the victim was killed; and that, on the day of the killing, the victim had left home early in the morning and had worked until 6 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>A police criminologist, Kevin Kosiorek, opined that the sperm found in the victim\u2019s body had been deposited there around the time of her death and at the location where she was discovered. This opinion was based, in part, on the fact that no sperm cells were detected on the victim\u2019s underwear; according to Kosiorek, \u201cif somebody is up walking around,... semen would be draining out of her and would be on the underwear if she were wearing it . . . .\u201d Kosiorek also stated that the pattern of stains found on the victim\u2019s skirt was \u201cconsistent with drainage if a person were laying <em>[sic] </em>horizontally].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Kosiorek provided the opinion that sperm \u201cheads,\u201d which were identified in this case, are usually detectible only within \u201ca day or maybe a little more\u201d after sexual intercourse. In addition, while only small quantities of sperm and seminal fluid were collected, Kosiorek explained that the amounts collected are not indicative of the amounts actually deposited, and that the amounts deposited are, in any event, poor indicators of the timing of intercourse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Soon after being charged, the jury submitted a note to the judge, asking, \u201c[Cjould the defense have independently tested any of the physical evidence?\u201d The judge sent back a note stating, \u201cWhether the defendant could seek his own testing of any physical evidence is not a question that was addressed by the evidence. Because you are to confine your deliberations to the evidence presented at the trial, you should not further consider or discuss that question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">On the morning after the jury began deliberating, one juror was discharged because she had failed to appear in court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The discharged juror was replaced by an alternate. As discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>the judge instructed the newly constituted jury that they were to \u201cstart [their] deliberations all over again.\u201d The judge also stated that the question posed by the jury on the previous day \u201cshould be shared with our new juror as well so he is up to speed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>on communications that our deliberating jury has had with the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On the afternoon of the same day, the jury returned a guilty verdict, convicting the defendant of all three theories of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the verdict. He asserts that, although ample evidence demonstrated that he had had sexual relations with the victim, there was no evidence connecting him to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Our inquiry is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>466 Mass. 707, 712-713 (2014), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). \u201c[T]he evidence and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom must be \u2018of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 677, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928) (second alteration in original). Circumstantial evidence alone may suffice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, supra </em>at 713, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolin, </em>448 Mass. 207, 215 (2007). The evidence in this case satisfies these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">As detailed, the evidence was not limited to the fact that sperm cells matching the defendant\u2019s DNA were found in the victim\u2019s body and on her clothing. The pattern of sperm on the victim\u2019s skirt, and the absence of sperm on the victim\u2019s underwear, indicated that the sperm had been deposited around the time of the victim\u2019s death and at the location where her body was discovered. The people closest to the victim, namely her sister and her friend and former neighbor, testified that they had never heard of the defendant and that the victim had never been with older men or with men who did not speak Spanish. The victim\u2019s sister also testified to the victim\u2019s whereabouts on the day of her death and on the preceding nights. All of these pieces of evidence tended to negate the possibility that the defendant had had sex with the victim on some prior occasion unrelated to her death. Finally, the defendant stated to a police officer, after he was arrested, that he had \u201cto face the music now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Minds \u201cof ordinary intelligence and sagacity,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>264 Mass. at 373, could find this evidence sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>forceful to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had killed the victim deliberately, upon a reflective decision to do so; that the killing involved the infliction of injuries brutal both in number and in severity; and that it was carried out in the course of the felony of aggravated rape. The evidence was therefore sufficient to support the verdict of guilty on all three theories of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">3. <em>Third-party culprit evidence and </em>Bowden <em>evidence. </em>As stated, the defendant sought to present evidence suggesting, in his view, that the victim might have been killed by third parties, and that the police had conducted an inadequate investigation. The focal point of this evidence was a set of police reports found in the flies of a Boston police detective, Frank Mulvey, who had been involved in the original investigation. Mulvey had died by the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The most detailed police report in Mulvey\u2019s file (first report) related the following account, provided in its entirety by the victim\u2019s mother, speaking through an interpreter. In October, 1984, police searched the apartment of one of the victim\u2019s friends, a woman named Yvonne. Drugs and cash that belonged to the victim\u2019s former boy friend, who was known as Chulo,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were hidden in an adjacent apartment, and police did not find them. The victim and Yvonne falsely told Chulo that the drugs and the cash had been confiscated. Yvonne used the money to buy a car. Chulo subsequently threatened the victim at gunpoint, and she \u201ctold him the whole story.\u201d Chulo set the car bought by Yvonne on fire. The first report also included another, apparently unrelated piece of information provided by the victim\u2019s mother: the mother reportedly stated that the victim had told her, shortly before her death, that she \u201chad been present in [the Jamaica Plain section of Boston] when [an African-American] guy had been shot in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Two other police reports contained in Mulvey\u2019s file were far less informative. According to one (second report), a police sergeant had received \u201cinformation [that Yvonne] had some Dominicans do [the victim] because she thought that she ratted on a drug deal.\u201d According to the other (third report), police officers had relayed \u201cinfo[rmation] they heard on [the] street\u201d that police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>should \u201clook into\u201d Chulo, who was \u201cnot carrying a full load.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The judge did not permit the defendant to enter these police reports in evidence, stating that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no indicia sufficient... for the court to determine [their] reliability.\u201d The judge also excluded certain questions that defense counsel wished to ask witnesses about the reports. Specifically, counsel was not permitted to ask Yvonne\u2019s sister whether Yvonne had been involved with drugs; and in his cross-examination of the police detective who had reopened the investigation, Juan Torres, counsel was not permitted to discuss the substance of the police reports. In addition, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction concerning alleged inadequacies in the police investigation, although the defendant was permitted to make arguments about this matter in closing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The defendant argues that the police reports, as well as testimony that might have been elicited by the excluded lines of questioning, should have been admitted both as evidence of third-party culprits and as evidence of an inadequate investigation under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472 (1980). Because the defendant preserved his objections to the judge\u2019s rulings on these issues, we review for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>445 Mass. 589, 591 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">a. <em>Third-party culprit evidence. </em>\u201cA defendant may introduce evidence that tends to show that another person committed the crime or had the motive, intent, and opportunity to commit it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva-Santiago, </em>453 Mass. 782, 800 (2009) (Silva-Santiago), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. 378, 387 (1989). We have \u201cgiven wide latitude to the admission of relevant evidence that a person other than the defendant may have committed the crime charged. \u2018If the evidence is \u201cof substantial probative value, and will not tend to prejudice or confuse, all doubt should be resolved in favor of admissibility.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Silva-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Santiago, supra </em>at 800-801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. 60, 66 (2004). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 23 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keizer, </em>377 Mass. 264, 267 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We have imposed two types of restrictions on the admission of third-party culprit evidence, recognizing that \u201cfeeble third-party culprit evidence ... inevitably diverts jurors\u2019 attention away from the defendant on trial and onto the third party, and essentially requires the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the third-party culprit did not commit the crime.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801. First, in order to be admitted, third-party culprit evidence \u201cmust have a rational tendency to prove the issue the defense raises, and [it] cannot be too remote or speculative.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. at 22. In addition, third-party culprit evidence is often hearsay, namely out-of-court statements \u201coffered for the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 that a third party is the true culprit.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra. </em>Such evidence may be admitted \u201conly if, in the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1105 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The opportunity to present third-party culprit evidence is of \u201cconstitutional dimension,\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 804 n.26, because it is rooted in the right of criminal defendants to \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986), quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). See art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, we examine a judge\u2019s decision to exclude third-party culprit evidence \u201cindependently,\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>under \u201ca standard higher than that of abuse of discretion,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. at 67 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Examining the exclusion of the proffered third-party culprit evidence independently, we are satisfied that there was no error. To begin with, even had it not been hearsay, the evidence offered by the defendant was \u201cremote\u201d and \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801. In other words, for the following reasons, this evidence was limited in both reliability and relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The second report and the third report were patently unreliable. The information in these reports was vague; the second report relayed unspecified \u201cinformation\u201d that Yvonne \u201chad some Dominicans do\u201d the victim, and all that the third report suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>was that police \u201cshould look into\u201d Chulo, who was \u201cnot carrying a full load.\u201d In addition, the basis for the vague information in these reports was unclear: the second report was written as a result of a telephone call from a police sergeant who said he \u201cha[d] information,\u201d without specifying the source of it; and the information in the third report was \u201cheard on [the] street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The first report, which originated from an interview with the victim\u2019s mother, was more detailed. However, the basis of the mother\u2019s information was specified only as far as the statement that the victim had witnessed an unidentified African-American man being shot in Jamaica Plain; the mother reportedly had heard of this incident from the victim herself. The first report did not explain how the mother had learned that the victim and Yvonne had stolen drugs from Chulo, that Chulo had subsequently threatened the victim with a gun, or that he had burnt Yvonne\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Moreover, the judge permitted the defendant to conduct a voir dire of the mother during trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The mother testified at voir dire that she did not remember \u201canything\u201d about speaking to police after her daughter\u2019s death, and that she did not remember her daughter telling her about stealing drugs from Chulo, being threatened at gunpoint, or seeing an African-American man shot in Jamaica Plain. Instead of illuminating the first report, the voir dire of the mother thus rendered that report even more enigmatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The first report also was not probative of the crux of a third-party culprit defense, namely \u201cthat another person committed the crime or had the motive, intent, and opportunity to commit it.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 800, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>404 Mass. at 387. The report implied that Yvonne, Chulo, or both might have believed that the victim had wronged them. It would be a stretch to say that such beliefs amounted to a \u201cmotive\u201d for murder, particularly since the first report did not reveal when exactly Chulo was said to have threatened the victim or to have burnt Yvonne\u2019s car. In any event, the first report provides no indication that either Yvonne or Chulo had an intent or an opportunity to kill the victim, or that they did, in fact, commit the crime. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra. </em>\u201cEvidence of a third party\u2019s ill will or possible motive is insufficient alone to support a defense under the third-party culprit doctrine.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>469 Mass. 447, 466 (2014), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. 393, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>398 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>469 Mass. 266, 275-276 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizanowicz, </em>459 Mass. 400, 418-419 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Thus, it would have been permissible for the judge to conclude that the evidence proffered by the defendant was \u201ctoo remote or speculative\u201d to be admitted, even if it had not been hearsay. See <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Moreover, as hearsay, both the police reports and the questioning about them were admissible as third-party culprit evidence \u201conly if, in the judge\u2019s discretion, \u2018the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other \u201csubstantial connecting links\u201d to the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. at 305. For reasons similar to those previously discussed, the evidence offered in this case did not satisfy these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The defendant identified no \u201cconnecting links\u201d between Yvonne or Chulo and the crime itself, in terms of actual intent to harm the victim, geographical or chronological proximity to the crime scene, or the like. Even the first police report, the most informative of the three, suggested only a speculative and uncorroborated potential motive for the murder. The evidence proffered by the defendant also did not satisfy the requirement of \u201cnot tending] to prejudice or confuse the jury.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801. The defendant wished to share with the jury police officers\u2019 notes about vague information from unclear sources. This evidence would have invited the jury to mistake the memorialization of uncorroborated leads for known facts about events preceding the murder. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>386 Mass. at 398-399 (statement suggesting that victim\u2019s estranged husband suspected third party would have tended to mislead jury because it had no tendency to prove that third party actually was murderer). It would have tended, like all third-party culprit evidence, to \u201cdivert[] jurors\u2019 attention away from the defendant on trial and onto the third party.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra. </em>No less problematically, it would have posed a risk of drawing the jury into an evaluation, irrelevant under the circumstances, of the victim\u2019s lifestyle and character. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>430 Mass. 673, 678 (2000) (generally, \u201cevidence of a victim\u2019s character is not admissible in a criminal case\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the judge\u2019s exclusion of the evidence proffered by the defendant as third-party culprit evidence was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>b. Bowden <em>evidence. </em>Evidence also may be admissible to show \u201c[t]he failure of the authorities to conduct certain tests or produce certain evidence,\u201d because \u201c[t]he fact that certain tests were not conducted or certain police procedures not followed could raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jurors\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. at 485-486. \u201c[Fjailure of the police to investigate leads concerning another suspect is sufficient grounds for a <em>Bowden </em>defense.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 802, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 166 (2006). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1107 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><em>Bowden </em>evidence generally is \u201coffered not to show the truth of the matter asserted, but simply to show that the information was provided to the police.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 802. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>429 Mass. 388, 391 (1999). Such evidence, therefore, is not subject to the limitations applicable to hearsay third-party culprit evidence. In order for <em>Bowden </em>evidence to be admitted, however, the judge must \u201cconduct a voir dire hearing to determine whether the third-party culprit information had been furnished to the police, and whether the probative weight of the <em>Bowden </em>evidence exceeded the risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth from diverting the jury\u2019s attention to collateral matters.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 803. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pytou Heang, </em>458 Mass. 827, 851-852 (2011) (relevant evidence in general should be excluded if its \u201cprobative value [is] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or the risk of misleading the jury\u201d); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2014). The exclusion of proffered <em>Bowden </em>evidence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 804; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 629 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The same police reports offered by the defendant as third-party culprit evidence, and the same attendant lines of questioning, were also offered as <em>Bowden </em>evidence. Because this evidence came from police records, it was not necessary for the judge to conduct a voir dire hearing to determine whether the information had been furnished to the police. <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 803. The judge excluded the proffered <em>Bowden </em>evidence after considering the arguments of counsel; such evidence was only to be admitted if its probative weight \u201cexceeded the risk of unfair prejudice to the Commonwealth from diverting the jury\u2019s attention to collateral matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the reasons we discuss, we discern no abuse of discretion in its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>First, the evidence proffered was of limited probative value. The police reports from Mulvey\u2019s file pointed to investigative leads that police had received in the course of the original investigation, twenty-five years earlier. The file did not detail the manner in which police had investigated these leads. Mulvey, who had died, could not describe the course that the original investigation had run. The defendant also did not offer any additional evidence on this matter. Thus, the evidence proffered was relevant primarily in that it would have enabled the jury to surmise that police had failed, in early 1985, \u201cto investigate leads concerning another suspect,\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 802, given that Mulvey\u2019s file memorialized the leads but not any follow-up to them. Tins inference, while perhaps permissible, would have represented weak support for a <em>Bowden </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The excluded evidence also could have shed light on the adequacy of the police\u2019s reexamination of the original leads after the investigation was revived. This matter was, however, probed with some vigor in the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Torres, the detective who reopened the investigation. As mentioned, the judge ruled that the substance of the reports found in Mulvey\u2019s file could not be revealed; but he permitted defense counsel to note in his questioning that certain named individuals, including Yvonne and Chulo, were identified in the file, and to ask Torres whether these individuals had been investigated further in the course of the reopened investigation. The Commonwealth\u2019s redirect examination revealed that police had spoken to Yvonne after reopening the case, had arranged for her to testify before the grand jury, and had learned that Chulo had been deported by the time the investigation had been reopened.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The excluded evidence would thus have made only a limited contribution to a <em>Bowden </em>defense focused on the more recent police investigation; while this evidence could have informed the jury\u2019s assessment of the police\u2019s renewed efforts, those efforts were themselves revealed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Moreover, as discussed, the information in the police reports was largely from unidentified origins, and much of it was vague. Consequently, even if the jury were to believe that police had failed to pursue certain avenues of investigation effectively, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>initially or after reopening the case, this failure would only weakly have suggested that a third party had committed the crime. In other words, it was unlikely that the shortfalls of the investigation suggested by the proffered evidence \u201ccould raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jurors.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. at 486.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On the other side of the scale, the defendant\u2019s <em>Bowden </em>evidence posed a risk, as discussed earlier, of confusing the jury, and of diverting its attention to collateral questions, primarily conjecture concerning the nature of the original investigation. It would also have opened the door to speculation, immaterial here, about the victim\u2019s lifestyle and character.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Also relevant to our analysis is the fact that the judge did allow the defendant to pursue a number of lines of questioning and argument in support of a <em>Bowden </em>defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bizanowicz, </em>459 Mass. at 417, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ridge, </em>455 Mass. 307, 316 (2009). As noted, defense counsel was permitted to ask Torres whether police had revisited various investigative avenues, including avenues based on Mulvey\u2019s file. He was also allowed to argue, in closing, that the collection and retention of evidence from the crime scene had been careless, and that hairs collected at the crime scene, as well as the sock tied around the victim\u2019s neck, could have been tested for DNA but were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In the circumstances, while the judge might well have admitted more of the proffered <em>Bowden </em>evidence, we discern no abuse of discretion in his decision otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">c. <em>Constitutional claim. </em>As noted, the opportunity to present third-party culprit evidence \u201cis of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 804 n.26. This constitutional dimension stems from the right, guaranteed by the United States Constitution, to \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. at 690, quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. at 485. Similarly, but more broadly, art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides that \u201cevery subject shall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be favourable to him.\u201d The defendant argues that if the Massachusetts doctrine concerning third-party culprit evidence permitted the judge to exclude the evidence proffered in this case, then that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>doctrine is consequently unconstitutional. This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The United States Supreme Court has held that the right to present a defense is \u201cabridged by evidence rules that \u2018infring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused\u2019 and are \u2018arbitrary\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>547 U.S. 319,324-325 (2006), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998) (alteration in original). Our jurisprudence concerning the circumstances in which third-party culprit evidence may be excluded is consistent with these strictures. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>461 Mass. 438, 446-447 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruell, </em>459 Mass. 126, 131-133 (2011). We have permitted the exclusion of such evidence in view of concerns with limited probative value, unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, and misleading the jury. See <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801. The Court in <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>547 U.S. at 326, recognized that these considerations are not \u201carbitrary,\u201d stating that \u201cwell-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\u201d More specifically, the Court quoted a \u201cwidely accepted\u201d rule that, while the \u201caccused may introduce any legal evidence tending to prove that another person may have committed the crime with which the defendant is charged,\u201d such evidence \u201cmay be excluded where it does not sufficiently connect the other person to the crime, as, for example, where the evidence is speculative or remote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, quoting 40A Am. Jur. 2d Homicide \u00a7 286, at 136-138 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The standards we have described here and in prior cases are thus not \u201carbitrary.\u201d They also are not \u201cdisproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,\u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>547 U.S. at 324-325, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 308, particularly given our insistence that all doubts concerning evidence \u201cof substantial probative value\u201d that \u201cwill not tend to prejudice or confuse . . . should be resolved in favor of admissibility,\u201d see <em>Silva-Santiago, supra </em>at 801, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>443 Mass. at 66. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant argues that certain statements in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument were improper. He focuses on the fact that, after successfully requesting that the judge exclude the defendant\u2019s proffered third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>culprit evidence, the prosecutor pointed out that no evidence of that type had been presented. Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cCounsel may not, in closing, \u2018exploit[] the absence of evidence that had been excluded at his request.\u2019 Such exploitation of absent, excluded evidence is \u2018fundamentally unfair\u2019 and \u2018reprehensible.\u2019 \u2018[A] party\u2019s success in excluding evidence from the consideration of the jury does not later give that party license to invite inferences . . . regarding the excluded evidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 732 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>439 Mass. 547, 555 (2003), <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1983), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (1980) (alterations in original). Here, a number of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks invited precisely such a prohibited inference, and should not have been made. The prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about [the victim\u2019s] life that would give anybody who knew her a motive to kill her. It is a rape/ murder by a stranger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201cYou know from her life she\u2019s a regular [eighteen] year old living a regular [eighteen] year old\u2019s life. She was not making risky choices. She does not have risky friends. She is not engaging in risky behavior. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\u201cSo when she walked that night. . . , she was walking as an innocent young woman. A woman without enemies. A woman without people who would have a motive to kill her. A woman who had done nothing herself to cause this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">These comments, and especially the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the victim \u201cwas not making risky choices\u201d and was \u201cnot engaging in risky behavior,\u201d would not have seemed plausible had the defendant\u2019s proffered third-party culprit and <em>Bowden </em>evidence been admitted. In this sense, the prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cexploited] the absence of evidence that had been excluded at his request.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>We conclude, however, that there is no substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice occurred. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cIn determining whether an error in closing argument requires reversal, we consider whether defense counsel made a timely objection; whether the judge\u2019s instructions mitigated the error; whether the error was central to the issues at trial or concerned only collateral matters; whether the jury would be able to sort out any excessive claims or hyperbole; and whether the Commonwealth\u2019s case was so strong that the error would cause no prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Consideration of these factors, and particularly the degree to which the error was \u201ccentral to the issues at trial\u201d and the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, leads us to conclude that reversal is not required. First, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the victim\u2019s lack of \u201crisky behavior\u201d were not a key element of his closing argument. Unlike the prosecutor in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haraldstad, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 568, the prosecutor here did not extensively \u201cmine[] th[e] vein\u201d created by the excluded testimony. His argument focused on the evidence that the defendant\u2019s sperm was found in the victim\u2019s body and on her clothing; that the pattern of the sperm indicated, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, that it had been deposited approximately when and where the victim had died; and that, according to the individuals closest to the victim, she had never been with older men or with men who did not speak Spanish. The prosecutor also devoted much of his argument to countering the defendant\u2019s efforts to minimize the prosecution\u2019s case, and to recounting the brutality of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In addition, the jury heard some evidence that tended to support the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the victim\u2019s past. The victim\u2019s sister testified that the victim did not go out often, at least with her; and a friend of the victim testified that the victim \u201cseemed to take care of herself. She used to dress like any young girl, you know, and she used to be clean. She used to keep to herself, I think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In the circumstances, the prosecutor\u2019s misguided remarks did not undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial. \u201c[W]e are substantially confident that, if the error had not been made, the jury verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rud-dock, </em>428 Mass. 288, 292 n.3 (1998). We leave that verdict un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>disturbed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">5. <em>Instructions to the alternate juror. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in his instructions to the reconstituted jury, after an original deliberating juror had been discharged, concerning the question posed by the original jury and the judge\u2019s answer to it. The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instruction undercut his directive that the reconstituted jury must begin its deliberations anew. Although the defendant did not object to the instruction at trial, he now contends that it amounted to a structural error that requires reversal without a showing of prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>403 Mass. 489, 493 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u201cIf a judge determines that the substitution of an alternate juror is appropriate, then the judge . . . must instruct the jury to disregard all prior deliberations and begin its deliberations again.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 770 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carnes, </em>457 Mass. 812, 829 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>403 Mass. at 492. The judge provided such instructions in this case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201c[Ojnce we have a new deliberating juror . . . you must start your deliberations all over again. I appreciate you have not been deliberating for long, but you must start anew because you now constitute a new jury of twelve deliberating jurors. And you must all start from the beginning so that everyone can hear and share and discuss this case anew. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201c[L]et me repeat, ladies and gentlemen of the new deliberating jury, you are to start your deliberations anew, afresh, start over again.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">These emphatic instructions were not undermined by the judge\u2019s discussion of the question that had been asked by the original jury and answered on the previous day. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201c[Tjhere was a note that was given to me by the deliberating jury with a question. I answered that question. The note and the question are with the jury and should be shared with our new juror as well so he is up to speed on communications that our deliberating jury has had with the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s characterizations of these statements, the judge did not instruct the jury to broach any previous discussions with the new juror. Rather, he directed that the jury\u2019s written question, and presumably the judge\u2019s written response, be \u201cshared\u201d with the new juror. This directive was proper. The judge\u2019s written answer to the jury\u2019s question was, in essence, an addendum to the instructions that the judge had given in the presence of all the jurors, before the alternates were selected and before the jury began to deliberate. It was appropriate that the new juror be provided with this additional instruction, just as it would have been appropriate for the alternate jurors to be present had the judge answered the jury\u2019s question in open court rather than by means of a note. No reasonable jurors would have read into the judge\u2019s instruction permission to share prior deliberations with the new juror, or to continue the original jury\u2019s deliberations instead of beginning anew.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">6. <em>Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record and conclude that there is no basis to exercise our authority pursuant to G.
