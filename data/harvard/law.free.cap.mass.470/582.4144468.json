See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1), as amended, 435 Mass. 1302 (2002). We conclude that she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>The respondent, Suzanne T. Dwyer-Jones, has been admitted to practice in both Maine and Massachusetts. On March 25, 2013, a final hearing was held before a single justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on a petition filed by the Maine board of overseers of the bar for suspension of the respondent pursuant to Me. Bar R. 7.3(e)(2)(B). That rule permits the board to file a petition directly with the court where it is alleged that \u201cthe continued practice of [an] attorney poses a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public,\u201d <em>id., </em>because the attorney is \u201cincapacitated from continuing practice by reason of mental infirmity or addiction to drugs or intoxicants.\u201d Me. Bar R. 7.3(e)(2)(A). After the hearing, at which the respondent was both present and represented by counsel, the Maine single justice found that the respondent \u201cis afflicted with a substantial proclivity for substance abuse and a very serious mental health condition.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201c[T]he combined effects of these conditions clearly produced a substantial incapacity that adversely impacted [the respondent\u2019s] ability to practice law and resulted in a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public. Indeed, . . . she was essentially unable to manage her own affairs, let alone the complex matters involved in the representation of others. The court finds that the incapacitating symptoms of these conditions remain essentially as florid today as they were during the last two years. Accordingly, the court hereby orders that [the respondent] be suspended from the practice of law in the State of Maine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Considering that the \u201cissues of the duration and conditions of the suspension are conjoined with [the respondent\u2019s] insight into her medical conditions and the progress she has made to manage them,\u201d the Maine single justice imposed a one-year suspension with conditions, and ordered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201c[a]ny petition for [reinstatement] must show insight into the serious problems that resulted in this suspension, her plan to address them, and a showing of substantial progress toward the goal of being able to undertake the affairs of others without being distracted or incapacitated by her underlying conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">After entry of the Maine order, on June 20, 2013, bar counsel in Massachusetts notified this court of the respondent\u2019s suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sion in Maine \u201cas a result of a substantial incapacity that adversely impacted her ability to practice law and resulted in a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public.\u201d Bar counsel provided a certified copy of the Maine order, and petitioned for an order transferring the respondent to disability inactive status in Massachusetts, pursuant to the reciprocal provisions of S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1). That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201c(1) Involuntary Commitment, Adjudication of Incompetence, or Transfer to Disability Inactive Status. Where a lawyer has been judicially declared incompetent or committed to a mental hospital after a judicial hearing, or where a lawyer has been placed by court order under guardianship or conservatorship, or <em>where a lawyer has been transferred to disability inactive status in another jurisdiction, the court, upon proper proof of the fact, shall enter an order transferring the lawyer to disability inactive status. </em>A copy of such order shall be served, in the manner the court may direct, upon the lawyer, his or her guardian or conservator, and the director of the institution to which the lawyer is committed\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The respondent opposed the petition. After a hearing, a single justice of this court placed the respondent on disability inactive status in Massachusetts for a period of one year, effective as of August 18, 2013. The respondent appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Neither Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01 nor prior decisions of this court address the standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>review for a single justice\u2019s order \u2014 reciprocal or not \u2014 transferring an attorney to disability inactive status. Although \u201c[disability proceedings are not disciplinary proceedings,\u201d <em>Matter of Disability Proceeding Against Diamondstone, </em>153 Wash.2d 430, 437, cert, denied, 546 U.S. 845 (2005), we recognize that they have procedural similarities. See SJ.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (4) (a), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1315 (1997) (proceedings to determine incapacity \u201cconducted in same manner as disciplinary hearings\u201d), and \u00a7 13 (6), as amended, 435 Mass. 1302 (2002) (with some exceptions, petitions for reinstatement following suspension or disbarment apply to reinstatement from disability inactive status). We generally will apply the same principles applicable to disciplinary cases to disability cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Where reciprocal proceedings are involved, the disability rules provide that \u201cupon proper proof of the fact [that a lawyer has been transferred to disability inactive status in another jurisdiction, the court] shall enter an order transferring the lawyer to disability inactive status\u201d in the Commonwealth. S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1). Compare S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 16 (5), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1319 (1997) (\u201cA final adjudication in another jurisdiction that a lawyer has been guilty of misconduct . . . may be treated as establishing the misconduct for purposes of a disciplinary proceeding in the Commonwealth\u201d). Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1), treats the foreign judgment or order restricting the attorney\u2019s practice as conclusive of the underlying disability or incapacity to practice law. As we do in the reciprocal discipline context, we will limit our review to considering whether the procedures followed in the other jurisdiction lacked reasonable notice or opportunity to be heard, and whether there was a significant infirmity of proof as to the disability. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 16 (3), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1319 (1997). Finally, if we conclude that a practice restriction is appropriate in this Commonwealth, we consider independently whether applying the same restriction would \u201cresult in grave injustice,\u201d and whether the disability established elsewhere would warrant the identical restrictions here. <em>Matter of Lebbos, </em>423 Mass. 753, 756, cert, denied, 520 U.S. 1275 (1997) <em>(Lebbos IT).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">3. <em>Applicability of \u00a7 13 (1). </em>Whether in the context of attorney disability or discipline, \u201cconsiderations of public welfare are wholly dominant.\u201d <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544, 547 (1943). The reciprocal disability and disciplinary rules accordingly acknowledge that an \u201cattorney is not suddenly rehabilitated when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>she crosses a State line,\u201d <em>Lebbos II, supra </em>at 755, and provide that the lawful disability and disciplinary decisions of our sister States should have reciprocal effect here. SJ.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7\u00a7 13 (1), 16. This reflects appropriate deference to the proceedings of other jurisdictions, and gives effect to the decisions made \u201cwithout undertaking the often difficult and protracted task of redoing the inquiry which has already been concluded there.\u201d <em>Lebbos II, supra </em>at 755. See <em>Bar Counsel </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Overseers, </em>420 Mass. 6, 9-11 (1995) (\u201coffensive use of collateral estoppel is appropriate in bar disciplinary proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We recognize that the rules and procedures of other jurisdictions may not align perfectly with ours, but if they are \u201cequivalent\u201d in practical application and effect, orders and judgments entered elsewhere serve as the basis for reciprocal treatment here. <em>Matter of Lebbos, </em>407 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1990), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1040 (1991) <em>(.Lebbos I) </em>(involuntary transfer to inactive status in California based on alleged misconduct equivalent to temporary suspension in Massachusetts). See <em>Matter of Ngobeni, </em>453 Mass. 233 (2009) (reciprocal discipline permissible where lawyer permitted to resign without admission or finding of misconduct in other jurisdiction). See also, e.g., <em>Matter of Marquez, </em>63 A.3d 1059 (D.C. 2013) (disability suspension in District of Columbia functional equivalent of impairment suspension in Virginia); <em>Matter of Carter, </em>395 S.C. 128 (2011) (transfer to incapacity inactive status in South Carolina based on disability inactive status in Tennessee); <em>Matter of McDonough, </em>6 A.3d 1283 (D.C. 2010) (disability suspension in District of Columbia based on disability inactive status in Connecticut).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In Maine, when an attorney is \u201cincapacitated from continuing practice by reason of mental infirmity or addiction to drugs or intoxicants,\u201d Me. Bar R. 7.3(e)(2)(A), the rules provide for suspension or voluntary resignation, rather than transfer to \u201cdisability inactive status.\u201d Me. Bar R. 7.3(e)(1). The Maine rules do not recognize a \u201cdisability inactive\u201d status per se. The Maine single justice accordingly suspended the respondent \u2014 after a hearing \u2014 because he concluded that she suffered from \u201ca substantial incapacity that adversely affected [her] ability to practice law and resulted in a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public.\u201d In Massachusetts, that conclusion would support \u201can order transferring the respondent to disability inactive status until further order of the court.\u201d SJ.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (4) (e), as amended, 453 Mass. 1307 (2009). In the circumstances, the single justice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>this court correctly concluded that the Maine suspension order was the practical equivalent of what our rules consider to be a \u201ctransfer to \u2018disability inactive status.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">4. <em>Fairness of Maine proceeding. </em>We next turn to the question whether the respondent \u201creceived a fair hearing [in Maine] at which sufficient evidence was presented to justify our talcing reciprocal. . . action.\u201d <em>Lebbos II, supra </em>at 756. There is nothing in the record before us to suggest that she did not. In accordance with the rules of that State, a single justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court conducted a hearing at which the respondent was present and was represented by counsel, and at which she testified. The Maine single justice\u2019s thorough memorandum of decision reflects that counsel participated in prehearing conferences and exchanged materials, and that the hearing was continued for several months at the respondent\u2019s request. In short, the respondent has not established that she lacked notice or an opportunity to be heard. See <em>Matter of Mitrano, </em>453 Mass. 1026,1027 (2009); <em>Matter of Steinberg, </em>448 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2007). While the procedures followed in Maine are not identical to those of Massachusetts, the differences do not establish a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">5. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>Nor are we persuaded that there was any significant infirmity of proof in Maine. The Maine single justice\u2019s decision reflects thoughtful consideration of the evidence before him, concluding that the respondent attorney \u201cis afflicted with a substantial proclivity for substance abuse and a very serious mental health condition . . . that adversely impacted [her] ability to practice law and resulted in a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public.\u201d He also found that \u201cthe incapacitating symptoms of these conditions remain essentially as florid today as they were during the last two years,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[t]he issues of the duration and conditions of the suspension are conjoined with [her] insight into her medical conditions and the progress she has made to manage them.\u201d See <em>Matter of Mitrano, supra </em>at 1027. The respondent has not demonstrated that proof of incapacity was lacking. Indeed, apart from the Maine single justice\u2019s decision itself, no transcript or other record of the underlying proceeding in Maine has been provided to this court. As the single justice of this court reasoned, \u201c[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that this factual issue [of capacity] was not fully and fairly litigated in Maine, and no reason why the mandate in \u00a7 13 (1) providing essentially for a reciprocal transfer to \u2018disability inactive status\u2019 should not be triggered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>6. <em>Appropriate reciprocal response. </em>As we do in the context of reciprocal discipline, we consider what level of restriction on practice in Massachusetts \u201cis warranted by the facts even if that [restriction] exceeds, equals, or falls short of the [restriction] imposed in another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Matter of Watt, </em>430 Mass. 232, 234 (1999). We are not bound by the single justice\u2019s determination, and consider de nova the single justice\u2019s order. <em>Matter of Goldberg, </em>434 Mass. 1022, 1023 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Neither due process considerations nor the applicable rules require that a separate hearing on disability be conducted in Massachusetts pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (4), to evaluate an attorney\u2019s incapacity to practice law where it fully and fairly has been adjudicated elsewhere.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1). Because the respondent has not established that the proceedings in Maine were procedurally deficient, or that there was a significant infirmity of proof, the single justice of this court properly declined to provide the respondent an opportunity to litigate her physical or mental status during the term of the Maine order. See <em>Lebbos II, supra </em>at 756-757 (noting reluctance to examine claimed defects in disciplinary proceeding \u201cwhere an appellate forum exists in that jurisdiction which may and did address these particular concerns\u201d). Prior to giving reciprocal effect to the Maine order, the respondent was given adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard on bar counsel\u2019s petition for transfer to disability inactive status, and she availed herself of them. Among other things, she replied to bar counsel\u2019s petition and supplemented her reply, and a telephonic hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We emphasize that a transfer to disability inactive status is not a disciplinary measure. See S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 4, as appearing in 425 Mass. 1304 (1997). Ordinarily, that status does not have a defined duration, and an attorney is permitted to petition to transfer to active status once each year or \u201cat such intervals as this court may direct.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (6) (b). When a respondent who has been reciprocally placed on disability inactive status has been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201creturned to active status by the other jurisdiction, this court, after hearing, may dispense with referring the matter to the Board pursuant to [S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 18 (5), as appearing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>453 Mass. 1315 (2009),] for the taking of further evidence that his or her disability has been removed and may immediately direct the lawyer\u2019s reinstatement to active status upon such terms as are deemed proper and advisable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (6) (d). Therefore, where, as here, an attorney\u2019s inactive status is founded on proceedings in another jurisdiction, if she is returned to active status in that jurisdiction, she may petition a single justice of this court to \u201cimmediately direct\u201d her reinstatement to active status, without the necessity of petitioning for reinstatement pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not consider the single justice\u2019s order to have foreclosed her from filing a petition for reinstatement at the time the suspension in Maine is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>The respondent\u2019s suspension in Maine based on a finding of incapacity was the practical equivalent of a transfer to \u201cdisability inactive status,\u201d for purposes of the reciprocal disability provision of S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1). The single justice correctly concluded that the respondent was not entitled to a separate hearing in Massachusetts to evaluate her incapacity, and properly transferred her to disability inactive status in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1), 435 Mass. 1302 (2002), was amended in 2001 to provide for reciprocal transfer to disability inactive status based on actions taken in another jurisdiction. Although the rule, as amended, appears in the Massachusetts Reports, <em>id., </em>it may not have been included in certain publications of the annotated laws of court for some period. See Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01, \u00a7 13 (1), at 656 (LexisNexis 2012). Before the single justice, however, bar counsel quoted the amended rule, and respondent\u2019s counsel argued in part that, because the respondent was suspended in Maine but not transferred to disability inactive status, the reciprocal provisions of \u00a7 13 (1) did not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">On May 16, 2012, bar counsel filed a notice of conviction, pursuant to S.J.C.
