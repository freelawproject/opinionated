Approximately six months later, he commenced an action in the Superior Court against the AHA for alleged violations of the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 148A. Fernandes claimed that the AHA violated \u00a7 148 by intentionally misclassifying his position as maintenance mechanic II, instead of maintenance mechanic I, and thereby failing to pay him the wages to which he was entitled. Fernandes also alleged that the AHA violated \u00a7 148A by terminating him in retaliation for complaining about nonpayment of earned wages and filing a complaint with the Attorney General\u2019s office.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a trial in January, 2012, a jury, in response to special questions, found in favor of Fernandes on both claims. The jury awarded damages against the AHA in the amount of $2,300 for unpaid wages due to misclassification, and $130,000 for lost wages due to retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The parties then filed numerous posttrial motions. Of relevance to the present appeal, the AHA filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, contending that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Fernandes\u2019s wage and retaliation claims because, as a housing authority employee, Fernandes was required to bring such claims before the Civil Service Commission (commission) for resolution. Fernandes filed a motion for reinstatement to the position of maintenance mechanic I with full seniority as if he had not been terminated from employment on May 29, 2009, and a motion for a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, for additur. Following hearings, the trial judge denied all three motions in a thorough and well-reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">First, after considering the purposes of and remedies afforded by the Massachusetts civil service law, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, and the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 148A, 150, the judge discern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ed no legislative intent to confine a housing authority employee to the procedures set forth in the civil service law where his termination implicated violations of his rights under the Wage Act. Accordingly, the judge concluded that the AHA was not entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Next, with respect to Fernandes\u2019s motion for reinstatement, the judge was unpersuaded that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, authorized such a remedy for retaliatory conduct in the absence of clear statutory language to that effect. Finally, the judge concluded that although the jury\u2019s calculation of $130,000 in damages for lost wages due to retaliation was less than the amount to which Fernandes thought he was entitled, the award was neither unreasonable nor so unduly small as to suggest the need for additional relief. In accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, the judge proceeded to award Fernandes treble damages in the amount of $6,900 for unpaid wages and $390,000 for retaliatory termination, plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $36,667.50 and costs of $1,087.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The parties\u2019 cross appeals were entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over Fernandes\u2019s claims under the Wage Act, that reinstatement to employment is not an available remedy for violations of such statutory scheme, and that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Fernandes\u2019s motion for additur. Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>We briefly recite the facts the jury could have found from the evidence at trial, reserving some details for later discussion. When Fernandes was hired by the AHA in 2001, he was classified as a maintenance mechanic II. It was an entry-level position, considered to be in the nature of an apprenticeship to a higher job classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In 2003, the executive director of the AHA, John Zambarano, implemented changes to the duties of its maintenance department workers. Pursuant to these changes, Fernandes was required to perform more diversified work that he believed was consistent with the position of maintenance mechanic I, which required a greater skill level and paid a higher salary than he was receiving.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notwithstanding Fernandes\u2019s enhanced job responsibilities, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>AHA continued to pay him the salary of a maintenance mechanic II. On various occasions over the years of his tenure, Fernandes complained to his supervisor, Mark Johnson, and to Zambarano that he was misclassified and that, based on his duties, he properly should be classified as a maintenance mechanic I with the commensurate wage rate. His complaints were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Finally, on April 28, 2009, Fernandes filed a \u201cNon-Payment of Wage and Workplace Complaint Form\u201d with the Attorney General\u2019s office. He alleged that, based on his job responsibilities, he had been misclassified as a maintenance mechanic II and was owed wages commensurate with the position of maintenance mechanic I. Fernandes informed Johnson that he had filed this complaint, and he subsequently requested and received from Dianne Precourt, AHA\u2019s financial coordinator, copies of his job description and the prevailing wage rates. One month later, on May 29, 2009, Zambarano called Fernandes into a meeting and informed him that, based on the seniority of the personnel on the maintenance staff, Fernandes was being laid off due to budgetary constraints. He was given two weeks of severance pay. The present action ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">2. <em>Jurisdiction over Fernandes\u2019s claims. </em>The AHA contends in this appeal that a housing authority employee can seek redress for an adverse employment action only through administrative proceedings under the civil service law, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, and not through judicial proceedings in the Superior Court. In the AHA\u2019s view, Fernandes\u2019s complaint essentially alleged that he had been subjected to a decrease in compensation and then terminated without \u201cjust cause,\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a741, which are matters within the exclusive purview of the commission. Consequently, the AHA continues, the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Fernandes\u2019s original action and, therefore, the judge should have granted AHA\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. We disagree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The doctrine of primary jurisdiction arises in cases where a plaintiff, \u201cin the absence of pending administrative proceedings, invokes the original jurisdiction of a court to decide the merits of a controversy\u201d that includes an issue within the special competence of an agency. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220 (1979). See <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., </em>453 Mass. 585, 609 (2009); <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341, 345-346 &amp; n.3 (1987). See generally A.J. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 1725 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2014). \u201cWhere an agency has statutorily been granted <em>exclusive </em>authority over a particular issue, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires that a court refer the issue to the agency for adjudication in the first instance\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Blauvelt </em>v. <em>AFSCME Council 93, Local 1703, 74 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 794, 801 (2009), citing <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., supra </em>at 609-610. See <em>Puorro </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 61, 64 (2003). The underlying rationale is that a court must be careful not to invade the province of an administrative agency before it has begun to exercise its authority in a particular case because judicial interference effectively would transfer to the courts a matter entrusted to the agency by the Legislature and would result in a substitution of the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency. See <em>Wilczewski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>404 Mass. 787,792 (1989). The doctrine of primary jurisdiction has particular applicability when \u201can action raises a question of the validity of an agency practice ... or when the issue in litigation involves \u2018technical questions of fact uniquely within the expertise and experience of an agency\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., supra </em>at 221, quoting <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 290, 304 (1976). See <em>Columbia Chiropractic Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 60, 62 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">This court has noted that \u201c[a] determination that primary jurisdiction over an issue in a civil case resides with an administrative agency requires that the case be stayed or dismissed to permit the administrative agency the opportunity to issue its determination.\u201d <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., </em>453 Mass. at 610 n.32. When an entire controversy is within the exclusive jurisdiction of an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>live agency, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction \u201cordinarily results in dismissal of judicial proceedings begun without prior resort to the agency.\u201d <em>J. &amp; J. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Martignetti, </em>369 Mass. 535, 540 (1976). However, \u201c[wjhere at least one of the issues or claims is a matter for judicial determination or resolution, the court is not ousted of subject matter jurisdiction by the presence in the case of one or more issues which arguably are within the jurisdiction of an administrative or regulatory agency.\u201d <em>Austin Lakes Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Avon Utils., Inc., </em>648 N.E.2d 641, 646 &amp; n.5 (Ind. 1995). See <em>Everett </em>v. <em>357 Corp., supra </em>at 611 n.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We proceed to consider the exclusivity of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to Fernandes\u2019s claims. The AHA argues that because G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, explicitly provides civil service protections to tenured housing authority employees, the Legislature intended to confer jurisdiction solely on the commission to resolve complaints about purported adverse employment actions. We conclude that nothing in the civil service law suggests that Fernandes was required to bring his action before the commission where his claims alleged violations of the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 148A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">General Laws c. 121B, \u00a7 29, provides that \u201c[n]o employee of any housing authority, except an employee occupying the position of executive director, who has held his office or position . . . within the authority for a total period of five years of uninterrupted service, shall be involuntarily separated therefrom except subject to and in accordance with the provisions of [G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a741-45,] to the same extent as if said office or position were classified under said chapter.\u201d In turn, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, states that a tenured employee shall not be discharged or laid off except for \u201cjust cause\u201d and except in accordance with specific procedural requirements set forth in the first paragraph of \u00a7 41. Pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42, \u201c[a]ny person who alleges that an appointing authority has failed to follow the requirements of [\u00a7 41] in taking action which has affected his employment or compensation <em>may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>file a complaint with the commission\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, \u201c[i]f a person aggrieved by a decision of an appointing authority made pursuant to [\u00a7 41] shall . . . appeal in writing to the commission, he shall be given a hearing.\u201d Thereafter, \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by a final order or decision of the commission . . . may institute proceedings for judicial review in the superior court.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. Finally, a tenured employee who has incurred attorney\u2019s fees in the defense of an unwarranted adverse employment action \u201cshall be reimbursed for such expense,\u201d subject to specified limitations. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 45. In essence, G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, affords housing authority employees, like Fernandes, the protections of the civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cThe fundamental purpose of the civil service system is to guard against political considerations, favoritism, and bias in governmental hiring and promotion.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers </em>v. <em>Abban, </em>434 Mass. 256, 259 (2001). It also is designed to \u201cprotect efficient public employees\u201d from partisanship and arbitrary punishment. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Second Dist. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>389 Mass. 508, 514 (1983), quoting <em>Debnam </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>388 Mass. 632, 635 (1983). See <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. 392, 396-397 (1974). The civil service system accomplishes its purpose by mandating that an adverse employment action be taken only for \u201cjust cause,\u201d and by imposing on an appointing authority the obligation to comply with procedural requirements that are intended to protect the rights of a tenured employee. \u201cIf the commission finds that the appointing authority has failed to follow [the] requirements [of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41,] and that the rights of [any] person [filing a complaint] have been prejudiced thereby, the commission shall order the appointing authority to restore said person to his employment immediately without loss of compensation or other rights.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The aforementioned language of G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, and the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, clearly are meant to protect tenured employees\u2019 rights, but nothing therein dictates that the only avenue by which a housing authority employee who claims that he has been paid inadequate wages and involuntarily sepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>rated from his employment can seek redress is through administrative proceedings before the commission. To the contrary, the language in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42, stating that an aggrieved employee \u201cmay\u201d file a complaint with the commission strongly suggests that the Legislature has not granted <em>exclusive </em>authority over <em>all </em>challenged employment actions to the commission. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>404 Mass. 170, 172-174 (1989) (Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and Civil Service Commission simultaneously resolved separate complaints filed by individual alleging failure to hire based on race); <em>Dedham </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Mass. at 400-404 (Civil Service Commission did not have exclusive jurisdiction over suspension of employee where claim of prohibited labor practice also could be brought before Labor Relations Commission). In circumstances where, as here, an employee\u2019s claims focus not on an employer\u2019s failure to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, but, rather, on the employer\u2019s violation of an entirely different and separate statutory mandate, the employee is not required to proceed before the commission, but may commence a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Of critical significance in this case is the nature of Fernandes\u2019s claims. The AHA characterizes those claims within the framework of the civil service law, contending that determinations whether Fernandes was subjected to a retaliatory layoff or a \u201clowering] in rank or compensation,\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, involve a \u201cjust cause\u201d analysis. However, contrary to the AHA\u2019s view of Fernandes\u2019s complaint, the substance of his interrelated claims pertained to alleged violations of the Wage Act. More specifically, Fernandes asserted that the AHA intentionally misclassified his position and thereby failed to pay him the wages to which he was entitled, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the AHA then terminated his employment in retaliation for his filing of a nonpayment of wage complaint with the Attorney General\u2019s office, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148A. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the central thrust of Fernandes\u2019s action was the AHA\u2019s purported violations of the Wage Act, and not its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>alleged failure to act with \u201cjust cause,\u201d Fernandes elected to seek redress for the harm he sustained by filing an action in the Superior Court, rather than by commencing administrative proceedings before the commission. Nothing in the civil service law precluded him from doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See generally <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. Boston, 435 Mass. 718, 719-720 (2002) (we interpret statutory language according to intent of Legislature ascertained from its words considered in context of statute\u2019s purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Similarly, nothing in the Wage Act excludes a housing authority employee from its protections or requires that such employee pursue relief from alleged wrongful conduct under the civil service system. \u201cThe purpose of the Wage Act is \u2018to prevent the unreasonable detention of wages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. 164, 170 (2012), quoting <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. at 720. See <em>Lipsitt </em>v. <em>Plaud, </em>466 Mass. 240, 245 (2013). It was designed, among other purposes, \u201cto protect wage earners from the long-term detention of wages by unscrupulous employers.\u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra, </em>quoting <em>Cumpata </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>113 F. Supp. 2d 164, 167 (D. Mass. 2000). To ensure that employees are not penalized for asserting their rights to earned wages, the Legislature included an antiretaliation clause in the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148A, to protect employees, like Fernandes, who complain about violations of the statute. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Winter Place LLC, </em>447 Mass. 363, 367-368 (2006); <em>Fraelick </em>v. <em>PerkettPR, Inc., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 704 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">When the Wage Act was first enacted in 1886, it \u201cwas initially limited to employees of a \u2018manufacturing, mining or quarrying, mercantile, railroad, street railway, telegraph, telephone and municipal corporation and every incorporated express company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>water company.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. at 171 n.6, quoting St. 1886, c. 87, \u00a7 1. Since that time, however, the Legislature has broadened the scope of the Wage Act by imposing its provisions on \u201c[ejvery person having employees in his service.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. See <em>Lipsitt </em>v. <em>Plaud, </em>466 Mass. at 245 &amp; n.8; <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra. </em>An employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 or 148A, may bring a private civil action ninety days after filing a complaint with the Attorney General, or sooner if the Attorney General assents to such suit, for injunctive relief, damages, and any lost wages and other benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. See <em>Depianti </em>v. <em>Jan-Pro Franchising Int'l, Inc., </em>465 Mass. 607, 611-612 (2013). \u201cAn employee so aggrieved who prevails in such an action shall be awarded treble damages, as liquidated damages, for any lost wages and other benefits and shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. See <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra </em>at 171 n.8. See also <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 178 (2000) (treble damages are punitive in nature, authorized only where allowed by statute, and appropriate where defendant\u2019s conduct is outrageous or indifferent to rights of others). There is no provision in the Wage Act stating that if an aggrieved employee has been afforded civil service protections, that employee must proceed before the commission, rather than commencing a civil action. See <em>Depianti </em>v. <em>Jan-Pro Franchising Int'l, Inc., supra </em>at 613-614 (filing requirement of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, \u201ctriggers no mandatory agency investigation or administrative adjudicatory action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Although both the civil service law and the Wage Act address wrongful conduct arising in the employment context, they have distinct purposes and, as a consequence, provide different remedies for the violation of their statutory mandates. Notwithstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ing the fact that Fernandes was a housing authority employee, we discern no intent on the part of the Legislature to preclude him from bringing an action in the Superior Court specifically to vindicate his rights under the Wage Act. Although the Commissioner of Labor and Industries is authorized under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 29, to \u201cdetermine rates of wages\u201d for each classification of work performed by laborers for a housing authority, neither that statutory provision nor G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, address the unlawful withholding of earned wages by an employer. It is the Wage Act that speaks to and provides remedies for such prohibited employer conduct. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148,150. In a similar vein, the Legislature clearly intended to sanction severely those employers who retaliate against employees who complain about purported wage violations. See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148A, 150. That occurs under the Wage Act. See <em>id. </em>Fernandes\u2019s claims are not ones that require the special expertise of the commission to resolve. See <em>Columbia Chiropractic Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass, at 62. See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., 311 </em>Mass. at 221. Moreover, their resolution by the Superior Court does not interfere with the development and administration of policies under the civil service law. See <em>id. </em>at 222. For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over Fernandes\u2019s claims. The judge did not err in denying the AHA\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">3. <em>Reinstatement to employment. </em>As we have discussed, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, provides that an employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 or 148A, may bring a civil action \u201cfor injunctive relief, for any damages incurred, and for any lost wages and other benefits.\u201d Fernandes contends that, given the jury\u2019s verdicts, the judge erred in denying his motion for reinstatement to the position of maintenance mechanic I with full seniority as if he had not been terminated from employment on May 29, 2009. He argues that the \u201cinjunctive relief\u2019 language in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, permits the equitable remedy of reinstatement. We disagree and conclude that reinstatement to employment is not an available remedy for violations of the Wage Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Fernandes analogizes the \u201cinjunctive relief\u2019 language in the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, to language in the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 15IB, which provides that \u201c[a]ny person claiming to be aggrieved by a practice made unlawful under this chapter\u201d may bring \u201ca civil action for damages or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>injunctive relief or both in the superior or probate court.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9. Relying on <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 585 (Sosman, J., concurring), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>543 U.S. 979 (2004), Fernandes asserts that while the language of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, like the Wage Act, does not specifically identify reinstatement as a form of injunctive relief, courts have recognized that reinstatement is a proper remedy under G. L. c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We acknowledge that reinstatement is an available remedy under G. L. c. 15 IB, but it is one that is <em>expressly </em>permitted by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) in the context of an administrative proceeding under \u00a7 5. General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 5, states that when the MCAD finds that a respondent has engaged in any unlawful practice as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, the MCAD has broad authority to take affirmative action to remedy such unlawful practice, \u201cincluding but not limited to, hiring, <em>reinstatement </em>or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, ... as, in the judgment of the [MCAD],' will effectuate the purposes of this chapter\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. at 563 (primary purpose of administrative proceeding before MCAD is to vindicate public\u2019s interest in reducing workplace discrimination by deterring and punishing unlawful conduct by employers). We have said that G. L. c. 151B \u201cprovides an aggrieved party with \u2018two largely independent avenues for redress of violations of [G. L. c. 151B], one through the MCAD (G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 5-6), and the other in the courts (G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9).\u2019 \u201d <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 436, 441-442 (2008), quoting <em>Stonehill College, supra </em>at 565. See <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>405 Mass. 446, 452 (1989). Therefore, \u201c[t]he remedies available under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 9, differ.\u201d <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, LLC, supra </em>at 442 n.9. The Legislature plainly has articulated the availability of reinstatement as a remedy for employment discrimination in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Similarly, in other circumstances where the Legislature has authorized reinstatement as a remedy for unlawful discharge, it has done so expressly. See, e.g., G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 5J (3) (where employee discharged for disclosing information to government or law enforcement agency under Massachusetts False Claims Act, court may order \u201creinstatement with the same seniority status [such] employee .. . would have had but for the discrimination\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185 <em>(d) </em>(where employee discharged in retaliation for disclosing information pursuant to Massachusetts whistle-blower statute, court may \u201creinstate the employee to the same position held before the retaliatory action, or to an equivalent position\u201d); G. L. c. 150E, \u00a711 (\u00bf0 (where employer commits prohibited practice under public employees collective bargaining statute, \u201chearing officer shall order the reinstatement with or without back pay of an employee discharged or discriminated against in violation of the [statute]\u201d). It is well established that \u201cwe do not \u2018read into [a] statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, whether the omission came from inadvertence or of set purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), quoting <em>King </em>v. <em>Viscoloid Co., </em>219 Mass. 420, 425 (1914). See <em>Dartt </em>v. <em>Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. (Mass.), </em>427 Mass. 1, 9 (1998) (court will not add language to statute that Legislature could have, but did not, include). The omission of particular language from a statute is deemed deliberate where the Legislature included such omitted language in related or similar statutes. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Department of State Police, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 754 (2004). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 833 (2003), quoting 2A N.J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06, at 194 (6th ed. rev. 2000) (\u201c[W]here the legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Here, nothing in the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, permits a court to order the reinstatement of an employee who has been aggrieved by an employer\u2019s unlawful conduct in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 or 148A. We are not persuaded that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cinjunctive relief\u2019 in \u00a7 150 encompasses the remedy of reinstatement, particularly where the availability of such a remedy under other statutory provisions has been expressly articulated by the Legislature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, we decline to engraft onto the Wage Act remedies that are available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>to an aggrieved employee under the antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B. When Fernandes elected to commence an action in the Superior Court, rather than before the commission, to seek redress for the harm he purportedly sustained as a consequence of the AHA\u2019s violations of the Wage Act, he also effectively elected the remedies that would be afforded under that statutory scheme. Contrast G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42 (reinstatement may be available for illegal discharge under civil service law). We conclude that the judge properly denied Fernandes\u2019s motion for reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">4. <em>Additur. </em>Fernandes contends that the judge abused his discretion in denying Fernandes\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, for additur. Mass. R. Civ. R 59 (a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974). He asserts that, based on the testimony of the AHA\u2019s financial coordinator, Dianne Precourt, the proper amount of his lost wages and benefits was $193,750. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the jury determined, after finding that the AHA had retaliated against Fernandes, that his lost wages and benefits amounted to $130,000. In Fernandes\u2019s view, because the evidence presented at trial regarding his damages was uncontroverted, the jury\u2019s award was unreasonable and inexplicable, and therefore, the judge should have granted an additur. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Additur serves the beneficial goal of \u201csecuring substantial jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tice between the parties without the burdensome costs, delays and harassments of new trials.\u201d <em>Baudanza </em>v. <em>Comcast of Mass. I, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 622, 626 (2009), quoting <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>379 Mass. <em>777, </em>782 (1980). \u201cAn additur is appropriate where the judge concludes that the verdict is sound except for the amount of damages and that the amount of damages is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629-630, quoting <em>Service Publs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 580 (1986). See <em>DiBiase </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 930 (1992) (plaintiff entitled to additur where damages awarded by jury greatly disproportionate to proven injury). \u201cAn unduly slim verdict, however, may signal the existence of other defects in the work of the jury, or mistakes by the judge. In such a case additur would not be appropriate, and a simple new trial would be called for.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Wood, supra </em>at 785-786. See <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>North Shore Community Arts Found., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 376 (1999). \u201c[T]he allowance of a motion for a new trial based upon an inadequate . . . award of damages, and the direction of an addition . . . , rests in the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Loschi </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>361 Mass. 714, 715 (1972). See <em>Baudanza </em>v. <em>Comcast of Mass. I, Inc., supra </em>at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Here, the judge stated that although the $130,000 awarded by the jury in lost wages was less than the amount calculated by Fernandes, it was not unreasonable. Further, he continued, the award was not \u201cunduly slim\u201d so as to signal the existence of other defects in the jury\u2019s work that would necessitate a new trial on damages. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>379 Mass, at 785. Accordingly, based on a survey of the entire case, the judge denied Fernandes\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages or, alternatively, for an additur. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Fernandes relies on the testimony of Precourt to support his contention that the jury\u2019s award of damages was unreasonably low. However, Fernandes\u2019s characterization of that testimony does not match its substance. At trial, Precourt stated that, in 2009, she put together information as to how much money the AHA would save by laying off one worker. She determined that the value or cost of the employee to the AHA each year \u201cprobably would have totaled about $75,000.\u201d Contrary to Fernandes\u2019s understanding, this testimony was not exactly the same as saying that, as a consequence of being laid off, Fernandes lost wages and benefits totaling $75,000 per year. Moreover, Precourt\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence presented to the jury pertaining to the issue of damages. Also admitted in evidence were payroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>documents setting forth Fernandes\u2019s wages over several years. As reflected on the pay stub for the period ending May 3, 2009, Fernandes\u2019s gross weekly pay was $966.76. The jury could have determined that this amount would equate to approximately $50,271.52 per year, or $4,189.29 per month. If the jury had multiplied that sum by thirty-one months, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>the total would have been $129,867.99 in lost wages and benefits, which is very close to the $130,000 in damages awarded by the jury for the AHA\u2019s retaliatory conduct. The judge properly denied Fernandes\u2019s motion for a new trial on damages or, in the alternative, for an additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">5. <em>Appellate attorney\u2019s fees. </em>In his reply brief, Fernandes has requested reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 150, states that an aggrieved employee who prevails in an action alleging violations of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 or 148A, \u201cshall be awarded ... the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The judge below awarded Fernandes such fees and costs in connection with the proceedings before the Superior Court. We now conclude that Fernandes is statutorily entitled to recover reasonable appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs with respect to the claims on which he prevailed. See <em>Yorke Mgt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 19 (1989). He is directed to file with the clerk of this court materials detailing and supporting his request for such fees and costs within fourteen days of the issuance of the rescript in this case. See <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9,10 (2004). The AHA will be afforded fourteen days to respond, and the court will then enter an appropriate order. See <em>id. </em>at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The remaining count of David Fernandes\u2019s complaint (count two) alleged that his termination violated his procedural rights under G.

Following the jury\u2019s verdict, Fernandes voluntarily withdrew count two of his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">In accordance with the provisions of G.
