See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P. The board appealed, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court to this court. We conclude that art. 134, although general in scope, assimilates the elements of underlying offenses and that under the circumstances here, where the plaintiff was convicted on specifications detailing \u201clike violation\u201d offenses, the art. 134 conviction is a sex offense under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>and reinstate the board\u2019s classification of the plaintiff as a level two sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">1. <em>Factual background and procedural history. </em>We summarize the facts found by hearing examiners after evidentiary hearings, supplemented by undisputed facts from the record. The plaintiff was convicted by general court martial of the following three specifications in violation of art. 134: (1) \u201cDid . . . knowingly transport or ship in interstate commerce visual depictions of one or more minors, under the age of [eighteen] years, engaging in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1)]\u201d; (2) \u201cDid . . . knowingly receive visual depictions of one or more minors, under the age of [eighteen] years, engaged in sexually explicit conduct, which depictions had been shipped or transported in interstate commerce, in violation of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2)]\u201d; and (3) \u201cDid .. . knowingly transport in interstate commerce for purposes of sale or distribution, obscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy pictures or images of his penis, in violation of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465].\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The charge was brought in 1999 after a \u201csting\u201d operation in which the plaintiff, then a captain of the United States Air Force serving in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, sent lewd comments and images depicting child nudity and children in sexually suggestive poses to a Keene, New Hampshire, police officer. The police officer was posing as a fourteen year old male in an Internet chat room. The plaintiff pleaded guilty to the art. 134 charge and to each of the underlying specifications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff was sentenced to confinement for thirty months without pay or benefits and thereafter dismissed from military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">After the plaintiff\u2019s release from confinement in 2000 or 2001,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he moved to Massachusetts. In 2002, the board notified the plaintiff of his duty to register as a level two sex offender. Following the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and an evidentiary hearing before a hearing examiner, the board upheld the classification. The examiner determined that the specifications underlying the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tiff\u2019s art. 134 conviction were each a \u201clike violation\u201d to sex offenses under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C \u2014 specifically, dissemination of child pornography, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29B; and possession of child pornography, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29C.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The examiner further concluded that the plaintiff poses a moderate risk to reoffend and a moderate degree of dangerousness. The plaintiff did not appeal the hearing examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In July, 2009, the board sought reclassification of the plaintiff\u2019s status from level two to level three based on his arrest in April, 2009, for failure to register, enticing a child under the age of sixteen, and disseminating matter harmful to a child. A new hearing examiner, in 2010, also concluded that the specifications underlying the plaintiff\u2019s art. 134 conviction were each a \u201clike violation\u201d to Massachusetts sex offenses and further concluded that the plaintiff poses a high risk to reoffend and a high level of dangerousness and classified him as a level three sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The plaintiff appealed the 2010 decision, and a Superior Court judge reversed, ordering the plaintiff\u2019s release from the obligation to register as a sex offender. The judge determined that the board lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff, reasoning that the plaintiff\u2019s conviction under art. 134, a \u201cnon-specific\u201d provision of the code, is not a \u201clike violation\u201d to a Massachusetts sex offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his analysis, the judge also noted that \u201c[mjilitary defendants in courts-martial are not provided the same constitutional protections as defendants in civilian criminal courts\u201d and that requiring the plaintiff to register as a sex offender would be \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d where he was convicted only under a \u201cnon-specific\u201d provision of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The board filed a motion to reconsider, which the judge denied without a hearing, and then appealed both the judgment and the denial of the motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>argues that the hearing examiners properly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s military conviction is a \u201clike violation\u201d sex offense under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, and seeks reinstatement of the board\u2019s 2002 classification of the plaintiff as a level two sex offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>Judicial review of a board decision is governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and is \u201cconfined to the record, except that in cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, testimony thereon may be taken in the court.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (5). See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178M. A reviewing court will not disturb the board\u2019s decision unless that decision was (a) in violation of constitutional provisions; (b) in excess of the board\u2019s authority; (c) based on an error of law; (d) made on unlawful procedure; (e) unsupported by substantial evidence; (f) unwarranted by facts found by the judge, where the judge is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact; or (g) arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 68549 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>470 Mass. 102, 108-109 (2014). In conducting our review, we \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the board. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">b. <em>\u201cLike violation\u201d analysis. </em>The board argues that the judge erred in concluding that the plaintiff is not a sex offender as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, and is not subject to the board\u2019s jurisdiction. The judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s conviction under art. 134, a \u201cnon-specific\u201d provision of the code, could not be a like violation under the elements-based test required by <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 151564 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 612, 615 (2010) <em>(Doe No. 151564).</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>explained below, we conclude that the judge\u2019s ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We begin our analysis with the statutory definition of a sex offender. \u201cA sex offender is defined as a person who has been convicted of any violation of Massachusetts law enumerated as a sex offense in the sex offender registry law, as well as any \u2018like violation of the laws of [a military authority].\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 615, quoting G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. This definition reflects a decision by the Legislature in 1999 to expand the \u201csex offender\u201d definition to include not only the enumerated sex offenses under Massachusetts law and \u201ca like violation of the law of another state,\u201d but also \u201ca like violation of . . . the United States or a military, territorial or Indian tribal authority.\u201d Compare G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, as amended by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 2, with G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, inserted by St. 1996, c. 239, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We first had the opportunity to interpret the undefined term \u201clike violation\u201d in <em>Doe No. 151564, </em>where we adopted an elements-based approach. We determined that the applicable test is whether the \u201celements [of the foreign conviction] are the same or nearly the same as an offense requiring registration in Massachusetts\u201d and explicitly rejected the board\u2019s argument that it could consider the conduct underlying a conviction in the \u201clike violation\u201d analysis. <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 615, 618. Our concern was that offenders have sufficient \u201cnotice and clarity about whether registration is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"A9l\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s argument that he is not a sex offender flows from our holding in <em>Doe No. 151564, supra, </em>requiring congruity between the elements of a sex offense in violation of the laws of another jurisdiction and a Massachusetts sex offense. To support this argument, the plaintiff seizes on the fortuitous absence of a provision in the code criminalizing the nonviolent sex offenses<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> underlying the art. 134 charge. This argument is facially plausible because art. 134 itself is a general article and has no corollary to a Massachusetts sex offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a consequence, the plaintiff argues, the specifications setting forth the particular provisions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of Federal criminal law underlying the art. 134 charge may not be considered under the elements-based test in <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 615. The board argues that the plaintiff\u2019s guilty plea to the general provision of art. 134 incorporates the underlying specifications and elements of the Federal offenses stated therein, which in turn are like violations of Massachusetts law. Resolution of the issue requires us to examine relevant provisions of the code for guidance in discerning the proper status of specifications. As explained below, we are persuaded that the board\u2019s argument is more consistent with the treatment of convictions for nonviolent sex offenses under military law. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>66 M.J. 21, 22 (C.A.A.F. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">First, the specifications are part and parcel of the art. 134 charge against the plaintiff. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, a court martial for a violation of art. 134 does not rest solely on the general terms of the article. \u201cIn military justice, a charge consists of two parts: the \u2018charge\u2019 \u2014 typically, a statement of the article alleged to have been violated \u2014 and the \u2018specification\u2019 \u2014 the more detailed description of the conduct allegedly violative of the article.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fosler, </em>70 M.J. 225, 227 n.2 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Particularly for art. 134, which allows for pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ecution of a broad range of conduct,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the general language of the charge \u201cis made specific through the language of a given specification.\u201d <em>Fosler, supra </em>at 229, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>68 M.J. 465, 472 (C.A.A.F. 2010). Because a prosecution may be initiated under art. 134 where the code does not contain a provision criminalizing the conduct at issue, the specifications also are essential in providing notice of the charge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, given the status of specifications in the scheme of military prosecutions under art. 134, the hearing examiners properly considered those specifications in determining whether the plaintiff is a sex offender under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Second, elements of any Federal offenses underlying an art. 134 charge become part of the charge when they are described in specifications detailing a violation for \u201ccrimes and offenses not capital\u201d under clause three of art. 134. <em>Medina, supra </em>at 25 (\u201cA clause 3 offense, of course, incorporates the elements of the federal offense in question\u201d). This rule applies here where the specifications demonstrate that the plaintiff was charged under art. 134\u2019s clause three, crimes and offenses noncapital. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vines, </em>57 M.J. 519, 527 (C.A.A.F. 2002) (\u201cTypically, a specification drawn under clause 3 will allege facts essential to prove the charged offense, and a citation to the federal statute in question\u201d). Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s conviction under art. 134 incorporates the elements of the underlying Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>offenses described in its specifications.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Medina, supra. </em>For this reason, we conclude that the judge erred in his determination that the board lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s art. 134 conviction is a \u201clike violation\u201d because it incorporates elements of Federal offenses that were \u201cthe same or nearly the same as an offense requiring registration in Massachusetts.\u201d <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Last, we deal briefly with the plaintiff\u2019s argument that <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, 529 </em>F.3d 1260 (10th Cir. 2008), precludes consideration of the underlying specifications. It does not. In <em>Brown, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit declined to consider the Federal offense described in a specification underlying an art. 134 conviction as a \u201cconviction\u201d triggering sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) (2006). <em>Id. </em>at 1261, 1263. The underlying specification described distributing child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 (2006). <em>Id. </em>at 1262. The plain language of the sentencing enhancement provision identified certain applicable convictions that could serve as sentencing enhancers, and art. 134 was not included; therefore, the court concluded that an art. 134 conviction could not be a sentencing enhancer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The question posed to the court in the <em>Brown </em>case is substantially different from the one posed here. The sentencing enhancement provision required that the petitioner be \u201cconvicted\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>certain applicable offenses. <em>Id. </em>The question on review in this case, however, asks only whether the elements of the crime or crimes underlying the conviction are sufficiently similar to the elements of a Massachusetts sex offense. See <em>Doe No. 151564, supra </em>at 615. The court in <em>Brown </em>noted that \u201cthe military court assimilated the elements of the crime from [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2252 \u2014 a federal child pornography statute\u201d \u2014 into art. 134, but such assimilation did not create a conviction of the underlying offense. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 1263. Accordingly, <em>Brown </em>does not detract from our determination that the elements of a Federal offense underlying an art. 134 conviction may be considered in the \u201clike violation\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the specifications are integral to an art. 134 charge and the elements of the underlying offenses are assimilated into the art. 134 charge, we conclude that the judge erred in ruling that the plaintiff is not a sex offender subject to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for reinstatement of the plaintiff\u2019s level two classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The plaintiff also pleaded guilty to a charge under art. 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (code), concerning \u201cconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933 (1994). The Sex Offender Registry Board (board) only argues that the art. 134 conviction triggers sex offender registration, and therefore the art. 133 charge is not discussed in this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Although the board asserted that the plaintiff was released from custody in 2001, as a matter of convenience the hearing examiners accepted the plaintiff\u2019s version of events that he was on parole from 2000 to 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The hearing examiner also determined that the specifications underlying the plaintiff\u2019s art. 134 conviction were a \u201clike violation\u201d to dissemination or possession of obscene matter, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29. Because this is not an enumerated sex offense under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C, we do not consider it. See note 14, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The issue whether the plaintiff\u2019s conviction is a \u201clike violation\u201d to Massachusetts sex offenses was resolved in 2002 by the hearing examiner, and was not appealed by the plaintiff. Although judicial review of an agency\u2019s action is subject to a thirty-day filing limitation, we consider the merits of the question because the hearing examiner in 2010, on a request for reclassification filed by the board, reanalyzed the issue and incorporated the 2002 decision. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s arrest in May, 2009, did not result in a conviction, and after the hearing examiner\u2019s reclassification in 2010, the Appeals Court determined that reclassification without a conviction exceeds the board\u2019s statutory authority. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 16748 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 162 (2012). The board therefore seeks the reinstatement of the level two classification instead of the level three classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The Superior Court judge also considered constitutional differences between military and civilian proceedings in analyzing whether an art. 134 conviction could be a \u201clike violation\u201d to a Massachusetts sex offense. We do not consider any such differences to be material to the \u201clike violation\u201d analysis. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of art. 134. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 757-758 (1974). The Court also has noted that Congress had the power under Federal laws to make sex offender registration a consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>of a military conviction. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kebodeaux, </em>133 S. Ct. 2496, 2503 (2013). The Legislature explicitly included convictions under military authority in the pool of offenses subject to sex offender registration. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. Accordingly, we discern no constitutional infirmities in the analysis of an art. 134 conviction as a \u201clike violation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The Massachusetts sex offender registry scheme was first enacted in 1996 in response to the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1994 to establish guidelines for State sex offender registration.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 29B (dissemination of child pornography), and \u00a7 29C (purchase or possession of child pornography), which we assume to be congruent with the Federal statutes under which the plaintiff was charged, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(1), 2252(a)(2). The plaintiff does not argue that the elements of the stated Federal offenses are not themselves \u201cthe same or nearly the same\u201d as the elements of Massachusetts sex offenses, and accordingly we assume without deciding that the above is correct. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (b), as appearing in 411 Mass. 1602 (1992). In the 2010 decision, the hearing examiner also determined that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465 was \u201crespectively equivalent to the Massachusetts sex offense[ ] of . . . G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29\u201d; however, we do not assume that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465 is a \u201clike violation\u201d because G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 29, is not an enumerated Massachusetts sex offense under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The sentencing enhancement provision included military offenses under art. 120 but excluded art. 134. The court determined that this was not irrational because \u201cCongress could have quite rationally desired that soldiers convicted in a court martial for [violent sexual acts under art. 120] be punished more severely for later offenses\u201d and because Congress has been expanding the list of permissible enhancers by increasing the sexual offenses punishable under art. 120, which were previously only punishable under art. 134. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>529 F.3d 1260, 1266 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
