At trial, the defendant\u2019s attorney in opening statement conceded that the defendant committed the killing, and told the Superior Court jury that the issue they had to decide was whether the defendant was guilty of manslaughter or murder. The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the second degree and of possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>firearm without a license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed his convictions, and we granted direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The defendant claims that his attorney\u2019s concession at trial that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter was tantamount to a guilty plea, and that a colloquy between the judge and the defendant was therefore constitutionally required to ascertain that the defendant made the concession knowingly and voluntarily. The defendant contends that, because such a colloquy did not take place, he was deprived of due process and the right against self-incrimination, and he asks that we vacate his convictions and remand for a new trial. We conclude that, in these circumstances, no colloquy between the judge and the defendant is required. We note that the defendant in this case expressly did <em>not </em>claim ineffective assistance of counsel and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the defendant did not consent to his attorney\u2019s strategic concession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence at trial. On December 31, 2006, the defendant (who was then twenty years old) and his former girl friend, Shantel Baxter, drove his cousin into Boston to drop him off at the South Station bus terminal. At around 3:30 p.m., the defendant double-parked his vehicle on Atlantic Avenue, and Baxter stayed with the vehicle while the defendant walked with his cousin into the bus terminal. At approximately 4:04 p.m., as the defendant was about to leave the bus terminal, the victim entered the terminal with his brother, Patrick Fortuna,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and his girl friend\u2019s cousin, Robertho Francois, and confronted the defendant, getting \u201c[rjight in his face.\u201d The defendant \u201ctr[led] to walk away\u201d in the direction of his vehicle, but the victim and Patrick followed him. As they approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the victim pulled the defendant up against an adjacent vehicle, grabbed the defendant by the neck, said that the defendant owed him money, and was \u201ckneeing\u201d the defendant and \u201ccalling [him] a pussy\u201d and \u201ca bitch-ass nigger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Baxter came out of the defendant\u2019s car, physically \u201ctrying to get between them\u201d and \u201cbegging [the victim] to stop,\u201d but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>victim swung his elbow at her and \u201ctold [her] to get the fuck off of him.\u201d The victim \u201cjust kept squeezing [the defendant\u2019s] neck,\u201d \u201ckicking him,\u201d \u201cspitting on him,\u201d and \u201cyelling in his face.\u201d After the victim yelled that he needed the defendant\u2019s telephone number, Baxter provided the number to Patrick in an effort to get the victim to stop. Then, Patrick said to the victim, \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Shortly afterwards, the victim and Patrick, along with Francois (who had been watching from a short distance), walked away from the defendant towards the bus terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The defendant and Baxter got back into the defendant\u2019s vehicle. As they sat there, the defendant told Baxter (who was in the passenger\u2019s seat) to \u201cmove the car,\u201d and a short time later,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he left the vehicle and headed back towards the bus terminal. When Baxter got into the driver\u2019s seat, she noticed that the \u201csecret compartment\u201d installed in the vehicle\u2019s dashboard (which moments earlier had been shut) was now open.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The victim, Patrick, and Francois \u201cwere walking back toward the bus station\u201d when the victim \u201ctum[ed] his head back,\u201d and suddenly started to run, as did Patrick and Francois. Gunshots were fired. Patrick ran in a different direction from that of the victim and Francois, and the victim later turned right on South Street while Francois turned left. At that point, Francois \u201ctum[ed] around\u201d and saw the \u201csame man\u201d that the victim had assaulted follow the victim down South Street. The defendant caught up with the victim and shot him three times: once in the arm, once in the back, and once in the head. The victim fell to the ground, and the defendant fled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At approximately 4:24 p.m., a Boston police officer arrived at the scene, and determined that the victim did not have a pulse. The victim was pronounced dead at 4:45 p.m., and the cause of death was identified as gunshot wounds to the head and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">At trial, defense counsel in his opening statement conceded that the defendant had committed the killing but stated that the evidence would show that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>not murder in the first or second degree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">\u201c[The defendant] no doubt did a terrible thing and no doubt he\u2019s guilty of very serious crimes. But the issue here is going to be did he act in a heat of passion, did he have the ability to reason, to think about what he was going to do, to premeditate, which is what\u2019s required for first degree murder ... or did he act out of a rage that he and any reasonable person would have felt treated the way he was treated, assaulted and humiliated . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Defense counsel continued to pursue this strategy in his closing argument, noting that \u201cour law recognizes that there are times when a person can be so provoked by what . . . somebody else does to them, that even if they commit a terrible act of killing that person, . . . they don\u2019t have the malice required for murder.\u201d He argued that \u201c[t]he evidence in this case... shows very clearly that [the defendant] acted out of heat of passion,\u201d and therefore should be found guilty of manslaughter, not murder. The jury did not find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, as argued by the prosecutor, but did find the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant asserts that, where defense counsel concedes the defendant\u2019s guilt in opening statement, due process \u201crequires an intelligent and voluntary waiver by the defendant in a non-capital case,\u201d \u201c[n]o less than in the case of a guilty plea, or an admission to sufficient facts, or a stipulation of facts in a trial, or a waiver of jury trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Before we address this claim, it is important to be clear as to what the defendant is <em>not </em>claiming on appeal. Specifically, the defendant is not claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He does not claim that his trial counsel did not discuss this strategic concession with him before opening statement, or that he did not consent to this course of action; the record is silent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>regarding his discussions with trial counsel on this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor does he claim that it was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d for trial counsel to have made this strategic choice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>459 Mass. 836, 843 (2011). He admits that his trial counsel \u201cperhaps even correctly believed\u201d that it served the defendant\u2019s interest to concede guilt to the lesser included offense of manslaughter to attempt to avert conviction on the murder indictment. Rather, he claims that the absence of a colloquy by the judge, standing alone, constitutes a violation of due process that requires that the defendant\u2019s convictions be vacated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Where a defendant tenders a guilty plea, the judge must engage the defendant in a colloquy before accepting the plea because \u201c[d]ue process requires that \u2018a guilty plea should not be accepted, and if accepted must be later set aside,\u2019 unless the contemporaneous record contains an affirmative showing that the defendant\u2019s plea was intelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 102 (1975). See <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-243 (1969). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 842-843 (1982) (if admission to facts sufficient to support finding of guilt \u201cis to be given the effect of a guilty plea, it must be supported by the same demonstrations of voluntariness and intelligence that are required of any other guilty plea\u201d). The reason for requiring a plea colloquy is that, by pleading guilty, the defendant waives three constitutional rights \u2014 the right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination \u2014 and \u201c[w]e cannot presume a waiver of these three important. . . rights from a silent record.\u201d <em>Boykin, supra </em>at 243. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 715-716 (1984) (\u201cBecause a plea of guilty involves these constitutional rights, the plea is valid only when the defendant offers it voluntarily, with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances,... and with the advice of competent counsel\u201d). See also Mass. R. Crim. P. 12 (c), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1511 (2004).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Where a defendant, instead of pleading guilty, agrees to try a case to a judge on stipulated evidence in an effort to preserve his or her right to appeal the judge\u2019s pretrial rulings, we also have required a colloquy to ensure that the defendant has knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lewis, 399 Mass. 761, 763-764 (1987) (reversing conviction for absence of colloquy where \u201cparties stipulated to what the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence would be\u201d and defendant offered no evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Castillo, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 36-38 (2006) (where defendant stipulated to material facts conclusive of guilt in case tried to judge, stipulation was tantamount to guilty plea, and failure of judge to engage defendant in plea colloquy required reversal of convictions). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 448-449 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 130, 132-133 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Where we have found a constitutional entitlement to a plea colloquy, a defendant has waived at least one of the three constitutional rights that are waived by a guilty plea. \u201cIt is axiomatic that, if the defendant does not plead guilty and does not waive these rights, the judge need not conduct a plea colloquy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>447 Mass. 625, 629 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>379 Mass. 772, 774-776 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Here, the defendant did not waive any constitutional right. He exercised his right to a trial by jury, confronted witnesses against him through cross-examination, exercised his privilege against self-incrimination by not testifying, and stipulated to no facts. \u201cUnlike the case of a guilty plea, the Commonwealth was put to its proof beyond a reasonable doubt and met it.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>379 Mass. at 774-776 (no colloquy was required where defense counsel offered to stipulate to prosecution\u2019s evidence in effort to preserve defendant\u2019s right to appeal pretrial rulings but trial judge refused to accept offer, and defense counsel instead offered no defense when prosecution\u2019s evidence was presented at jury-waived trial). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>466 Mass. 489, 491, 496 n.8 (2013) (case law requiring colloquy where defendant submits to jury-waived trial on stipulated facts did not apply where case was tried to jury and where defendant admitted in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>testimony that he possessed drugs and firearm \u201cas part of a litigation strategy to boost his credibility\u201d regarding his defense of necessity to firearms charge); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>456 Mass. 378, 383 (2010), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>398 Mass. 264, 269 (1986) (where defendant was indicted for possession with intent to distribute but defense counsel encouraged jury to convict on simple possession, defense counsel\u2019s concession that substances in defendant\u2019s possession were \u201cdrugs\u201d did not amount to tacit stipulation as to nature of substances, because \u201cdefendant\u2019s theory of his case cannot relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). Because defense counsel\u2019s concession did not constitute a waiver of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the trial judge was not constitutionally required to conduct a plea colloquy confirming that the defendant had waived his rights knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We recognize that, after a defendant\u2019s attorney concedes in opening statement that the defendant is guilty of manslaughter, there is virtually no chance that a jury would return a verdict of anything less than manslaughter. But that may also be true where a defendant testifies in his or her own defense and admits to the killing, or where a defendant calls a witness to testify to the victim\u2019s conduct that provoked the killing and the witness testifies that the defendant subsequently killed the victim. The purpose of a plea colloquy is to ensure that the waiver of certain fundamental constitutional rights is knowing and voluntary; it is not to ensure that the defense strategy is sound or that the defendant has consented to that strategy. Where a defense attorney\u2019s concession is manifestly unreasonable or where a defendant has not consented to that strategy, we have relied on posttrial claims of ineffective assistance of counsel as the remedy for a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>We also consider whether, under our supervisory authority, we should require trial judges to conduct a colloquy with the defendant before a defendant\u2019s attorney makes a concession of guilt at trial. We have exercised this supervisory authority to require that a colloquy be conducted where a defendant waives the right to a jury trial, even though it is not constitutionally required, because \u201ca supervisory rule requiring a colloquy would aid in \u2018sound judicial administration\u2019 by foreclosing many disputes about whether a waiver of the right to a jury trial was knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pavao, </em>423 Mass. 798, 800 (1996), quoting <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 509 (1979). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>376 Mass. <em>777, </em>784-785 (1978) (adopting \u201cprophylactic measure\u201d of requiring judge to conduct colloquy where defendant waives right to conflict-free counsel by agreeing to joint representation, even though colloquy is not constitutionally required).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We think it more prudent to leave the decision whether to conduct a colloquy regarding a concession of guilt to the sound discretion of the trial judge than to exercise our supervisory authority to require it in all instances. Strategic decisions to concede that a defendant is guilty of lesser included offenses are not uncommon, especially in drug cases, where a defendant may concede the possession of drugs to preserve the credibility of his claim that he or she did not intend to distribute. Nor is it uncommon for a defendant to admit guilt to an offense, such as possession of drugs, to preserve the credibility of the defendant\u2019s claim that he or she did not commit a more serious crime, such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>illegal possession of a firearm. As noted earlier, such concessions are not limited to a defense attorney\u2019s opening statement or closing argument; they may be made in a defendant\u2019s trial testimony, or by a defense witness that the defendant calls to the stand knowing that the witness will testify to the defendant\u2019s participation in one of the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Requiring a colloquy in all such cases would mean that the judge must be informed in advance of all such concessions, and conduct a colloquy that may invite discussion regarding the defendant\u2019s trial strategy. Such an inquiry may be warranted to determine \u201cwhether the defendant understands the significance of his apparent choice,\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>379 Mass, at 776, where (unlike here) there is some indication that the defendant expressly opposes his or her attorney\u2019s trial strategy, or the concession appears to be a manifestly unreasonable trial strategy. But because we can foresee instances where such a concession may not be known in advance (such as where a defendant admits to committing a lesser included offense during cross-examination) and other instances where a wise trial judge, when told of an anticipated concession, may decide that the more prudent course is to proceed without a colloquy, we decline to exercise our supervisory authority to impose a hard and fast rule that would require a colloquy whenever a concession of guilt is made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because no colloquy was required regarding defense counsel\u2019s concession of guilt to the lesser included offense of manslaughter in opening statement and closing argument, the defendant\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The defendant was found not guilty on indictments charging the possession of cocaine and of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Because the victim and his brother have the same last name, we shall refer to the brother by his first name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Baxter testified that she and the defendant sat in the car for \u201ca couple seconds\u201d or \u201ca couple minutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Baxter testified that she did not see anything inside the compartment.

We do not consider here whether it is manifestly unreasonable to pursue such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>strategy (regardless of its merits) without the defendant\u2019s consent, or whether prejudice should be presumed in such circumstances.
