David Cohen (father) and Shelley Cohen (mother). After the parties separated in 1999, a Los Angeles County Superior Court entered a judgment establishing monthly child and spousal support payments payable by the father to the mother. The father moved to Massachusetts in 2002. In 2004, the California support order was registered in the Probate and Family Court, upon request of the Los Angeles County Department of Child Services (California CSSD). Pursuant to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UEFSA), which has been adopted by both California and Massachusetts, Massachusetts courts thus acquired jurisdiction to enforce the support order. See Cal. Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4900,4950,4951 (West 2013); G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7\u00a7 6-601, 6-602. The child support division of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (DOR), acting on behalf of the mother, initiated contempt proceedings against the father in the Probate and Family Court, and a Probate and Family Court judge subsequently issued multiple orders that sought to enforce the California support order. The orders incorporated the parties\u2019 stipulated agreements, which, inter alla, obligated the father to pay the child\u2019s uninsured medical expenses and to contribute to her college education costs; neither of these items had been included in the order of the California court. In 2010, a Probate and Family Court judge found the father in contempt for having failed to make payments in the amounts agreed toward support arrears, to pay the agreed share of the child\u2019s college costs and her uninsured medical expenses, and to pay previously awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the mother in seeking enforcement. The father challenges the jurisdiction of the court to enter this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court was limited to enforcement of the California support order, and that the parties\u2019 stipulated agreements did not extend the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to modify the California support order. To the extent the Probate and Family Court orders modify the California support order, they are therefore void, and the court accordingly had no authority to enforce these orders or to find the father in contempt for failing to comply with them. The Probate and Family Court nonetheless retained jurisdiction to continue to enforce the California child support and spousal support order, at least until the father returned to live in California and California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>resumed enforcement. The Probate and Family Court judge therefore had authority to hold the father in contempt for failing to comply with orders that he pay the mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in connection with enforcement of the California order.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>1. <em>California proceedings. </em>The father and the mother lived in Los Angeles with their daughter. After a lengthy marriage, the parties separated in 1999, and a Los Angeles County Superior Court ordered the father to pay the mother monthly payments for child and spousal support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The father relocated to the Boston area in January, 2002, while the mother and child remained in California. Arrearages accumulated, and, in February, 2003, the California CSSD transmitted to the child support enforcement division of the DOR the first of two requests for registration of the California support order. This transmittal sought enforcement in Massachusetts through income withholding, pursuant to G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-602 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In June, 2003, a \u201cjudgment of dissolution of marriage\u201d entered in the Los Angeles County Superior Court that increased the father\u2019s monthly child support obligation to $1,035, and his spousal support to $600; the judgment also reserved jurisdiction over arrearages.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In March, 2004, on request of the California CSSD, the 2003 California support order was registered in the Probate and Family Court, giving the Massachusetts court authority to enforce the California support order. See G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7\u00a7 6-601 to 6-603. The child support enforcement transmittal document stated that registration was \u201cfor enforcement only\u201d and for \u201ccollection of arrears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">2. <em>Massachusetts proceedings. </em>On March 31, 2004, the DOR initiated contempt proceedings on behalf of the mother against the father in the Probate and Family Court. Each represented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>counsel, the parties reached an agreement and, in June, 2005, a Probate and Family Court judge issued a stipulated order reflecting that agreement. The stipulated order required the father to make a lump sum payment and further weekly payments to reduce all spousal and child support arrears; to pay one-third of the child\u2019s college costs; and to pay the mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The stipulation included the father\u2019s \u201cacknowledge[ment] that he is earning less than he is capable [of] and will forthwith commence a job search to obtain employment commensurate with his education and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In October, 2006, the mother filed another complaint for contempt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In December, 2006, the father was found in contempt for, among other things, his failure to pay his agreed contribution to the child\u2019s college expenses and uninsured medical expenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Another order issued in May, 2007, incorporating a four-page written stipulation of the parties. In that stipulation, the father agreed that he was guilty of contempt for having failed to pay \u201cchild support.\u201d The order required, among other things, that the father \u201ccontinue to pay $150 per week toward the child support arrears,\u201d and that he reimburse the mother for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, \u201cincluding travel incurred as a result of the hearing\u201d that day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The written stipulation provided that the father would \u201cfocus his efforts on his new employment,\u201d and resign from involvement in all but one specific nonprofit organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>In February, 2009, the DOR informed the father that the California CSSD had requested that the DOR close its case against him, because the California CSSD was then garnishing the father\u2019s Social Security payments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In June, 2009, the mother filed another complaint for contempt. Nothing in the record suggests that, prior to the filing of the mother\u2019s complaint in 2009, the Probate and Family Court was notified of the request by the California CSSD to DOR, or asked by any party, agency, or California court to cease enforcement efforts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A Probate and Family Court judge found the father in contempt for failure to pay $26,940.60 in child support, $54,432 in spousal support, $24,000 towards the child\u2019s college education, the child\u2019s uninsured medical expenses in the amount of $26,230, and the mother\u2019s legal fees and costs incurred in connection with prior and then-pending enforcement proceedings. A judgment of contempt entered on September 22, 2010, dated May 26, 2010,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> established a schedule of monthly payments to be made toward these arrears. In August, 2010, the father sought relief from that judgment pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4), 365 Mass. 828 (1974).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>was denied later that month. The father appealed. In December, 2010, the father returned to California. In June, 2013, the Appeals Court vacated the denial of the father\u2019s motion for relief in a memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 1136 (2013). We granted the father\u2019s application for further appellate review, limited to the issue concerning the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to enforce the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We note as a preliminary matter that the father did not challenge the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court concerning the support orders, nor its authority to hold him in contempt for violation of those orders, prior to this appeal. Nonetheless, \u201ca party has the right to raise subject matter jurisdiction at any time.\u201d <em>ROPT, Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 607 (2000). A claim that a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. See <em>Harker </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>390 Mass. 555, 559 (1983), quoting <em>Litton Business Sys. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981) (\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent, conduct or waiver\u201d); Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">1. <em>Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. </em>\u201cUIFSA aims to cure the problem of conflicting support orders entered by multiple courts, and provides for the exercise of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction by one tribunal over support orders.\u201d <em>Child Support Enforcement Div. of Alaska </em>v. <em>Brenckle, </em>424 Mass. 214, 218 (1997) <em>(Brenckle). </em>UIFSA establishes continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the State issuing a support order, so as to ensure that the issuing State is the only State with jurisdiction to modify its order absent specified, narrow circumstances. G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-611 <em>(a) </em>(l)-(2). Every State appears to have adopted some version of UIFSA. See Annot., Construction and Application of Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 90 A.L.R. 5th 1 (2001). Cf. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(f) (2012) (requiring States to adopt UIFSA in order to access Federal funding for child support enforcement).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">\u201cUnder UIFSA, once one court enters a support order, no other court may modify that order for as long as the obligee, obligor, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>child for whose benefit the order is entered continues to reside within the jurisdiction of that court unless each party consents in writing to another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Brenckle, supra </em>at 218. See G. L.c. 209D, \u00a7\u00a7 2-205 (a),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 6-611 (a) (l)-(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>\u201c See also <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>450 Mass. 676, 679 (2008); <em>Peddar </em>v. <em>Peddar, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 194-195 (1997); C.P. Kindregan, M. McBrien, &amp; P.A. Kindregan, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 30.6, at 255 (4th ed. 2013). The written consent must be filed in the issuing tribunal. G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-611 <em>(a) </em>(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Here, California issued the original support order. The mother and child remained residents of California throughout the Massachusetts proceedings, and there is no indication that the parents filed with the California court their written consent to grant a Massachusetts court authority to modify the order issued by the California court. In these circumstances, California remains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>State of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and accordingly is the only State with jurisdiction to modify its support order. See <em>Klingel </em>v. <em>Reill, </em>446 Mass. 80, 84 (2006), citing G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 2-205 <em>(c) </em>(responding tribunal can modify support order only if issuing State \u201chas, for some reason, lost its exclusive jurisdiction\u201d); C.P. Kindregan &amp; P.A. Kindregan, Massachusetts Domestic Relations Rules and Statutes Annot. \u00a7 7.6(11), Comment to G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-611 (2014) (discussing \u201cUIFSA philosophy that no other [Sjtate should modify an order of another [Sjtate which has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">a. <em>Enforcement of California\u2019s order. </em>To enforce judgments against a party who has moved from an issuing State that has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to a second State, an issuing State may register an order for enforcement in the second State. See G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-601. Once such an order is registered in the Probate and Family Court, that court becomes the \u201cresponding tribunal,\u201d and is \u201climited to recognizing and enforcing the order of the other [Sjtate [because] under UIFSA[,J conceptually, the responding [Sjtate is enforcing the law of another [Sjtate\u201d (quotations and citation omitted). C.P. Kindregan &amp; P.A. Kindregan, Massachusetts Domestic Relations Rules and Statutes Annot. \u00a7 7.6(3), Comment to G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-603 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Thus, although the Probate and Family Court did not have jurisdiction to modify the California court\u2019s support order, it did retain jurisdiction to enforce that order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> California\u2019s support order was registered for enforcement in the Commonwealth when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the California CSSD transmitted a request to the DOR that was then entered on the Probate and Family Court docket. The transmittal specified that the Probate and Family Court could exercise jurisdiction over the California court\u2019s order \u201cfor enforcement only.\u201d See G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 6-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">b. <em>Modification of California\u2019s order. </em>The judgment entered on September 22, 2010, dated May 26, 2010, held the father in contempt for his failure to comply with earlier orders and judgments that had entered in the Probate and Family Court beginning in 2009. The father contends that portions of the orders constituted modifications of the California order, and that the Probate and Family Court did not have jurisdiction to modify the California support order. UIFSA does not define \u201cmodification,\u201d but, \u201cwhere UIFSA is silent, the [Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738B (2012),] may help fill any gaps.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>10 N.Y.3d 60, 66 (2008). Section 1738B(b) of that statute defines modification as \u201ca change in a child support order that affects the amount, scope, or duration of the order and modifies, replaces, supersedes, or otherwise is made subsequent to the child support order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In this case, the California support order provided that the father\u2019s child support obligations would end essentially when the child completed twelfth grade or attained the age of nineteen,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and was silent on the issue of the costs of the child\u2019s college education and her uninsured medical expenses. The California Legislature, however, has expressly limited child support to minor children, or through the completion of high school for a child under age nineteen who is residing with a parent and attending school full-time.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Probate and Family Court judgment of contempt appears to have required the father to continue to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>child support beyond the child\u2019s attaining the age of nineteen, thereby affecting the duration of child support. The judgment also required the father to pay $24,000 toward the child\u2019s college education costs and $26,230 toward the child\u2019s uninsured medical expenses; these obligations constitute modifications of the California court\u2019s support order because they affected the amount, scope, and duration of support and were made subsequent to the order. These impermissible modifications of the California order exceeded the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">c. <em>Effect of impermissible modification. </em>As stated, prior to this appeal, the father had not challenged the jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court to issue such orders, nor its authority to hold him in contempt for violation of those orders. Nonetheless, \u201c[wjhere a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the judgment is void and time limitations for raising the issue are inapplicable.\u201d <em>ROPT, Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. at 605. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Rule 60 (b) \u201cstrikes a balance between serving the ends of justice and preserving the finality of judgments,\u201d and \u201cmay not be used as a substitute for a timely appeal\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. 392, 395 (1987). See <em>Harker </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>390 Mass. at 558 (\u201cIf we were to permit such an attack as a general rule, the finality of judgments would be substantially impaired\u201d). Therefore, \u201cwhen a court has rendered final judgment in a contested action, a party may not litigate that court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction except in certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Matter of Dugan, </em>418 Mass. 185, 186 (1994). One such circumstance is when \u201c[ajllowing the judgment to stand would substantially infringe the authority of another tribunal or agency of government.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Permitting enforcement of those portions of the Probate and Family Court\u2019s orders that modify the California order not only would infringe on the authority of the California courts, which have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, but also would upset a carefully constructed uniform set of laws adopted in all fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>States. See <em>Scanlon </em>v. <em>Witrak, </em>110 Wash. App. 682, 686 (2002) (allowing rule 60 [b] motion where Georgia had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under UIFSA and Washington State court had modified Georgia child support order). Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Mitchell, </em>181 Ill. 2d 169, 174-176 (1998) (erroneous order that expressed child support payments as percentage of income was in violation of statute, but was voidable, not void, in part because it was purely State matter and did not \u201cimplicate the authority of another tribunal\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Because the Probate and Family Court had no jurisdiction to modify the California support order, the portions of the orders that required the father to pay child support for a period beyond that established by the California court, part of the child\u2019s college education costs, and the child\u2019s uninsured medical expenses were void. The father, therefore, could not be found in contempt for violating the void portions of those orders. Cf. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>340 S.W.3d 483, 501, 503-504 (Tex. App. 2011) (when reviewing collateral attack, court will limit \u201creview to determining whether the record affirmatively and conclusively negates existence of jurisdiction\u201d to modify support order of State that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction, and will not consider \u201cwhether court otherwise erred in rendering its judgment\u201d). The judgment of contempt is enforceable insofar as it concerns portions of the orders that enforced the terms of the California support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">2. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees and costs. </em>The father also was adjudged in contempt for his failure to pay attorney\u2019s fees of $6,930 that had been awarded to the mother, and costs of $2,370 that had been incurred in connection with the mother\u2019s travel to Massachusetts to attend court proceedings. The father apparently has not paid these fees and costs. The judgment also ordered the father to pay additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the mother in pursuing the 2009 complaint for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Under UIFSA, the responding tribunal may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs against an obligor if \u201can obligee prevails.\u201d See G. L. c. 209D, \u00a7 3-313 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cf. <em>Arnell </em>v. <em>Arnell, </em>416 S.W.3d 188, 201 (Tex. App. 2013) (affirming award of attorney\u2019s fees to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>obligee under UIFSA where court registered and enforced foreign judgment). The imposition of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of the California order, and part of the enforcement power of the Probate and Family Court as the responding tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The father does not argue that the Probate and Family Court lacked jurisdiction to award attorney\u2019s fees, but only that the Court erred in awarding fees in this case. The father contends, without record support and, indeed, without pointing to any purportedly improper fee, that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded were incurred in connection with improper efforts to modify the California support order. We analyze this claim pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (6), which permits granting relief from a judgment for \u201cany other reason justifying relief.\u201d Relief under this provision is available only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Sahin </em>v. <em>Sahin, </em>435 Mass. 396,406 (2001). Because the Probate and Family Court\u2019s enforcement powers under UIFSA include the authority to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and because the father has not included in the record anything that indicates how the judge arrived at the fee award, the components of that award, or that any portion of the fee award pertains to fees incurred in conjunction with efforts directed toward the impermissible modifications, the father has not established the extraordinary circumstances that would justify such relief.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of contempt is vacated. The matter is remanded for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion, holding the father in contempt and obligating payment only for his failure to comply with such portions of the Probate and Family Court\u2019s orders that enforced the California child and spousal support order, and the fees and costs associated with such enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The order obligated M. David Cohen (father) to pay monthly to Shelley Cohen (mother) $178 in child support, $280 for the child\u2019s special education therapy, and $477 in spousal support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The record does not indicate whether the father\u2019s wages were attached. The record on appeal includes a copy of an \u201caudit\u201d created by the Los Angeles County Department of Child Services (California CSSD), setting forth the monthly support obligation and the amounts paid toward that obligation. This document reflects that no payments for child support or spousal support were made for the period from February, 2001, through July, 2004, and that payments were made only sporadically prior to and after that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The record does not indicate the method used to determine the amount in arrears, but the amount appears to include arrears accumulated after the father relocated to Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">According to the Probate and Family Court docket sheet, the mother also had filed a complaint for contempt in September, 2005; the parties entered into stipulations on that complaint in November and December, 2005; and a judgment of contempt entered in April, 2006. Copies of these documents are not included in the record submitted by the father, and the mother neither submitted a brief nor appeared at argument before us. The Probate and Family Court judge\u2019s decisions, however, provide detail concerning the facts at issue, including the judge\u2019s findings on the amounts of arrears and the father\u2019s ability to make the stipulated payments to reduce those arrears.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The December, 2006, order finds the father in contempt for having failed to pay $26,230 for the child\u2019s medical expenses incurred in 2006. While the record does not include an order requiring the father to pay health care costs, in a memorandum in support of the father\u2019s motion for relief from judgment, the father\u2019s attorney states that \u201chealthcare costs were added to the agreement by stipulation of the parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The costs were $1,750. The amount of attorney\u2019s fees was to be established at a later hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In a February, 2009, letter to the father, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (DOR) stated that it had \u201cend-dated [his] support obligation\u201d and \u201cpurged [his] arrears balance.\u201d The letter noted, \u201cFor as long as you live in the Commonwealth, there is always the possibility that we may become involved in your CCS case in the future.\u201d In a September, 2009, letter responding to an inquiry from the father, the DOR explained that, although it had closed the father\u2019s child support case, \u201c[a]ny and all existing court orders remained in place ....
