The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has certified the following questions to this court, pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">\u201c1. Are Springfield\u2019s municipal ordinances Chapter 285, Article II, \u2018Vacant or Foreclosing Residential Property\u2019 (the [f]oreclosure [ordinance) or Chapter 182, Article I, \u2018Mediation of Foreclosures of Owner-Occupied Residential Properties\u2019 (the [m]ediation [ordinance) preempted, in part or in whole, by those state laws and regulations identified by the plaintiffs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">\u201c2.

Bank </em>v. <em>Springfield, 736 </em>F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">We answer the first question that the mediation ordinance is preempted by G. L. c. 244 and that the foreclosure ordinance is preempted by G. L. c. 21E and G. L. c. Ill but not by G. L. c. 244. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We answer the second question in the negative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">1. <em>Procedural background. </em>We summarize certain undisputed facts in the order of certification and in the record before us. In 2011, in response to an increased number of foreclosures due to the housing market collapse of 2008 and its effect on public safety, the city enacted two ordinances addressing properties left vacant during or after the foreclosure process. The plaintiffs, six banks holding mortgage notes on properties in Springfield, filed suit in State court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of the ordinances. The defendant city removed the case to Federal court. The Federal District Court allowed the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. That court determined that the outcome of the case centered on unresolved questions of Massachusetts law better suited for this Court. We now consider the questions presented to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">2. <em>Springfield ordinances. </em>The two ordinances deal specifically with the foreclosure process. The mediation ordinance is entitled \u201cFacilitating Mediation of Mortgage Foreclosures of Owner Occupied Residential Properties\u201d and is codified in Chapter 7.60 of Title 7 of the Revised Ordinances of the city of Springfield, 1986, as amended (city ordinances). The foreclosure ordinance is entitled \u201cRegulating the Maintenance of Vacant and/or Foreclosing Residential Properties and Foreclosures of Owner Occupied Residential Properties\u201d and is codified in Chapter 7.50 of Title 7 of the city ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">a. <em>Mediation ordinance. </em>The mediation ordinance establishes a program requiring mandatory mediation between mortgagors and mortgagees. The ordinance requires that, upon giving notice of a default and the statutory right of redemption to the mortgagor, mediation must begin within forty-five days. The mediation consists of a conference between the mortgagor and mortgagee in which the parties must make a good faith effort to renegotiate the terms of the mortgage that was the subject of the notice or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>wise to resolve the pending foreclosure. If, after a mediation conference, the city-provided mediation program manager determines that the mortgagee has made a good faith effort to mediate but that the parties were unable to come to an agreement to avoid foreclosure, the manager will issue a certificate stating that the mortgagee has satisfied the requirements of the mediation ordinance and authorizing the mortgagee to proceed with its rights pursuant to G. L. c. 244. Failure of a mortgagee to comply with the mediation ordinance results in a $300 fine with each day of noncompliance constituting a separate violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">b. <em>Foreclosure ordinance. </em>The foreclosure ordinance requires owners of buildings that are vacant or undergoing foreclosure to register with the city. The definition of \u201cowner\u201d includes \u201ca mortgagee of any such property who has initiated the foreclosure process.\u201d Under the ordinance, the mortgage foreclosure process is initiated by \u201ctaking possession of a residential property pursuant to [G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 1]; [or by] commencing a foreclosure action on a property in any court of competent jurisdiction, including without limitation, filing a complaint in Land court under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act \u2014 Public Law 108-189 (50 U.S.C.S. App. \u00a7 501-536).\u201d In addition, \u201cwhere the mortgage authorizes [the] mortgagee entry to make repairs upon the mortgagor\u2019s failure to do so,\u201d the mortgagee has \u201cinitiated\u201d the foreclosure process. Read together, a mortgagee whose mortgage expressly authorizes entry to make repairs upon the mortgagor\u2019s failure to do so is an owner under the ordinance without any consideration as to whether the mortgagor has vacated the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Under the foreclosure ordinance, an \u201cowner\u201d as defined in the ordinance is responsible for the maintenance of the property. The ordinance specifies the minimum requirements of maintenance, including the filing of a space utilization plan with the fire commissioner; the removal of hazardous material from the property; the securing of windows and doorways or the provision of twenty-four-hour on-site security; the removal of trash, debris, and stagnant water; the draining of water from plumbing if the property is vacant; the procurement of liability insurance for the property; and the provision of a $10,000 cash bond against the possibility of noncompliance. Upon the satisfaction of these conditions, the city will issue a certificate of compliance to the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">If an owner fails to register a vacant or foreclosing property with the city and to obtain a certificate of compliance, the build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ing commissioner, once notified, is empowered to give notice and order the owner to bring the property into compliance with the foreclosure ordinance. Failure to comply with an order to register and its attendant conditions authorizes the building commissioner and his agents to enter the property to inspect it and bring it into compliance with the ordinance. An owner must pay any expenses incurred by the commissioner in securing an unregistered property within seven days of receipt of notice, or the city may file a notice of claim against the property and obtain a lien. The ordinance\u2019s requirement of a $10,000 bond ensures that, should the owner of a property subject to the ordinance fail to maintain the property according to the strictures of the ordinance, the city will be able to recoup the costs of entering the property and satisfying the maintenance requirements. If the property is registered and the owner fails to pay the expenses incurred by the city, the city may draw down the posted bond. Furthermore, the city will retain an unspecified portion of the bond as \u201can administrative fee to fund an account for expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, and marking said building and other such buildings that are not in compliance with [the foreclosure ordinance].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, failure to comply with the foreclosure ordinance results in a fine of $300 per day with each day constituting a separate violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">3. <em>Preemption. </em>The Home Rule Amendment authorizes a municipality by ordinance or bylaw to \u201cexercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court in conformity with powers reserved to the general court by section eight\u201d of the Home Rule Amendment. See art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. See also G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13 (Home Rules Procedures Act). Municipal bylaws are presumed to be valid. <em>Marshfield Family Skateland, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>389 Mass. 436, 440 (1983). The plaintiffs argue that the ordinances are inconsistent with several laws enacted by the General Court and thus are unconstitutional. The city argues that no conflict exists with the specified laws and that, should this court conclude otherwise, the foreclosure ordinance by its own language avoids any conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In determining whether a local ordinance or bylaw is inconsistent with a State statute, the \u201cquestion is not whether the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>lature intended to grant authority to municipalities to act..., but rather whether the Legislature intended to deny [a municipality] the right to legislate on the subject [in question].\u201d <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985). Municipalities enjoy \u201cconsiderable latitude\u201d in this regard. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 154 (1973). There must be a \u201csharp conflict\u201d between the ordinance or bylaw and the statute before a local law is invalidated. <em>Id. </em>Such a conflict \u201cappears when either the legislative intent to preclude local action is clear, or, absent plain expression of such intent, the purpose of the statute cannot be achieved in the face of the local by-law.\u201d <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>379 Mass. 43, 54 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Legislative intent to preclude local action can be express or inferred. <em>St. George Greek Orthodox Cathedral of W. Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fire Dep\u2019t of Springfield, </em>462 Mass. 120, 126 (2012). When express, the task of determining the inconsistency between a local enactment and a State law is relatively easy. See <em>Wendell, </em>394 Mass, at 524. More difficult are the instances when the Legislature is silent on the issue of local regulation and a party challenging a local enactment asserts that \u201ca legislative intent to bar such local action should be inferred in all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When \u201clegislation on a subject is so comprehensive that an inference would be justified that the Legislature intended to preempt the field,\u201d a municipal law cannot stand. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Boston, 316 </em>Mass. 178, 186 (1978) (construing campaign finance laws as \u201cpreempting any right which a municipality might otherwise have to appropriate funds for the purpose of influencing the result on a referendum question\u201d). \u201cIn a close case, the considerations influencing the decision depend on the particular circumstances and a perception of the extent to which the Legislature has or has not made a preemptive intent clear. In such an analysis, it is not inappropriate to take note of what has or has not been traditionally a matter of local regulation.\u201d <em>Wendell, </em>394 Mass. at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The plaintiffs have identified three statutes that they argue are in conflict with the ordinances: G. L. c. 244, the Massachusetts foreclosure statute; G. L. c. 21E, the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention Act (OHMRPA); and G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 127A-127L, the State sanitary code. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">a. <em>Massachusetts foreclosure statute. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the foreclosure statute preempts the foreclosure ordinance. The First Circuit has asked us also to consider whether the foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>statute preempts the mediation ordinance. As we explain, we conclude that the foreclosure statute preempts the mediation ordinance in whole but find no preemption of the foreclosure ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">i. <em>Mediation ordinance. </em>General Laws c. 244 establishes three means by which the equity of redemption of a mortgage may be foreclosed. They are foreclosure (1) by action, G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 3-10; (2) by entry and possession, G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; or (3) by sale under the power of sale in a mortgage, G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 11-17C. General Laws c. 244, \u00a7 35A, as amended by St. 2010, c. 258, \u00a7 7, gives a mortgagor of residential real property in the Commonwealth 150 days to cure a payment default before foreclosure proceedings may be commenced. A foreclosing mortgagee may reduce the 150-day period to ninety days by certifying that it has engaged \u201cin a good faith effort to negotiate a commercially reasonable alternative to foreclosure ... involving] at least 1 meeting, either in person or by telephone, between [the parties or their representatives,]\u201d and that the meeting was not successful. G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A <em>(b). </em>A good faith effort requires the mortgagee to consider the mortgagor\u2019s current circumstances, an analysis of the net present value of a modified mortgage loan compared to the \u201canticipated net recovery following foreclosure[,] and... the interests of the creditor.\u201d G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A (c). Should the good faith effort fail, the mortgagee must provide the mortgagor with an affidavit setting forth \u201cthe time and place of the meeting, parties participating, relief offered to the borrower, a summary of the creditor\u2019s net present value analysis and applicable inputs of the analysis and certification that any modification or option offered complies with current [F]ederal law or policy.\u201d G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A <em>(f).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">A comparison of the foreclosure statute and the mediation ordinance reveals similar attempts to give mortgagees an incentive to negotiate with the mortgagors before proceeding to foreclose. The city contends that the mediation ordinance complements and does not conflict with the foreclosure statute because a mortgagee could comply with both laws. We disagree. The Legislature\u2019s decision to utilize the proverbial \u201ccarrot\u201d of a shorter right-to-cure period trumps the city\u2019s choice of the \u201cstick\u201d of a daily fine. Furthermore, the ordinance by its own terms does not allow a mortgagee to proceed with foreclosure before obtaining a certificate of good faith mediation, a direct impingement on the process of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Mortgage foreclosure regulation traditionally has been a matter of State, and not local, concern. See Walsh, The Finger in the Dike: State and Local Laws Combat the Foreclosure Tide, 44 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 139, 180-187 (2011) (reviewing legal challenges to efforts by municipalities to regulate mortgage foreclosure process). See <em>BFP </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>511 U.S. 531, 541-542 (1994) (noting traditional State-level management of foreclosure). The mediation ordinance alters what the Legislature determined, as a matter of policy, to be the just medium between the parties involved in the contemplation of a mortgage foreclosure. By so doing, the ordinance necessarily \u201cfrustrate [s] the purpose\u201d of the foreclosure statute. <em>Wendell, </em>394 Mass, at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The Legislature\u2019s amendment of the foreclosure statute in 2012 provides further support for our conclusion that the foreclosure process is wholly a matter of State regulation absent an expression of a clear intent to allow local regulation. General Laws c. 244, \u00a7 35B, inserted by St. 2012, c. 194, \u00a7 2, prohibits a mortgagee from proceeding with foreclosure by sale if the mortgage loan at issue in the foreclosure qualifies as a \u201ccertain mortgage loan,\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35B <em>(a). </em>If the loan qualifies, the mortgagee must conduct an analysis of whether the mortgagor is capable of paying a modified mortgage loan, and it must offer the mortgagee any such identified loan. See G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35B <em>(b). </em>This analysis and offer, if any is forthcoming, constitute objective evidence of a good faith effort to prevent foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>We think the differing treatment of lenders based on the particular circumstances of the mortgage loan in question indicates that the Legislature considered and rejected other possible means of regulation. Accordingly, we discern a legislative intent to occupy the field to the exclusion of other options \u2014 including further regulation at the local level.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">ii. <em>Foreclosure ordinance. </em>The foreclosure statute does not preempt the foreclosure ordinance. As we stated above, G. L. c. 244 establishes procedures by which the equity of redemption in a mortgage may be foreclosed. The foreclosure ordinance does not impact that process. Although a mortgagee\u2019s duty to maintain and repair arises under the ordinance and other liabilities may arise from actions required under the ordinance, nothing in the ordinance affects the procedures for foreclosing the equity of redemption. It is immaterial for purposes of liability under the ordinance that the ordinance considers the foreclosure process initiated at a different moment than the statute because the ordinance does not purport to have any legal effect on the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>foreclosure process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> *We therefore conclude that the foreclosure ordinance does not conflict with the foreclosure statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">b. <em>Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention Act. </em>As we explain, we determine that the foreclosure ordinance is inconsistent with G. L. c. 21E, the OHMRPA. The foreclosure ordinance requires an \u201cowner of a vacant and/or foreclosing property\u201d to \u201c[r]emove from the property, to the satisfaction of the fire commissioner, hazardous material as that term is defined in Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 21K, as that statute may be amended from time to time.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the foreclosure ordinance\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d is broader than the definition included in the OHMRPA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the plaintiff\u2019s view, this overbreadth directly places the foreclosure ordinance squarely in conflict with a clearly stated legislative policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The OHMRPA is a statute \u201cdrafted in a comprehensive fashion to compel the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous material and to ensure that costs and damages are borne by the appropriate responsible parties. To that end, the [Department of Environmental Quality Engineering] has promulgated extensive regulations ... for purposes of implementing, administering, and enforcing [the OHMRPA].\u201d <em>Taygeta Corp. </em>v. <em>Varian Assocs., </em>436 Mass. 217, 223 (2002). Under the OHMRPA, a secured lender will \u201cnot be deemed an owner or operator with respect to the site securing the loan\u201d if certain conditions are met. G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 2 (c). However, this exemption from liability under OHMRPA applies only to \u201creleases and threats of release that first begin to occur before such secured lender acquires ownership or possession of the site.\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 2 (c) (1). \u201cNothing in this definition shall relieve a secured lender of any liability for a release or threat of release that first begins to occur at or from a site . . . during the time that such secured lender has ownership or possession of such site ... for any purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of this definition, a secured lender shall be deemed an owner or operator of. an abandoned site ... if such secured lender . . . held ownership or possession of such site immediately prior to such abandonment.\u201d G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 2 (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the foreclosure ordinance forcibly exposes them to liability under the OHMRPA if, in complying with the mandate of the ordinance, they enter a property and become mortgagees in possession during or after which a release or threat of release of hazardous material occurs. The imposition of liability in such circumstances would defeat the safe harbor for secured lenders provided by the Legislature. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The OHMRPA is a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d statute. <em>Taygeta Corp., </em>436 Mass, at 223. \u201cLegislation which deals with a subject comprehensively . . . may reasonably be inferred as intended to preclude the exercise of any local power or function on the same subject because otherwise the legislative purpose of that statute would be frustrated.\u201d Bloom, 363 Mass, at 155. Here, we can infer that the Legislature has decided that secured lenders not in possession (nor previously in possession) of a site should not be liable for any hazardous material releases at that site. The foreclosure ordinance alters that calculus by requiring mortgagees not yet in possession to enter the property and assume possession. In so doing, a secured lender may become liable under the OHMRPA through compliance with the foreclosure ordinance. As such, the foreclosure ordinance is inconsistent with the OHMRPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The city argues that the very language of the ordinance eliminates any inconsistency between it and the OHMRPA because the ordinance does not apply to owners \u201cexempt from such actions by Massachusetts General Laws.\u201d We are unpersuaded by this argument. \u201cThe existence of legislation on a subject ... is not necessarily a bar to the enactment of local ordinances and bylaws exercising powers or functions with respect to the same subject[,]\u201d but can be a bar when \u201cthe Legislature has . . . [impliedly] . . . forbidden the adoption of local ordinances and by-laws on that subject.\u201d <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1,11 (1975), quoting <em>Bloom, </em>363 Mass, at 156. Simply put, a municipality has no regulatory power in a field already wholly occupied by the State unless explicitly granted such power to regulate by the statute itself. The city cannot exempt a secured lender from the foreclosure ordinance if it has no power to include the lender. See N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:11, at 326-327 (7th ed. rev. 2014) (\u201cA true statutory exception exists only to exempt something which would otherwise be covered by an act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">c. <em>State sanitary code. </em>The plaintiffs challenge the foreclosure ordinance by claiming it is inconsistent with the Sanitary code and the regulations promulgated under it, 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 400 (1993), together known as the State sanitary code (code). \u201cGeneral Laws c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 127A-127N, reflect a comprehensive legislative attempt to effectuate compliance with minimum health and safety standards for residential premises.\u201d <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 202 (1977). A local board of health is permitted \u201cto adopt such rules and regulations as, in its opinion, may be necessary for the particular locality under its jurisdiction; provided, such rules and regulations do not conflict with the laws of the commonwealth or the provisions of the code.\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127A. Enforcement of the code and any local regulations falls to the local board of health or the Department of Public Health by service of an order on the owner of a property. <em>Id. </em>105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 400.200-400.300 (1993). The local board of health and the Department of Public Health, as well as a tenant, also may petition a court to enforce the requirements of the code. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 127A, 127C. Among the available remedies are criminal or civil injunctive relief, correction of the violation by the board itself at the expense of the owner, appointment of a receiver, or condemnation and demolition of the building. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 127A, 127B, 1271. 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 400.700(B) (1993). 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 410.910, 410.950-410.960 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The appointment of a receiver, while a familiar instrument of equity, is an extraordinary remedy. <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>379 Mass. 703, 735-736 (1980). General Laws c. 111, \u00a7 1271, \u201cset[s] forth circumstances that permit a court to appoint a receiver (i.e., when it \u2018may\u2019 do so) as well as those circumstances when appointment of a receiver is mandated (i.e., when it \u2018shall\u2019 do so).\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Rochalska, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 243 (2008). Section 127I \u201crequire[s] the appointment of a receiver to undertake remedial action when there are ongoing sanitary code violations in an occupied building \u2018and the court determines that such appointment is in the best interest of the occupants residing in the property,\u2019 but mak[es] the appointment discretionary when the building is unoccupied or, if occupied, when the best interests of occupants do not require appointment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>The foreclosure ordinance amalgamates two separate enforcement procedures envisioned in the State sanitary code into a single regulatory mechanism: the use of the surety bond and direct entry by an enforcement authority. Under the State sanitary code, an enforcement authority initially can only issue an order to the owner (as defined by 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.020 [2007]) or petition a court for enforcement. Only after \u201ca failure to comply with an order . . . results in a condition which endangers or materially impairs the health or well-being of the occupant or the public\u201d may an enforcement authority cause \u201csuch proper cleaning or repair and charge the responsible person or persons as hereinbefore provided with any and all expenses incurred.\u201d 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.960(A) (2007). The code requires only receivers to post a bond, not owners subject to the code. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1271. Even then, receivers are required to post a bond only after appointment by a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The foreclosure ordinance requires an owner, subject only to an administrative order and fine followed by charged expenses under the code, to post a bond to ensure compliance with the ordinance. The building commissioner may draw on the bond after failure of an owner to pay within seven days the expenses of a direct entry by the building commissioner or his agents. The code envisions that expenses for such a direct entry can be recouped by an action at law or by placing a lien on the property. 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.950(D) (2007). The foreclosure ordinance places a heavier burden on an owner than does the code to ensure enforcement of essentially the same mandates by requiring an owner to post a bond where the code would require none. \u201cGiven the comprehensiveness of the [code] and the remedies provided therein,\u201d it is inconsistent with the code for a municipality to require a surety bond of an owner in situations where the code would require none. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>425 Mass. 697, 704-705 (1997). In addition, the code\u2019s provision for the use of a surety bond limits the city\u2019s power to require such a bond in any other context of code enforcement. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 400.015 (1993) (\u201cNor should the existence of the State Sanitary Code limit or otherwise affect the power of any health authority with respect to any matter for which the State Sanitary Code makes no provision\u201d). The city, by the terms of the code, may require only a surety bond in the manner the code allows. The foreclosure ordinance requires a surety bond in circumstances different from those of the code. Thus the foreclosure ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>conflicts with the code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">4. <em>Lawful fee. </em>The plaintiffs challenge the foreclosure ordinance by characterizing it as an unlawful tax instead of a lawful fee. The city imposes a charge on foreclosing mortgagees to register the property with the city.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA municipality does not have the power to levy, assess, or collect a tax unless the power to do so in a particular instance is granted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Attleboro, </em>454 Mass. 165, 168 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 91, 92 (1987). The plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating the invalidity of the exaction. <em>Id. </em>The operation of the exaction, rather than the specific language used to describe it, ultimately demonstrates its nature. <em>Id. </em>Fees share certain common characteristics that distinguish them from taxes and establish the lens through which to determine their nature. <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10800 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>459 Mass. 603, 610 (2011) <em>(Doe No. 10800). </em>Utilizing these characteristics, we arrive at the conclusion that the monetary exaction at issue here is a lawful fee, and not a tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">a. <em>Particularized benefit. </em>Fees \u201care charged in exchange for a particular governmental service which benefits the party paying the fee in a manner \u2018not shared by other members of society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Emerson College </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>391 Mass. 415, 424 (1984), quoting <em>National Cable Television Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 336, 341 (1974). In <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>we examined whether an exaction that the Legislature authorized from sex offenders who were required to register with a supervisory board constituted a regulatory fee or tax. 459 Mass, at 605, 610-615. There, we further affirmed our reasoning in <em>Silva, </em>454 Mass, at 170, that \u201cthe particularized benefit provided in exchange for the [regulatory fee] is the existence of the regulatory scheme whose costs the fee serves to defray.\u201d Such fees \u201cserve regulatory purposes either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u2018directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it more expensive,\u2019 or indirectly by defraying an agency\u2019s regulation-related expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 201-202 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u201cIn the context of regulatory fees, we construe the term \u2018benefit\u2019 broadly to encompass the provision of particular governmental services to a group of individuals whose actions have necessitated the regulatory scheme in the first instance and who should shoulder the burden of paying for such services. That this may not be viewed as a \u2018benefit\u2019 to [one subject to the scheme] in the traditional sense of the word does not detract from the fact that a governmental entity has provided a particularized \u2018service\u2019 to individuals who require it.\u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 611. The city has stated its belief that properties in foreclosure are more likely to become nuisances than other properties and that a downward spiral of urban blight can occur as nuisance properties in foreclosure affect the values of other properties around it, thereby increasing the likelihood of foreclosure. The foreclosure ordinance attempts to regulate this phenomenon by addressing the period of time between when a mortgagor has stopped tending to the property (due either to the futility of the exercise in the face of foreclosure and unavoidable eviction or to the fact that the property is already vacant with no party responsible for its care) and when the mortgagee or new occupant comes into possession. While the act of foreclosing by mortgagees should not be equated with the acts of those subject to the regulatory scheme in <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>foreclosure is nevertheless the operation that triggers the conditions giving rise to the perceived necessity for the regulatory scheme. That this regulatory scheme is not viewed as a benefit by the plaintiffs does not detract from the fact that the city provides a particularized service to the plaintiffs in the form of maintaining property values of their loan collateral through enforcement of the foreclosure ordinance after foreclosure has commenced. See <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc., </em>421 Mass. at 205 (\u201cIt is appropriate that the entities which generate low-level radioactive waste [and not the taxpayers of the Commonwealth] should shoulder costs associated with protecting the general public from the hazards posed by the waste\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">b. <em>Costs. </em>Fees, unlike taxes, \u201care collected not to raise revenues but to compensate the governmental entity providing the services for its expenses.\u201d <em>Emerson College, </em>391 Mass. at 425. Here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>fee is paid into \u201can account for expenses incurred in inspecting, securing, and marking said building and other such buildings that are not in compliance with this Section.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 427 (stating deposit of exaction into general fund nondecisively weighs in favor of tax, not fee). \u201cThe critical question is whether the fees are reasonably designed to compensate an entity for its anticipated regulatory expenses.\u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 612. In reviewing this question, \u201creasonable latitude must be given to the agency in fixing charges to cover its anticipated expenses in connection with the services to be rendered.\u201d <em>Southview Coop. Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>396 Mass. 395, 403 (1985). Such charges should \u201cnot be scrutinized too curiously even if some incidental revenue were obtained.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>250 Mass. 591, 602 (1924). \u201cRelevant expenses include both the direct and the indirect or incidental costs associated with the particular government service.\u201d <em>Doe No. 10800, </em>459 Mass. at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the funds that do not apply directly to the registered compliant properties are utilized to secure other, noncompliant properties and are never recovered by the original payor. These excess monies, therefore, indicate that the exaction is excessive to the costs of the benefit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This argument passes over the fact that the foreclosure ordinance envisions that the expenditures of the city in entering and securing a noncompliant property will indeed be initially financed by a portion of the administrative fee from the compliant properties paid into an account to fund the city\u2019s actions in securing the noncompliant properties but that ultimately the penalties that other properties will incur through noncompliance will cover those expenditures of the city. This initial financing of a portion of the regulatory scheme beyond the simple processing and registration of a compliant property is \u201can indirect or incidental cost[ ] associated\u201d with the foreclosure ordinance. <em>Doe No. </em>10800, 459 Mass. at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">c. <em>Voluntariness. </em>The parties agree that the exaction at issue in the foreclosure ordinance is involuntarily paid. We have \u201cconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tently given less weight to the voluntariness factor\u201d in the context of regulatory fees. <em>Silva, </em>454 Mass. at 172. The purpose of the foreclosure ordinance is \u201cto promote the health, safety and welfare of the public, to protect and preserve the quiet enjoyment of occupants, abutters and neighborhoods, and to minimize hazards to public safety personnel inspecting or entering such properties.\u201d Exactions founded upon the police power to regulate particular activities are regulatory fees. See <em>id. </em>at 168. Accordingly, in this context, the issue of voluntariness \u201cis of no relevance in determining whether that charge is a fee or a tax.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In conclusion, for the aforementioned reasons, we determine that the city\u2019s exaction from those subject to the foreclosure ordinance would be a lawful fee, rather than a tax.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we answer the second certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We recognize that the city of Springfield has attempted to address the serious problem of urban blight within its borders through these ordinances.

Therefore, although we discuss the role of the exaction relative to costs and ultimately determine that the exaction is a fee, we can make no further determination whether the exaction unlawfully raises revenue or, alternatively, compensates the city on the record before us.
