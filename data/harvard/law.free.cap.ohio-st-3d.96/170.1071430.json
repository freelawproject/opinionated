Shortly after Specialty filed its complaint, it requested the BOR to allow it to withdraw the complaint, and the BOR granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">{\u00b6 2} Specialty filed another valuation complaint for the same property for tax year 1999. Specialty did not give notice of any of the four circumstances set forth in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) and listed on the complaint form, which permit the filing of a second complaint in the same interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u2022{\u00b6 3} The Board of Education for the Cleveland Municipal School District (\u201cBOE\u201d) filed a countercomplaint and a motion to dismiss Specialty\u2019s 1999 complaint. In its motion the BOE alleged that R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) prohibited Specialty\u2019s 1999 complaint as a second filing in the same interim period, which covered the tax years 1997, 1998, and 1999. The BOR granted the BOE\u2019s motion and dismissed Specialty\u2019s 1999 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">{\u00b6 4} Specialty appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which affirmed the BOR\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 5} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 6} Specialty contends that it may file a second complaint in the same interim period because it voluntarily withdrew the 1998 complaint before the BOR considered it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) limits the number of complaints that can be filed in a three-year interim period. It states:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cNo person * * * shall file a complaint against the valuation or assessment of any parcel that appears on the tax list if it filed a complaint against the valuation or assessment of that parcel for any prior tax year in the same interim period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">{\u00b6 9} In support of its contention, Specialty relies on <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Apr. 9, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-971012, 1999 WL 193346. General Electric filed a property valuation complaint for tax year 1993 and then withdrew it before the hearing. General Electric filed another complaint for tax year 1994. The Hamilton County Board of Revision dismissed the complaint for tax year 1994, finding that it was the second filing in the interim period. General Electric appealed to the Hamilton County Court of Appeals, which concluded that the board of revision must act on the complaint in some way before it is dismissed for the complaint to be considered filed. The Hamilton County Court of Appeals misinterpreted our opinion in <em>Elkem Metals Co., L.P. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 683, 693 N.E.2d 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">{\u00b6 10} Elkem\u2019s first filed complaint was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons. Elkem filed another complaint the following year and argued that the first complaint was a nullity to be ignored because it had been dismissed for jurisdictional reasons. We disagreed. Our decision turned on the word \u201cfiled\u201d contained in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2). We ruled that \u201c \u2018[a] paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper official and by him received and filed.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 687, 693 N.E.2d 276, quoting <em>United States v. Lombardo </em>(1916), 241 U.S. 73, 76, 36 S.Ct. 508, 60 L.Ed. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>{\u00b6 11} R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) states, \u201cNo person * * * shall file a complaint * * * if it filed a complaint * * * for any prior tax year in the same interim period.\u201d When a statute is clear and unambiguous in its terms, we apply it, not interpret it. <em>Soltesiz v. Tracy </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 477, 479, 663 N.E.2d 1273. This statute is clear and does not need interpretation. We ruled as we did in <em>Elkem </em>because the property owner had delivered a prior complaint to the proper official, who received and filed it in the interim period. Whatever happens to a complaint after it is filed is irrelevant for the purposes of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2). If \u201ca person, board, or officer\u201d files a complaint in an interim period it may not file another complaint in the same interim period, unless one or more of the four statutory circumstances listed in R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) is alleged. Specialty\u2019s 1999 complaint was the second complaint it filed in the same interim period, and it did not establish any of the four circumstances that would permit it to file a second complaint in the same interim period.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, we hold that the decision of the BTA affirming the BOR\u2019s dismissal of Specialty\u2019s 1999 complaint was reasonable and lawful, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b364-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b364-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-U\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">{\u00b6 13} I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion. I do not believe that the legislature intended R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) to apply to withdrawn complaints that were never acted upon. The intent of R.C. 5715.19(A)(2) was to prohibit successive <em>challenges </em>to evaluations. When a complaint against the valuation of real property is withdrawn before -any other action is taken, it is analogous to a complaint in a trial court that is voluntarily dismissed before service is perfected. Pursuant to Civ.R. 3(A), an action is not even commenced until service is perfected. No opposing party is harmed or even inconvenienced in either situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">{\u00b6 14} I would follow the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning in <em>Gen. Elec. Co. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Apr. 9, 1999), Hamilton App. No. C-971012, 1999 WL 193346, which reversed a similar dismissal and allowed the refiled action to proceed. Applying that reasoning, I would reverse this case and allow the refiled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>action to proceed. We should interpret ambiguous statutes to allow access to the legal system, not impose technical roadblocks.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATk\">Fred Siegel Co., L.P.A., and Annrita S.

Rose, for appellee Cleveland Municipal School District Board of Education.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 <em>15} </em>Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
