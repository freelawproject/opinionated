Schultz, was injured in 1978 while working for Southern Ohio Medical Center. In 1986, she was awarded permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d) for those injuries. At issue is claimant\u2019s subsequent involvement with the S.S. Swim Shop and whether that involvement warranted termination of PTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-18\">{\u00b6 2} In the mid 1980s, claimant\u2019s daughter, Susan Hunter, owned a shop selling swimwear and aquatic equipment in Portsmouth, Ohio. In a 1999 report, an investigator for the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) described claimant\u2019s involvement in the business:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>{\u00b63} \u201c[W]hen the business was first opened, Schultz [claimant] mostly watched the children of Hunter. Hunter stated that Schultz was on the business account, paid bills, filled in on the schedule when Hunter could not work, and consulted with merchants. Presently, Schultz waits on customers, pays bills, signs payroll, does the scheduling, and places orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">{\u00b6 4} Claimant made a similar statement to bureau investigators:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cWhen the store was opened, I paid the business bills, did payroll, consulted with merchants on swimwear, placed orders, and filled in on the schedule when others weren\u2019t available. The business checking account was setup with my name on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cPresently, I still do the same duties with the swim shop. I usually go into the swim shop three days per week, usually from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. While up at the store, I wait on customers, keep the displays stocked, and continue with all of my previous duties of paying bills, consulting, payroll, ordering, and complete the scheduling.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cI sometimes go to swimmeets [sic] and set up stands/displays and sell the swim gear. We set up at local swimmeets and sometimes go to Dayton and Columbus, Ohio for meets. Over the past several years, I would help the expansion of the business by making telephone calls to solicate [sic] business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">{\u00b6 9} Claimant made the following comments in a recorded conversation with an insurance adjuster after she filed an insurance claim for a 1998 fall while selling equipment at a YMCA swim meet:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cQ. [Adjuster] [D]o you work outside the home?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA. [Claimant] No. All I do is I manage, uh, a swim shop for my daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ. Okay. Uhm, how many hours a week do you normally work?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA. Uh, usually, oh, sometimes, uh, 18-20 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. Okay. Are you a member of the TP?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. No. No. I was in there, uh, doing a swim meet. Uh, we come in and, uh, service their swim meets. We bring our suits in, anything pertaining to swimming we bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c\u00c1. And we sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. How often do you frequent the \u2018Y?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. Well, usually twice a year. I usually come in and suit up their team and then I usually do their meet for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Okay. Do you recall, did you know any of them [the witnesses to her 1998 fall]?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Well, no. But I, the girl that was with me, Joanne Phillips, that, you know, had come with me\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Uh, huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA.\u2014 to help me was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. [I]s Joanne a friend of yours?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Yes. Uh, huh. She works for me part time.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. Okay. [D]o you have any physical handicaps at all?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. Okay. Did you walk with a cane, uh, prior to this past injury [at the YMCA]?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. No. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. Okay. Is there anything else that you can think of that you\u2019d like to mention about this claim that we haven\u2019t already discussed?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. No. It just, it cost me quite a bit. [I]t cost me my business cause I had to pay somebody to come in and work for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-22\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b221-23\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. Uh, huh. And how many hours do you pay someone to work for you?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-24\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. Well, I had, well, I was off, you know, we were paying out like, you know, 30 and 40 hours * * * a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-25\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c* * * \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b221-26\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cQ. Okay. And you still had the other employee in addition to hiring someone else to work?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-27\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cA. No. I have three girls that filled in for me that, you know, were able to, uh, you know, take care of the business while I was laid up.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-28\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-29\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cA. Which I hadn\u2019t planned on believe me.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cQ. Okay. So then after you were injured you had three people working?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cA. Yes. Uh, huh.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cQ. So actually you\u2019d only hired one other person to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cA. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cQ. \u2014 to work while you were off?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cA. To help. Yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">{\u00b6 53} Other evidence obtained by the bureau included (1) a business card for S.S. Swim Shop, with claimant\u2019s name listed first, (2) surveillance videos of claimant behind the counter at S.S. Swim Shop, (3) a statement from a BWC investigator that he entered the store and purchased an item from claimant, who was the only person there, and (4) a business transaction journal from TYR Sport, Inc. that established claimant as a contact person for S.S. Swim Shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">{\u00b6 54} On October 5, 1999, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation moved appellee, Industrial Commission of Ohio, to terminate PTD and declare an overpayment. In a meticulous five-page order, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) granted the bureau\u2019s motion. Citing <em>State ex rel. Smothers v. Mihm </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 566, 634 N.E.2d 1017, the SHO stated that PTD could be terminated if claimant is (1) engaged in sustained remunerative employment or (2) engaged in activities that, even if unpaid, were inconsistent with PTD receipt. Lacking evidence of claimant\u2019s receipt of wages for her services, the SHO relied on the second criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">{\u00b6 55} Citing much of the evidence quoted above, the SHO rejected claimant\u2019s assertion that her involvement with S.S. Swim Shop was minimal and that she only worked as an occasional \u201cfavor\u201d to her daughter. The SHO wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe SHO further finds an ongoing pattern of assistance to be work. The SHO finds that the claimant was involved in the latter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">{\u00b6 57} And:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c[T]he SHO finds that the claimant was engaged in activity which is/was inconsistent with the receipt of [PTD]. While the claimant may have performed some favors for her daughter, the claimant\u2019s pattern of work since 1984 is of such duration and degree that she was an ongoing, active participant in the running of the swimp [sic] shop. The claimant was working.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">{\u00b6 59} Reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">{\u00b6 60} Having lost her bid for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, claimant now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Angela D. Marinakis, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1o\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 61} Permanent total disability is the inability to do <em>any </em>sustained remunerative work. <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 170, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946. Therefore, an <em>ability </em>to do <em>any </em>work warrants the denial of PTD. Consequently, a claimant who performs sustained remunerable activity without pay demonstrates that he or she is capable of doing that same work for remuneration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 62} That is the case here. There is no evidence that claimant was paid for her efforts. The commission instead focused on claimant\u2019s activities without pay and concluded that claimant was capable of doing those same duties for pay, i.e., that she was capable of performing sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 63} Completing its analysis, the commission found, in effect, that claimant\u2019s activities were sustained, not sporadic, in nature. It rejected the notion that claimant\u2019s involvement was limited to \u2018intermittent favors,\u2019 finding instead that claimant engaged in a \u201can ongoing pattern of assistance\u201d \u2014 in other words, sustained activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 64} Claimant proposes that PTD can never be terminated absent medical evidence of an ability to work. That is untrue. Medical evidence that supported the original award of PTD may be impeached by evidence other than medical evidence. It can be impeached by subsequent evidence that claimant is actively doing work. As the magistrate observed in the court of appeals, \u201cWhen there is evidence that claimant is actually engaged in certain physical activities, it is not necessary to have an expert opinion that the claimant is capable of performing those activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 65} In conclusion, the commission has \u201csome evidence\u201d to support a finding that claimant is medically capable of sustained activity for which she could be remunerated. Therefore, it did not abuse its discretion in terminating PTD and declaring an overpayment for periods in which compensation and inconsistent activity overlapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 66} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
