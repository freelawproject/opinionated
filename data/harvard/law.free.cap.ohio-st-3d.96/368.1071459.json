Osborne, Norman P. Griffin, and Thomas Downs (collectively \u201cOsborne\u201d), were discharged from their employment with defendant-appellee, AK Steel/Armco Steel Company (\u201cAK Steel\u201d). Osborne filed suit in federal district court on May 28, 1996, alleging pension discrimination in violation of federal law and age discrimination in violation of state law. On December 2, 1998, the federal court granted AK Steel\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Osborne\u2019s pension discrimination claim with prejudice. In the same order, the federal court dismissed Osborne\u2019s age discrimination claim without prejudice. On December 2, 1999, Osborne refiled the age discrimination claim in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, relying on R.C. 2305.19, the Ohio saving statute. That court determined that R.C. 2305.19 did not save Osborne\u2019s claim and granted AK Steel\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 2} The issue before us is whether R.C. 2305.19 allows Osborne to refile the age discrimination claim. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">{\u00b6 3} For purposes relevant to this case, R.C. 2305.19 provides that when a claim \u201cfails otherwise than upon the merits,\u201d a new action may be commenced \u201cwithin one year after such date.\u201d AK Steel challenges the applicability of R.C. 2305.19 to this case. AK Steel relies on <em>Crandall v. Irwin </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 253, 22 O.O. 273, 39 N.E.2d 608, where this court stated in paragraph three of the syllabus, \u2018Where the limitation of time is an inherent part of a right unknown to the common law and created by statute, time is of the essence, and there is no right unless the action or proceeding to enforce such right is commenced within the statutory limit.\u201d AK Steel argues that because age discrimination claims are creatures of statute and R.C. 4112.02(N) contains a limitations period, then R.C. 2305.19, the saving statute, is inapplicable. See R.C. 2305.03 (lapse of time period provided by R.C. 2305.03 et seq. for commencing a civil action is a bar to that action \u201cunless a different limitation is prescribed by statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Unfortunately for AK Steel, more recent case law is against it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Lewis v. Connor </em>(1985), 21 Ohio St.3d 1, 21 OBR 266, 487 N.E.2d 285, this court' found that R.C. 2305.19 applied to save a claim even though the claim (workers\u2019 compensation) is a creature of statute and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contained its own limitations period. The <em>Lewis </em>opinion turned on this court\u2019s determination that R.C. 4123.519, now 4123.512, was a remedial statute, not a right-creating statute. Id. at 3, 21 OBR 266, 487 N.E.2d 285. Similarly, the entirety of R.C. Chapter 4112 is remedial. <em>Elek v. Huntington Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 135, 137, 573 N.E.2d 1056. See <em>Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 638 N.E.2d 991, syllabus. Accordingly, we conclude that paragraph three of that syllabus is inapplicable in the case before us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 5} Because R.C. Chapter 4112 is remedial, it must be \u201cliberally construed to promote its object (elimination of discrimination) and protect those to whom it is addressed (victims of discrimination).\u201d <em>Elek, </em>60 Ohio St.3d at 137, 573 N.E.2d 1056. Like the court in <em>Lewis, </em>\u201c[w]e decline to hold that [Osborne] has entered the \u2018twilight zone\u2019 where dismissal of her complaint without prejudice after expiration of the limitation period of [the relevant statute] has the same effect as a dismissal on the merits, barring any further action with respect to the same claim.\u201d Id. at 4, 21 OBR 266, 487 N.E.2d 285. Further, nothing in R.C. Chapter 4112 \u201cprohibits the refiling of a complaint where the original notice of appeal is timely filed.\u201d See id. See, also, <em>Reese v. Ohio State Univ. Hosp. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 162, 164, 6 OBR 221, 451 N.E.2d 1196. Accordingly, today we extend the holding of <em>Lewis </em>and conclude that R.C. 2305.19, the saving statute, applies to claims filed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 6} The age discrimination claim was filed in federal court within the limitations period of R.C. 4112.02(N). It was dismissed without prejudice. The claim was then filed in the court of common pleas exactly one year later. Because R.C. 2305.19 is applicable, we conclude that the claim was timely filed and that the judgments of the trial court and the court of appeals were in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b562-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

This court has not had occasion to cite <em>Crandall </em>since 1953. See <em>Gehelo v. Gehelo </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 243, 52 O.O. 114, 116 N.E.2d 7. That almost fifty-year lapse into obscurity was more likely caused by the abstruseness of the opinion than because the legal principles involved are so thoroughly settled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\">.
