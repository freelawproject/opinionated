Townsend, has been allowed for \u201cnon-displaced fracture coccyx; lumbosacral sprain; major depressive disorder; herniated right disc L4-5.\u201d It has been specifically disallowed for \u201cherniated disc at L5-S1; aggravation of pre-existing compression [of] traversing nerves and compromise right exiting foramina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">{\u00b6 2} Claimant made several requests for wage-loss compensation, covering consecutive periods. In support of those applications were reports from Drs. Edward G. Myers and Edward J. Urban. In an August 24, 1998 report, Dr. Myers attributed claimant\u2019s work restrictions in part to a herniated disc at L5-S1 and compression of the traversing nerves \u2014 both nonallowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">{\u00b6 3} Dr. Urban on November 5, 1998, completed a form \u2019from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation that asked him to list all restrictions arising from the claim\u2019s allowed conditions. Dr. Urban wrote: \u201cNo bending, climbing, squatting, stooping, pushing, or pulling-overhead reaching; or [l]ifting more then [sic] 15 lbs. [or] [sjitting, standing, and walking more then [sic] 20 min. at a time.\u201d The form also contained a check-the-box section requesting the physician to \u201cidentify the physical capacity of the injured worker.\u201d It included inquiries as to the' claimant\u2019s ability to sit, stand, walk, bend, squat, crawl, climb, and reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">{\u00b6 4} In addition, there were sections <em>on </em>claimant\u2019s abilities to lift and carry. Six weight ranges were listed with the following choices: never, occasionally, frequently, and continuously. In the ll-to-20 pound category, Dr. Urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>checked \u201cnever.\u201d Of further relevance was his designation \u201cno\u201d in response to whether claimant\u2019s hands could be used repetitively for fine manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 5} A Staff Hearing Officer for the Industrial Commission of Ohio awarded wage-loss compensation after finding, among other things, that the reports of Drs. Myers and Urban were evidence that causally related claimant\u2019s physical restrictions and resulting wage loss to his allowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 6} Claimant\u2019s employer, appellee WCI Steel, Inc., sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. Persuaded that the cited reports were deficient, the court of appeals issued a limited writ of mandamus and ordered the commission to vacate the award and reconsider the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 8} To the commission, the Myers and Urban reports were \u201csome evidence\u201d of a causal relationship between claimant\u2019s postinjury wage loss and his industrial injury. To the court of appeals they were not. Claimant defends the commission\u2019s evidentiary interpretation in this court and asks us to reinstate the award. Our review favors the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">{\u00b6 9} Claimant does not challenge the disqualification of Dr. Myers\u2019s August 1998 report, implicitly conceding that it indeed referred to the specifically disallowed conditions of herniated disc L5-S1 and nerve traversal. He does, however, forcefully contest the rejection of Dr. Urban\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">{\u00b6 10} The court of appeals\u2019 criticism had two bases. First, it concluded that Urban\u2019s indication of a restriction against the use of hands for fine manipulation implied that nonallowed conditions contributed to claimant\u2019s inability to return to his former job.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">{\u00b6 11} We find this to be an inappropriate inference. Crucial to our finding is an understanding of how this information came about. The disputed Urban report was on a bureau-prepared form. Near the top was a blank space for the following: \u201cList all restrictions which are the direct result of the allowed conditions in the claim.\u201d In response, Dr. Urban wrote: \u201cNo bending, climbing, squatting, stooping, pushing or pulling-overhead reaching; or [ljifting more then [sic] 15 lbs. [or] [setting, standing, and walking more then [sic] 20 min. at a time.\u201d The court of appeals made no mention of any of these restrictions being inconsistent with the allowed conditions in the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">{\u00b6 12} The second half of the form asked the doctor to \u201cidentify the physical capacity of the injured worker.\u201d It contained check-the-box inquiries as to claimant\u2019s capacity to sit, stand, walk, bend, squat, crawl, climb, and reach. There were questions on lifting and carrying limitations as well as questions on the capacity of claimant\u2019s hands and feet for certain repetitive movements.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>{\u00b6 13} When the form is viewed as a whole, the difficulty with the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning is this: the form <em>asks </em>the doctor to answer questions as to parts of the body not associated with the claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. The ready response to this, of course, is that the doctor could have answered in the affirmative when asked about claimant\u2019s ability to use his hands for fine manipulation. And this is a legitimate observation. One must remember, however, that claimants can have nonallowed conditions and still collect compensation. The key is whether and to what extent the nonallowed conditions contribute to the disability. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. Even if the nonallowed conditions are severe, they are irrelevant as long as the allowed conditions are independently disabling. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the bureau\u2019s own form asked Dr. Urban to address claimant\u2019s physical capacity, including the capacity of body parts unrelated to his allowed conditions. Dr. Urban did so. The bureau also asked Dr. Urban to list the conditions contributing to claimant\u2019s inability to return to his former position of employment. Dr. Urban did so and enumerated <em>only </em>claimant\u2019s allowed conditions as being the cause of his inability to return to his former job. As such, Dr. Urban\u2019s report cannot be disqualified on the basis of nonallowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals also faulted Dr. Urban\u2019s report for being internally inconsistent. This finding was based on two things: (1) Dr. Urban\u2019s prohibition against \u201clifting more [than] 15 lbs.\u201d and (2) his check-the-box indication of \u201cnever\u201d in response to the question of whether claimant could lift between 11 and 20 pounds. Again, the problem lies in the bureau-designed form. Dr. Urban was asked to list, in narrative form, claimant\u2019s restrictions. He wrote that claimant could not lift above 15 pounds. The bureau then listed six weight categories in which the doctor had the choice of only \u201cnever\u201d \u201coccasionally,\u201d \u201cfrequently,\u201d or \u201ccontinuously.\u201d Unfortunately, because the form\u2019s closest relevant weight range was eleven to twenty pounds and Dr. Urban had set the uppermost limit at fifteen, checking off <em>any </em>of the designated responses would have resulted in internal inconsistency. Presumably, Dr. Urban checked \u201cnever\u201d because claimant could not lift between sixteen and twenty pounds. If, however, he had checked \u201ccontinuously\u201d because claimant could lift eleven to fifteen pounds, the same accusation of inconsistency could still be made. So, too, with the designations \u201coccasionally\u201d and \u201cfrequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 16} The bureau form, therefore, put Dr. Urban in a no-win situation. Dr. Urban obviously did his best to answer the questions truthfully and accommodate the questions asked by the bureau. Claimant can never lift up to twenty pounds and, based on the makeup of the forms, Dr. Urban\u2019s answers were not irreconcilable. Accordingly, his report is deemed \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a causal relationship between wage loss and the allowed conditions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Stewart Jaffy &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Stewart R.
