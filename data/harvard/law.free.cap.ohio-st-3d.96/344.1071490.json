He was also convicted and sentenced to prison for aggravated robbery and receiving stolen property. The court of appeals affirmed his convictions and sentence. <em>State v. Woodard </em>(Apr. 23, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 61171, 1992 WL 84888. On appeal as of right, we also affirmed. <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 623 N.E.2d 75, certiorari denied, <em>Woodard v. Ohio </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 1246, 114 S.Ct. 2770, 129 L.Ed.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 2} Subsequently, the trial court denied Woodard\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, and the court of appeals affirmed. <em>State v. Woodard </em>(Jan. 22, 1998), Cuyahoga App. No. 71912, 1998 WL 23844. We declined to accept Woodard\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1522, 692 N.E.2d 1024. The United States Supreme Court also rejected Woodard\u2019s complaint that Ohio\u2019s clemency process violated his constitutional rights. <em>Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 272, 118 S.Ct. 1244, 140 L.Ed.2d 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 3} On November 29, 2000, Woodard filed an application in the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals to reopen his appeal from his conviction pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel before that court. However, the court of appeals found that Woodard had failed to show good cause for filing his application more than 90 days after that court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b). <em>State v. Woodard </em>(Sept. 18, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 61171, 2001 WL 1134873. The court of appeals also found that Woodard\u2019s application was barred by res judicata and that Woodard \u201cfailed to meet his burden to demonstrate that \u2018there is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal,\u2019 \u201d as required by App.R. 26(B)(5). Hence, that court also denied the application for reopening the appeal on the merits. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 4} In his second proposition of law, Woodard asserts that his counsel have established a genuine issue as to whether he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his initial appeal to the court of appeals. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Woodard has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>N.E.2d 696; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456. \u201cTo show ineffective assistance, [appellant] must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 329, 330, 744 N.E.2d 770, citing <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Woodard \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ACO\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and L. Christopher Frey, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AH8m\">Richard Agopian, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 5} We have reviewed Woodard\u2019s assertions of deficient performance by appellate counsel and find that Woodard has failed to raise \u201ca genuine issue as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 6} In his first proposition of law, Woodard argues that he had good cause for the late filing of his application to reopen under App.R. 26(B) and relies, in part, upon <em>White v. Schotten </em>(C.A.6, 2000), 201 F.3d 743, to support his claim of good cause. However, our disposition of Woodard\u2019s second proposition on the merits of the case negates any need to decide this issue. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
