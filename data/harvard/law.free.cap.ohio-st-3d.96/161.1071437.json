For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the comp-time system did not affect her salaried status. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">{\u00b6 2} Erma Johnson worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services (\u201cDYS\u201d) as a regional administrator and managing officer. DYS requires regional administrators such as Johnson to work 40 hours per week. Johnson\u2019s work week was composed of five nine-hour days, each of which included a one-hour lunch break. DYS required Johnson to be at work during the department\u2019s core hours of 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">{\u00b6 3} DYS\u2019s comp-time system allows salaried, exempt employees to accrue hour-for-hour comp time for hours worked in excess of 40 per week, with a supervisor\u2019s approval. Supervisors typically approve comp time when the additional hours worked are \u201cnecessary for operation of the division or work unit.\u201d When a salaried exempt employee is tardy or absent during core hours, DYS requires the employee to account for the hours missed by using accrued leave time such as vacation time, sick leave, or comp time. The employee is allowed to choose which type of leave to use, subject to a supervisor\u2019s approval. At times, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>when Johnson did not indicate a choice, a supervisor accounted for the missed time from the comp-time balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 4} Johnson normally started work at 8:30 a.m.. and occasionally worked as late as 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. Her supervisor frequently approved accrual of comp time for her extra hours. On a number of occasions in 1997 and 1998, Johnson arrived after core hours had started or left before they had ended. To account for some of these absences, Johnson used sick leave and vacation time. For others, she indicated that the absent hours were \u201cflex time.\u201d In those instances, Johnson\u2019s supervisor accounted for the absent hours by deducting from her comp time, which always had a positive balance. Johnson\u2019s cash salary was never reduced because she always had sufficient vacation time, sick leave, or comp time available to compensate for work hours missed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">{\u00b6 5} Johnson filed suit, claiming that DYS\u2019s comp-time system rendered her a nonsalaried, nonexempt employee. She alleged that she should be paid overtime for the hours in excess of 40 per week that she had worked. The Court of Claims held that Johnson had been a salaried, overtime-exempt employee and therefore was not entitled to overtime pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">{\u00b6 6} Johnson appealed. The court of appeals reversed, determining that an employer may account for missed time by deducting from an employee\u2019s personal or sick leave, but not from an employee\u2019s comp time. The court held that deduction of comp time violates the salary test of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), which prohibits the reduction of an overtime-exempt employee\u2019s salary according to hours worked. The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">{\u00b6 7} Pursuant to FLSA, employers must generally pay overtime compensation for work performed in excess of 40 hours per week. Section 207(a)(1), Title 29, U.S.Code. However, any salaried \u201cemployee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\u201d is exempt from that requirement. Section 213(a)(1), Title 29, U.S.Code. It is undisputed that Johnson\u2019s duties at DYS qualify her for exempt status under either the executive or administrative criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">{\u00b6 8} At issue is whether Johnson was a salaried employee. Section 541.1(f), Title 29, C.F.R. Pursuant to the salary test, an employee is paid \u201con a salary basis\u201d if \u201che regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of his compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\u201d Section 541.118(a), Title 29, C.F.R. \u201c[Additional compensation besides the salary is not inconsistent with the salary basis of payment.\u201d Section 541.118(b), Title 29, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>{\u00b6 9} It is not disputed that in every biweekly pay period during Johnson\u2019s employment with DYS, she received her full salary without reduction because of \u201cthe quality or quantity of the work performed.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Johnson was paid a salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 10} The next question is whether DYS\u2019s comp-time system destroyed Johnson\u2019s salary status. The test is whether the accrual or deduction of comp time subjected her salary \u201cto reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\u201d Section 541.118(a), Title 29, C.F.R. We conclude that the accrual of comp time did not destroy Johnson\u2019s salary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cAdditional compensation\u201d will destroy an employee\u2019s salaried, exempt status only where it divides the actual salary into multiple \u201cparts for the purpose of circumventing the requirement of payment \u2018on a salary basis.\u2019 \u201d Section 541.118(b), Title 29, C.F.R. DYS\u2019s system for accruing comp time was not intended to, and does not, circumvent the salary test; rather it was intended to ensure that an exempt employee\u2019s salary remained constant. Although the comp-time system did not result in additional compensation for Johnson, it served to compensate her, when her actual time worked was less than the required amount for any particular period. Accordingly, it could be viewed as additional compensation. Recognizing that comp time is the equivalent of compensation does not also mean that it is salary. We conclude that comp time accrued pursuant to DYS\u2019s comp-time system is nonsalary compensation. See <em>Kuchinskas v. Broward Cty. </em>(S.D.Fla.1993), 840 F.Supp. 1548, 1555 (\u201ccompensatory time may be part of an employee\u2019s compensation package, [but] it does not constitute salary\u201d). Therefore, any reduction in Johnson\u2019s comp time for hours absent from work during core hours will not destroy her salaried status because her salary was not reduced. Section 541.118(a), Title 29, C.F.R. See <em>Internatl. Assn. of Fire Fighters, Alexandria Local 2141 v. Alexandria </em>(E.D.Va.1989), 720 F.Supp. 1230, 1232 (\u201cdocking of leave or accrued compensatory time for absences of less than an entire day\u201d does not \u201cdefeat salaried status\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 12} This conclusion is supported by further analysis of the salary test, which states that salary is \u201ca predetermined amount * * * [and] is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\u201d Section 541.118(a), Title 29, C.F.R. Comp time is not \u201cpredetermined.\u201d It is granted in special circumstances to compensate employees for work beyond DYS\u2019s expectations. Comp time is granted only when extra hours are worked and the extent of comp time cannot be determined prior to the hours for which it is accrued. It also cannot be exchanged for cash. Further, the term \u201camount\u201d suggests that comp time is not salary because \u201camount\u201d is generally construed to mean a \u201ccash\u201d amount. <em>Barner v. Novato </em>(C.A.9, 1994), 17 F.3d 1256, 1261-1262.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AXo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Wagoner &amp; Steinberg, Ltd., C.

Herring, Law Director, and James G. Burkhardt, urging reversal for amicus curiae city of Toledo.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">{\u00b6 13} We hold that a system of awarding comp time for extra hours worked and deducting comp time for hours absent does not destroy an employee\u2019s salaried, exempt status when the employee\u2019s salary is not reduced because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 14} Our holding is supported by the Department of Labor\u2019s position on the salary test. Considering a proposed benefits plan that included a comp-time system substantially similar to that of DYS, the Department of Labor stated, \u2018Where an employer has a bona fide benefits plan (e.g., vacation time, sick leave, comp time), it is permissible to substitute or reduce the accrued leave in the plan for the time an employee is absent from work even if it is less than a full day without affecting the salary basis of payment, if by substituting or reducing such leave the employee receives in payment an amount equal to his or her guaranteed salary. Payment of an amount equal to the employee\u2019s guaranteed salary must be made even if an employee has no accrued benefits in the leave plan and the account has a negative balance, where the employee\u2019s absence is for less than a full day.\u201d Department of Labor Opinion Letter 2199 (Oct. 19, 1999). Though this analysis is not controlling, it supports our conclusion that the accrual of and deduction from Johnson\u2019s comp time did not destroy her salaried status.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 15} Because the comp-time system does not destroy Johnson\u2019s salaried, exempt status, her claim for overtime pay was properly denied by the Court of Claims. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
