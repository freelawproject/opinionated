Bonfield and Shelly M. Zachritz, have lived together since 1987 as partners in a same-sex relationship. During that time, Teri has adopted two children, Joseph, born in 1993, and Jacob, born in 1995. Shelly participated equally with Teri in the decision to adopt the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">{\u00b6 2} Teri has also given birth to three children, a son born in 1996, and twins born in 1998, each of whom was conceived through anonymous artificial insemination. Shelly actively participated in the planning and births of the children, assisted with Teri\u2019s artificial insemination, and was present throughout Teri\u2019s doctor\u2019s visits during the pregnancies and actual births. According to Teri and Shelly, since the children\u2019s respective adoptions and births Shelly has acted as their primary caregiver and has come to be seen by them as their parent in the same way as has Teri.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">{\u00b6 3} Appellants\u2019 description of their family is echoed by Dr. Leslie Swift, a licensed clinical psychologist, who testified that appellants operate jointly in caring for the children, and have created a loving and committed home. Dr. Swift identified Shelly as the children\u2019s primary caretaker, as she is responsible for the day-to-day care of the children. Dr. Swift found that both Teri and Shelly function as parents, and that the children are bonded to each of them and \u201cgo to each for similar things and also for different needs.\u201d Finally, Dr. Swift testified that should the children be separated from Shelly, their primary caregiver, it could be devastating to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">{\u00b6 4} Notwithstanding her role as the primary caregiver for their children, Shelly has no legally recognized rights with regard to Joseph, Jacob, Nicholas, Matthew, or Samantha. Lacking such legal rights, she does not have equal access to the children\u2019s medical or school records, and is unable to authorize medical care or obtain medical insurance coverage for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 5} An option in some states would be for Shelly to pursue a \u201csecond parent adoption.\u201d M. Jacobs, Micah Has One Mommy and One Legal Stranger: Adjudicating Maternity for Nonlegal Lesbian Coparents (2002), 50 Buff.L.Rev. 341, 345, fn. 15. Second parent adoption is a process by which a partner in a cohabiting and nonmarital relationship may adopt his or her partner\u2019s biological or adoptive child, without requiring the parent to relinquish any parental rights. E. Zuckerman, Second Parent Adoption for Lesbian-Parental Families: Legal Recognition of the Other Mother (1986), 19 U.C.Davis L.Rev. 729, 731, fn. 8. However, because second parent adoption is not available in Ohio, Shelly cannot adopt the children. Instead, if Shelly were to adopt the children herself, the effect would be to terminate Teri\u2019s rights and responsibilities as an adoptive parent. See R.C. 3107.15(A). Therefore, because Teri wishes to retain her rights as a parent, adoption of the children by Shelly is not a viable option.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 6} Concerned that Shelly\u2019s lack of legally recognized rights is contrary to the children\u2019s best interests both currently and in the future, appellants filed their Petition for Allocation of Parental Rights and Responsibilities in the Common Pleas Court of Hamilton County, Juvenile Division. They sought to \u201cconfirm their commitment that they will both continue to raise the children regardless of what happens to their relationship.\u201d In addition to concerns about Shelly\u2019s status with respect to the children in the event that Teri and Shelly separate, appellants seek to secure Shelly\u2019s legal rights to the children in the event of Teri\u2019s death. For instance, if Teri were to die, Shelly\u2019s care and physical custody of the children could be interrupted for a time or even terminated, should a relative of Teri decide to petition the court for custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 7} Adopting the recommendation of the magistrate, the juvenile court found that it did not have jurisdiction to grant the petition because Shelly is not a parent within the meaning of R.C. 3109.04. The record reveals that the trial court questioned why appellants did not apply for joint custody, since custody is a much broader term than shared parenting and \u201cthe award of joint custody does not divest any party of their [own] custody.\u201d The trial court suggested that the better approach would be a shared custody arrangement and declined to \u201ccircumvent the laws of Ohio by torturing the shared parenting agreement [law] where there is no parentage.\u201d The court stated that custody of the children in a shared custody arrangement \u201cwould not be a fiction [but] a reality, [whereas] parenting is a bit of fiction in this situation.\u201d The court then invited appellants to petition for a joint custodial arrangement, without reference to \u201cshared parenting.\u201d The record does not indicate that appellants acted upon the advice offered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 8} Upon appeal of the trial court order denying shared parenting, the court of appeals held that pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(2), the juvenile court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the custody of any child who is not a ward of a court. As none of the Bonfield children is a ward of a court, the court of appeals concluded that the juvenile court has jurisdiction to hear the petition. However, the court held that the juvenile court must exercise its jurisdiction in child custody matters in accordance with R.C. 3109.04. Although R.C. 3109.04 does not define \u201cparent,\u201d the court applied the definition of \u201cparent and child relationship\u201d in R.C. 3111.01(A) to define \u201cparent\u201d in R.C. 3109.04, and concluded that a juvenile court has no authority to award to a person who is not a biological or adoptive parent parental rights or shared parenting. Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">{\u00b6 9} The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 3109.04(A)(2) provides: \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIf at least one parent files a pleading or motion in accordance with division (G) of this section and a plan for shared parenting pursuant to that division and if a plan for shared parenting is in the best interest of the children and is approved by the court in accordance with division (D)(1) of this section, the court may allocate the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the children to both parents and issue a shared parenting order requiring the parents to share all or some of the aspects of the physical and legal care of the children in accordance with the approved plan for shared parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 12} The specific issue is whether Shelly is a \u201cparent\u201d for purposes of R.C. 3109.04(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Analysis of R.C. 3109.04(A)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 3109.04(A)(2) provides that a court may, upon determining that a proposed shared parenting plan is in the best interest of the children, allocate parental rights and responsibilities for the care of children to both \u201cparents.\u201d \u201cParent\u201d is not defined in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">{\u00b6 14} The legal concept of \u201cshared parenting\u201d is relatively new in Ohio law and refers to an agreement between parents regarding the care of their children that was previously termed \u201cjoint custody.\u201d Ohio Legislative Service Commission, Analysis of 1990 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, at 20. In 1990, the General Assembly adopted recommendations of the Domestic Relations Task Force established by the 116th General Assembly to change \u201c[cjhild custody and visitation laws [to] reflect a shared parenting concept where both divorcing parties remain important to them children\u2019s development.\u201d Domestic Relations Task Force Report, 116th General Assembly, 1990, at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">{\u00b6 15} Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3 replaced references to \u201cjoint custody\u201d in domestic-relations-related statutes with \u201cshared parenting.\u201d See, e.g., former R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>3109.04(D)(l)(a)(i), (E)(2)(c), and 3113.215(B)(6), 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 116, 121, 187. \u201cParty,\u201d in this context, was replaced with \u201cparent.\u201d See former R.C. 3109.05(A)(3), 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 128. However, the Act did not replace all references to \u201ccustody\u201d of a child, or \u201cparent, legal guardian,\u201d or \u201ccustodian,\u201d leaving intact those references where the context and scope of the statutory language did not warrant change. For example, R.C. 2151.06 was not amended, and it provides that \u201ca child has the same residence or legal settlement as his parents, legal guardian of his person, or his custodian who stands in the relation of loco parentis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">{\u00b6 16} Appellants argue that the doctrine of in loco parentis applies to the definition of \u201cparent\u201d in R.C. 3109.04(A)(2), and urge the court to find that Shelly stands in loco parentis to Teri\u2019s children for purposes of that statute. They rely on <em>State v. Noggle, </em>which held that a \u201cperson in loco parentis has assumed the same duties as a guardian or custodian, only not through a legal proceeding.\u201d <em>State v. Noggle </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 615 N.E.2d 1040. However, the court\u2019s determination in <em>Noggle </em>was based on an analysis of R.C. 2907.03(A)(5), which specifically provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(5) The offender is the other person\u2019s natural or adoptive parent, or stepparent, or guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, in contrast to R.C. 3109.04(A)(2), which uses only the word \u201cparent\u201d in the context of a shared parenting agreement, R.C. 2907.03(A)(5) expressly includes a person in loco parentis in defining a sexual offender. The General Assembly could have provided juvenile courts with the authority to allocate parental rights and responsibilities not only to parents, but also to guardians, custodians, and others who stand in loco parentis. That the statute refers to \u201cparent\u201d reflects legislative intent to exclude from the benefits of R.C. 3109.04 guardians or custodians in loco parentis.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">{\u00b6 21} The court of appeals applied R.C. 3111.01(A) to 3109.04(A)(2), finding that Shelly is not a \u201cparent\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 3111.01(A). R.C. 3111.01(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cAs used in sections 3111.01 to 3111.85 of the Revised Code, \u2018parent and child relationship\u2019 means the legal relationship that exists between a child and the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parents and upon which those sections and any other provision of the Revised Code confer or impose rights, privileges, duties, and obligations. The \u2018parent and child relationship\u2019 includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 23} \u201c(B) The parent and child relationship extends equally to all children and all parents, regardless of the marital status of the parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b624} Appellants argue that by its terms R.C. 3111.01(A) applies only to \u201csections 3111.01 to 3111.85 of the Revised Code.\u201d Therefore, it applies only for purposes of the Parentage Act, R.C. Chapter 3111, and should not be used to define the term \u201cparent\u201d in R.C. 3109.04. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">{\u00b6 25} Since there is no definition of \u201cparent\u201d in R.C. 3109.04, it is appropriate to search related sections of the Revised Code for a definition. A plain reading of R.C. 3111.01 indicates that there are three ways a \u201cparent and child relationship\u201d can be established: by natural parenthood, by adoption, or by other legal means in the Revised Code that confer or impose rights, privileges, and duties upon certain individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">{\u00b6 26} Appellants argue that the domestic relations code contains other means by which parenthood is recognized beyond simply being a \u201cnatural or adoptive parent.\u201d They point to R.C. 3111.95(A), which accords the consenting husband of a woman inseminated through nonspousal artificial insemination the status of father of the child so conceived, even though the husband has no natural or adoptive relationship to the child. They also observe that R.C. 3111.95(B) provides that a sperm donor for a nonspousal artificial insemination \u201cshall not be treated in law or regarded as the natural father\u201d of any child resulting from such a procedure, despite having a biological relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, appellants argue that a \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent should be treated as a parent under R.C. 3109.04 for purposes of entering a shared parenting agreement. Appellants advocate a four-part test to determine whether a person is a \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent. Under this test, the court considers (1) whether the legal parent consents to and fosters the relationship between the \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent and the child, (2) whether the \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent has lived with the child, (3) whether the \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent performs parental functions for the child to a significant degree, and (4) whether a parent-child bond has been forged between the \u201csecond\u201d parent and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">{\u00b6 28} This four-part test has been used in other states to determine whether a psychological or second parent may be awarded custody. See <em>V.C. v. M.J.B. </em>(2000), 163 N.J. 200, 223, 748 A.2d 539 (test provides good framework for determining psychological parenthood in cases where petitioner has lived for a substantial period of time with child); <em>In re Custody of H.S.H.-K. </em>(1995), 193 Wis.2d 649, 658, 533 N.W.2d 419 (court may determine whether visitation is appropriate where nonparent petitioner first proves petitioner\u2019s parent-like relationship with child using four-part test, and a significant triggering event justifies state intervention in the child\u2019s relationship with biological or adoptive parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Ohio has adopted a similar test in the context of a wrongful death action. R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), the statute at issue in <em>Lawson v. Atwood </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 69, 536 N.E.2d 1167, provides that \u201can action for wrongful death shall be brought in the name of the personal representative of the decedent for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent.\u201d We held that such an action could be brought by a nonparent for his own exclusive benefit only when the nonparent could prove by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the natural parents of the child have disclaimed or abandoned parental rights to the child, (2) the person claiming the status of parent has performed the obligations of parenthood for a substantial period of time, (3) the child and the alleged parent have held themselves out to be parent and child for a substantial period of time, and (4) the relationship between the child and the alleged parent has been publicly recognized. Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">{\u00b6 30} The existence of such a test in a wrongful death action is not dispositive of the case at issue. A difference between <em>Lawson </em>and the case at issue is the absence of a statutory definition of \u201cparent\u201d in R.C. 2125.02, and the definition of \u201cparent and child relationship\u201d in R.C. 3111.01(A). Additionally, in <em>Lawson, </em>we emphasized that there is a significant distinction between the wrongful death action at issue and a dispute between parties competing for custody or the privileges and obligations of parenthood with respect to the child. Id., 42 Ohio St.3d at 72, 536 N.E.2d 1167. Moreover, R.C. 2125.02 is a remedial law and must be construed to compensate those who have been deprived of a relationship. Id. at 70, 536 N.E.2d 1167. In contrast, R.C. 3109.04(A)(2) focuses on the best interests of the child. Finally, in <em>Lawson, </em>prior to the child\u2019s death, the person claiming to be the child\u2019s parent had been awarded legal custody of the child. Id. at 71, 536 N.E.2d 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, as R.C. 3109.04 specifically uses the term \u201cparent\u201d and this term is defined in R.C. 3111.01, we find it inappropriate to adopt appellants\u2019 four-part test to broaden the narrow class of persons who are statutorily defined as parents for purposes of entering a shared parenting agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellants argue that a biological or adoptive parent has the fundamental constitutional right, which may not be restricted by statute, to voluntarily enter into a court-approved shared parenting plan with a \u201cpsychological\u201d or \u201csecond\u201d parent. The fundamental due process right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of one\u2019s children has been upheld in <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. However, this right does not embrace the right to have all decisions recognized or approved in law. In other words, although Teri\u2019s decision to co-parent her children with Shelly may be protected from interference by the state, Teri is not entitled to the benefit of statutes that are clearly inapplicable to such a familial arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Although we have concluded that Shelly does not qualify as a parent pursuant to R.C. 3109.04, we, like the court of appeals, \u201cdo not intend to discredit [appellants\u2019] goal of providing a stable environment for the children\u2019s growth.\u201d We note that although appellants urged the trial court to find that \u201cboth Petitioners have equal standing to parent the minor children,\u201d their brief filed in this court contains repeated references to \u201ccustody,\u201d and concludes with a plea for the court to recognize that they are \u201cequal custodial parents.\u201d Similarly, although their petition to the trial court is ostensibly for the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities of minor children, the petition clearly states that appellants request that the court award them \u201cthe legal status of co-custodians [of] the children.\u201d Accordingly, we have examined their claim for shared parenting in the custody context and conclude that the juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine whether a petition for shared custody is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(A) The juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction under the Revised Code as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(2) Subject to division (V) of section 2301.03 of the Revised Code, to determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">{\u00b6 38} The court of appeals held that the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the custody of the Bonfield children under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2), but that the court must exercise this jurisdiction in accordance with R.C. 3109.04. R.C. 2151.23(F)(1). The court concluded that R.C. 3109.04 limits the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction in allocating parental rights and responsibilities to \u201cparents,\u201d and that Shelly is not a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">{\u00b6 39} The juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court, even though the court has not first found the child to be delinquent, neglected, or dependent. <em>In re Torok </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 585, 53 O.O. 433, 120 N.E.2d 307, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. This exclusive responsibility \u201cto determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court\u201d of this state cannot be avoided merely because the petitioner is not a \u201cparent\u201d under R.C. 3109.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">{\u00b6 40} It is well settled under Ohio law that a juvenile court may adjudicate custodial claims brought by the persons considered nonparents at law. For example, <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, concerned a child whose biological mother had placed her from infancy in the care of a nonparent. The child lived with the nonparent for two years. In the ensuing custody dispute between the parent and the nonparent, <em>Perales </em>relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) rather than R.C. 3109.04, since the child at issue was not a ward of another court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 41} In contrast, this court has held that in a case where custody of children had already been determined by a domestic relations court in a divorce decree, and where the children are later determined to be abused, neglected, or dependent, the juvenile court has jurisdiction under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) to make a custody determination, but must do so in accordance with R.C. 3109.04. <em>In re Poling </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 211, 594 N.E.2d 589, paragraph two of the syllabus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 42} However, the court in <em>Poling </em>limited its holding to cases where the juvenile court has obtained jurisdiction over a child under R.C. 2151.353 on the basis that the child is abused, neglected, or dependent. The court did not consider whether all custody cases arising under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) must be decided under R.C. 3109.04, nor could such an interpretation of <em>Poling </em>be reconciled with Ohio\u2019s long-standing precedent that a juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine custody claims brought by nonparents. Therefore, we distinguish <em>Poling </em>and hold that the juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine the custody of the Bonfield children pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) without reference to R.C. 3109.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 43} We next elucidate the standard the juvenile court should use in disposing of appellants\u2019 petition. In <em>Perales, </em>we found that in the custody dispute between a parent and a nonparent, the juvenile court may not award custody to the nonparent without first making a finding of parental unsuitability. <em>In re Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, syllabus. This is because custody proceedings between a parent and a nonparent, unlike those between two parents, pose the possibility of terminating a parent\u2019s rights in favor of one who is not a parent. Id. at 96, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">{\u00b6 44} However, <em>Perales </em>involved an actual dispute between parties competing for custody. This is not the case here. In fact, appellants\u2019 petition was unopposed at the trial level and remains unopposed. In the petition, Teri voluntarily seeks to relinquish her right to sole custody of the children in favor of shared custodial rights with Shelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">{\u00b6 45} Parents may waive their right to custody of their children and are bound by an agreement to do so. <em>Masitto v.

What used to be known as joint custody is now known as shared parenting. Whatever the label, custody is still at the heart of what Teri Bonfield and Shelley Zachritz want the court to recognize and what they want to see endure. With an award of custody comes an acceptance of the responsibility for the care and direct supervision of children. Custody connotes more than a bond, it connotes presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b649} The General Assembly\u2019s shift in terminology from joint custody to shared parenting was never meant to make custody of children exclusive to what are considered traditional parents. As the majority points out, R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) sees to that. Ohio\u2019s custody laws allow for the legal recognition of an adult\u2019s commitment to a child, and that adult\u2019s right and responsibility to continue that commitment. What we call that adult is not important. What her children call her is.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AO9\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 50} The majority holds that \u201cpursuant to its authority under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2), the juvenile court may determine whether a shared custody agreement between Teri and Shelly is in the best interests of the children.\u201d In deciding this, the majority states that \u201cthe juvenile court has jurisdiction to determine the custody of the Bonfield children pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) <em>without reference to R.C. 3109.0k\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 51} As the majority correctly notes, R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) provides that the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction under the Revised Code \u201cto determine the custody of any child not a ward of another court of this state.\u201d This statutory provision merely <em>empowers </em>a juvenile court to entertain custody determination actions; it does not, however, provide the <em>enabling </em>mechanism by which such actions come before the juvenile court. Instead, R.C. 2151.23(F)(1) dictates <em>how </em>a party invokes the juvenile court\u2019s R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) jurisdiction:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe juvenile court shall exercise its jurisdiction in child custody matters in accordance with sections 3109.04, 3109.21 to 3109.36, and 5103.20 to 5103.28 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">{\u00b6 53} Thus, it is R.C. 2151.23(F)(1), not (A)(2), that targets procedures by which a party can properly invoke the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. Under the majority\u2019s reading of the statutory scheme, <em>anyone </em>could file for custody of <em>any </em>child simply by filing an \u201cR.C. 2151.23(A)(2) motion.\u201d Yet, the Revised Code generally limits the consideration of issues of custody/parenting of children to (1) circumstances of abuse, dependency, or neglect, see, generally, R.C. Chapter 2151, and (2) circumstances surrounding changes in the legal relationship of parents, such as divorce, legal separation, or annulment, R.C. 3109.04(A). By legislative choice, there must be a statutory trigger to invoke R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">{\u00b6 54} Here, the appellants sought to invoke the juvenile court\u2019s R.C. 2151.23(A) jurisdiction by way of R.C. 3109.04. Although this statute is a proper vehicle by which a party can invoke the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, the party must be a parent of a minor child from a marriage. R.C. 3109.04(A) provides that \u201cin any proceeding pertaining to the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities for the care of a child, * * * the court shall allocate the parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the minor children <em>of the marriage.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The statute then goes on to provide for ways in which the court may allocate parental rights and responsibilities. In this case, the R.C. 3109.04(A) marriage requirement forecloses reaching determinations under the remaining portions of R.C. 3109.04, such as whether Shelly is a \u201cparent\u201d under R.C. 3109.04(G). Because the General Assembly does not permit same-sex marriages, see R.C. 3101.01, Teri and Shelly are not married, the children are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cof the marriage,\u201d and R.C. 3109.04(A) is inapplicable. The juvenile court thus did not err in denying a grant of custody under R.C. 3109.04.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADF\">Sallee Fry Waterman, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8i\">Susan J.
