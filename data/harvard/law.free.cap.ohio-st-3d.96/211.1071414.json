Sweeney, Sr., J.</author>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">{\u00b6 1} In 1984, defendant-appellee, Robert O. Hayden, pled guilty to attempted rape and was sentenced to prison for a term of 5 to 15 years. In 1999, based solely on his conviction, the trial court determined that Hayden was a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d and notified him of his duty to register under R.C. 2950.03(A)(1). Appellee appealed from this order, arguing that his constitutional rights of confrontation and due process had been violated because he had not been afforded a hearing. In a split decision, the court of appeals reversed, holding that appellee\u2019s constitutional right to due process, including the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>confront his accusers, had been violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing. The cause is now before this court upon the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 2} This case involves yet another challenge to R.C. Chapter 2950, which contains Ohio\u2019s sex offender classification, registration, and notification laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 3} Initially, the state takes issue with the appellate court\u2019s application of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to R.C. Chapter 2950. That Revised Code chapter imposes registration requirements on those convicted of sexually oriented offenses. In particular, the state argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to provide a hearing did not violate this clause. However, at oral argument, appellee conceded that prior decisions from this court, notably <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 700 N.E.2d 570, and <em>State v. Williams </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 728 N.E.2d 342, preclude this argument. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 4} <em>Cook </em>holds that the scheme provided for in R.C. Chapter 2950 is civil, not punitive, in nature. Id., 83 Ohio St.3d at 422, 700 N.E.2d 570. <em>Williams </em>reaffirms that principle. Id., 88 Ohio St.3d at 528, 728 N.E.2d 342. Thus, the federal Confrontation Clause, which provides that \u201c[i]n all <em>criminal </em>prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d (emphasis added), clearly has no application. See, also, Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, which contains a similar guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, we hold that the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution do not apply to R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 6} However, the issue remains as to whether appellee\u2019s due process rights were violated. The right to procedural due process is found in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. To trigger protections under these clauses, a sexual offender must show that he was deprived of a protected liberty or property interest as a result of the registration requirement. See <em>Steele v. Hamilton Cty. Community Mental Health Bd. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 176, 181, 736 N.E.2d 10. Although due process is \u201c \u2018flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands,\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, the basic requirements under this clause are notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>State v. Hochhausler </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 455, 459, 668 N.E.2d 457. In particular, appellee finds fault with the trial court\u2019s failure to afford him a hearing on whether he is a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d who must comply with the registration requirements of R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>{\u00b6 7} At the outset we note that a statute is presumed constitutional and before a court may declare it unconstitutional it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">{\u00b6 8} Although Ohio has had sex offender registration statutes since 1963, see, e.g., former R.C. Chapter 2950, 130 Ohio Laws 669, the law became more complex in 1996 due in large part to New Jersey\u2019s 1994 passage of \u201cMegan\u2019s Law,\u201d N.J.StatAnn. 2C:7~1 et seq., and the 1994 enactment of the federal Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Section 14071, Title 42, U.S.Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Against this backdrop, R.C. Chapter 2950 was repealed and reenacted to provide protections to the public against sex offenders. 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2560. Specifically, the law divides sex offenders into three categories and imposes registration and sometimes notification requirements upon each class once the offender is released from incarceration. See, e.g., R.C. 2950.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2950.01(B) defines a \u201chabitual sex offender\u201d as a person who \u201cis convicted of or pleads guilty to a sexually oriented offense\u201d and who \u201cpreviously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more sexually oriented offenses.\u201d R.C. 2950.01(B)(1) and (2). In the case of an adult, R.C. 2950.01(E) defines a \u201csexual predator\u201d as a person who \u201chas been convicted of or pleaded guilty to committing a sexually oriented offense and is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses.\u201d Finally, the least restrictive designation, that of a \u201csexually oriented'offender,\u201d is not specifically defined in R.C. Chapter 2950. However, we have explained that a \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d is a person \u201cwho has committed a \u2018sexually oriented offense\u2019 as that term is defined in R.C. 2950.01(D) but who does not fit the description of either habitual sex offender or sexual predator.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>supra, 83 Ohio St.3d at 407, 700 N.E.2d 570; <em>Williams, </em>supra, 88 Ohio St.3d at 519, 728 N.E.2d 342. This is the classification in which the trial court placed appellee. The question is whether due process requires a hearing before a court may impose that label on a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 10} Recognizing that sexual predators and habitual sex offenders have a high risk of recidivism, R.C. 2950.02(A)(2), the law allows in certain cases for the public dissemination of information regarding the whereabouts of these offenders. See R.C. 2950.11. However, before the community notification requirement is imposed, the law requires that a hearing be held either before sentencing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>before an incarcerated sex offender is released to determine whether that person should be labeled a sexual predator or habitual sex offender who is likely to offend again. R.C. 2950.09(B)(1) and (C). A hearing is necessary because a factual determination must be made as to the offender\u2019s likelihood to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">(\u00b6 11} At the hearing, the offender and the prosecutor have the opportunity to testify, present evidence, and call and examine lay and expert witnesses, and the offender has the right to an attorney. R.C. 2950.09(B)(2); <em>State v. Eppinger </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 743 N.E.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 12} But Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme requires a hearing to determine sexual-offender status only for certain sex offenders. See R.C. 2950.11(B), which provides that for those convicted of a sexually oriented offense, the trial court \u201cshall\u201d hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is a sexual predator only if certain criteria apply. Appellee does not meet these criteria because he was sentenced before January 1, 1997, and his offense was not violent. R.C. 2950.11(B)(1) and (2). Therefore, he is not statutorily entitled to a classification hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 13} The question now becomes, is appellee constitutionally entitled to such a hearing? Again, the answer is no. Neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor the analogous clause in Ohio\u2019s Constitution, Section 16, Article I, requires a hearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellee has not shown that he was deprived of a protected liberty or property interest as a result of the registration requirement imposed without a hearing. A constitutionally protected liberty interest has been defined as freedom from bodily restraint and punishment. <em>Ingraham v. Wright </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 651, 673-674, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711, citing <em>Rochin v. California </em>(1952), 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183. Appellee has certainly not suffered any bodily restraint as a result of the registration requirement imposed on him as a sex offender. Nor has he been punished. In <em>State v. Eppinger </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 158, 165, 743 N.E.2d 881, we stated that \u201cR.C. Chapter 2950 is not meant to punish a defendant, but instead, \u2018to protect the safety and general welfare of the people of this state.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting R.C. 2950.02(B). See, also, <em>State v. Williams </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 527, 728 N.E.2d 342. (The registration provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 are neither criminal nor punitive in nature.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 15} In fact, affording appellee a hearing under these facts would be nothing more than an empty exercise. The point of such a hearing would be to determine whether appellee committed a sexually oriented offense. What evidence could appellee possibly present that would justify a finding that he is not? The fact of his conviction of attempted rape is established. When he was convicted of that crime, which is a sexually oriented offense under R.C. 2950.01(D)(1)(g), appellee was automatically classified as a sexually oriented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>offender and therefore must register with the sheriff of the county in which he resides as prescribed by R.C. 2950.04(A)(2). In <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 412, 700 N.E.2d 570, we held that \u201cthe registration and address verification provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950 are <em>de minimis </em>procedural requirements that are necessary to achieve the goals of R.C. Chapter 2950.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 16} The court of appeals\u2019 majority determined that the lack of a hearing denied appellee his constitutional right to due process, including the right to confront his accusers. In rejecting the majority\u2019s holding, Judge Frederick N. Young determined that the majority decision effectively deleted the \u201cdue\u201d from \u201cdue process.\u201d The dissent noted that appellee\u2019s conviction for a sexually oriented offense automatically conferred on him the status of a sexually oriented offender. Thus, the dissent explained, \u201c[w]hat follows \u2014 the registration requirement \u2014 is mandated by law. The trial court cannot \u2018determine\u2019 anything. It merely engages in the ministerial act of rubber-stamping the registration requirement on the offender.\u201d We agree with the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 17} Yet, appellee argues that defendants should have the opportunity for a hearing to avoid the possibility of mistakes, for instance such as the misidentification of the offender or offense. However, we note that appellee has not alleged that any particular mistake has occurred here. Thus, we find this argument to be pure conjecture. Even if such an error did arise, legal remedies such as mandamus are available to correct such an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 18} Accordingly, we hold that the Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution do not require a trial court to conduct a hearing to determine whether a defendant is a sexually oriented offender. Instead, according to R.C. Chapter 2950, if a defendant has been convicted of a sexually oriented offense as defined in R.C. 2950.01(D) and is neither a habitual sex offender nor a sexual predator, the sexually oriented offender designation attaches as a matter of law. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s determination that appellee is a sexually oriented offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Abt\">Douglas and Cook, JJ., concur in syllabus and judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b407-11\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">.

See <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (\u201cThe requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of liberty and property\u201d). In reaching this conclusion, the majority limits its analysis to whether the state has deprived Hayden of a \u201cfreedom from bodily restraint and punishment.\u201d It is not enough, however, to say that Hayden\u2019s procedural due process claim fails simply because he has not been restrained or punished by the sexually oriented offender classification. In this case, for example, Hayden argues that he has a constitutionally protected interest in his reputation that the state cannot impair without a hearing. For purposes of a procedural due process inquiry, a person has a constitutionally protected interest against \u201cgovernmental defamation\u201d that (1) is sufficiently derogatory to injure the person\u2019s reputation and (2) imposes \u201csome tangible and material state-imposed burden or alteration of his or her status or of a right in addition to the stigmatizing statement.\u201d <em>Doe v. Dept. of Pub. Safety </em>(C.A.2, 2001), 271 F.3d 38, 47, citing <em>Paul v. Davis </em>(1976), 424 U.S. 693, 701-702, 710-711, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405; see, also, <em>Cutshall v. Sundquist </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 193 F.3d 466, 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 21} Even when recognizing the so-called \u201cstigma plus\u201d test, see <em>Doe, </em>271 F.3d at 47, 50, as implicating a constitutionally protected liberty interest, Hayden\u2019s procedural due process claim fails. Unlike persons adjudicated to be sexual predators or habitual sexual offenders, a sexually oriented offender such as Hayden is not subject to community notification provisions. See R.C. 2950.10, 2950.11. Thus, the only burden imposed on a sexually oriented offender is the duty to register with the offender\u2019s county sheriff and verify periodically the offender\u2019s address. R.C. 2950.04 to 2950.07; see, also, <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 408, 700 N.E.2d 570. It is true that at least one federal appellate court has held that registration requirements imposed on sexual offenders qualify as a \u201cplus\u201d factor for purposes of the \u201cstigma plus\u201d test in procedural due process cases. See <em>Doe, </em>271 F.3d at 57. This court has already determined, however, that the registration and address verification requirements in R.C. Chapter 2950 impose only de minimis burdens on offenders subject to them. <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 412, 700 N.E.2d 570. An interest must be more than de minimis to trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. See <em>Goss v. Lopez </em>(1975), 419 U.S. 565, 576, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725; <em>Fuentes v. Shevin </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 67. 90. 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556, fn. 21.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Mathias H. Heck, Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, and Carley J. Ingram, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9c\">J. Dean Carro, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, even if there were a constitutionally protected interest at stake in his case, it remains doubtful that Hayden could prevail on his procedural due process claim. As the majority correctly observes, Hayden is a sexually oriented offender subject to statutory registration requirements simply by having pleaded guilty to attempted rape. See R.C. 2950.01(D)(1)(g) and 2950.04(A)(1). Thus, Hayden would be subject to the registration provisions (provided he received the notice required by R.C. 2950.03) <em>regardless </em>of the trial court\u2019s entry labeling him a \u201csexually oriented offender.\u201d In other words, the trial court imposed no new status on Hayden that did not already exist. Hayden has therefore received all the process to which he was due \u2014 namely, the underlying criminal proceedings resulting in his conviction. Cf. <em>State v. Ward </em>(1994), 123 Wash.2d 488, 869 P.2d 1062 (holding that Washington\u2019s sexual-offender registration requirement was a \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of guilty plea; thus, a trial court\u2019s failure to inform defendant of the requirement at the plea hearing did not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 23} With the foregoing observations, I concur in the syllabus and judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-7\">Douglas, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b409-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 24} I respectfully dissent.
