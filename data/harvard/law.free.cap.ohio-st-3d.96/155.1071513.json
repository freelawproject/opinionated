McKenzie of Hamilton, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0063477, with violating several provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility when he engaged in direct mail advertising of his legal services. Respondent answered, and the matter was referred to a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">{\u00b6 2} Based on evidence and stipulations received at a hearing on October 26, 2001, the panel found that in 1999, respondent, whose practice was primarily personal injury work, engaged a marketing company to mail out solicitation letters to prospective clients. The letters the marketing company transmitted on respondent\u2019s behalf contained testimonials from former clients. Also, the wording \u201cAdvertisement Only\u201d on some of the envelopes was not printed in red ink.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">{\u00b6 3} The panel also heard evidence that the fact that the words \u201cAdvertisement Only\u201d were not always in red ink was a printer\u2019s error. Additionally, the panel found that although respondent initially approved the testimonials, he eventually had the testimonials removed from the solicitation letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">{\u00b6 4} The panel concluded that respondent had violated DR 2~101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not use a direct mail solicitation that contains a testimonial of past or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>present clients pertaining to the lawyer\u2019s capability) and 2-101(F)(2)(e) (a lawyer may engage in solicitation by direct mail in specified limited circumstances provided the letter of solicitation in its text and on the envelope in which it is mailed includes the words \u201cADVERTISEMENT ONLY\u201d in type no smaller than 10 points and in red ink). After receiving mitigation evidence regarding respondent\u2019s good reputation and noting his complete cooperation with relator\u2019s investigation, the panel recommended that respondent receive a public reprimand.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AoX\">Stephen J.

Respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
