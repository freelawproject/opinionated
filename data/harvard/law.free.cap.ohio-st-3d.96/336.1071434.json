Hubbard filed a workers\u2019 compensation application, asserting that he had contracted malignant mesothelioma from years of heavy exposure to asbestos in the workplace. At his September 23, 1999 hearing, he submitted medical evidence corroborating his allegation. No contrary evidence was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 2} Despite the absence of rebuttal, a hearing officer for respondent Industrial Commission of Ohio referred decedent for a commission exam, citing commission resolution No. R96-1-01. On January 7, 2000, decedent was transported from his home to an examination in another county. He was presented for evaluation on a stretcher, unable to walk or stand. Examining physician Dr. Marc J. Dinga confirmed the diagnosis of industrial mesothelioma and sadly noted that decedent was literally \u201cwasting away.\u201d One week later, Hubbard died.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of decedent\u2019s death, the commission ordered that all action on the application be abated. Relator, widow-claimant Mary C. Hubbard, has now commenced an original action in mandamus before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 4} The parties agree and the evidence confirms that decedent expired from industrially induced mesothelioma. All agree that decedent timely sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits. They disagree on the widow-claimant\u2019s retention of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 5} Widow-claimant does not dispute that unaccrued benefits generally abate when a claimant dies. <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 463, 751 N.E.2d 974. She relies, however, on an exception to the rule carved by <em>Johnston.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 6} <em>Johnston </em>involved an application for a sizeable lump sum settlement in an allowed claim that the bureau did not process for eight months.. The claimant died in the interim from a nonwork-related cause, prompting the bureau to assert abatement. The widow countered with the accusation that the delay was unreasonable and proposed that an exception to the general abatement principles be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">{\u00b6 7} We agreed. Reviewing prior cases on the inheritability of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we concluded that \u201cthe provision of prompt and certain compensation to deserving claimants [is] no less fundamental to Ohio workers\u2019 compensation law than the principle that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are generally uninheritable.\u201d Id. at 473, 751 N.E.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Therefore, \u201calbeit slowly and unevenly, we have come to recognize the inherent injustice of requiring a claimant, whether he or she be a dependent seeking death benefits or an injured employee seeking disability compensation, to outlive delays in the administrative process. Regardless of the status of the claim at the time of death, the claimant\u2019s estate may recover the compensation that the claimant would have received, but for administrative delays, during his or her lifetime.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 9} The widow-claimant in this case argues that the processing of decedent\u2019s application was unreasonably delayed by, for example, the commission\u2019s insistence on a commission/bureau medical exam. The commission relied on resolution No. R96-1-01, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cWhereas pursuant to the provisions of Section 4123.68 of the Ohio Revised Code, before awarding compensation for disability or death due to silicosis, asbestosis, coal miners pneumoconiosis, or any other occupational disease of the respiratory tract resulting from injurious exposure to dust, the Administrator is to refer the claim to a qualified medical specialist for examination and recommendation with regard to diagnosis, extent of disability, or other medical questions connected with the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 11} Widow-claimant argues that the resolution was inapplicable and the examination unnecessary because decedent had mesothelioma, not asbestosis. The commission declares that the latter encompasses the former under the definition set forth in R.C. 4123.68(AA):</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAsbestosis means a disease caused by inhalation or ingestion of asbestos, demonstrated by x-ray examination, biopsy, autopsy, or other objective medical or clinical tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 13} This contention is rejected. The above specifies <em>\u201ca </em>disease\u201d contracted through asbestos inhalation, not <em>\u201cany </em>disease\u201d contracted from same. Asbestosis is <em>\u201ca </em>disease\u201d caused by asbestos and it should be presumed that asbestosis was the condition addressed by the definition and not mesothelioma. The two are distinct. Asbestosis is a pneumoconiosis, an \u201c[inflammation commonly leading to fibrosis of the lungs.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (26th Ed.1995) 153 and 1391. Mesothelioma, on the other hand, is a cancer, \u201c[a] rare neoplasm derived from the lining cells of the pleura and peritoneum which grows as a thick sheet covering the viscera * * *.\u201d Id. at 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 14} The commission, therefore, erred in effectively treating the two conditions interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b6 15} The commission also offers this provision from R.C. 4123.68(AA):</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cAll conditions, restrictions, limitations, and other provisions of this section, with reference to the payment of compensation or benefits on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>silicosis or coal miners\u2019 pneumoconiosis apply to * * * any other occupational disease of the respiratory tract resulting from injurious exposures to <em>dust.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOS\">Kelley &amp; Ferraro, L.L.P., Thomas M. Wilson and Corey W. Frost, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AxC\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Dennis L. Hufstader, Assistant Attorney General, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 17} The commission mistakenly emphasizes the word \u201cany\u201d when the operative word is \u201cdust.\u201d Decedent\u2019s mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos, and asbestos is a fiber, not a dust. This provision is, therefore, inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 18} The commission additionally cites R.C. 4123.53(A), which allows the bureau to order \u201cany employee * * * to submit to a medical examination * * * as provided by the rules of the commission or the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d This provision does not advance the commission\u2019s cause, because the relevant \u201crules of the commission\u201d have already been found inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, the commission alleges a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, citing R.C. 4123.60, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIf the decedent would have been lawfully entitled to have applied for an award at the time of his death the administrator may, after satisfactory proof to warrant an award and payment, award and pay an amount, not exceeding the compensation which the decedent might have received, but for his death, for the period prior to the date of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 21} This statute clearly empowers the commission to make an award to the widow-claimant. The commission asserts that because widow-claimant did'not specifically cite this section and apply for benefits thereunder, she has not exhausted all administrative avenues. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 22} A writ of mandamus is hereby granted, ordering the commission to vacate its order of abatement and to reactivate the claim for further proceedings to determine the amount of benefits owed to the widow-claimant for the period of April 23, 1999 through January 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
