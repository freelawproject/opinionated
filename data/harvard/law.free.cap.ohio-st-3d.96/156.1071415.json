Smith owns respondent All Ohio Insurance Agency, Inc. (\u201cAll Ohio\u201d), which employs respondents Gregory P. Smith and Sheila A. Smith. The Smiths operated a business known as respondent License Recovery, which is wholly owned and operated as a-division of All Ohio. None of the Smiths has ever been admitted to the practice of law in Ohio or any other jurisdiction, and All Ohio and License Recovery are neither legal professional corporations nor owned or operated by any individual admitted to practice law in Ohio or any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">{\u00b6 2} Doing business as License Recovery, respondents obtained computerized lists identifying individuals who were subject to driver\u2019s license suspensions by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles and used these lists to solicit customers to assist in retaining their driving privileges or appealing their administrative suspensions. Respondents prepared documents, such as petitions to modify point suspensions, and provided advice and instructions for filing the documents in various Ohio courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2000, relator, Columbus Bar Association, filed a complaint before the Board of Commissioners on the Unauthorized Practice of Law, alleging that by preparing documents and giving advice for filing the documents in Ohio courts, respondents engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Respondents filed an answer, and the parties subsequently filed a stipulation of facts and waiver of notice of hearing. In the stipulation, respondents admitted that their preparation of documents and provision of advice for filing them constituted the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">{\u00b6 4} In its final report filed March 28, 2002, the board found the facts as previously set forth and concluded that respondents had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The board recommended that respondents be enjoined from engaging in further activity constituting the unauthorized practice of law in Ohio and that costs be taxed to respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">{\u00b6 5} On review of the record, we adopt the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the board. \u201c\u2018The practice of law * * * embraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v.
