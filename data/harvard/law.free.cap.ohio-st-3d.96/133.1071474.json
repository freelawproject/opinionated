Abdul Hakiym Zakiy, challenges the denial of his application to reopen his direct appeal under App.R. 26(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">{\u00b6 2} Davie was convicted of the aggravated murders of John Ira Coleman and Tracy Jefferys and sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. Davie </em>(Dec. 27, 1995), Trumbull App. No. 92-T-4693, 1995 WL 870019. Meanwhile, prior to defense counsel\u2019s filing Davie\u2019s notice of appeal before this court, Davie, on February 12, 1996, filed a pro se application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204. However, the court of appeals dismissed the application in a judgment entry because Davie\u2019s appeal had been filed with this court on February 26, 1996, and pursuant to former S.Ct.Prac.R. II(2)(D)(1), 68 Ohio St.3d CXXV, the court of appeals was divested of jurisdiction. <em>State v. Davie </em>(July 15, 1996), Trumbull App. No. 92-T-4693. Thereafter, we also affirmed his conviction and sentence on November 26, 1997. <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">{\u00b6 3} On March 1, 2000, appellant filed the instant application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan, </em>alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals found that Davie had failed to show good cause for filing his application more than 90 days after that court\u2019s judgment was journalized, as required by App.R. 26(B)(2)(b). However, notwithstanding the untimeliness of appellant\u2019s application, the court of appeals reviewed Davie\u2019s 24 assignments of error, and found them all to be without merit. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Davie has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696. To show ineffective assistance, Davie must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had they presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 6} Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Smith \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201cappl[y] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. \u201cMoreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151-152, 761 N.E.2d 18; see, also, <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745,103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 8} We have reviewed appellant\u2019s four propositions of law alleging, inter alia, deficient performance by appellate counsel. In none of the four propositions of law has Davie raised \u201ca <em>genuine issue </em>as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 9} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b326-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
