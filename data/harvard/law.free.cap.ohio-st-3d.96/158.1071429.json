We agree that Doe\u2019s application should be denied now, but we require a longer waiting period to allow us to evaluate his ability to maintain the medication regimen and health necessary for the regulation of his bipolar disorder. Accordingly, we deny Doe\u2019s application for admission to the bar and grant him permission to reapply for the bar exam in February 2003. We further order that the record of proceedings in this case be sealed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0y\">John Doe II, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVL\">Robert E. Sweeney Co., L.P.A., and John L.
