Rowan and sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. Sneed </em>(May 22, 1989), Stark App. No. CA-6976, 1989 WL 63272. On February 12, 1992, we also affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Sneed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 3, 584 N.E.2d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">{\u00b6 3} In addition, the trial court denied Sneed\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief, and the court of appeals affirmed that judgment. <em>State v. Sneed </em>(Sept. 29, 2000), Stark App. No. 1999CA00339, 2000 WL 1476140. We declined to accept Sneed\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Sneed </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 1428, 741 N.E.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 4} On November 8, 2001, appellant filed the instant application for reopening with the court of appeals pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 5} In denying appellant\u2019s application for reopening, the court of appeals relied on the reasoning \u201ccontained in the State of Ohio\u2019s response in opposition.\u201d <em>State v. Sneed </em>(Jan. 14, 2002), Stark App. No. CA-6976. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 6} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard to assess whether Sneed has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen his appeal under App.R. 26(B)(5). See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696. To show ineffective assistance, Sneed must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had they presented those claims on appeal. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Sneed \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Strickland </em>charges us to \u201cappl[y] a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and to \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. \u201cMoreover, we must bear in mind that appellate counsel need not raise every possible issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151-152, 761 N.E.2d 18.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AK-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Robert D. Horowitz, Stark County Prosecuting Attorney, and Ronald Mark Caldwell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AzF\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, and Christa M. Hohmann, Assistant State Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">{\u00b6 8} We have reviewed appellant\u2019s three propositions of law alleging, inter alia, deficient performance by appellate counsel. In none of the three propositions of law has Sneed raised <em>\u201ca genuine issue </em>as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d before the court of appeals, as required under App.R. 26(B)(5). (Emphasis added.) This decision renders moot Sneed\u2019s other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 9} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
