Both counts carried firearm specifications. The charges were in connection with the shooting death of defendant\u2019s wife, Lisa.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 2} On September 4, 1998, Jeffrey Miller, defendant-appellee, stayed home while his wife, Lisa, went to work. Defendant spoke briefly with his neighbor, Ed Capp, and mentioned that a couple of checks were missing and that he had asked Lisa about them earlier. Defendant told Capp that he planned to go over to his uncle\u2019s property that afternoon to go shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant arrived at his uncle Allen Massena\u2019s home around 12:30 p.m. and they left to look at a truck that defendant was considering purchasing. After being unable to find the truck, the two men returned to Massena\u2019s home to target practice. Defendant and Massena shot defendant\u2019s .357 Magnum. After the two finished target practice, defendant unloaded the gun, put the gun back into the holster, placed the remaining unfired ammunition in the back of his truck, and put the unloaded .357 in a separate place in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 4} Around 4:00 p.m., Capp observed defendant sitting on his sun porch and went over to invite him to join him in an area of Ashtabula that includes several bars. Defendant declined, stating that he was going to wait for Lisa to come home.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">{\u00b6 5} Later that night, around 9:00 p.m., defendant went to the Iroquois Lounge and found Capp. Capp noticed that defendant had been drinking prior to entering the Iroquois. Capp bought defendant a beer, and the two men drank a shot. Defendant told Capp that Lisa did not come home and that he had left her a note stating that he was going to leave her. Defendant asked Capp if he would come over to his home and \u201cget his hardware.\u201d Capp understood this to mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that defendant wanted Capp to help him remove his guns from his home. The two men left the bar in separate cars and met back at defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">{\u00b6 6} After defendant and Capp tried unsuccessfully to light a bonfire, the two men entered defendant\u2019s house, and Capp sat down at the kitchen table while defendant went upstairs to bring down his guns. While Capp was seated at the kitchen table, he read a note that defendant had left there for Lisa. Capp testified that defendant stated in the note that he was leaving Lisa and that her crafts, her gambling, and her interests meant more than their marriage. According to Capp, defendant stated in the note that he was leaving to \u201cpursue other interests or avenues.\u201d The note also indicated that defendant did not think that Lisa\u2019s work schedule, which included working weekends, was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 7} Defendant came back downstairs carrying a .357 Magnum revolver in a holster. Capp told defendant that he did not want to bring defendant\u2019s guns into his own home unless they were unloaded. Defendant unloaded the .357 Magnum revolver and handed the gun to Capp. Capp took the revolver and checked to be certain that there were no bullets in the gun and then placed the gun back into its holster. Capp handed the gun back to defendant, who placed it on the kitchen table before going upstairs to retrieve his other guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 8} Defendant returned with two shotguns that were both loaded. Capp watched as defendant unloaded the rifles and returned upstairs. Capp walked over to the stairs and saw defendant at the top of the stairs holding an ammunition box when Capp heard the sound of the automatic garage door opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 9} Capp said, \u201cLisa\u2019s home,\u201d and he went back into the kitchen and picked up the revolver and the two shotguns. As Capp was leaving, he dropped one of the shotguns. Defendant told Capp, \u201cNever mind. Leave them.\u201d Capp left without the guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 10} Lisa\u2019s daughter-in-law, Karen Garside, later testified that she received a telephone call from the defendant at approximately 10:00 p.m. Defendant asked to speak to Karen\u2019s husband, Scott, Lisa\u2019s son. Karen informed defendant that Scott was not at home. Karen testified that defendant told her that he was looking for Lisa and wondered whether she knew where she was or whether she was with Scott. Karen told defendant that she did not know, and defendant asked Karen to have Scott call him when he returned. Defendant told Karen he was coming over to her home, but Karen asked him not to. Karen testified that defendant sounded drunk and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 11} Karen testified that she received another call from defendant around 10:20 p.m. in which he informed her that Lisa had returned, and he asked whether Scott had returned as well. Karen informed defendant that Scott had not returned, and defendant asked again that Karen have Scott call him when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Scott returned. Karen again agreed to do so. Karen testified that she could hear Lisa in the background during this telephone call. Karen also testified that the tone of defendant\u2019s voice would stagger; he would be irritated one moment, anxious and worried the next, and she could tell once again that he had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">{\u00b6 12} Melissa Garside, Lisa\u2019s daughter, testified that on September 4, 1998, she and Lisa had planned to meet at Lisa\u2019s home at 9:00 p.m. so Melissa could pick up a bed. Melissa called her mother\u2019s house at 8:55 p.m. to tell her that she was running late but received no answer, and the answering machine did not activate. Melissa tried again unsuccessfully to call her mother at 9:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. At approximately 10:20 p.m., Melissa reached her mother on the phone. Lisa informed her daughter that her husband, defendant, was \u201cdrunk off his ass and he\u2019s playing with all his guns.\u201d Immediately after that, defendant got on the phone and told Melissa, \u2018Your mother is busy right now. You\u2019ll have to talk to her later.\u201d Defendant then hung up on Melissa.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 13} Jason White, the Millers\u2019other next-door neighbor, observed Lisa pull into her driveway and park in the garage. White heard the car door close and then heard defendant, who sounded angry, state, \u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up bitch, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d White testified that an hour later, he heard a gunshot. He testified that he did not attempt to call 911 because he often heard gunshots coming from the Miller residence. White also testified that defendant drank a lot and had a beer in his hand every time White saw him.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 14} Kimberly Cook, a dispatcher for the Ashtabula County Sheriffs Department, testified that defendant made two calls that night regarding an incident at his home. Defendant made the first call at 10:28 p.m. and claimed that the shooting was an accident. The second call was received at 10:30 p.m. Both calls were recorded by the 911 recording equipment and both calls were played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 15} Officer Ronald Kaydo of the Ashtabula Police Department was the first to arrive at the scene. Officer Kaydo testified that the revolver was lying on the kitchen table, about three feet from Lisa\u2019s body. He also observed a holster lying on the floor. Officer Kaydo testified that the holster had some damage to the end of it. Officer Kaydo observed Lisa slumped over the table and defendant with his left hand on the back of Lisa\u2019s neck, who stated that he was trying to stop the bleeding. Defendant said that \u201cit was an accident, that he accidentally shot her.\u201d Officers conducted a safety sweep of the house. In the upstairs bedroom they found a large ammunition box, ammunition, and shotguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 16} Richard Turbok, a firearms examiner with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, testified that to a reasonable degree of certainty, the bullet found lodged in the wall stud of the kitchen in the Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>home was fired from defendant\u2019s .357 Magnum revolver. Turbok also testified as to the amount of force necessary to pull the trigger of the .357 Magnum revolver to make it fire. Turbok explained that the revolver could be discharged in single action or double action mode. He testified that the amount of weight it takes for the trigger to be pulled to fire the weapon was 6 pounds when the gun was in single action mode and 12/6 pounds of pressure when the gun was in double action mode. Dr. Robert Challener, the Chief Deputy Coroner in Cleveland, performed the autopsy on Lisa Miller and determined that she had bled to death from having been shot once in the face from a distance of approximately 18 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 17} Defendant was indicted on charges of aggravated murder with a firearm specification in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), and felony murder with a firearm specification in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B). A jury returned a verdict finding defendant not guilty of aggravated murder but guilty of murder while committing an offense of violence (felonious assault) and found that defendant had had a firearm while committing the offense of violence and had used it to facilitate the offense of murder while committing that offense. Defendant was sentenced to serve fifteen years to life in prison for felony murder and three years for the firearm specification with the two sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 18} In a split decision, the Ashtabula Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court for a new trial. The court of appeals held that because defendant had shot the victim in a vital portion of her body at a close range, the act had to be either intentional or accidental. Therefore, defendant could not have committed the underlying offense of felonious assault as a matter of law. Further, the court of appeals held that a statement made by the victim to a coworker was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 19} The matter is now before this court upon the allowance of a motion for a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 20} Today, this court must decide three issues: whether felony murder as defined in R.C. 2903.02(B) is supported by evidence that establishes that the defendant shot the victim knowingly when the underlying offense of violence charged is felonious assault; whether the unanimous concurrence of all three appellate judges was necessary for a reversal of the judgment in this case pursuant to Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; and whether witness testimony that demonstrates a declarant\u2019s then-existing state of mind is properly admitted when the testimony does not offer reasoning for the-particular state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Felony Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">{\u00b6 21} The newly enacted felony murder statute, R.C. 2903.02, became effective on June 30, 1998, well before the crimes occurred in this case. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201c(B) No person shall cause the death of another as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree * *</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 23} The underlying offense of violence for which defendant was charged in this case was felonious assault. Felonious assault, a second degree felony, is defined by R.C. 2903.11:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(A) No person shall <em>knowingly </em>* * *:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b626} \u201c(2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 2901.22 defines the culpable mental states in Ohio and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(B) A person acts <em>knowingly, regardless of his purpose, </em>when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">{\u00b6 29} The court of appeals appeared to have been troubled by the fact that the state charged the defendant with two crimes, thereby providing alternate theories of what occurred on September 4,1998. \u201cFrom the beginning, it was the state\u2019s contention that appellant intentionally shot his wife in the head. The defense, however, argued that the shooting was accidental. Clearly, one of those two choices represents the truth. Either appellant intended to shoot his wife, or it was accidental. If it was intentional, then appellant committed either aggravated murder or murder, depending on whether there was prior calculation and design. If it was unintentional, i.e., the gun was accidentally discharged while appellant was holding it or waiving it around, then such conduct would constitute negligent homicide. In either event, it was not a felonious assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 30} The state readily acknowledges that it attempted to prove at trial that defendant purposely shot his wife. In fact, the state attempted to prove that defendant purposely shot his wife with prior calculation and design: aggravated murder. However, the prosecution is entitled to offer differing theories as to what actually transpired in the commission of an offense and is therefore entitled to use its discretion in deciding which charges to level against the defendant. See <em>State ex rel. Nagle v. Olin </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 341, 347, 18 O.O.3d 503, 415 N.E.2d 279. In this case, the prosecution believed that the facts could support a conviction for either aggravated murder (a purposeful killing with prior calculation and design) or felony murder (a killing as a proximate result of the offender\u2019s committing or attempting to commit an offense of violence that is a felony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>first or second degree, e.g., felonious assault). It was the jury\u2019s duty to assess which charge, if any, was supported by the facts presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 31} In reversing the felony murder conviction, the court of appeals critically misconstrued the standard of mens rea necessary to commit felony murder. Felonious assault is defined as <em>knowingly </em>causing, or attempting to cause, physical harm to another by means of a deadly weapon. R.C. 2903.11(A). A person acts <em>knowingly, regardless of purpose, </em>when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist. R.C. 2901.22(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 32} The jury could certainly find that when the defendant placed a loaded gun within eighteen inches of his wife\u2019s head and shot it at her with such aim that he shot her in the cheek, he was aware that his conduct would probably cause a certain result, i.e., harm to his wife. The jury could reasonably believe that in an effort to injure his wife, defendant aimed the gun at a nonvital organ in an attempt to injure only, and one of them moved suddenly. The jury could reasonably believe that the shooting was not an accident. If the jury did not believe that the defendant intended to cause his wife\u2019s death, the evidence clearly supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant knew that physical harm to his wife was probable. The evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for felony murder based on felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 33} If defendant knowingly caused physical harm to his wife by firing the gun at her through a holster at close range, he is guilty of felonious assault. The fact that she died from her injuries makes him guilty of felony murder, regardless of his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 34} The defendant contends that since felony murder has a lesser mens rea standard (knowingly) than murder (purposely), and since the two crimes carry the same punishment, prosecutors will now seek murder convictions under the felony murder statute based on felonious assault. However, prosecutors can still charge in the alternative and generally seek an indictment most aligned with the facts of the case. In addition, the General Assembly has chosen to define felony murder in this manner, and the General Assembly is presumed to know the consequences of its legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, Ohio Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b6 35} Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA majority of the judges hearing the cause shall be necessary to render a judgment. * * * No judgment resulting from a trial by jury shall be reversed on the weight of the evidence except by the concurrence of all three judges hearing the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>{\u00b6 37} The state argues that the decision of the court of appeals must be reversed, in part because the decision was based on the manifest weight of the evidence and was supported by only two of the three judges on the appellate panel. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the decision to reverse was based on the sufficiency of the evidence rather than the manifest weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 38} This court recently clarified that the legal concepts of \u201csufficiency of the evidence\u201d and \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d are quantitatively and qualitatively different. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541, paragraph two of the syllabus. We have held, \u201cTo reverse a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the judgment is not sustained by sufficient evidence, only a concurring majority of a panel of a court of appeals reviewing the judgment is necessary.\u201d Id., paragraph three of the syllabus. However, to \u201creverse a judgment of a trial court on the weight of the evidence, when the judgment results from a trial by jury, a unanimous concurrence of all three judges on the court of appeals panel reviewing the case is required.\u201d Id., paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 39} While elsewhere calling it a sufficiency argument, the court of appeals ultimately held that \u201cappellant\u2019s [defendant\u2019s] argument that his conviction for felony-murder was against the <em>manifest weight </em>of the evidence is sustained, albeit for different reasons than set forth in his brief.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In reviewing the basis for its reversal, we find that the court of appeals clearly weighed the evidence to reach its conclusion as to the appropriateness of the felony murder charge. Thus, the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of the judgment of the trial court based on the manifest weight of the evidence was unconstitutional with the concurrence of only two judges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 40} During the course of defendant\u2019s trial, Ken Sironen, a coworker of Lisa\u2019s, testified that on the afternoon of September 4, 1998, just hours before defendant shot and killed Lisa, Lisa told him, \u201cIf I would come up shot in the head, that bastard [defendant] did it.\u201d The court of appeals held that this statement was hearsay, that did not fall into any exception, and therefore should not have been admitted. The court held that the statement in question went beyond Lisa\u2019s then-existing state of mind. \u201cIf she had merely said that she was fearful of appellant, that would have been admissible. Instead, she expressed her specific belief that appellant might kill her by shooting her in the head. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>culpability is precisely what the state was attempting to prove. Thus, this statement fell within the exception to the exception as set forth in the latter half of Evid.R. 803(3) which specifically excluded \u2018a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 41} Evid.R. 803 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c(3) * * * A statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 21, 514 N.E.2d 394, this court permitted testimony that the victim was fearful and apprehensive, but we held that the state-of-mind exception \u201cdoes not permit witnesses to relate any of the declarant\u2019s statements as to why he held a particular state of mind.\u201d Further, we held that the testimony sought to be introduced must refer to the present rather than the past. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 46} Out-of-court statements about a declarant\u2019s then-existing mental condition are considered trustworthy because their spontaneity makes them as reliable as similar kinds of statements made on the witness stand. Weissenberger, Ohio Evidence (2002) 414, Section 803.30. However, the court of appeals held that this statement as to why the victim feared the defendant was too detailed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">{\u00b6 47} The trial court voir dired Sironen extensively before letting him testify and limited his testimony to the statement, \u201cIf I would come up shot in the head, that bastard did it.\u201d We conclude that the statement was properly admitted as an expression of Lisa\u2019s fear of her husband and did not include detail as to why Lisa feared her husband. Therefore, under <em>Apanovitch, </em>the statement was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">{\u00b6 48} Because we hold that felony murder as defined in R.C. 2903.02(B), with the underlying offense of violence being felonious assault, is supported by evidence that establishes that the defendant knowingly caused physical harm to the victim, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court. Moreover, we hold that the court of appeals\u2019 split decision reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment based on the manifest weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>evidence was unconstitutional pursuant to Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Judgment reversed and verdict reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b585-5\">Douglas, Resnick and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b585-6\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">. We note that the court of appeals sent the matter back for a new trial. Defendant was indicted on aggravated murder and felony murder. The jury acquitted him of aggravated murder, and the court of appeals reversed his conviction for felony murder and held that the jury should not have considered it. From our reading, there were no charges left on which defendant could be tried.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b585-7\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZfz\">concurring in judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 49} There was sufficient evidence to support Miller\u2019s conviction for felony murder under R.C. 2903.02(B). I therefore agree with the majority\u2019s resolution of the state\u2019s first proposition of law. I cannot agree, however, with the majority\u2019s treatment of the remaining propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 50} The majority sustains the state\u2019s second proposition of law, concluding that the court of appeals committed constitutional error by reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment on a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence rationale with the concurrence of only two judges. See Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. This conclusion is judicially imprudent and legally incorrect. First, the majority\u2019s resolution of the first proposition of law necessarily decides that the court of appeals erred in its analysis of the felony murder issue. Our decision that the court of appeals should not have reversed <em>at all </em>on that issue renders moot any discussion of whether the court of appeals was required to do so unanimously.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 51} Second, the majority\u2019s resolution of the unanimity issue is simply wrong as a matter of law. It is true that the court of appeals sustained an assignment of error in which Miller alleged that his felony murder conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. But even a cursory reading of the opinion below shows that the court of appeals did not actually hold that Miller\u2019s conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Rather, the court of appeals held (incorrectly) that \u201cthe charge against appellant of felony-murder, based upon the underlying crime of felonious assault, was not possible,\u201d and thus, \u201cit was error for the trial court to allow that charge to go to the jury.\u201d This rationale reveals nothing other than the court of appeals\u2019 belief that there was <em>insufficient evidence as a matter of law </em>to allow the jury to consider a felony-murder instruction. And a reversal based on insufficiency of evidence does not require unanimity on the part of the court of appeals. See Section 3(B)(3), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 52} Finally, I decline to join the majority\u2019s disposition of the hearsay issue raised in the state\u2019s third proposition of law. The majority decides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>statement at issue \u2014 the victim\u2019s declaration \u201cIf I would come up shot in the head, that bastard [Miller] did it\u201d \u2014 is admissible under the Evid.R. 803(3) exception to the hearsay rule. Evid.R. 803(3) allows evidence of an otherwise inadmissible hearsay statement that is \u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), <em>but not including a statement of memo'll or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed </em>unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 53} It is true that our cases have applied Evid.R. 803(3) to permit testimony that the victim was fearful of the defendant. See, e.g., <em>State v. O\u2019Neal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 402, 411, 721 N.E.2d 73; <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 677, 687 N.E.2d 1358; <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 21, 514 N.E.2d 394. But the statement at issue in this case says nothing about the victim\u2019s fear of Miller; it states only the victim\u2019s <em>belief </em>that Miller would be her killer if she were ever (ishot in the head.\u201d Such a statement is beyond the scope of the Evid.R. 803(3) exception. Cf. <em>State v. Awkal </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 324, 331, 667 N.E.2d 960 (noting that certain statements, while indicative of the victim\u2019s state of mind, exceeded the scope of the <em>Apanovitch </em>rule because they did not indicate that the victim feared the defendant). In concluding otherwise, the majority has interpreted Evid.R. 803(3) to allow something that the plain language of the rule forbids \u2014 a hearsay statement of belief to prove the fact believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 54} I would therefore find that the victim\u2019s statement was inadmissible hearsay. I still agree, however, with today\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals because the trial court\u2019s admission of the hearsay statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that Miller caused his wife\u2019s death was not at issue; the only question was whether Miller shot her knowingly, purposely, or accidentally. The wife\u2019s hearsay statement was probative, if at all, to the question of whether Miller purposely killed her. The trial outcome, however, establishes that the jury was unaffected by the hearsay statement\u2019s implication of a purpose to kill. The fact that the jury found Miller guilty of felony murder under R.C. 2903.02(B) rather than aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A) establishes that the jury was unconvinced that Miller acted purposely. Accordingly, Miller suffered no discernible prejudice from the erroneous admission of hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 55} For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment but decline to join the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b586-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ALag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Thomas L.
