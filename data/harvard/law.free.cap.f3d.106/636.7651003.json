Muscarello had pled guilty. Count Three charged Muscarello with knowingly using and carrying a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Based on the presentence report (PSR), the court dismissed Count Three, to which Muscarello had already pled guilty and on which he had already been convicted. Agreeing with the government that the district court erred in dismissing the firearms count, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ain\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b755-18\">Pursuant to a plea agreem\u00e9nt, Muscarello pleaded guilty in May 1995 to drug charges and to \u201cusing and carrying\u201d a firearm in relation to those crimes. The factual basis for the guilty plea, which was signed for approval by Musearello\u2019s attorney, established that \u201c[l]ocated inside the glove compartment of the Defendant Muscarello\u2019s Ford truck was a loaded firearm which the Defendant knowing [sic] possessed in his vehicle and <em>carried </em>for protection <em>in relation </em>to the above described drug trafficking offense\u201d (emphasis added). Muscarello did not object to the factual basis supporting his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-19\">After Muscarello was thus convicted but prior to his being sentenced, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Bailey v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>significantly narrowing the \u201cuse\u201d facet of \u00a7 924(c) (but not addressing the \u201ccarrying\u201d facet). This prompted Muscarello to file a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) to quash or dismiss the firearm count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After holding a hearing on Muscarello\u2019s motion, the district court granted it, dismissing and quashing Count Three. In so doing, the district court chose no longer to credit the factual basis presented by the government and concurred in by Muscarello, but instead to switch its reliance exclusively to the following two paragraphs from Muscarello\u2019s post-conviction PSR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-20\">As to the weapon, Muscarello does not deny his possession of the pistol. The pistol was in the glove compartment of his truck where it had been for a long period of time. He denies any conscious decision to carry the gun in relation to the marijuana sale, and stated that he carried in rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tion to his job with the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriffs office as balif [sic] at the courthouse in Amite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\">In 1954, [Muscarello] became constable of the 6th Ward of Tangipahoa Parish, a mostly rural area that included the farming community of Tiekfaw. He held this position until 1958. In 1957 Tiekfaw was incorporated, and Muscarello was elected Chief of Police in the town. He maintained both positions until his term as constable expired in 1958. Muscarello was the Chief of Police in Tiekfaw until his retirement in 1987. From 1987 until his arrest on December 8, 1994, he was employed with the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriffs office, working as a bailiff in the 21st Judicial District Courthouse, Amite, Louisiana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The court stated that \u201c[t]he equities herein favor [Muscarello]\u201d and concluded that Mus-carello \u201cdid not knowingly possess <em>in relation </em>to a drug-trafficking crime,\u201d but that \u201c[t]o the contrary, defendant, his employment background considered, knowingly possessed in the glove compartment of his vehicle in furtherance of his job requirements and not for active employment in the charged transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The government moved for reconsideration but the district court denied that motion despite its acknowledgment that Mus-carello, \u201cin the guilty plea colloquy, [had] acquiesced in and admitted to the government\u2019s factual basis[J\u201d The court went on to note that \u201cthis [was] a <em>pre-Bailey </em>composition by the government and a <em>pre-Bailey </em>consideration by defendant and his counsel.\u201d The court then quoted the foregoing paragraphs from Muscarello\u2019s PSR again, and repeated the conclusion that Muscarello \u201cdid <em>carry </em>a firearm in a locked glove compartment of his vehicle, but not <em>in relation </em>to the commission of a drug-trafficking crime.\u201d The case is before us for review by virtue of the government\u2019s timely filing of a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">To support a conviction under \u00a7 924(c), the evidence must prove that the Defendant (1) used or carried a firearm, (2) during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government concedes that, after <em>Bailey, </em>the evidence in the instant case will not support a conviction for <em>use </em>under \u00a7 924(c). The government nevertheless contends that, as <em>Bailey </em>did not address the <em>carrying </em>facet of \u00a7 924(c), our prior jurisprudence on carrying remains applicable, and the factual basis is more than sufficient to support Muscarello\u2019s conviction for carrying the firearm. We agree. Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Rivas </em>recognizes that <em>Bailey </em>does not alter our prior precedent analyzing the \u201ccarrying\u201d facet of \u00a7 924(c), at least when the gun is possessed in a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, \u201cthe \u2018carrying\u2019 requirement of \u00a7 924(c) is met if the operator of the vehicle knowingly possesses the firearm in the vehicle during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although none question that (1) the possession element of the carrying facet of \u00a7 924(c) was met by the uncontested fact that Muscarello knowingly possessed a loaded pistol in the glove compartment of his truck, or (2) the gun was thus possessed \u201cduring\u201d the commission of the drug-trafficking crime, the district court determined on the basis of the PSR that the \u201cin relation to\u201d element was not present. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>We conclude that the district court clearly erred in this determination, and did so as a result of two errors of law. First, the district court erred in discrediting and disregarding the factual basis concurred in by Muscarello, by characterizing it as a \u201cpre-<em>Bailey </em>composition by the government and a <em>pre-Bailey </em>consideration by Defendant and his counsel.\u201d Although that might be a valid legal basis for disregarding the factual basis as to the <em>use </em>facet of \u00a7 924(c), it is a legal non sequitur when the <em>carrying </em>facet is under scrutiny. It follows that the court\u2019s disregard of the factual basis was legal error. Second, the court erred in relying on Mus-carello\u2019s post-conviction self-serving declaration to the probation officer, recounted in the PSR, regarding his subjective intent in possessing the pistol in the truck that he used in facilitating his illicit drug trafficking. Under the circumstances of this case, the court should not have allowed the PSR to supplant the formal plea agreement, given the defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary concurrence, and that of his counsel, in the clear and unambiguous factual basis for that plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The Supreme Court decision in <em>Bailey </em>addressed the <em>use </em>facet of \u00a7 924(c) but did not address the <em>carrying </em>facet. Although <em>Bailey </em>indirectly heightened the focus on the <em>carrying </em>facet of \u00a7 924(c) by narrowing the <em>use </em>facet, it did nothing to invalidate our <em>pre-Bailey </em>\u201ccarrying\u201d jurisprudence, at least as to those instances of drug trafficking that involve the use of motor vehicles in which firearms are possessed. We recognized in <em>United States v. Pineda-O</em>rtuno<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201c[w]hen a vehicle is used, \u2018carrying\u2019 takes on a different meaning from carrying on a person because the means of carrying is the vehicle itself.\u201d Thus, for example, the fact that the glove compartment was locked does not prevent conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is not to say, however, that every time a gun is knowingly possessed in a vehicle and the vehicle is used during and in relation to the commission of a drug-trafficking crime, the firearm is, as a <em>per se </em>matter of law, carried <em>in relation to </em>a drug-trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 924(c). Albeit a rarity, it is at least conceivable for such a vehicle-contained gun to be <em>carried </em>\u201cduring\u201d but <em>not </em>necessarily \u201cin relation to\u201d the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">When, as here, the defendant knowingly possesses a firearm in a motor vehicle and uses the vehicle during the commission of the underlying crime, then as a matter of law the firearm is carried during a drug-trafficking offense for purposes of \u00a7 924(c). It matters not that the government, confected the factual basis in the instant case before the decision in <em>Bailey, </em>or that Muscarello\u2019s knowing and voluntarily agreement with the accuracy of the factual basis predated <em>Bailey. </em>Neither does it matter that, according to the PSR, Muscarello subjectively intended to possess the firearm in connection with his bailiffing job and not in connection with his drug-trafficking crime when he has already knowingly and voluntarily signed on to a plea agreement with a factual basis that expressly includes the \u201cin relation to\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">The district court' erred both in disregarding the factual basis for Muscarello\u2019s guilty plea and in relying on the content of the PSR regarding Muscarello\u2019s subjective intention. As this reliance led the district court to err in dismissing Count Three of the indictment, we (1) reverse that dismissal, (2) reinstate Count Three of the indictment and Muscarello\u2019s conviction thereon pursuant to his guilty plea, (3) vacate the sentence imposed to the extent that Muscarello\u2019s guilt on the firearms charge was not considered in calculating the sentence, and (4) remand the case to the district court for reimposition of Muscarello\u2019s conviction on Count Three and for resentenc-ing. In so doing, we observe that what constitutes \u201ccarrying\u201d under \u00a7 924(c) when the firearm is possessed in the motor vehicle differs substantially from what constitutes carrying a firearm in a n\u00f3n-vehicle situation. Thus our pronouncements today regarding carrying-a firearm should not be applied in a non-vehicle situation without closely scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>nizing the effects of this distinction and questioning charily whether our vehicle case jurisprudence is properly applicable to a non-vehicle case, and vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">DISMISSAL REVERSED; DISMISSED COUNT AND CONVICTION THEREON REINSTATED; SENTENCE VACATED; and CASE REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-12\">. \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-14\">.
