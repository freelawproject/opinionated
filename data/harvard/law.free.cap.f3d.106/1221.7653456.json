In addition, O\u2019Callaghan contends that certain evidence was improperly admitted and the district court erroneously denied his motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-23\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties and we make the following findings: (1) there was sufficient evidence to support the defendants\u2019 convictions on all counts; (2) the admission of the evidence concerning the firearm was not an abuse of discretion; (3) the trial court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s motion for severance was not an abuse of discretion; (4) the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement of West\u2019s sentence for failure to appear was appropriate; and (5) the trial court did not make the requisite findings regarding O\u2019Callagan\u2019s mental state in failing to appear. We write further to direct the court in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-24\">Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, increase the offense level by two levels\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Application Note 3 of the Commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 sets forth a non-exhaustive list of examples of obstructive conduct, including \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>failure to appear was not \u201cwillful\u201d, and, therefore, the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In interpreting the Sentencing Guidelines, this court conducts a plain-meaning approach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying this approach, we conclude that the term \u201cwillful\u201d requires that the defendant consciously and deliberately fail to appear for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">The district court made a specific finding that West \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to appear and the circumstances of her arrest support this conclusion. The district court, however, made no finding that O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s failure to appear was \u201cwillful\u201d. O\u2019Callaghan failed to appear in El Paso for trial at 9:00 a.m. on December 4, 1995. At that time, defense counsel informed the court that he had received a call from O\u2019Callaghan indicating that he would be late arriving to court. The district court then revoked O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s bond and issued a warrant for his arrest. He was arrested later that morning as he arrived at the El Paso airport. He contended that he arrived from Houston, where he lived, to attend court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">At sentencing, defense counsel objected to the parole officer\u2019s recommendation that O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s sentence be enhanced according to \u00a7 3C1.1. The defense counsel argued that O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s tardiness was \u201cnegligent\u201d, \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d, even \u201cstupid\u201d, but aptly observed that \u201cnegligence is not willfulness\u201d. The district court denied defense counsel\u2019s objection and assessed the two-level upward adjustment authorized by \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-7\">\u201cHe knew the Court setting. He wasn\u2019t here. Even though he was late, we were all scheduled to start trial. He should have been here at 9:00 a.m. in the morning. He should have taken the necessary preparation, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">The \u00a7 3C1.1 two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice is appropriate punishment for this tardiness only where the defendant \u201cwilfully\u201d\u2014voluntarily and intentionally\u2014failed to appear for trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court, however, did not find that O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s tardiness was \u201cwillful\u201d, and based on our review of the record we are unable to make this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-15\">Accordingly, West\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED, O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED, West\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED, and O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for a determination whether his tardiness was \u201cwillful\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1340-19\">.
