At his plea proceeding, McDonald agreed to the following factual basis for his plea: Upon his arrests after the revocation of his state probation, a search of his vehicle revealed that he was carrying at least five false identification documents; most of the documents bore the name of Charles McDonald and one was a false driver\u2019s license. McDonald also was carrying more than 15 \u201caccess devices,\u201d including fraudulently obtained credit cards and blank cheeks. McDonald had used these items to defraud many merchants and financial institutions, in the amount of approximately $82,-679.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">In McDonald\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the Probation Office made the following recommendations regarding his sentence: McDonald\u2019s base offense level was 6. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(a). Six levels were to be added because McDonald caused more than $70,000 in losses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(G). A further two-level increase was required because his offense involved \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2). McDonald was entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 12. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). His criminal history score was 10, for a Category V criminal history; one criminal-history point was attributable to a 1994 Texas misdemeanor conviction for \u201cfailure to identify,\u201d in which he gave a fictitious name and showed a false- driver\u2019s license to police officers. McDonald\u2019s total offense level and criminal history score combined for a sentencing guideline range of 27 to 33 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-12\">McDonald objected to the inclusion of the \u201cfailure to identify\u201d offense in his criminal history score. Citing \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l)(A), he argued that it should not count because it was a misdemeanor with a prison term of less than 30 days. The Probation Office countered that the 1994 offense was includable because it involved \u201csimilar conduct\u201d to his federal offense, in that McDonald had used a fraudulent driver\u2019s license in an attempt to avoid arrest after an officer arrived with an arrest warrant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">At sentencing, the , district court overruled McDonald\u2019s objection, reasoning that \u201cthe substance of the failure to identify ... was not only a failure to identify but to give a fictitious name\u201d and that the prior \u2022 offense was therefore \u201cclose enough to the type of conduct involved\u201d in this case to warrant its inclusion in McDonald\u2019s criminal history score. The court sentenced McDonald to concurrent 30-month prison terms and a three-year supervised release term and ordered him to pay $35,922.76 in restitution. McDonald timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-15\">McDonald contends that his 1994 misdemeanor offense for \u201cfailure to identify\u201d should not have been included in his criminal history score. He observes that the state offense, which involved providing false information to a police officer, is specifically listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) as a misdemeanor conviction that is ordinarily to be excluded in computing that score. Acknowledging that such offenses may be counted if the \u201cprior offense was similar to an instant offense,\u201d McDonald contends that his 1994 Texas offense was different from both of federal charges to which he pleaded guilty. He also argues that he was prejudiced, because without the one criminal-history point for the 1994 offense, his score would have been only nine and he would have had only a Category TV criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>\u201cMisdemeanor offenses and petty offenses are generally considered in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score.\u201d <em>United States v. Gadison, </em>8 F.3d 186, 193 (5th Cir.1993) (citing \u00a7 4A1.2(e)). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADR\">(1) [sentences for the following prior offenses <em>and offenses similar to them, </em>by whatever name they are known, are counted <em>only if </em>(A) the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or (B) <em>the prior offense was similar to the instant offense:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-4\"><em>False information to a police </em>officer_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-6\">In <em>United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278 (5th Cir.1991), [this Court] established a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach to determine when a prior offense is \u201csimilar\u201d to one of the enumerated exempted offenses in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). The <em>Hardeman </em>approach requires the district court to assess all factors of similarity, including</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoh\">a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses, the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment, the elements of the offense, the level of culpability involved, and the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-7\"><em>Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d at 281. A court employing the <em>Hardeman </em>factors should do so cognizant of the fact that the criminal history factors are designed to take into account the relative severity of a prior offense as well as the degree to which it indicates the likelihood of future criminal behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 281-82.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\"><em>Gadison, </em>8 F.3d at 193. \u201cThe word \u2018offense\u2019, as used [in \u00a7 4A1.2(e) ], includes any relevant conduct and not just the conduct charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>997 F.2d 30, 34 (5th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). \u201cIn reviewing [such] claim[s], we must accept the factual findings of the district court unless clearly erroneous, but we review de novo the application of the guidelines for errors of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">In McDonald\u2019s ease, the Probation Office urged that his 1994 conviction for \u201cfailure to identify\u201d was similar to his instant conviction for possession of false identification documents because both involved the use of a false driver\u2019s license. McDonald\u2019s federal conviction for possession of false identification documents is based on the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-12\">(a) Whoever, in a circumstance described in subsection (c) of this section\u2014 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-13\">(3) knowingly possesses with intent to use unlawfully ... five or more ... false identification documents; ... or attempts to do so, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMWW\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a). Subsection (c) refers to the circumstance that \u201cthe ... possession prohibited by this section is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce....\u201d \u00a7 1028(c)(3). If the offense involves more than five identification documents, the offender is subject to imprisonment of up to five years. \u00a7 1028(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-14\">McDonald\u2019s \u201cfailure to identify\u201d conviction was based on the following provision: \u201cA person commits an offense if he intentionally gives a false or fictitious name ... to a peace officer who has: (1) lawfully arrested the person_\u201d Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 38.02(b). McDonald was sentenced to five days in jail for his \u201cfailure to identify\u201d offense. The parties agree that because officers were serving an outstanding arrest warrant on McDonald, his offense was a \u201cClass B\u201d misdemeanor that carried a maximum penalty of 180 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-17\">It is undisputed that both offenses involved the use of a false driver\u2019s license. The Government focuses on this fact in arguing that the two offenses were \u201csimilar\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(c). The Government also contends that McDonald\u2019s 1994 offense \u201cwas far more serious than merely giving \u2018false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>information to a police officer,\u2019\u201d because it \u201cstrongly suggested the possibility of future criminality.\u201d The Government asserts that the 1994 offense was \u201cconsistent with planned criminal conduct\u201d' and \u201csuggested] a more calculating, resourceful and more dangerous criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">McDonald emphasizes the differences in the maximum penalties for the two offenses: five years versus 180 days. He notes that the elements of the offenses are different, in that his federal offense not only requires the possession of false identification but also the use of that identification to unlawfully affect interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">The parties do not explicitly dispute that McDonald\u2019s \u201cfailure to identify\u201d offense was \u201csimilar\u201d to the \u201cfalse information\u201d offense listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">We believe that <em>Moore </em>provides the closest analog to the circumstances in McDonald\u2019s case. In <em>Moore, </em>this Court, applying \u00a7 4A1.2(c), compared a defendant\u2019s prior state crime of evading arrest to his federal conviction for assaulting a federal officer. <em>Moore, </em>997 F.2d at 34-35. The defendant, Moore, shot at a DEA agent during a raid on a \u201ccrack house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. This Court identified the following differences in the two crimes: they carried far different maximum penalties (six months versus 10 years); the federal offense involved violence, but the pri- or state one did not; and Moore was only a teenager at the time of the earlier offense. <em>Id. </em>at 35. However, this Court observed that both offenses \u201cinvolved nearly identical conduct,\u201d in that Moore possessed a gun and fled on both occasions. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201cwhile Moore\u2019s prior evading arrest conviction may not have indicated some likelihood to commit future offenses, the fact that Moore has now attempted to evade arrest twice and that he was willing to shoot a police officer to do so indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In balancing the differences and similarities, this Court upheld the district court\u2019s imposition of a criminal history point for Moore\u2019s \u201csimilar\u201d evading-arrest offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-10\">The Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Moore </em>supports the district court\u2019s ruling that McDonald\u2019s \u201cfailure to identify\u201d offense was \u201csimilar\u201d to his federal conviction for possession, of false identification documents. McDonald\u2019s use of false identification was central to both offenses. Likewise, we read the district court\u2019s decision as satisfying the balancing requirements of <em>Hardeman. </em>The district court\u2019s decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">. It is not disputed that McDonald's 1994 \"failure to identify\u201d sentence did not qualify for the exception listed in subsection (c)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
