Mezzanotti, 227 </em>Md. 8, 20-21; <em>Guerriero v. Friendly Finance, </em>230 Md. 217; <em>Miller v. Talbott, </em>239 Md. 382; <em>Peck v. Toronto, </em>246 Md. 268, <em>cert. den. </em>389 U. S. 868; <em>Pfeiffer v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>247 Md. 56. There have been suggestions that this ultimate sanction usually will be invoked only where the failure is wilful or contumacious, <em>Peck, supra, Smith v. Potomac Plectric, </em>236 Md. 51, 62, and <em>Miller, supra, </em>but the power of the court to act is not thus limited and there may be other occasions when this gravest sanction can properly be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The case before us started with the filing by Lynch in December 1965 of a declaration against Tull claiming damages for breach of a plumbing contract. Tull filed a counterclaim in May 1966, and on April 13, 1967, directed nine interrogatories to Lynch. Not having received an answer to the interrogatories, Tull, on September 15, 1967, moved for judgment by default under Rule 417 d. On September 18, three days later, Lynch answered the interrogatories and on September 21, 1967, filed an \u201cOpposition to Motion for Judgment by Default.\u201d On October 6 next, a hearing was held before Judge Shure who granted Tull a judgment for costs in Lynch\u2019s suit against him and a judgment by default in Tull\u2019s counterclaim against Lynch. No transcript was made of the hearing on October 6 and we do not have the advantage of knowing the precise reasons Judge Shure had for his action. However, Judge Shure, in denying Lynch\u2019s motion to reconsider the, granting of the judgments by default, indicated that he had fully articulated his reasons at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>hearing on October 6. He said that Tull\u2019s counsel \u201chad earned his motion to dismiss\u201d and told Lynch\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cI think you were dilatory and I think that the abuse was so flagrant that I had to grant the motion. I think that what I said at that time would apply today. * * * if you are a few days late, it is one thing but if you let motions go by for the reasons which were very apparent to me that he wanted these answered quickly and you did not do it, dictated to me that I had to grant the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Appellant has not provided us with the most pertinent means of reviewing Judge Shure\u2019s exercise of discretion, that is, a transcript of the first hearing on the propriety of granting judgments by default. The burden was upon Lynch to put before this Court every part of the proceedings below which were material to a decision in his favor. He omitted to provide a very material part. That which is before us does not permit us to find an abuse of discretion in Judge Shure\u2019s actions. The reasons for Lynch\u2019s failure to answer the interrogatories, which Judge Shure said were apparent to him as constituting a \u201cflagrant abuse\u201d could well have been a deliberate, if not wilful, attempt to hinder or prevent effective presentation of Tull\u2019s defenses and counterclaims, or to stall in revealing his own weak claim or defense. There is little if anything in the record to indicate to the contrary as to either rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
