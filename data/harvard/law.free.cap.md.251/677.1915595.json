Vol.) Art. 31A \u00a7\u00a7 1-16). The court decreed that the Aetna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) did not have a duty or obligation to defend a lawsuit filed by the passenger in a one vehicle accident in which it carried the liability insurance on the vehicle involved and further, that the American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania (American) which carried liability insurance on the operator of the vehicle, did have the duty and obligation to defend against the action brought by the injured passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The events which led to the filing of the action for declaratory relief are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">Steuart Contee Day (Day) owned and operated a gasoline station known as Day\u2019s Gulf Service at 7340 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland. In the early hours of March 10, 1966, Douglas E. Turner (Turner), who was a daytime employee of Day\u2019s at the gas station, arrived at the station with Mrs. Carol Logan. There, Turner, with the permission of Lloyd Monroe, the service station attendant on duty at the time, borrowed a 1962 Chevrolet tow truck, belonging to Day, for the purpose of pulling Turner\u2019s automobile out of a ditch. The record reveals that both Monroe and Turner knew that such permission was beyond Monroe\u2019s scope of authority. In his deposition Turner admitted that he knew that the use of the tow truck at night was specifically forbidden and that only Steuart Day, the employer, could authorize its use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Mrs. Logan accompanied Turner as a passenger in the tow truck and they were involved in an accident on the Capitol Beltway, Interstate Route 495, at a point 900 feet east of Riggs Road, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, when the tow truck ran off the road. Mrs. Logan was injured and subsequently filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Law No. 31,081) against both Day and Turner seeking a judgment against each of them for the personal injuries sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">At the time of the accident Aetna carried a liability policy on the tow truck, with Day\u2019s Gulf Service named as the insured. During this same period of time American had a public liability contract insuring Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">After Mrs. Logan filed her personal injury suit on the law side of the circuit court, American filed a suit in equity, naming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Aetna, Mrs. Logan, Turner and Day as defendants, seeking a declaratory decree as to which, if either, Aetna\u2019s or American\u2019s insurance contract, should be subject to the claims made by Mrs. Logan.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The lower court was of the opinion that the controlling provision of the Aetna policy was the \u201cpermission\u201d clause found in Part I, which expressly provided that any person using a vehicle with the permission of the insured (Day as owner of Day\u2019s Gulf Service) was to be covered under the policy, as long as the actual use was within the scope of the permission of its insured, and in the instant case it found that Turner had not been given this permission. The court below was not impressed with American\u2019s argument that coverage under its contract with Turner did not extend to his operation of a tow truck, which American classified as a \u201cutility vehicle\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was excluded from coverage under the policy, rather than a \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d Accordingly the court below held that Aetna had no obligation under its contract to investigate and defend the suit and that American under its contract with Turner did have a duty and obligation to investigate and defend any action arising out of the accident. It is from this decree that the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">1. In its argument on appeal American does not attack the interpretation which the lower court placed on the \u201cpermission\u201d clause of Part I of Aetna\u2019s policy, rather it concentrates its efforts entirely on the interpretation given by the court to the coverage afforded by its own policy which interpretation it contends was erroneous. It should be noted that Turner also filed a separate appellee\u2019s brief in which he sought to uphold the lower court\u2019s ruling on the coverage afforded by American\u2019s policy whereby it was obligated to defend, while at the same time he urged that this Court reverse the lower court\u2019s ruling of no liability on the part of Aetna, a fellow appellee. However, since Turner did not enter any appeal whatsoever from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the lower court\u2019s decree we may not consider his attack on its decree on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> zIt is therefore incumbent upon us to consider only the question of the coverage afforded by American\u2019s policy to Turner, as the operator of the tow truck, and whether the lower court was correct in holding that American had an obligation to defend the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">On appeal American did not take issue with the lower court\u2019s interpretation that the definition of a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d did not exclude a tow truck, but relied on an entirely new argument, namely, the construction to be placed on the definition of \u201cpersons insured\u201d under Part I of its policy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. which it contended excluded an insured who operated a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d (including a non-owned tow truck) without the permission of the owner and therefore, on the basis of the lower court\u2019s finding of fact that Turner used the tow truck without Day\u2019s permission, placed him beyond the pale of coverage. For a proper understanding of this argument it is necessary to set forth the pertinent provisions of the insurance contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cPersons insured. The following are insureds under Part I:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201c(b) With respect to a non-owned automobile,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">(1) the named insured</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">(2) any relative, but only with respect to a private passenger automobile or trailer provided his actual operation or (if he is not operating) the other actual use thereof is with the permission, or reasonably believed to be with the permission, of the owner and is within the scope of such permission, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">(3) any other person or organization not owning or hiring the automobile, but only with respect to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>or its liability because of acts or omissions of an insured under (b) (1) or (2) above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We think the unambiguous wording of the quoted provisions covering \u201cpersons insured\u201d under Part I of the policy clearly demonstrates that the necessity for the \u201cperson insured\u201d to obtain the permission of the owner of a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d to operate the vehicle, applies only to relatives of the insured, as set forth in subsection (b) (2) and not to the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d There is no qualifying language used in subsection (b) (1) with regard to the operation by the \u201cnamed insured\u201d of a \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d Nor does the appellant favor us with any authorities to support the construction it would have us adopt. We find no reason in law or logic which would prompt us to read such a limiting effect into the clear language of the clause and proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In <em>Aviation Ins. Co. v. </em>Barclay, 237 Md. 318, 206 A. 2d 119 (1965), Chief Judge Prescott speaking for the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-7\">\u201cA policy of insurance is a contract, and, in the absence of constitutional or statutory barriers, the parties thereto are at liberty to make their own agreement. It needs no citation of authority to assert that where there is ambiguity in the terms of an insurance policy, they should be liberally construed in favor of the insured and against the drafter of the policy; but this does not mean that a strained or unjustified construction of the policy is to be adopted, which disregards the plain meaning and intent of the parties. We find no ambiguity in the pertinent terms of the policy here involved, so we shall give them their plain and ordinary meaning in determining whether the appellee was an additional insured.\u201d <em>Id. 323.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">See also cases collected in 12 M. L. E., Insurance \u00a7 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">. The \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d of the language employed in American\u2019s policy compels us to agree with the lower court \"in holding that Turner, as a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d was covered under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">American also contends that the lower court erred in find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ing that the \u201cExclusions\u201d subsection (i) (2) of its policy did not exclude the tow truck, thus exposing American to an action for damages for the destruction of the tow truck. The appellee Aetna in its brief, points out that the specific issue as to American\u2019s liability for damages to the tow truck was not presented, tried or decided below and thus cannot be now raised on appeal (Maryland Rule 885). However, the record reveals that the construction to be placed on subsection (i) (2) was raised below, perhaps not on the specific question as to liability for damages to the tow truck, as the record is not clear on this point, but in support of American\u2019s contention that the tow truck was excluded from any coverage under American\u2019s policy. Also, the lower court in its opinion gave an interpretation as to the meaning of subsection (i) (2), an interpretation with which we agree, and we think we should address our attention to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We set forth the subsection under question :</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u201cExclusions. This policy does not apply under Part I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">(i) to injury or destruction of (1) property owned or transported by the insured or (2) property rented to or in charge of the insured other than a residence or private garage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The lower court was of the opinion that the word \u201cproperty\u201d as used in subsection (i) (1) was not intended to refer to \u201cautomobiles,\u201d otherwise the ridiculous conclusion would be reached that any vehicle owned by the insured would be excluded from coverage under the policy; obviously a result not intended by the parties to the insurance contract. Accordingly, by analogy, applying the same rationale to subsection (i) (2) it becomes clear that the use of the word \u201cproperty\u201d in subsection (i) (2) is not intended to embrace a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d within the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">In contrast to the clarity of the language of the policy as found in the clause defining \u201cpersons insured,\u201d which we have previously discussed, the language in subsection (i) of the \u201cExclusions\u201d appears imprecise. However, to adopt the construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tion advanced by American in its brief for which it cites no authority, would require a strained and artificial construction. It would have us apply the exclusion to any bailed property or \u201cproperty in charge of the insured,\u201d including borrowed automobiles. Reading subsection (i) as a whole, we think the exclusion would apply to property of which the insured was a bailee or \u201cin charge of,\u201d <em>other than automobiles. </em>We think the lower court gave a correct interpretation to subsection (i) (2). In <em>Mateer v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>247 Md. 643, 233 A. 2d 797 (1967) we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u201cMaryland does not follow the rule of many jurisdictions that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer. The Maryland rule is that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained if reasonably possible from the policy as a whole. However, if an insurance company draws an ambiguous clause, the ambiguity is to be resolved against it as the one who drafted the instrument, as is true in the construction of contracts generally. <em>Penn., Etc., Ins. Co. v. Shirer, </em>244 Md. 530, 168 A. 2d 525 (1960).\u201d <em>Id. </em>648.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We affirm the decree of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\">. The lower court held that under American\u2019s policy the term \u201cutility vehicle\u201d applied to an \u201cowned automobile\u201d and that no mention was made of a \u201cutility vehicle\u201d under the definition of a \u201cnon-owned automobile,\u201d the included class pertinent to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-10\">.
