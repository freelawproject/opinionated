The proof was that that child was normal and well adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">The trial judge denied the change of custody but allowed the wife\u2019s lawyer a fee, without stating his reasons for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-14\">The father appeals from the granting of the fee. We find his appeal to be well taken. An absolute divorce ends the marital relationship and a divorced wife is not entitled to a fee for her counsel from her former husband unless counsel\u2019s services were reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the children. <em>Carter v. Carter, </em>156 Md. 500, 508-509; <em>Andrews v. Andrews, </em>242 Md. 143, 155-156. There was no indication here of the factors requisite to impose liability on the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">\u25a0 Chapter 488 of the Daws of 1967 (Sec. 5A of Art. 16 of the Code) gave the equity court power to award a fee at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>in child custody and support cases, as <em>Price v. Price, </em>232 Md. 379 suggested the Legislature well might want to do, but it also provides that in deciding whether to award a fee the court should consider \u201cwhether there was substantial justification for instituting or defending the proceeding\u201d which in effect makes the statutory test on this point the test of the cases such as <em>Carter </em>and <em>Andrews, </em>cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">\n<em>Decree appealed from reversed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
