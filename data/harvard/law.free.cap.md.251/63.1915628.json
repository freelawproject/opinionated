The only protestants before the Board who appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County were the appellants, Ellis S. White and Pearl R. White, his wife, who own and reside at 109 Central Avenue, Glyndon, Maryland, approximately one-half mile from the subject property. Mr. White, the principal witness for the protestants, testified that he preferred that the land remain undeveloped in its then zoning as he feared increased traffic, doubted the capacity of the water distribution system, indicated that the public schools were already overcrowded and that the introduction of additional people into the area would \u201cchange the entire character of our community.\u201d There was no evidence that the property of the protestants would be depreciated in value by the proposed rezoning or that the protestants could even see the subject property from their Central Avenue property. The protestants perfected an appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County from the order of the Board granting the rezoning. Upon a timely motion, the Circuit Court (Rain\u00ae, J.) dismissed the appeal on the ground that the protestants and appellants were not parties aggrieved by the Board\u2019s decision as required by Section 604 of the Baltimore County Charter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In our opinion Judge Raine\u2019s order dismissing the appeal was correct. Our decisions in <em>Loughborough Development Corp. v. Rivermass Corp., </em>213 Md. 239, 131 A. 2d 461 (1957) and <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 213 A. 2d 487 (1965) indicate that the appellants did not establish the necessary special damage to their property (an adverse effect different than that suffered by the public generally) to make them \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s order and these decisions are dispositive of the present case. See also <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A. 2d 289 (1967) for a review of our prior decisions in regard to aggrievement in zoning cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, the appellants to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-6\">.
