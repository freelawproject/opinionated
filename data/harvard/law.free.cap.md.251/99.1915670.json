The appellant (Bugg) and the appellees Cash and Carpenter, sitting in their taxicabs, were awaiting the arrival, on the late buses, of sailors returning to the Naval Training Station at Bainbridge, 3 miles distant. Cash was first in line; Carpenter was next; Bugg was further back. When the first bus arrived Bugg, contrary to the prevailing custom, \u201cshot up, cut everybody off, loaded up a full load and went on to Bainbridge.\u201d Upon his return, ahead of the others, he became \u201cfirst in line for the next bus.\u201d It is no surprise that Cash and Carpenter took a rather dim view of Bugg\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Bugg\u2019s witnesses testified that Cash, who claims Bugg gave him \u201ca good cussing,\u201d grabbed Bugg, aged 70, by the shirt collar, held him at arm\u2019s length and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you never bring those words through your mouth again for I am not Mr. Gaddy you are fooling with.\u201d Cash then \u201cbacked him around * * * [behind another taxicab] and let him go.\u201d They testified further that shortly thereafter Carpenter \u201cslapped him [Bugg] across the face and broke * * * [his] glasses,\u201d knocked him down and then hit him \u201cin the jaw\u201d as he tried to get up. Bugg, they said, ran in back of the Whistle Stop, \u201ccrying and begging * * * [Carpenter] not to hit * * * [him] no more.\u201d A driver named Hall took Bugg to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Bugg filed suit against Cash, Carpenter and Ralph Brown on 31 August 1965. The declaration was signed by two members of a Baltimore law firm. A member of the Cecil County bar entered his appearance for Bugg on the same day. All of them withdrew from the case in February 1967. The trial was held before Judge Mackey and a jury on 17 October 1967. Bugg appeared in proper person. He said he had issued writs of summons for witnesses, including himself, but there is nothing in the record to show it. He advised the court that he planned \u201cto get a lawyer\u201d but he did not ask for a continuance. Judge Mackey was of the opinion that Bugg had had \u201cplenty of time to get a lawyer\u201d (8 months had passed since his attorneys withdrew). \u201cSo [said the judge] we are going ahead with the case. * * * You are representing yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Although appellees pleaded only the general issue, counsel, in his opening statement, declared he would show that Bugg is \u201chotheaded,\u201d that he is a \u201clitigious, contrary individual,\u201d that he was \u201cknown to carry a pistol or a knife,\u201d that he attacked Carpenter, that on other occasions he had been convicted of assault, and that on the day following the incident he \u201cwas carrying a shotgun around looking for\u201d Cash and Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">During his direct examination, James Gaddy, produced as a witness on behalf of Bugg, was questioned by the trial judge. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\u201cQ. You say [that you saw] nothing unusual about his face or his head or anything ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cA. He looked that night just about like he is look<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>ing right now. He always has been a bad man, ever since I have been knowing him. Bad man. Fights with me every time he gets in conversation with me. Bad man. Of course, he is my neighbor. We are neighbors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cBY MR. BUGG:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cQ. I didn\u2019t ask you those questions, Mr. Gaddy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cA. Well, you asked me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201cMr. Bugg: I ask that be struck out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I will ask you the jury to disregard it as not being responsive to Mr. Bugg\u2019s question, and not really having any bearing on this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">I will ask jury to disregard those remarks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">In his cross-examination by counsel for appellees the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u25a0 \u201cQ. You have already said you don\u2019t know anything about the 19th. What is Mr. Bugg\u2019s reputation for good order, sobriety, peacefulness, and general reputation in the neighborhood where he lives? Is it good or bad ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">\u201cA. (Witness indicating card in hand.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\">\u201cQ. Answer my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-15\">\u201cA. It is bad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-16\">\u201cMr. Bugg: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It is bad. Bad as anybody I have met since I have been in the world, and I will soon be 70 years old, December 27th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-18\">\u201cThe Court: I overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-19\">\u201cA. He is the baddest man I ever met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-20\">What follows is an excerpt from the cross-examination of Charles Woodrow Calary, another witness for Bugg:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-21\">\u201cQ. Now, you know Mr. Bugg, don\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-22\">\u201cA. Yes. sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-23\">\u201cQ. What is his general reputation for peace and sobriety and good order in the community in which he lives ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-24\">\u201cMr. Bugg: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-25\">\u201cThe Court: Just a minute. Mr. Evans I will hear you on the propriety of that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201cMr. Evans: I think this man is charged with assault. The defense is going to be in here, as far as Mr. Carpenter is concerned, that Pink Bugg is a pugnacious man, he has been in trouble with the law and charged with assault before, and I want to know if Mr. Calary knows him, what his reputation is for good order and peacefulness in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201cMr. Bugg: I object to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201cMr. Evans: I think it is relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201cMr. Bugg: I object to that. We are only concerned in this case\u2014I don\u2019t think that ties in with this case anywhere, where I am concerned with the law. And I think as far as my record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">\u201cThe Court: Excuse me, this question is proper in testimony as a character witness, but I can\u2019t recall this question being\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cMr. Evans: This case charges assault, and I want to know what his general reputation is in the community, if Mr. Calary knows it, as to good order, peacefulness and being law abiding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">\u201cThe Court: I am going to sustain the objection,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">Mr. Evans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">At the conclusion of Bugg\u2019s case counsel for appellees moved \u201cfor a dismissal, a directed verdict of acquittal\u201d on the ground there was \u201cno evidence of the amount of damage, money-wise, or otherwise.\u201d The trial judge appears to have agreed. Bugg had not met the burden, he said, of \u201csatisfying the jury by a preponderance of the evidence as to the extent of his damages or anything that goes beyond, in the mind of the court, mere speculation or conjecture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">We do not find in the record anything which adds up to a prima facie case against Brown. Indeed, that he was home in bed at the time seems to be unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Bugg\u2019s brief in this Court was filed in proper person but the case was argued by counsel. There was no brief and no appearance for the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">In 86 C.J.S. <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 22 (1954) will be found a quite ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>quate statement of the general rule in respect of the necessity for proving damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">\u201cAlthough damage is an essential element of tort, a fundamental distinction is to be observed between two classes of torts, one composed of legal wrongs in themselves constituting invasions of right and thus giving rise to legal damage, the other of breaches of duty not necessarily violative of legal rights and with which some actual express damage must concur in order to establish the violation of right essential to tort. In the former class, damage flows from the wrongful act, itself injurious to another\u2019s right, although no perceptible loss or harm accrues therefrom; in the latter, however, some specific actual damage is a condition precedent to the tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 18 (1965) it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">\u201cSince the essence of plaintiff\u2019s grievance consists in the offense to the dignity involved in the unpermitted and intentional invasion of the inviolability of his person and not in any physical harm done to his body, it is not necessary that the plaintiff\u2019s actual body be disturbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The following statement is taken from Prosser\u2019s <em>Law of Torts </em>\u00a79 at 33-35 (1964) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cProof of the technical invasion of the integrity of the plaintiff\u2019s person by even an entirely harmless, but offensive, contact entitles him to vindication of his legal right by an award of nominal damages, and the establishment of the tort cause of action entitles him also to compensation for the mental disturbance inflicted upon him, such as fright or humiliation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">\u201cThe defendant is liable not only for contacts which do actual physical harm, but also those relatively trivial ones which are merely offensive and insulting. Spitting in the face is a battery, as is forcibly removing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s hat, or any other contact brought about in a rude and insolent manner. \u2018The least touching of another in anger,\u2019 said Chief Justice Holt, \u2018is a battery;\u2019 and no harm or actual damage of any kind is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">To the same effect <em>see also Richardson v. Boato, </em>207 Md. 301, 302-06, 114 A. 2d 49 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In <em>Mason v. Wrightson, </em>205 Md. 481, 109 A. 2d 128 (1954), the plaintiff, an attorney, over his strenuous objection, was required by a police sergeant to stand up and be searched. At the trial of his suit against the sergeant for assault and battery he offered no proof of pecuniary loss. The trial judge found for the defendant on the theory that the wrong done was at most technical and that no actual damage was established. We reversed and entered a judgment for the plaintiff for one cent damages and costs. Chief Judge Brune, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe remaining question is whether the appellant is entitled to recover any damages, and if so, how much. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the appellant\u2019s damages on a pecuniary basis, and there was no proof thereof. Though there are exceptions to this rule, as in conspiracy cases, where damage is the gist of the action or an essential element of the tort <em>(Horn v. Seth, </em>201 Md. 589, 95 A. 2d 312), we do not regard this case as falling within such exceptions, but as coming within the rule recognized in <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Works v. Catron, </em>186 Md. 156, 164, 46 A. 2d 303, 306; and <em>Salisbury Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Lowe, </em>176 Md. 230, 4 A. 2d 440, under which, as was said in <em>Horn v. Seth, </em>201 Md. 589, 597, 95 A. 2d 312, 316, in referring to these cases, \u2018* * * if damage is shown in a tort action, the defendant is not entitled to a directed verdict merely because the monetary amount is not proven, even though the defendant may be entitled to an instruction, if requested, limiting recovery to nominal damages.\u2019 We think that the humiliation incidental to the search here made does show some damage. As was said in <em>Baltimore v. Appold, </em>42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Md. 442: \u2018It is well settled that every injury to the rights of another imports damages, and if no other damage is established, the party injured is at least entitled to a verdict for nominal damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-89.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">It is obvious that Bugg has made out a prima facie case against Carpenter. It must be assumed that he experienced some pain and suffering (he said he was \u201cstill suffering\u201d with his shoulder and jaw) as a result of his beating. It is well settled that a pecuniary basis need not be established to make pain and suffering compensable and the jury\u2019s determination of the amount thereof will not ordinarily be disturbed. As against Cash, Bugg would clearly have been entitled to an award of nominal damages had the jury found in his favor on the issue cif liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Bugg contends the trial judge \u201cshould not have permitted counsel for defendants to show bad character of plaintiff by cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s witness when plaintiff did not show his character on direct examination of said witness.\u201d Since, for reasons already stated, the case will be remanded, we shall not undertake to resolve this contention. Nor shall we comment on the anomalies apparent in the record. However, since it seems likely the case will be tried again, we shall set forth what seem to be the applicable rules of evidence. We have assumed, of course, that there will be some amendment to the pleadings, Maryland Rule 342 c 2 (g), and that the parties will arrange to produce their testimony in the proper manner and at appropriate times.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">In civil actions evidence of the general reputation of the plaintiff generally is not admissible unless it is attacked or unless the nature of the proceedings puts the reputation of the parties in issue. <em>Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 438, 244 A. 2d 207 (1968); <em>Sappington v. Fairfax, </em>135 Md. 186, 188, 108 A. 575 (1919). In 29 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 337 (1967), it is said that \u201cusually in actions for assault and battery, evidence of the character or reputation of either the plaintiff or the defendant is admissible.\u201d The following is quoted from a note in 154 A.L.R. 121, 129 (1945) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cIn assault and battery cases evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s reputation for turbulence and quarrelsomeness may become admissible either because the defendant pleads self-defense or because it is uncertain, on the evidence, as to whether the plaintiff or the defendant was the aggressor, or, in some cases, on the issue of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In 6 C.J.S. <em>Assault and Battery </em>\u00a7 41 (a) (1937), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, in actions for assault or assault and battery, the character of the parties thereto is not in issue, and evidence with respect thereto is inadmissible either for or against a party, unless it is first attacked or supported by the adversary, or placed in issue by the nature of the proceeding itself, as where there is a dispute as to who was the aggressor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201cWhere justification is pleaded by way of self-defense, it is competent to show the character of plaintiff as being quarrelsome or turbulent, provided such fact has been brought to the knowledge of defendant prior to the assault, and this is so even though plaintiff has offered no evidence of his good character in that respect. This principle applies where the defense is that force was used to resist an assault on one whom defendant has right to defend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cWhere the question of who was the aggressor is a disputed issue in the case, evidence of plaintiff\u2019s character or reputation for turbulence is admissible, even though defendant did not have knowledge of such character before the assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">See also, <em>Peoples Loan &amp; Inv. Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>151 F. 2d 437 (8th Cir. 1945) ; <em>Cain v. Skillin, </em>219 Ala. 228, 121 So. 521 (1929) ; <em>Phillips v. Mooney, </em>126 A. 2d 305 (D. C. Mun. App. 1956); <em>Niemeyer v. McCarty, </em>221 Ind. 688, 51 N. E. 2d 365 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">We think Judge Mackey was justified, in the circumstances, in refusing to give Bugg a continuance. Whether his ruling in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>respect of the soTcalled doctor\u2019s bills or \u201chospital records\u201d was correct need not detain us. We shall assume that Bugg, if he again elects to appear in proper person, will seek information, before the trial, as to the proper procedure for the admission of these items into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Accordingly we shall reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of Cash and Carpenter and remand the case for a new trial. The judgment in favor of Brown will be affirmed, ,</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Judgment in favor of arppellee Brown affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>One-third of the costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>Judgment in favor of appellees Cash and Carpenter reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\n<em>The remaining two-thirds of the costs to abide the result below.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
