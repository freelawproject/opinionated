He also contends that he should not be obliged to pay his former wife alimony for the same period because she took the children to Europe without the consent of the lower court, thereby denying appellant visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellant had a continuing common law obligation to support his children. <em>Kriedo v. Kriedo, </em>159 Md. 229, 150 A. 720 (1930). This responsibility does not necessarily terminate when the child is not within the jurisdiction. <em>State v. James, </em>203 Md. 113 at 124, 100 A. 2d 12 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">It is clear that the court in the exercise of a sound discretion may vary or modify an order for support and maintenance of children. Code (1966 Repl. Vol.), Art. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 66. <em>Price v. Price, </em>232 Md. 379, 194 A. 2d 99 (1963); <em>Bebermeyer v. Bebermeyer, </em>241 Md. 72, 215 A. 2d 463 (1965).
