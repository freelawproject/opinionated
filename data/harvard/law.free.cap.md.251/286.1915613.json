The language said to be ambiguous, or otherwise requiring construction, provides that \u201cInsuring Agreement II [extending coverage to non-owned automobiles] does not apply * * * to any accident arising out of the operation of an automobile business,\u201d which is defined to mean \u201cthe business of selling, repairing, servicing, storing or parking of automobiles.\u201d The facts are simple and not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In November 1962, Roney Motor Company of Frederick, Maryland, employed Davis as a motor mechanic. Davis owned a 1960 Valiant upon which appellant (State Farm) had issued a public liability policy, the pertinent provisions of which are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On S November, Davis, who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>been adjusting the carburetor of a customer\u2019s car, started the engine to see if it would function properly. The car moved forward, striking and injuring appellee (Stitely). More than four months later Davis received a letter, dated 21 March 1963, from Universal Underwriters Insurance Company reciting a subrogee\u2019s interest arising out of its payment of workmen\u2019s compensation to Stitely and advising Davis to report the matter to his insurer, which he did on 4 April 1963. Davis, prior to the receipt of the letter of 21 March, \u201chad no reason or idea in the world that the accident involved in this case was something that was in any way connected with his own automobile insurance company and for that reason he made no report [to State Farm].\u201d State Farm declined the defense of the action claiming untimely notice and no coverage. On 2 May 1966 Stitely, to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>own use and the use of Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, filed a bill in the Circuit Court for Frederick County seeking a declaration that State Farm is obliged to defend Stitely\u2019s suit and to respond in damages. The trial judge, Clapp, J., declared that State Farm is obliged to offer a defense and to \u201crespond in such damages as may be there found to the extent of and within the limitations of its policy of insurance.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree with the result reached by Judge Clapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The appellee cites many cases in support of Judge Clapp\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe exclusion as to accidents arising out of the operation of an automobile business does not apply where the named insured, an automobile mechanic, is using a non-owned private passenger automobile in his occupation with the permission of the owner or person in lawful possession of it.\u201d Those cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> however, as well as others cited by Judge Clapp,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> all involve policies in which the exclusion is based on such language as \u201cwhile used [or being used] in the automobile business by the insured.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The language in this case embodies a concept quite different from \u201cuse in the automobile business.\u201d It proscribes coverage as to <em>\u201cany </em>accident <em>arising out </em>of the <em>operation </em>of <em>an </em>automobile business.\u201d (Emphasis added.) There can be no doubt that Stitely sustained an accident. To argue that his accident did not arise out of the operation of the automobile business seems to us to be an exercise in futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Appellee, in his argument, adopts the reasoning of Judge Clapp that the exclusionary clause must be made to read \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>any accident arising out of <em>the use of the non-o-Med automobile in </em>the operation of the automobile business.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Otherwise, it is said, the preceding clause, 1 c, would be completely nullified. Both Judge Clapp and appellee seem to have assumed that under clause 1 c, which allows the insured (Davis) to use a non-owned private passenger automobile in his business or occupation as long as it is operated or occupied by him, a relative or his private chauffeur or servant, Davis had the right to use the customer\u2019s car in his business of being a motor mechanic, since the car was being operated or occupied by him. As we see it clause 2 does not nullify clause 1 c; it simply reduces by one (the automobile business) the number of businesses in which Davis could use a non-owned private passenger automobile and that, it is plain, is the office of clause 2. It is argued also that because the words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cused\u201d appear in other clauses of the policy they ought to be read into clause 2. We see nothing persuasive in that argument. It seems entirely clear to us that State Farm\u2019s purpose in inserting clause 2 was to preclude, as far as this policy is concerned, liability for <em>any </em>accident arising out of the operation of the automobile business. Had it wished to incorporate the \u201cuse in the automobile business\u201d concept it could quite easily have used one of its other policies, for which, no doubt, a higher premium would have been demanded. <em>Capece v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>86 N.J. Super. 462, 207 A. 2d 207 (1965). See note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Stitely invites our attention to the two hypotheses used by Judge Clapp to shore up the notion that the language of the policy is neither plain nor unambiguous. The first, as stated by Judge Clapp, is that \u201cif the named insured had been driving a non-owned automobile, with the permission of the owner, and not as an employee, into a garage where he was not employed, for the purpose of having it repaired, and should cause an injury through his negligent operation, it could hardly be contended that he would not be covered by the policy. Yet in a broad sense the accident would have arisen out of the operation of an automobile business.\u201d The second has the named insured colliding with an automotive service truck on its way to render assistance to a customer. It might be said that either hypothesis is incidentally tangential tO' the operation of the automobile business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>but that either one <em>arises out of </em>the operation of the automobile business is a concept which must be rejected. It might as well be said that one kicked by a lawyer\u2019s horse has sustained an injury arising out of the practice of law. Even if it were possible to do so, no useful purpose would be served by any attempt on our part to categorize assorted factual situations either as \u201carising out of the operation of the automobile business\u201d or as being merely incidentally tangential thereto. It suffices to say that Stitely\u2019s injuries were caused by an accident which arose out of the operation of the automobile business and although we so hold it must not be supposed that our holding is to be extended beyond this case or any case in which similar facts appear. It will have been observed, of course, that, when the injury occurred, both Stitely and Davis were engaged in the performance of their duties as motor mechanics, that the accident happened during working hours and on the premises of the employer, whose business, it is agreed, is the repair and servicing of automobiles, a situation significantly different from either of the hypotheses posed by Judge Clapp.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">For reasons not altogether clear Stitely appears to find some comfort in <em>Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Ins. </em>Co., 233 Md. 205, 196 A. 2d 76 (1963). While the facts in that case differ somewhat from the facts in this case, we recognized, in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the problems involved in the construction of insurance contracts where language such as \u201cany accident arising out of the operation of a[n automobile] repair shop\u201d is used. There a bus belonging to Bartko had been painted in a shop owned by Wolf. Bartko, driving his own car, went to Wolf\u2019s shop to get the bus. Wolf refused to drive the bus to Bartko\u2019s home but he agreed to follow in Bartko\u2019s car if Bartko would thereafter bring him back to his shop. Wolf was insured by Pennsylvania. Bartko\u2019s policy, issued by Travelers\u2019, contained the following exclusionary clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201c 'The insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named insured or such spouse does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201c \u2018 (1) to any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, operating an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>sales agency, repair shop, * * * <em>with respect to any accident arising out of the operation thereof </em>* * \u201d <em>Id. at </em>209 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Just as Wolf reached Bartko\u2019s driveway he collided with an automobile belonging to one Carnes. In the ensuing litigation Pennsylvania sought to establish Travelers\u2019 liability to Carnes. The trial judge held that Travelers\u2019 exclusionary clause relieved it of any obligation to provide coverage to Wolf. She (Judge Shirley Jones) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201c \u2018The fact is that in this particular instance the service was performed for the customer and even though Wolf may have considered it merely a favor or an accomodation, it was nonetheless a service arising directly from the work which he had performed for the customer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. at 212.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">We agreed with Judge Jones and we went on to conclude that the collision with Carnes did indeed arise out of Wolf\u2019s operation of an automobile repair shop. Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge), said, for the Court, in respect of the problems of construction :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\u201cIn construing this [language in the Pennsylvania policy] and similar language in insurance contracts such as \u2018any accident arising out of the operation\u2019 of a repair shop (the language used in Travelers\u2019 policy), the Courts have been reluctant to attempt to set forth a hard and fast definition thereof, preferring to base their decisions upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, in which due consideration is given to such factors as the nature of the transaction, its connection with the business, and whether it is a natural and/or necessary incident of the operation thereof, though not necessarily foreseen or expected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">In <em>Allen v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>108 Vt. 317, 187 A. 512 (1936), precisely the same language was involved. There Allen, who operated a garage in Randolph, Vermont, repaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>a car belonging to a touring Kansan, Holmes, who was insured by Travelers. It was arranged that Allen, after completing the repairs, would deliver the car to Holmes in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. In so doing he collided with Rich. The Vermont court affirmed the holding of the trial judge that the delivery of Holmes\u2019 car by Allen \u201cwas undertaken as something connected with the operation of the business, and arising out of it\u201d and that the exclusionary clause in Holmes\u2019 policy exonerated Travelers. <em>Allen </em>was cited by Judge Prescott in <em>Pennsylvania </em>and it <em>{Allen) </em>appears to be the source of the quotation therefrom which we have set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Judge Prescott alluded to the contrary result reached in <em>Employers Mut. Cas. Co. v. Federated Mut. Implement &amp; Hardware Ins. Co., </em>213 F. 2d 421, 423 (8th Cir. 1954). The exclusionary clause of that policy is identical with that of the case at bar. Quoting with approval from <em>Allen, </em>the court agreed with the trial judge that \u201cthere was ample evidence to justify the finding that the mission upon which Mr. Ulnick was embarked at the time of the accident was a purely personal one.\u201d The case is interesting in that it provides a sort of negative support for the holdings of <em>Pennsylvania </em>and <em>Allen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">It would seem to follow, we think, that if <em>Pennsylvania </em>and <em>Allen </em>have been correctly decided then the conclusion that the accident in the instant case arose out of the operation of the automobile business is both palatable and assimilable. The language of the policy is clear and unambiguous and, in the circumstances of this case, construction thereof is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Having decided there is no coverage we do not reach the question of proper notice. The judgment of the trial judge will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Case remanded for the entry of a declaration conformable to the views expressed in this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellee Stitely.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. \u201cINSURING AGREEMENT II\u2014NON-OWNED AUTOMOBILES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\">\u201cSuch insurance as is afforded by this policy under coverages A, B, Division 2 of C and M, D, D-50, E, G and H with respect to the owned automobile applies to the use of a non-owned automobile by the named insured or a relative, and any other person or organization legally responsible for the use by the named insured or relative of an automobile not owned or hired by such other person or organization provided such use is with the permission of the owner or person in lawful possession of such automobile. <em>\u201cInsuring Agreement II does not apply:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201c(1) <em>to a non-owned automobile </em>(a) registered in the name of the named insured or a relative, (b) hired by or furnished to the named insured or a relative for regular use, or (c) <em>while used in the business or occupation of such named insured or relative except a private passenger automobile operated or occupied by such named insured, relative, or by his private chauffeur or domestic servant;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">\u201c(2) to any accident arising out of the operation of an automobile business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-12\">\u201c(3) under coverages C and M, unless bodily injury results from the operation of such automobile by such named insured or relative or on their behalf by a private chauffeur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>or domestic servant or from the occupancy thereof by such named insured or relative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cDEFINITIONS \u2014 INSURING AGREEMENTS I AND II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cAutomobile Business\u2014means the business of selling, repairing, servicing, storing or parking of automobiles.\u201d \u201cEXCLUSIONS \u2014 INSURING AGREEMENTS I AND II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">\n<em>\"This insurance does not apply under:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">\u201c(a) any of the coverages (except under coverages C and M for bodily injuries to the named insured and his relatives) while the owned automobile is rented or leased to others by the insured, used as a public or livery conveyance, or used for carrying persons for a charge, but the transportation on a share expense basis in a private passenger automobile of friends, neighbors, fellow employees or school children shall not be deemed carrying persons for a charge; \u201c(b) coverages A and B, to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201c(c) coverages A and B, <em>except as to the named insured, to the owned automobile while used in an automobile business, </em>except that coverages A and B shall apply, as excess insurance over any other collectible insurance, to a resident of the same household as the named insured, to a partnership in which such resident or the named insured is a partner, or to any partner, agent or employee of the named insured, such resident or partnership;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">.
