(A/C), an electrical subcontractor, entered into an oral contract to do certain electrical work on the remodeling of a restaurant in Washington, D. C. The general contractor was Capitol Construction Co. (Capitol), a proprietorship conducted by Albert Berkman. Berkman, as principal, and Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna), as surety, had provided the owner of the restaurant with a labor and material payment bond in the penal sum of $8,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">The parties have stipulated that A/C did $9,734.00 worth of work on the restaurant. Sometime in May of 1965, Capitol sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>A/C a check for $5,000.00, which was intended to be a partial payment on account. Capitol\u2019s bank declined to honor the check, however, and on 24 June 1965, Capitol gave A/C a confessed judgment note, guaranteed by Albert Berkman. The note was in the amount of $10,068.81, maturing in 60 days and providing for interest at 6%, and was designed to cover not only the restaurant job, but other amounts owed A/C by Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">On 9 July 1965, A/C filed notice of its intention to assert a mechanic\u2019s lien against the restaurant, but for some reason not clear to us, this was not pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">On 12 July, A/C wrote to Aetna:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cConfirming our telephone conversation of Wednesday, July 7, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cSince you people furnished a payment and performance bond on the above job, we are notifying you of our interest in same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u201cThe amount of our bill is $9734.62. After many attempts, even through the National Bank of Rosslyn, Virginia (Mrs. Hayes) to collect same, we have only a 60 day note which we are holding until August 23, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">\u201cIf we do not receive payment that day, appropriate legal action will commence at once.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Capitol failed to honor its note on 25 August, and on the following day, Aetna wrote to Berkman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">\u201cWe have been put on notice of a mechanics\u2019 lien, filed by the A/C Electric Co. Inc. in the amount of $9,734.62 on the above captioned bond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">\u201cAs indemnitor under this bond, we are looking to you to satisfy this claim or put us in funds, in order that we might satisfy the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">\u201cWe would appreciate your prompt reply concerning your intentions on this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">On 3 September 1968, Aetna wrote to A/C:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-16\">\u201cThis will acknowledge your letter of August 30th,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>addressed to the attention of Mr. Wm. Haggerty of this office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cWe are presently checking into this matter and you should be hearing from us within ten days to two weeks concerning our status in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">When neither Capitol nor Aetna paid A/C\u2019s bill, on 20 May 1966 suit was instituted against Capitol, Berkman and Aetna. On motion of the plaintiff, summary judgment was entered against Capitol and Berkman, and the case proceeded to trial against Aetna. At the close of A/C\u2019s case, Aetna\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was granted. From the judgment entered for Aetna, this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Problems arising from surety arrangements are as old as recorded history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As presented to us in the briefs and on argument, the case involves a head-on collision between two principles of the law of suretyship, both too well recognized to require extensive elaboration. On the one hand, A/C argues that a creditor\u2019s acceptance of additional collateral security, even though it has a maturity date later than that of the original debt, does not amount, in the absence of an agreement, to an extension of time of payment which will release a surety from his obligation and cites <em>Hayes v. Wells, </em>34 Md. 512, 517 (1871). To the same effect, <em>see Asbell v. Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>156 Md. 106, 143 A. 715 (1928); <em>Berman v. Elm Loan &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, </em>114 Md. 191, 78 A. 1104 (1910); <em>American Iron &amp; Steel Mjg. Co. v. Beall, </em>101 Md. 423, 61 A. 629 (1905); <em>Warner v. Williams, </em>93 Md. 517, 49 A. 559 (1901); <em>Oberndorff v. Union Bank, </em>31 Md. 126 (1869); Stearns, <em>Suretyship </em>(5th ed. 1951) \u00a7 6.27 at 149; and Brandt, <em>Suretyship md Guaranty </em>(3d ed. 1905) \u00a7 403 at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">On the other hand, Aetna contends that, by taking the note, A/C substituted a wholly new obligation for the debt which had existed on open account, thus extending time of payment, and that this released the surety under the rule of <em>Dixon v. Spencer, </em>59 Md. 246 (1883) and <em>Berman v. Elm Lom &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>These cases hold that when a creditor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the principal alter the terms of an obligation without the consent of the surety, the surety is discharged. Stearns, <em>op. tit., </em>\u00a7 6.22 at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The lower court rejected A/C\u2019s contention and accepted Aetna\u2019s argument. As we see it, under the facts of the case, neither contention is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Capitol was sued as a corporation; service of process was made on Albert Berkman as its \u201csecretary-treasurer\u201d; and judgment was entered against it as a corporation. The stenographic transcript of arguments on the motion for directed verdict indicates that counsel for both Aetna and A/C were under the impression that Capitol was a corporation. In fact, as the trial judge pointed out, Capivol Construction Company was an individual proprietorship, but counsel for both parties readily conceded that this should not affect the result. We think it was of considerable significance. The record shows that Aetna\u2019s bond identified the principal as \u201cAlbert Berkman t/a Capitol Construction Company.\u201d The bond application was signed \u201cCapitol Const. Co. by Albert Berkman\u201d, as was the note which Capitol gave A/C.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">A/C\u2019s dealings were with Berkman, who traded as Capitol Construction Company. When A/C took Capitol\u2019s note, guaranteed by Berkman, it got nothing more than Berkman\u2019s promise to pay, the same promise which Berkman had made when A/C extended Capitol credit on open account. What A/C accepted, however, was an obligation having a different due date from that created by the extension of credit on open account: the note called for payment 60 days from date, with interest at <em>6%. </em>The obligor and obligee of the note were precisely the same as the parties who had dealt on open account, and in this respect, <em>Brengle v. Bushey, </em>40 Md. 141 (1874), where additional and better security was given by one of two joint and several obligors, is distinguishable. When it took the notes, A/C not only failed to improve the quality of its security, but converted an indebtedness which was immediately due to one where payment could not be enforced for 60 days. It cannot be successfully maintained that the note was collateral security for the payment of a prior debt or that payment of the open account could have been enforced, once the note was accepted. In es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>sence, the note was given and accepted in substitution for and in satisfaction of a pre-existing and different obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">However, Aetna\u2019s reliance on the rule of <em>Dixon v. Spencer, supra-, </em>is misplaced, under all the circumstances. In that case, Spencer agreed to furnish ale, beer and porter to Houck on credit, payable in 30 days. Dixon guaranteed the payment of the account. When Houck\u2019s indebtedness to Spencer aggregated $263.53, Spencer took two promissory notes for the amount due, payable in 60 and 90 days. Judge Robinson, speaking for our predecessors, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cThe main question is whether the taking of these promissory notes by the appellees discharges the appellant from his liability as guarantor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201cIt can hardly be necessary to cite authorities in support of the general principle, that where the time of payment is, without the consent of the surety, extended for a definite time, by a valid contract between the creditor and the principal, the surety is thereby discharged. The subject and the many decisions in regard to it, are fully considered and discussed in 2 Amer. Lead. Cas. 431. See also Brandt on Surety. &amp; Guar. 401.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\u201cThe surety, by his contract, merely guarantees the payment by his principal of a certain sum of money at a stipulated time. This he engages to do and no more. Upon the default of the principal he has the right to pay the money and to proceed at once against him for indemnity. If the creditor, however, makes a new contract with the principal\u2014takes his promissory note, payable at another and further time\u2014he is thereby precluded from suing on the original contract until the maturity of the note, and the surety is also deprived of the right to pay the money due on his contract, the payment of which is necessary to enable him to proceed against the principal. By his own act, the creditor has entered into a new contract with the principal, and for the time being has tied his own hands, and the hands of the surety so far as regards the original contract. In so doing without the consent of the surety, the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>says the latter shall be discharged.\u201d 59 Md. at 247-48.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><em>Dixon v. Spencer, </em>although correctly decided on its facts, is not determinative of the issue before us. <em>Dixon, </em>like <em>Berman v. Elm Loan &amp; Savings Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>dealt with the rights of an individual, and presumably uncompensated, surety. Shortly after the turn of the century, our predecessors intimated that a surety \u201c* * * whose obligation is deliberately entered into, as a commercial transaction, and with the exclusive view to the pecuniary profit resulting from it\u201d, <em>Smith v. Turner, </em>101 Md. 584, 587-88, 61 A. 334 (1905), might expect to receive treatment different from that which traditionally had been accorded an uncompensated surety. Thereafter, the principle was followed in <em>Aetna Indemnity Co. v. Waters, </em>110 Md. 673, 699, 73 A. 712 (1909) and formally articulated in <em>Southern Md. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Nat\u2019l Surety Co., </em>126 Md. 290, 94 A. 916 (1915) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cThe doctrine that a surety is a favorite of the law, and that a claim against him is <em>strictissimi juris </em>does not apply where the bond or undertaking is executed upon a consideration by a corporation organized to make such bonds or undertakings for profit.\u201d 126 Md. at 293.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">To the same effect are <em>Chapman v. Hoage, </em>296 U. S. 526, 80 L. Ed. 370, 56 S. Ct. 333 (1936); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Fowler, </em>31 F. 2d 881, 884 (4th Cir. 1929) ; <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Knox Net &amp; Twine Co., </em>150 Md. 40, 43, 132 A. 261 (1926); and <em>American Fidelity Co. v. Short &amp; Walls Lumber Co., </em>128 Md. 50, 56, 97 A. 12 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Fowler, supra, </em>Judge (later Chief Judge) Parker, spoke for the Fourth Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201cThe rule is well settled in this circuit that a compensated surety is in effect an insurer, that its contract will be construed as an insurance contract most strongly in favor of the party or parties protected thereby, that forfeiture on technical grounds will not be favored, and that the strictissimi juris rule of the law of suretyship will not be applied for its protection (citing cases).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u201cThere is authority for the position, also, that failure to give notice under a bond such as this will not discharge the company, in the absence of a showing of loss or damage resulting therefrom * * * (citing cases).\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 884.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The principle was further elaborated when Judge Mitchell, speaking for this Court in <em>Women\u2019s Hospital v. US.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>177 Md. 615, 11 A. 2d 457 (1940), recognized that among the principles to be applied in construing a performance and payment bond were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201c (1) That since the advent of corporate bonding companies whose business it is to become surety upon bonds for a profit, the old doctrine that a surety is a favorite of the law and that a claim against him is <em>strictissimi juris </em>has been greatly minimized; (2) that the business of surety corporations being in all essentials practically that of insurers, the liability upon bonds executed by them has been liberally extended beyond that to which sureties were formerly held, (citing cases).\u201d 177 Md. at 618-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">For other cases holding that the contract of a surety for profit is not to be so strictly construed as one of a surety not for gain, see <em>Walsh v. Jefferson Fed\u2019l Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>216 Md. 131, 137, 139 A. 2d 847 (1958); <em>Lange v. Board of Education, </em>183 Md. 255, 260, 37 A. 2d 317 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">As we said in <em>Berry v. U.S.F. &amp; G. Co., </em>249 Md. 150, 156, 238 A. 2d 907 (1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201cAs the individual surety of the nineteenth century was supplanted by the corporate surety, the modern concepts of the law of suretyship evolved rapidly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">and quoted Stearns, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.4 at 11-13 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">\u201cBecause of the often repeated adjuration that the surety is a favorite of the law, some confusion has arisen as to the manner in which suretyship agreements are to be construed. As we have seen, the early suretyship cases treated the contract as one of great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>burden to the surety, because of the fact that it was usually made for accommodation only, and without any participation in the benefits of the principal contract. These reasons gave rise to a line of decisions strictly construing the suretyship contract in favor of the surety, following the legal doctrine of <em>\u2018strictissinu juris! </em>Although the rule is still applied where an uncompensated surety is involved, the courts generally have abandoned it as to a paid surety and, indeed, tend to construe such a surety\u2019s contract in favor of the obligee. A paid surety which is a surety or bonding company is usually considered to be in the same class as an insurance company, its contract being held to be in the nature of insurance and to be construed according to the rules applicable to insurance contracts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The narrow question raised by this case is whether an extension of time for payment, granted by a creditor to the principal, without the consent of a compensated surety, effects a discharge of that surety. Although we are mindful of the division which exists among the reported cases, <em>see </em>Annotation 74 A. L.R.2d 734 (1960), we think that the modern and correct view is that adopted by Restatement, <em>Security </em>(1941) \u00a7 129 at 346:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>\u201cEXTENSION OE TIME TO PRINCIPAL.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">(1) Subject to the rule stated in Subsection (2) and to the rules in respect of negotiable instruments, where the principal and creditor, without the surety\u2019s consent, make a binding agreement to extend the time of payment by the principal, the surety is discharged unless the creditor in the extension agreement reserves-his rights against the surety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">(2) <em>Where the surety is a compensated surety he is discharged only to the extent that he is harmed by the </em>extension.\u201d (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Illustration 4 to \u00a7 129 is of particular relevance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201cP is a building contractor and S is a compensated surety for the materialmen furnishing supplies. S\u2019s contract does not contain any stipulations as to the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of performance by P and the materialmen. The materialmen grant P a ninety day credit which is subsequently extended sixty days. It is found that the total credit extended to P was reasonable in the circumstances. S remains liable because the reasonable interpretation of his obligation is that he consented to a reasonable extension of credit to P, irrespective of the original terms of the first arrangements made between P and the materialmen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><em>See also, Ore-Ida Potato Products, Inc. v. United Pacific Ins. Co., </em>87 Idaho 185, 392 P. 2d 191 (1964) which adopts the Restatement view; 50 Am.

Ct. 142 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We note, but do not regard as necessarily controlling, A/C\u2019s commendable diligence in notifying Aetna on 7 and 12 July that it had accepted Capitol\u2019s note, and Aetna\u2019s unexplained <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> complacency in failing to reply until 3 September, when it did so without intimating that it intended to resist A/C\u2019s claim. While silence on the part of a surety is not ordinarily regarded as acquiescence or consent, <em>American Iron &amp; Steel Mfg. Co. v. Beall, </em>101 Md. 423, 426, 61 A. 629 (1905); Stearns, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 6.45 at 182, if Aetna is to be regarded as an insurer, other principles may apply. It is well recognized that an insurer may, by its conduct, be deemed to have waived a condition of its policy or some irregularity on the part of its insured, if no extension of coverage results. <em>American Auto.
