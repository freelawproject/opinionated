Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et </em>al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1338-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1338-21\">Petitioner Johnson brought this habeas corpus action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, complaining that he was denied due process of the law in his Florida robbery trial in that the perception of the state\u2019s two major witnesses, both of whom made in-court identifications of him, was influenced by suggestive pretrial photographic identification procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-22\">Identification procedures may be \u201cso unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u201d as to deny a criminal defendant due process of law. <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). However, \u201cconvictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The district court found that the photographic identification procedure used in Johnson\u2019s case was \u201cclose to, if not over, the line of suggestiveness,\u201d and for the purpose of this appeal we assume, without deciding, that it was. Nevertheless, we affirm the denial of the writ, for \u201cimpermissible suggestiveness\u201d does not necessarily give rise to \u201ca very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d Such is the case when a witness\u2019 in-court identification is based upon a source independent of the suggestive photographic display^). Thus the law of this circuit, implied if not stated on numerous occasions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is that \u201cthe existence of an independent basis of in-court identification obviates the necessity of considering the constitutionality of the pretrial identification.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>510 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">Reviewing the record in the state court, which held a full hearing on the source of the in-eourt identification of the two witnesses, our district court concluded that there was no substantial risk of misidentification of Johnson because each witness\u2019 identification was based upon a source independent of the photographs, the confrontation at the scene of the robbery. This was a credibility choice based upon fully developed evidence. It was not clearly erroneous, and it will not be disturbed upon appeal. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>497 F.2d 160, 163 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1035, 95 S.Ct. 520, 42 L.Ed.2d 311 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">. <em>E. g., Strader v. Estelle, </em>491 F.2d 969 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>419 U.S. 994, 95 S.Ct. 305, 42 L.Ed.2d 266 (1974); <em>Hines v.

Johnson has asked us to abandon this position and adopt the holding of <em>Rudd v. Florida, </em>343 F.Supp. 212, 220 (M.D.Fla.1972) that \u201cany simultaneous identification of a suspect by two or more witnesses in the presence of each other is so impermissibly suggestive as to amount to a denial of due process, and any subsequent in-court identifications must be subjected to a <em>per se </em>exclusionary rule.\u201d We specifically declined to embrace such a <em>per se </em>rule in affirming, <em>Rudd v. Florida, </em>477 F.2d 805, 812 (5th Cir. 1973), and here emphatically reject it again for the reasons stated at 477 F.2d 812.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
