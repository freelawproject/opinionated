Wohlgemuth, </em>376 F.Supp. 173 (W.D.Pa.1974).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was argued before a panel of this court on October 24, 1974. The panel\u2019s opinion and judgment were filed on December 10, 1974. On December 24, 1974, the plaintiffs (appellees and cross-appellants) petitioned the court to rehear the case en banc. On January 31, 1975, we vacated the panel\u2019s December 10, 1974, judgment and ordered the case to be reheard en banc. The case was reargued en banc on May 8, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">The facts appear in the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 175 \u2014 78. Briefly stated, the plaintiffs are women who are eligible for benefits under the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program (PMAP).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants are \u201cthe Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare (Department) and certain of its Officers and/or Administrative Representatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. The plaintiffs challenge certain procedural requirements (hereinafter referred to as \u201cprocedures\u201d or \u201cregulations\u201d) which the Department has adopted to restrict PMAP payments for abortions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court found that, under those procedures, abortions would only be performed under PMAP in the following situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-18\">\u201c \u20181. There is documented medical evidence that continuance of the pregnancy may threaten the health or life of the mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-19\">2. There is documented medical evidence that the infant may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-20\">3. There is documented medical evidence that a continuance of a pregnancy resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>incest, may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of a patient;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">4. Two other physicians chosen because of their recognized professional competency have examined the patient and have concurred in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">5. The procedure is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 175. See also <em>id. </em>at 175 n. I.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In effect, these requirements define a compensable \u201ctherapeutic\u201d abortion, and exclude payment for non-therapeutic, or \u201celective,\u201d abortions. The district court found that PMAP also covers the costs of prenatal care, childbirth, and post-par-tum treatment when the woman chooses to bear the child. <em>Id. </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The plaintiffs attack the Department\u2019s regulations both on the statutory ground that they are inconsistent with Title XIX (commonly called \u201cMedicaid\u201d) of the Social Security Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(1974),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and also on the constitutional ground that they are inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), the Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of a suit which challenged certain New York regulations under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 <em>et seq. </em>(1974). Like Medicaid, AFDC is a voluntary participation program. See <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra </em>at 530 n. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1372. Like the plaintiffs in the case now before us, the plaintiffs in <em>Hagans v. Lavine </em>challenged the New York regulations both on the ground that they were inconsistent with the Act and also on the ground that they violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 94 S.Ct. 1372. The Court held that the constitutional claim was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but required the district court on remand to consider the statutory claim first as a matter of pendant jurisdiction. <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra, </em>at 536, 539-43, 94 S.Ct. 1372. The Supreme Court has recently made it clear that in the Title XIX setting it also desires the statutory claim to be carefully considered before constitutional questions are reached. In <em>Westby v. Doe, </em>420 U.S. 968, 95 S.Ct. 1385, 43 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975), vacating <em>Doe v. Westby, </em>383 F.Supp. 1143 (D.S.D.1974), a policy of the Social Services Department of the State of South Dakota, which limited payment under Title XIX for abortions, was under review. The district court had reached the question of the policy\u2019s constitutionality without any consideration of the policy\u2019s consistency with Title XIX, and the Supreme Court summarily vacated and remanded for reconsideration in the light of <em>Hagans v. Lavine.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>In the case before us, the district court considered the statutory claim, but decided that the Pennsylvania procedures were consistent with the Social Security Act. See <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 182-86. Turning to the allegations of unconstitutionality, the court declared the procedures to be in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. See <em>id. </em>at 186-92.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Both arguments are renewed in this appeal. Because we believe that the principle of <em>Hagans v. Lavine </em>applies to the courts of appeals as well as to the district courts, we will consider first whether the Pennsylvania procedures are consistent with the Social Security Act. See <em>Alma Motor Co. v. Timkin-Detroit Axle Co., </em>329 U.S. 129, 136-37, 67 S.Ct. 231, 91 L.Ed. 128 (1947); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schiavo, </em>504 F.2d 1, 6-7 &amp; n. 11 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">II. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT ON THE SCOPE OF STATE PREROGATIVE UNDER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The district court reasoned that the Social Security Act was designed to give the states great latitude in establishing eligibility for, and levels of, benefits. <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 184\u201486. The court relied principally on <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), in which the Supreme Court held that the Social Security Act allowed the states to place a ceiling on the amount of benefits available to recipients of AFDC. See also <em>New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino, </em>413 U.S. 405, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973) (a work incentive program added to the AFDC provisions of the Act does not pre-empt state work incentive programs); <em>Jefferson v. Hackney, </em>406 U.S. 535, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972) (Texas\u2019 method of computation of AFDC benefits held consistent with the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">The Supreme Court has recognized an important qualification to the <em>Dandridge v. Williams </em>principle. In <em>King v. Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 118 (1968), the Court held invalid Alabama regulations which prevented AFDC benefits from flowing to the children of women cohabiting out of wedlock. The Court found the regulations to be inconsistent with congressional policy regarding AFDC recipients. Similarly, in <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970), the Court held invalid a New York law which lowered the \u201cstandard of need\u201d for AFDC benefits, finding the law to be inconsistent with what the Court \u201cfathom[ed] to be the Congressional purpose\u201d in enacting \u00a7 402(a)(23) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 602(a)(23) (1974). 397 U.S. at 414b-15, 90 S.Ct. 1207. <em>King </em>and <em>Rosado </em>demonstrate that, although the AFDC program is a \u201cscheme of cooperative federalism,\u201d <em>King, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 316, 88 S.Ct. at 2128 it is not a scheme of unlimited state discretion. Instead, Congress defined an area of state prerogative, the boundaries of which are defined by the congressional policies \u2014 both explicit and implicit<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u2014found in the Social Security Act. The <em>King v. Smith </em>principle was reaffirmed by an eight-Justice majority in <em>Van Lare v. Hurley, </em>421 U.S. 338, 95 S.Ct. 1741, 44 L.Ed.2d 208 (1975) (finding New York\u2019s \u201clodger\u201d regulations inconsistent with the Social Security Act). See also <em>Townsend v. Swank, </em>404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971); <em>Lewis v. Martin, </em>397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">III. TITLE XIX AS A \u201cSCHEME OF COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">A. <em>Areas of state discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Both parties agree with the district court that Title XIX, like AFDC, is a system of \u201ccooperative federalism.\u201d <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 184. The congressional desire to give the states considerable latitude in the administration of Title XIX is apparent throughout the statute. Funds are appropriated \u201c[f]or the purpose of enabling each State, <em>as far as practicable under the conditions in such State,\u201d </em>to furnish medical assistance and other services. ' 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396 (1974) (emphasis added). The states are free to choose whether they will participate at all; a participating state\u2019s program can cover only the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d \u00a7 1396(a)(10); 45 C.F.R. 249.10(a)(1) (Rev.Ed., Oct. 1, 1973); or it can be extended to include the \u201cmedically needy\u201d as well. Section 1396(a)(10)(C); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.10(a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If a state extends coverage to the medically needy, it can either give the types of care and services listed in clauses (1) through (5) of \u00a7 1396d(a) or give any seven of the types of care and services described in clauses (1) through (16) of \u00a7 1396d(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 1396a(a)(13)(C). The statute literally abounds with other options which are open to the participating states, all of which should help to tailor the state\u2019s program to the needs and conditions in that state, as contemplated in the appropriations section quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">B. <em>Explicit statutory limitations on state discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">The story does not end with the litany of state discretion in A above. Many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>other provisions of the statute are designed to channel the state\u2019s program in directions which are consistent with the basic congressional objective of furnishing \u201cmedical assistance on behalf of families . . . whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d \u00a7 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"A77\">1. <em>Required services</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAAE\">Although the states were given a choice of services to provide to the medically needy, Congress requires the participating states to provide services (1) through (5) in \u00a7 1396d(a) to the categorically needy. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(B). Those services are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIYo\">\u201c(1) inpatient hospital services; (2) outpatient hospital services; (3) other laboratory and X-ray services; (4) skilled nursing facility services, screening and diagnosis of children, family planning services and supplies furnished to individuals of child bearing age; and (5) physicians\u2019 services furnished by a physician whether in the office, patient\u2019s home, hospital or elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMs\"><em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"AhHk\">2. <em>Equality requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">Another section of the Act requires the assistance made available to the categorically needy to be equitably distributed, and to be equal to the assistance made available to the medically needy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aokx\">\u201c(a) A State plan for medical assistance must\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeCGE\">(10) provide\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEVg\">(A) for making medical assistance available to all individuals receiving aid or assistance under any plan of the State approved under subchapter I, X, XIV, or XVI, or part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, or with respect to whom supplemental security income benefits are being paid under subchapter XVI of this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azu\">(B) that the medical assistance made available to any individual described in clause (A)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">(i) <em>shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope </em>than the medical assistance made available to any other such individual, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av8Q\">(ii) <em>shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope </em>than the medical assistance made available to individUals not described in clause A; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMd\">(C) if medical assistance is included for any group of individuals who are not described in clause (A) and who do not meet the income and resources requirements of the appropriate State plan, or the supplemental security income program under subchapter XVI of this chapter, as the case may be, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atb\">(i) for making medical assistance available to all individuals who would, except for income and resources, be eligible for aid or assistance under any such State plan or to have paid with respect to them supplemental security income benefits under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and who have insufficient (as determined in accordance with comparable standards) income and resources to meet the costs of necessary medical and remedial care and services, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJT\">(ii) that the medical .assistance made available to all individuals not described in clause (A) <em>shall be equal in amount, duration, and scope;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkL-\">Section 1396a(a)(10) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">C. <em>General limitations on state discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARWd\">1. <em>Economy</em></p>\n<p id=\"AKIN\">In addition to the above express limitations on state prerogatives, the Act and its history include more general statements of purpose. These also are binding upon the participating states. Section 1396a(a)(17)(A) requires state-adopted standards for the receipt of benefits to be \u201cconsistent with the objectives of this subchapter [Title XIX].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>See also <em>King v. Smith </em>and <em>Rosado v. Wyman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Section 1396a(a)(30) requires the states to take such steps \u201cas may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of care and services.\u201d This same emphasis upon payment for \u201cnecessary\u201d medical services is reflected in \u00a7 1396, the appropriations section, which states that the purpose of the Act is \u201cto furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of families . . . whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d Similar language appears in the definition in \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i) of the medically needy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Limiting payments to those services which are \u201cnecessary\u201d is also supported by recent amendments to Title XIX, which evidence a strong congressional interest in economy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">2. <em>Physicians\u2019 discretion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">It is also apparent that Congress intended to place the primary authority for determining what treatment a particular recipient requires in the hands of the attending physician. The Senate Committee on Finance, which in 1965 reported favorably on the amendments to the Social Security Act that included the creation of Title XIX, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201c3. <em>General Provisions Relating to the Basic and Voluntary Supplementary Plans</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201c(a) Conditions and limitations on payment for services</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">\u201c(1) Physicians\u2019 role</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhU\">\u201cThe committee\u2019s bill provides that the physician is to be the key figure in determining utilization of health services \u2014 -and provides that it is a physician who is to decide upon admission to a hospital, order tests, drugs and treatments, and determine the length of stay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">S.Rep.No.404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 1943, 1986. Although these remarks referred to the amendments to Medicare (Title XVIII), Congress understood Medicaid (Title XIX) as an expansion of the Medicare concept. The same Committee wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">\u201cThe committee bill is designed to liberalize the Federal law under which States operate their medical assistance programs so as to make medical services for the needy more generally available. To accomplish this objective, the committee bill would establish, effective January 1, 1966, a new title in the Social Security Act \u2014 \u2018Title XIX: Grants to the States for Medical Assistance Programs.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-15\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 2014. Thus, in <em>Roe v. Norton, </em>380 F.Supp. 726 (D.Conn.1974), the court discerned \u201cthe basic philosophy of both the Medicare and Medicaid provisions, which emphasizes the wide discretion to be accorded physicians in treating their patients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>We must conclude that although Title XIX involves a system of \u201ccooperative federalism,\u201d the congressional hand has been rather heavy in circumscribing the area of state prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">IV. THE PENNSYLVANIA REGULATIONS\u2019 CONSISTENCY WITH TITLE XIX</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Pennsylvania argues that its abortion regulations pursue congressional objectives. The state relies on the congressional mandate, noted above, to provide only necessary services, arguing that its regulations restrict payments for abortions to those which are \u201cnecessary,\u201d excluding those which are \u201celective.\u201d The argument proves too much. It is undoubtedly true that at the time a woman chooses to have a non-therapeutic abortion there is a greater quantum of personal freedom than at the time she has a therapeutic abortion or goes into labor. But there is also greater freedom of choice involved when one decides to have a tooth cavity filled than when one is forced to have the tooth extracted after it has abscessed. The state could not require Title XIX beneficiaries to await the abscess and undergo the extraction<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without damaging the broad purposes of Title XIX. And it is inconsistent with \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(B) and (C), which requires equality among beneficiaries, to force pregnant women to use the least voluntary method of treatment, while not imposing a similar requirement on other persons who qualify for aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The plaintiffs, on the other hand, place their reliance on the sections of the statute which require Pennsylvania to furnish them physicians\u2019 services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient services, and family planning services.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because Pennsylvania has chosen to extend coverage to the medically needy, and has chosen not to exercise its option under \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(C)(ii) subsection (13)(C)(i) requires Pennsylvania to extend the services listed in the text to those plaintiffs who are on Public Assistance. For this reason, the plaintiffs are correct in arguing that the state is required to furnish all of them \u2014 both those who are categorically needy and those who are medically needy \u2014 the listed services.</p>\n<p id=\"AiJ9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In both the statute and the regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, physicians\u2019 services are defined by reference to the legal practice of medicine under state law. See \u00a7 1396d(a)(5), referring to \u00a7 1395x(r)(l); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.10(b)(5) (Rev. ed., Oct. 1, 1973). Since <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and <em>Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973), required the states to legalize the practice of elective abortion during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, the plaintiffs argue that elective abortion is now included in the definition of \u201cphysicians\u2019 services,\u201d and is therefore required to be furnished to the plaintiffs by \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(B) and (C).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Similar arguments are advanced under the rubrics of \u201cinpatient hospital services,\u201d \u201coutpatient hospital services,\u201d and \u201cfamily planning services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Again, the argument proves too much. Elective cosmetic surgery, for example, is within the licensed practice of medicine in most, if not all, states. If the plaintiffs were correct, the state would be required to pay for such procedures, at the expense, perhaps, of many pressing medical needs of the poor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While \u00a7 1903(e) of the original Act may have required the eventual funding of such procedures,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> its repeal indicates that Congress has no present intention of funding every procedure which falls within the legal practice of medicine. The states are given broad discretion to tailor their programs to their particular needs, and are required to economize and to fund only necessary medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The problem for this court is to harmonize the various competing policies found in the Act and its history. A participating state should be able to adapt its program to its conditions and needs, and to limit the level of its Medicaid expenditures. This can be accomplished by giving the state broad discretion to define the medical conditions for which treatment is \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The proper treatment of such a condition, on the other hand, must be left to the judgment of the attending physician.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See <em>Roe v. Norton, supra </em>at 729. Vesting such discretion in the physician is consistent with congressional objectives, see p. 618, <em>supra; </em>it is also a logical prerequisite to any program intended to bring valid medical assistance to the needy.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u00a7 1396a(a)(19) (requiring states to safeguard \u201cthe best interests of the recipients\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Of course, some regulation of the methods of treatment is reasonable, and unavoidable. But the state should be required to show that, on balance, the policies of Title XIX support the regulations in question. See <em>Doe v. Rose, </em>499 F.2d 1112, 1114 (10th Cir. 1974) (\u201cthe respective states are empowered to impose reasonable standards <em>for carrying out the objectives of the federal program\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Under \u00a7 1396a(a)(19), for example, the state might require some procedures to be performed in hospitals, to protect the medical interests of the recipients. Or, pursuant to the congressional interest in economization, the state might require doctors to prescribe generic drugs rather than brand names, provided, of course, that this would, in the particular instance, be consistent with sound medical practice. Gratuitous interference with medical decisions by doctors, on the other hand, would create a system of medical obstruction, rather than of medical assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Applying the above analysis to the Pennsylvania regulations before us, we find them to be inconsistent with the Act. Since the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pays for full-term deliveries and also for therapeutic abortions, it is plain that the state has determined, in its discretion, that pregnancy is a condition for which medical treatment is \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Title XIX. The next question is whether some justification can be found in the statute for preventing an attending physician from choosing non-therapeutic abortion as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>method for treating a pregnancy.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We can find none. Economy will not do, since in most cases non-therapeutic abortion is the cheapest method of treatment. See <em>Doe v. Rose, supra </em>at 1116-17, <em>citing Klein v. Nassau Cty. Med. Ctr., supra </em>note 12; <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra </em>at 187. Nor will protection of the recipient\u2019s health, under \u00a7 1396a(a)(19) suffice; the state itself admitted at oral argument that non-therapeutic abortion is the least dangerous alternative for the pregnant woman, at least during the first trimester. See <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. at 163, 93 S.Ct. 705. Not only are the state\u2019s abortion regulations not justified by any statutory policy, but they also run directly counter to \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(B) and (C), since the \u201cleast voluntary method of treatment\u201d requirement which the regulations impose on pregnant women is imposed on no other class of recipient. We therefore conclude that once the state has decided to finance full-term delivery and therapeutic abortion as methods for the treatment of pregnancy, it cannot decline to finance non-therapeutic abortions without violating the requirements of Title XIX. Since the decisions of the Supreme Court have forced the states to include elective abortion in the legal practice of medicine through the second trimester of pregnancy,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we also hold that the statute requires Pennsylvania to fund abortions through the end of the second trimester.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">V. CONTRARY ARGUMENTS REJECTED</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In reaching the above conclusion, we are not unmindful that other courts have. found state provisions like Pennsylvania\u2019s to be consistent with the statutory scheme. In <em>Roe v. Ferguson, </em>515 F.2d 279 (6th Cir. 1975), the Sixth Circuit reversed a district court\u2019s holding that Title XIX requires state funding for elective abortions. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMeS\">\u201cThere is no indication that Congress intended to require the furnishing of abortion services not required for the preservation of the health of the woman at a time when the performance of such abortions was illegal in most jurisdictions. In view of the disfavor shown toward abortions in other legislation, we are reluctant to infer that Congress intended to include required coverage for such controversial services without even mentioning the subject. When Congress passed the Family Planning Services and Research Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300a et seq. providing funds to states opting to participate in creating comprehensive programs of family planning services, abortion was specifically excluded as a means of family planning to be recognized under the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a \u2014 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">\u201cIn establishing the Legal Services Corporation system, Congress again provided that no funds of the Corporation could be used for legal assistance for those seeking to procure a nontherapeutic abortion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996f(b)(8).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-13\"><em>Id. </em>See also <em>Doe v. Rose, supra </em>at 1114\u2014 15 (\u201cpreferring]\u201d to decide the case on constitutional grounds in light of the Act\u2019s silence on the abortion question); <em>Doe v. Wohlgemuth, supra. </em>We find none of these arguments to be persuasive. It is impossible to believe that in enacting Title XIX Congress intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to freeze the medical services available to recipients at those which were legal in 1965. Congress surely intended Medicaid to pay for drugs not legally marketable under the FDA\u2019s regulations in 1965 which are subsequently found to be marketable. We can see no reason why the same analysis should not apply to the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of elective abortion in 1973. The inference which the Sixth Circuit drew from legislation in which Congress prohibited expenditure for non-therapeutic abortions also seems unwarranted. Congress could have proscribed payment for elective abortions when it passed the Family Planning Services and Research Act of 1970, or in 1972 when it amended Title XIX, but it did not do so. See Comment, <em>supra </em>note 14, at 933 n.80. Furthermore, abortions are hardly a desirable method of family planning; this consideration may explain the provisions of the Family Planning Services and Research Act relied upon by the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">VI. CONCLUSION AND DISTRICT COURT ACTION ON REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment declaring that the Pennsylvania regulations are inconsistent with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In <em>Hagans v. Lavine, supra, </em>415 U.S. at 543-44, 94 S.Ct. 1372, the Supreme Court pointed out that a single district judge can grant both declaratory and injunctive relief on statutory grounds in a case such as this, using this language (415 U.S. 543, 94 S.Ct. 1382):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cGiven a constitutional question over which the District Court had jurisdiction, it also had jurisdiction over the \u2018statutory\u2019 claim. See <em>[supra, </em>at 536]. The latter was to be decided first and the former not reached if the statutory claim was dispositive. [Citing cases.] The constitutional claim could be adjudicated only by a three-judge court, but the statutory claim was within the jurisdiction of a single district judge. [Citing cases.] Thus, the District Judge, sitting alone, moved directly to the statutory claim. His decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals, although had a three-judge court been convened, an injunction issued, and the statutory ground alone decided, the appeal would be only to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnH\">The court went on to state at 543-45, 94 S.Ct. at 1382:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">\u201cThe procedure followed by the District Court \u2014 initial determination of substantiality and then adjudication of the \u2018statutory\u2019 claim without convening a three-judge court\u2014 . accurately reflects the recent evolution of three-judge-court jurisprudence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">\u201cIt is true that the constitutional claim would warrant convening a three-judge court and that if a single judge rejects the statutory claim, a three-judge court must be called to consider the constitutional issue. Nevertheless, the coincidence of a constitutional and statutory claim should not automatically require a single-judge district court to defer to a three-judge panel, which, in view of what we have said in <em>Rosado v. Wyman, supra, </em>could then merely pass the statutory claim back to the single judge. [Citing cases.] \u2018In fact, it would be grossly inefficient to send a three-judge court a claim which will only be sent immediately back. This inefficiency is especially apparent if the single judge\u2019s decision resolves the case, for there is then no need to convene the three judge court.\u2019 [Citing case.] Section 2281 does not forbid this practice, and we are not inclined to read that statute \u2018in isolation with mutilating literalness . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">We have quoted the foregoing because we hold at this time that the majority opinion in <em>Murrow </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>502 F.2d 1066 (3d Cir. 1974), will not be followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>insofar as it is inconsistent with (a) part II of <em>Hagans v.

Contrary to the court\u2019s assumption, it is possible that an attending physician would have concluded that an abortion was medically indicated with respect to one or more of the appellees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atuv\">\u201cAt bottom, therefore, appellees\u2019 argument apparently is that the Social Security Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>requires reimbursement of the costs of all medically feasible abortions performed merely upon the demand of pregnant women. We see no statutory basis for this contention. An abortion is a serious medical matter which requires an exercise of medical judgment. A state need not provide medical assistance with respect to other medical services \u2014 such as, for example, a tonsillectomy \u2014 merely upon the patient\u2019s own request, and there is no apparent reason why abortions should be treated differently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The Memorandum also quoted from <em>Doe v.

In the spirit of \u201ccooperative federalism,\u201d Congress annually appropriates funds to enable each state, \u201cas far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to furnish medical assistance\u201d to designated families and individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of <em>necessary medical services.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396. (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">A state is not required to participate in the Medicaid Program, but if it chooses to become a participant, it must submit a plan for medical assistance to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\u201cHEW\u201d) for approval, which is conditioned upon the plan comporting with the provisions of Title XIX. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396, 1396a(b). Thereafter, operation of the program is under state direction with continuing eligibility for federal grants subject to the state\u2019s compliance with the originally approved plan and federal regulations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c; 45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 246-280.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">As dictated by the federal statute and regulations, a state\u2019s Medicaid program <em>must </em>provide medical assistance<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d as spelled out by the majority. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">A state <em>may </em>decide to limit coverage to the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d or it <em>may </em>decide to include within the scope of its Medicaid program other groups or individuals in need of \u201cnecessary medical services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">A state whose medical assistance program extends beyond the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d has the option of providing the five services made mandatory as to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>in the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d class, or selecting any seven of the services listed in clauses (1) through (16) of \u00a7 1396d(a). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The five services made mandatory as to the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d (included in Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid program) are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">\u201c(1) inpatient hospital services (other than services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">\u201c(2) outpatient hospital services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201c(3) other laboratory and X-ray services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201c(4)(A) skilled nursing facility services (other than services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases) for individuals 21 years of age or older (B) effective July 1, 1969, such early and periodic screening and diagnosis of individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of 21 to ascertain their physical or mental defects, and such health care, treatment, and other measures to correct or ameliorate defects and chronic conditions discovered thereby, as may be provided in regulations of the Secretary; and (C) family planning services and supplies furnished (directly or under arrangements with others) to individuals of child-bearing age (including minors who can be considered to be sexually active) who are eligible under the State plan and who desire such services and supplies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201c(5) physicians\u2019 services furnished by a physician . . . whether furnished in the office, the patient\u2019s home, a hospital, or a skilled nursing facility, or elsewhere,\u201d \u00a7 1396d(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">A state is required to include in its Medicaid plan \u201creasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which . . . are consistent with the objectives of [Title XIX] . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). A state may properly limit the coverage of its Medicaid program to the costs of \u201cnecessary medical services.\u201d A state plan for medical assistance <em>must </em>provide that a method of \u201cutilization review\u201d be established for each item of care or services listed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a) so as \u201cto safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(30); 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 250.20(a).

Services made available to a group other than the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d must be equal in \u201camount, duration, and scope\u201d for all individuals within the group, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10), but may be less than or differ from those benefits provided the \u201ccategorically needy.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-20\">In summary outline, Title XIX provides for a federal-state funded program which permits each state to decide whether it will participate and what services it will provide, and to whom, subject to the requirement that certain welfare recipients must be included and certain items of basic medical care must be furnished.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-21\">The Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program (\u201cPMAP\u201d) was designed to comport with the requirements of Title XIX. It provides, <em>inter alia, </em>for reimbursement for medical services to the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d and the \u201cmedically needy,\u201d affording to the latter the five services made mandatory as to the \u201ccategorically needy,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> earlier here spelled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Regulations pertaining to the administration of PMAP provide for reimbursement of costs of an abortion <em>only </em>where \u201cthere is documented medical evidence,\u201d submitted by the attending physician and two other physicians, that \u201ccontinuance of the pregnancy may threaten the health or life of the mother,\u201d or, that \u201cthe infant may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency,\u201d or, that \u201ca continuance of pregnancy resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or incest, may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of a patient,\u201d and \u201cthe procedure is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The recited provisions of the Regulations, as the majority has well said, \u201cin effect . . . define a compensable \u2018therapeutic\u2019 abortion, and exclude payment for non-therapeutic, or \u2018elective\u2019 abortions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The plaintiff-welfare recipients contended below that the cited Regulations contravene Title XIX, because, in their view, <em>an abortion, </em>whether it be therapeutic or non-therapeutic, <em>is a \u201cnecessary medical service\u201d </em>within the meaning of the Title and the purview of its categories of \u201cphysicians\u2019 services\u201d; \u201cinpatient and outpatient hospital services\u201d, and \u201cfamily services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In disposing of these contentions, the court below said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\"><em>\u201cCongress was silent with respect to specific authorization of medical assistance for abortions. \u25a0 Pennsylvania standards must be scrutinized without curtailment by Congressional action and the State Regulations and/or Procedures must be given great latitude in providing for the administration of the Program. </em>We, therefore, feel compelled to find <em>Pennsylvania\u2019s Regulations do not conflict with Title XIX of the Social Security </em>Act.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">The foregoing holding was prefaced by this significant statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">\u201cBut, even if we assume, as do the Plaintiffs, that abortion payments are clearly authorized under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, nevertheless, Congress has given the States great latitude in establishing standards for the administration of the various plans, under the doctrine of a <em>\u2018scheme of cooperative federalism.\u2019 \u201d </em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">The distilled essence of the holding below is that Title XIX does not, <em>per se, </em>require a Medicaid state to pay for a non-therapeutic abortion, and accordingly the Pennsylvania Regulations denying payment for such an abortion does not conflict with Title XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">The distilled essence of the majority\u2019s holding is that Title XIX, <em>per se, requires </em>a Medicaid state to pay for a non-therapeutic abortion \u201conce the state has decided to finance full-term delivery and therapeutic abortion as methods for the treatment of pregnancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">The Achilles\u2019 heel of the majority\u2019s holding is its <em>non sequitur </em>application of recent Supreme Court decisions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in which no issue as to the sweep of Title XIX was involved, and the critical question presented related <em>only </em>to constitutional challenges to state statutes making performance of a non-therapeutic abortion a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-18\">The majority\u2019s application of these Supreme Court decisions is manifested by its following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-19\"><em>\u201cSince the decisions of the Supreme Court have forced the states to include elective abortion in the legal practice of medicine </em>through the second trimester of pregnancy, <em>we also hold that the statute [Title XIX] requires Pennsylvania to fund abortions through the end of the second trimester. \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-20\">It need only be. said on the score of the foregoing, that the 1973 Supreme</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Court decisions, which make legal a physician\u2019s performance of an elective abortion, cannot be utilized to construe the earlier enacted Title XIX <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> as <em>requiring </em>a Medicaid state to pay the expenses of such an abortion, albeit these decisions are applicable to the presented issue of constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Regulations' which has been avoided by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">As earlier noted, two other circuits which have spoken to the Title XIX issue have subscribed to the holding of the court below and expressly refused to subscribe to the view espoused by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In <em>Doe v. Rose, </em>499 F.2d 1112 (10th Cir. 1974), constitutional and statutory challenges were presented to the Utah Department of Social Services\u2019 \u201cinformal policy\u201d concerning abortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The \u201cinformal policy\u201d provided that a pregnant woman was not entitled to an abortion at the expense of Utah\u2019s Medicaid program without prior approval as a \u201ctherapeutic abortion\u201d by the Executive Director of the Department. The \u201cinformal policy\u201d defined a \u201ctherapeutic abortion\u201d as one necessary to save the life of the expectant mother or to prevent serious and permanent impairment to her physical health, and none other.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The district court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 request for an injunction restraining enforcement of the \u201cinformal policy\u201d on both statutory and constitutional grounds. The Tenth Circuit, on review, affirmed on the constitutional grounds only, declaring that it preferred to do so for these reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201cAt the outset, so far as we are advised the applicable federal statutes regarding Medicaid make no mention, as such, of abortions. Hence, we lack specific guidance as to whether Congress intended that abortions be covered by Medicaid and, if so, more critically, <em>which </em>abortions were to be covered by medicaid benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201cThe implementing state statutes of Utah, as well as the latter\u2019s state plan, submitted to and approved by the federal authorities, also make no mention, as such, of abortions. Hence, this is not an instance where the administrative policy under attack is mandated by either state or federal statute. By the same token, <em>in our view there is nothing in either the federal or state statutes which specifically bars the policy here followed by Rose. </em>In this regard, we are mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s preference for statutory, as opposed to constitutional, resolution of welfare controversies. See <em>Wyman v. Rothstein, </em>398 U.S. 275, 90 S.Ct. 1582, 26 L.Ed.2d 218 (1970). Nevertheless, in light of the applicable statutes\u2019 complete silence on the abortion question, we prefer to dispose of the present appeal on constitutional grounds, rather than by any strained effort to show that the policy in question is, in effect, though not in so many words, prohibited by either federal or state statute. . . \u201d 499 F.2d at 1114\u20141115. (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The Sixth Circuit, in <em>Roe v. Ferguson, </em>515 F.2d 279 (6th Cir. 1975), reversed the district court\u2019s holding that Title XIX was contravened by administrative rulings by the Auditor of the State of Ohio and an Ohio statute which prohibited reimbursement for elective abortions to state Medicaid recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">In doing so, the Court expressly declared its accord with <em>Doe v. Rose, supra, </em>and the holding of the court below in the instant case, on the Title XIX issue, in the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\"><em>\u201cWe are in accord with the decisions which have found no conflict between state restrictions of Medicaid payments to elective abortions and the provisions of the Social Security Act. There is no indication that Congress intended to require the furnishing of abortion services not required for the preservation of the health of the woman at a time when the performance of such abortions was illegal in most jurisdictions. </em>In view of the disfavor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>shown toward abortions in other legislation, we are reluctant to infer that Congress intended to include required coverage for such controversial services without even mentioning the subject. When Congress passed the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300a et seq. providing funds to states opting to participate in creating comprehensive programs of family planning services, abortion was specifically excluded as a means of family planning to be recognized under the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300a \u2014 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cIn establishing the Legal Services Corporation system, Congress again provided that no funds of the Corporation could be used for legal assistance for those seeking to procure a nontherapeutic abortion. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2996f(b)(8).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cIn view of this evidence of the Congressional attitude toward abortion as a family planning technique or as an acceptable medical service in general, it is difficult to construe the silence of Congress in Title XIX as an endorsement of the view that nontherapeutic abortions are included in the \u2018necessary medical services\u2019 required to be furnished by a state participating in Medicaid. This is not to say that Congress may constitutionally exclude such abortion services from coverage in the Medicaid program. <em>In the absence of a legislative history indicating a contrary position, however, we cannot say that the statute itself prohibits such an exclusion.\u201d </em>515 F.2d at 283 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">As earlier stated, the majority\u2019s holding is nourished <em>only </em>by a single district court <em>case</em>\u2014Roe <em>v. Norton, supra. </em>There, the narrow issue presented was whether Title XIX <em>prohibited </em>\u201cfederal reimbursement for the expenses of an [elective] abortion,\u201d and thus <em>compelled </em>a Medicaid state to deny reimbursement for such an abortion. The issue arose by reason of the adoption of a regulation by the Connecticut Welfare Department banning reimbursement for non-therapeutic abortions because of its belief that it was <em>compelled </em>to do so by Title XIX.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The district court ruled that \u201cTitle XIX must be construed to <em>permit </em>payment for elective abortions.\u201d In doing so, the district court further held that the Title \u201cmust be construed . . . to <em>prohibit </em>state regulations that impair a woman\u2019s exercise of her right, in consultation only with her physician, to have an [elective] abortion.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">It must immediately be noted that the stated further holding is dictum under the prevailing circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">Coming now to the majority\u2019s disregard of the views expressed by the Solicitor General of the United States, and the federal agency which administers the Medicaid program, on the score of the reach of Title XIX, in its holding that \u201cthe Pennsylvania Regulations are inconsistent with Title XIX\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">As already stated, the Solicitor General in his Amicus Curiae Memorandum<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> specifically opined that \u201cthe Social Security Act does <em>not </em>require a federally-funded state medicaid program to pay for abortions that are not medically indicated,\u201d and, the federal agency which administers the Medicaid program, in a statement on its \u201cposition\u201d on abortion,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>made it clear that a Medicaid state has the option of funding abortions, and if it does, \u201cthe federal Government shares the cost with the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">A more recent statement made by the Social and Rehabilitation Service, under which the Medical Services Administration operates, further reflects the Government\u2019s view that Title XIX does not <em>exclude </em>non-therapeutic abortions.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The statement declares in relevant part that \u201cunder Title XIX, federal financial participation is <em>available </em>for <em>any </em>abortions <em>for which </em>the state welfare agency provides.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The foregoing evidences the federal Government\u2019s view that Title XIX <em>neither prohibits, nor requires </em>a Medicaid state\u2019s payment for non-therapeutic abortions, and that such states are free to either provide or deny at their option medical assistance for such an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">It is undisputed that the Government has pursued a policy of sharing in a state\u2019s funding of non-therapeutic abortions, pursuant to its stated position.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The majority\u2019s disregard of the stated views of the federal agencies concerned with administration of Title XIX, contravenes the settled rule that construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration should be accorded great deference, absent compelling indications that it is clearly wrong.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">This, too, must be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">It cannot be gainsaid that Title XIX does not make any reference to abortions \u2014 therapeutic or elective \u2014 and that its legislative history is similarly silent on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">In recognition of that fact, the majority concededly reached its holding as to the force of Title XIX with respect to abortions \u2014 therapeutic and elective \u2014 by \u201cinterpreting\u201d Title XIX to support its conclusion. In doing so it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-16\">\u201cIt is <em>impossible to believe </em>that in enacting Title XIX <em>Congress intended </em>to freeze the medical services available to recipients as those which were legal in 1965.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-17\">The quoted statement clearly falls into the category of argument criticized as a \u201cdeparture from ordinary principles of statutory interpretation,\u201d in the recent case of <em>Bums v. Alcala, </em>420 U.S. 575, 95 S.Ct. 1180, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The same is true with respect to this further conclusory statement of the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cWe therefore conclude that <em>once </em>the state has decided to finance full-term delivery and therapeutic abortion as methods for treatment of pregnancy, it <em>cannot decline to finance non-therapeutic abortions without violating the requirements of Title XIX.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">It may be noted at this juncture that the stated construction of Title XIX is sharply at odds with that of the Solicitor General in his Amicus Curiae Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In spelling out his views as to \u201cthe extent of the \u2018medical assistance\u2019 which must be provided\u201d under Title XIX, the Solicitor General said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">\u201cFurthermore, a participating state <em>need not pay for every kind of medical treatment </em>encompassed within those five categories. The state is required only to set \u2018reasonable standards . for determining . . . the extent of medical assistance . . . <em>consistent with the objectives </em>of [Title XIX]\u2019 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(17),\u201d and, \u201c[w]e disagree\u201d with the contention \u201cthat the denial of assistance with respect to non-medically indicated abortions is not \u2018reasonable\u2019 under 42 UvS.C. 1396a(a)(17).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">I agree with the Solicitor General\u2019s rejection of the contention that the denial of assistance with respect to nonmedically indicated abortions is not reasonable under Title XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">The Title\u2019s use of the phrase \u201camount, duration and scope of services\u201d in its various provisions, indicates that \u201cCongress anticipated that states would limit the types of services they covered <em>\u201d </em><footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">In summary, I would for all the reasons stated in the foregoing discussion, affirm the holding of the court below that the <em>\u201cPennsylvania Regulations do not conflict with Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-18\">II. THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-19\">The court below held that the Pennsylvania Regulations \u201care unconstitutional because they are in violation of the Equal Protection Clause since they create an unlawful distinction between individual women who choose to carry their pregnancies to birth, and indigent women who choose to terminate their pregnancies by abortion.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-20\">It premised its holding on these grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-21\">\u201cUnder traditional Equal Protection standards, once the State chooses to pay for medical services rendered in connection with the pregnancies of some indigent women, it cannot refuse to pay for the medical services rendered in connection with the pregnan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>cies of other indigent women electing abortion, unless the disparate treatment supports a legitimate State interest,\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and, \u201cthe State\u2019s decision to limit coverage to \u2018medically indicated\u2019 abortions, as arbitrarily determined by it, is a limitation which promotes no valid State interest.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">I would reverse the unconstitutionality holding of the court below, albeit the Eighth and Tenth Circuits and four district courts <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> have held unconstitutional regulations and statutes similar to the Pennsylvania Regulations, and no court has held to the contrary.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">I agree with the dissenting view below that \u201cthere is no constitutional requirement that the State must finance exercise of a \u2018fundamental\u2019 right, nor does a classification which distinguishes between medically necessary and non-necessary abortions offend the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The sum of the holding of the court below is that since Pennsylvania\u2019s Medicaid program pays for medical services incident to full-term delivery, and/or therapeutic abortions, it violates the Equal Protection Clause when it denies payment for an elective abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The holding reflects the court\u2019s subscription to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that an elective abortion is one way of handling a pregnancy and accordingly such an abortion falls within the category of \u201cnecessary medical care\u201d extended by Pennsylvania to pregnant eligibles. It also reflects rejection of Pennsylvania\u2019s contentions that its Medicaid program provides only for extension of \u201cnecessary medical care,\u201d and its payment for a full-term delivery and/or therapeutic abortion properly fall within the range of reasonably-defined \u201cnecessary medical care\u201d for the condition of pregnancy, and that a non-therapeutic (elective) abortion does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">Discussion of the constitutional issue must be prefaced by these observations with respect to the present state of the law as indicated by Supreme Court decisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">A woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy during its first two trimesters. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">The Supreme Court did not hold in these cases that a state is under a duty to finance the exercise of the constitutional right to an elective abortion, nor has it ever held that <em>medical care in general </em>is a fundamental right, albeit it has recognized that \u201cmedical care is . \u2018a basic necessity of life\u2019 to an indigent . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">The Supreme Court has declined to designate welfare in general as a fundamental right,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> although it has recognized the critical importance of welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>as providing \u201cthe very means by which to live.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The cornerstone of the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that the Regulations, <em>in the absence of a compelling state interest, </em>violate the Equal Protection Clause in that they discriminatorily divide pregnant eligibles <em>into two classes </em>\u2014 one which chooses to carry pregnancy to full term delivery, and another which elects to terminate pregnancy for non-therapeutic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The fallacy of the stated contention is that it disregards the fact that Pennsylvania in its medicaid program has committed itself to extend medical care to its eligibles only where <em>\u201cnecessary medical care\u201d is required. </em>The only classification made by the Regulations is between necessary medical care and non-necessary medical care. Such a classification does not call into play the \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d test. It is subject only to the \u201creasonable basis\u201d, otherwise stated, \u201crational basis\u201d test, spelled out in <em>Dandridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). There, the Court held that a state regulation which reduced family welfare benefits did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In doing so it said in relevant part at page 485, 90 S.Ct. at page 1161:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cIn the area of economics and <em>social welfare, </em>a State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. <em>If the classification has some \u2018reasonable basis,\u2019 it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification </em>\u2018is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it <em>results </em>in <em>some inequality.\u2019 Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.Ct. 337, 55 L.Ed. 369], \u2018The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations \u2014 illogical, it may be, and unscientific.\u2019 <em>Metropolis Theatre Co. v. City of Chicago, </em>228 U.S. 61, 69-70 [33 S.Ct. 441, 57 L.Ed. 730].\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">I am of the opinion that the classification between \u201cnecessary medical care\u201d and \u201cnon-necessary medical care\u201d survives the application of the \u201creasonable basis\u201d and/or \u201crational basis\u201d tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">It cannot be gainsaid that full-term delivery and/or therapeutic abortions reasonably and rationally fall within the category of \u201cnecessary medical care\u201d for a pregnant woman, and that an \u201celective\u201d or non-therapeutic abortion does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">This, too, must be said:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">The holdings of unconstitutionality in the Eighth and Tenth Circuit cases, cited in note 26, rested in large part on the analysis of the three-judge district court in <em>Klein v. Nassau County Medical Center</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in holding that providing financial assistance to pregnant mothers who carry their babies to full term and delivery while denying financial assistance to mothers who choose instead an \u201celective\u201d abortion denied the latter mothers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That analysis, in only slightly different terms is also advanced before this court by the plaintiffs. The persuasiveness of the analysis depends upon a willingness to accept the posture of the mother as one in which she is required to \u201cresign her freedom of choice\u201d not to bear the fetus term.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">There is both a verbal and an emotional appeal about this argument. But the legal and economic fact as well is not precisely stated in it. The compulsion to \u201cresign her freedom of choice\u201d derives not from the state policy but from the mother\u2019s poverty. The equal protection clause as sought to be used here would require this court to determine that the state, having undertaken to relieve <em>some </em>of the burdens of poverty is required to remedy <em>a11 </em>of poverty\u2019s burdens. The state, with some support from the medical profession, in reaching a determination of what is medically necessary, and unquestionably with support based on the prevailing mores of the majority of our society, has decided to remedy that problem of poverty which is represented by the costs of medical care during pregnancy and the delivery of the baby. From society\u2019s point of view, there are a variety of arguments for the wisdom of such public expenditure, most based upon the desirability of preserving the life and well being of the expectant mother and of assuring healthy babies. The state, thus far, has not concluded that avoidance of unwanted babies is as important as avoidance of unhealthy babies. This may well be an improper determination of values. A court may regard the two objectives as of equal magnitude and conclude that the state is quite wrong. It would be an error, however, for courts to displace the value judgment of the legislature with the value judgment of the court absent a finding that the value judgment of the legislature is proscribed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">There are probably no programs of the state or federal government affording financial assistance that do not contain within them, sometimes unarticulated, norms of conduct that are prerequisite to receiving the assistance. Surely the unavailability of unemployment compensation to one who quits his or her job while affording it to one who has labored to retain it but has been laid off serves as an inducement to refrain from quitting. For the well-off person in our society, with some independent reserves, that inducement is irrelevant, and the individual is free to quit. For the low-income employee, that policy may well prevent the person from refusing to continue in employment that has become, perhaps, personally unbearable.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The examples could be multiplied. In their determinations of appropriate contexts of financial aid the federal and state legislatures have reflected societal prejudices about human conduct. These differentially affect the poor, who are dependent upon governmental assistance, and the more affluent, who are not. To require the states to forego this kind of policymaking would be to require the states to choose between leaving the pain of poverty unabated or to provide assistance neutral in its assertion of values. Not only would this seem to go well beyond present decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in interpreting the equal protection clause but it would, if embraced, likely place financial assistance to the poor in many contexts beyond what is politically feasible, thus leaving all the poor worse off than under the present value distinctions made.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Only in the areas in which the poor are faced with governmentally imposed financial burdens \u2014 divorce court fees, appeal transcript fees \u2014 has the Supreme Court found that legislatures are constitutionally bound to relieve the poor of the burdens of their poverty. The instant case might be such a case, for example, if the Pennsylvania legislature had established a minimum doctor\u2019s charge, or even more clearly, a state license fee for an elective abortion. But in the instant case, the burden carried by the indigent mother who desires, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>elective abortion has not been made greater by the state. It has simply not been eased, whereas the state has eased the burden of the costs of pregnancy for the mother who wishes to carry the fetus until term. That kind of distinction in affordance of financial assistance has not till now and should not be subject to judicial supervision under the aegis of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Equal Protection Clause does not provide cure-all panaceas, or Utopian solution, with respect to all the problems incident to the condition of poverty, e.g. inability of an indigent pregnant woman to privately finance her non-medically necessary (elective) abortion. Otherwise stated, the Equal Protection Clause cannot be construed to afford a guarantee against <em>all </em>the incidents of the condition of poverty.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">III. THE DISCRIMINATORY ADMINISTRATION OF THE REGULATIONS.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">As earlier stated, I would enjoin enforcement of the Regulations on the ground that they are being administered in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in that <em>they are not enforced </em>against indigents who threaten suit when they are denied funding of an elective abortion, and <em>they are enforced </em>against those who do not threaten suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">It has long been settled that State administrative procedures which are <em>per se </em>valid and constitutional may, nevertheless, be enjoined when they are unconstitutionally applied. <em>Yick Wo v. Hopkins, </em>118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). More recently, the Supreme Court has stressed that \u201ca law non-discriminatory on its face may be grossly discriminatory in its operation.\u201d <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 242, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 2023, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970); <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 17, n.11, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The Pennsylvania Department of Justice concedes<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> that \u201cit entered into a policy of consenting to the granting of the requested relief [funding of an elective abortion] on an individual basis when . . . litigation was threatened,\u201d and it cites in corroboration a Stipulation detailing its policy filed in another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">In making that concession, the Justice Department urges that \u201c[t]his was <em>not </em>a policy of the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare in any way modifying the uniform application of the Pennsylvania Medicaid Regulations. This was, and still is, merely a policy of the lawyers for the defendant In pending litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">The fact that Pennsylvania pays for an elective abortion when suit is threatened or pending establishes discriminatory administration of its Regulations. It <em>is utterly irrelevant </em>that payment for an elective abortion is made <em>at the instance of \u201cthe lawyers for the defendant\u201d </em>and <em>not by way \u201cof the policy of the Department of the Pennsylvania Department of Welfare.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">\u201cThe play\u2019s the thing.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">The sum total of the existing situation with respect to the Regulations is that they are enforced as to some pregnant indigents seeking elective abortions and denied as to others in the saifte category.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-17\"><em>Standing alone, and independently so, </em>the stated circumstances constitute violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">I would for this reason remand the cause to the court below with directions to enjoin enforcement of the Pennsylvania Regulations in light of their Administration in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">Judge Gibbons joins in this dissenting opinion except as to Part III.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-23\">. 376 F.Supp. 173, 186 (W.D.Pa.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-24\">. <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">.

Viewing the matter as \u201cone of statutory interpretation,\u201d the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>held that the term \u201cdependent children,\u201d as presently defined by the Social Security Act does not encompass \u201cunborn children,\u201d and therefore a state is not required by the Act to include unborn children as those eligible for AFDC benefits, but may do so, in which event federal matching funds would be available. (The Court remanded the case, however, for consideration of the constitutional issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">After reviewing the provisions of the Act governing AFDC eligibility, the Court stressed that its prior decisions in this area had not established \u201ca special rule of [statutory] construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 95 S.Ct. at 1185. Lower courts, in considering the same issue, were admonished for departing from the \u201cordinary principles of statutory interpretation\u201d as evidenced by their holdings that \u201cpersons who are <em>arguably </em>included in the federal eligibility standard <em>must be </em>deemed eligible unless the Act or its legislative history clearly exhibits an intent to exclude them from coverage, in effect creating a presumption of coverage when the statute is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 95 S.Ct. at 1184 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-23\">In the instant case, the majority likewise departs from the \u201cordinary principles of statutory interpretation\u201d by construing Title XIX as <em>requiring </em>payment for non-therapeutic abortions inasmuch as such abortions are \u201carguably\u201d a \u201cnecessary medical service\u201d reimbursable under the Medicaid Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b719-24\">.
