On the trial of the appeal, the plaintiff proved that the check sent up with the papers, and upon which the suit, was brought, was in the proper hand writing of Henry Y. Low, the defendant, and that the name Henry Y. Low, subscribed to the said check, was in the proper hand writing of the said Henry Y. Low,\u201d whereupon the said check was offered in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and objected to on the ground, that there was no assignment on said check, that it is not the check described in the plaintiffs state of demand, which objection was sustained by the Court; and no other evidence being offered by the plaintiff, the jury rendered a verdict for the defendant. The judgment on this verdict, together with the other proceedings, were removed into this court by certiorari.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-5\"><em>Nevius </em>for plaintiff in certiorari.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-6\"><em>Blauvelt </em>for defendant referred the court to 1 <em>Gamp. </em>175,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO2\">and insisted, that the assignment mentioned in the statement of demand must mean, an \u201c assignment \u201d in writing, and such an assignment not being proved by the plaintiff, the Court of Common Pleas properly overruled the check.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by Justice Drake.</p>\n<author id=\"b255-8\">Drake, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_h\">An action was commenced by the plaintiff, as <em>bearer </em>of a check, drawn by the defendant on the cashier of the Bank of New Brunswick, payable to one C. S. Hutchings, or bearer. The state of demand filed in the justices\u2019 court, in setting out the transfer, alleged that the said C. S. Hutchings, \u201c duly transferred, <em>assigned, </em>and delivered the said draft or order, to the said plaintiff, who thereby became,\u201d &amp;c. There was a trial and judgment in the court below, for the defendant, upon which an appeal was taken to the Inferior Court of Common Pleas of the county of Middlesex. On the trial of the appeal, the check, after being proved, was offered in evidence and objected to on the ground \u201c that there was no assignment on said check, and that it is not the check described in the plaintiff\u2019s state of demand.\u201d Upon comparing the instrument with the state of demand, no variance is apparent, unless it be in the allegation of <em>assignment, </em>and I presume that it was for a supposed defect in the proof of that allegation, that the evidence was overruled; and that the correctness of that decision is the point now intended to be submitted to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Without enquiring how far such an objection should prevail if the word <em>assigned </em>necessarily imported a <em>written </em>transfer, I am of opinion that the court below erred in their construction of that term. An assignment does not necessarily imply, or require writing. And when alleged of any subject, it should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>always be construed in connection with the law of transfer, applicable to that particular subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">A note payable to <em>bearer </em>is negociable by delivery, and this creates a property in the assignee, or <em>bearer </em>\u2014 Grant v. <em>Vaughn, </em>8 <em>Burr. </em>1524. That was an action by the bearer of a bill, payable to bearer, and not endorsed, yet Justice Yeates says, that \u201c whether the plaintiff can maintain this action, depends upon its being <em>assignable </em>or not.\u201d Chitty says, such a note is in legal operation <em>assignable </em>by endorsement, or by mere delivery. <em>Chitty on bills, </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u201c Assignment is the setting over or transferring the interest a man hath in any thing to another.\u201d <em>Jacob's Law Diet. </em>1 <em>Vol. </em>139. And see his title assigns, or assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u201c Assignees are in fact or in law.\u201d <em>Com. Dig. Assignment B. </em>\u2014executors, administrators, heirs, &amp;c. are assignees in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">A mortgage may be <em>assigned </em>by mere delivery, without writing. 1 <em>John. Rep. </em>580, 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The books are full of instances of this use of the term assigned. I am of opinion that in this case the allegation was sustained by the proof <em>offered; </em>and that therefore the judgment of the Common Pleas should be reversed, and the cause remitted to that court, that they may proceed therein according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\"><em>Approved in Allen v.
