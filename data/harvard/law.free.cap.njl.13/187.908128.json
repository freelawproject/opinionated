That the indenture was void, as it was proved by all the witnesses, that the pauper did not possess common understanding, and cited <em>Chitty on </em>Contracts, 29; 2 <em>Stra. </em>1104; 2 <em>Black. Com. </em>291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">3. That there was no evidence of a legal service in the township of Jefferson. The evidence upon the point was, that it was a year from the time the pauper was bound, until he finally left Seward\u2019s and went to Beman\u2019s. All the witnesses say, that duririg this year, he was continually running away, and that he never staid a week at a time. The statute requires that there should be a service of one full year, which must be taken to mean a continuous service of the whole year at one time, and not parts of a year extending throughout the term of a year.

Two of the children of Obadiah Seward, then living at home with their father, testified that they considered the time of his residence in Jefferson with their father, not to exceed a year, but a third witness believed it might be a, little more. If we take the whole time according to the largest of these estimates, it cannot amount to <em>service </em>for one full year,, as almost, if not quite, one half of it was spent by the apprentice in vagrancy, owing to his being deficient in common sense; in running away from home, and roving from place to place,, against the will of his master. Two of those witnesses testified,, \u201c that he was running away continually; they do not believe, he ever stayed at home a month at a time, and that he was absent a month at a time frequently.\u201d Benjamin Hayward, a third witness, testified to his belief, that the apprentice, who&gt; was his brother, never stayed one month at a time at one place in his life, but was in the habit of roving from place to place-The witnesses did not vary as to these facts; which must be taken as they presented them to the sessions, and as the sessions returned them to this court in the state of the ease. These facts, seem to afford a fair inference that nearly or perhaps quite half of that year was spent in absence from home while running away and roving abroad; but even if it amounted to a third or fourth part of it, the remainder could not be \u201c service with his master for one full year,\u201d as the statute requires. No man would pay for it as a year\u2019s service, nor could it be considered such in a suit for wages. There is a case in <em>Coxe\u2019s Rep. </em>289, where an indented servant, after staying three months with his master ran away and after nine months\u2019 absence returned again, but his master would not receive him, and the court held it not to be service for a full year, although he was under indenture the whole time. Subjection to indenture, without service under it, does not fulfil the words nor the design of the statute;, and running away is not service. Therefore I am of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that the order of removal and affirmance of the Sessions must be set aside and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Ewing, C.
