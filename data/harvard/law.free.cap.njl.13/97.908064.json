On this principle, because that court omit to proceed when they ought, we grant a mandamus to reinstate an appeal,, which has been unlawfully dismissed. But where they irregularly sustain an appeal and proceed to hear and determine the matter, the redress of the aggrieved is to be sought by certiorari, not by mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Motion overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Cited in <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Abrahams, </em>3 <em>Gr. </em>25.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
