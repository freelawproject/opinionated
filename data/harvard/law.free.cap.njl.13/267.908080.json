It appeared from the return of the justices to a rule of this court, that the order was drawn up by Edmund Sheppard, at his own house, in the presence of one of the overseers of the poor, but not in the presence of Ebenezer Westcott, and that the justices were not together when the order Avas signed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>H.
