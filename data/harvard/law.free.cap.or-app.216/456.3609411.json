J.</author>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">This case is before us for a third time. Defendant, who was convicted of felon in possession of a firearm (FIP), ORS 166.270, and murder, ORS 163.115, appeals, challenging his murder conviction and his sentences for both crimes. Specifically, defendant raises three distinct arguments: First, his retrial for murder, following the second appeal, in which the Supreme Court reversed defendant\u2019s original murder conviction, was barred as untimely under Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution. Second, the trial court\u2019s imposition of a more severe sentence for murder, following defendant\u2019s conviction on retrial, was erroneous under <em>State v. Turner, </em>247 Or 301, 429 P2d 565 (1967). Third, in resentencing defendant following his second trial, the trial court erred in refusing to consider defendant\u2019s challenge, based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), to the imposition of an upward departure sentence on defendant\u2019s FIP conviction. For the reasons that follow, we reject defendant\u2019s first two contentions but agree with the third. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The circumstances material to our review are, albeit somewhat complicated, undisputed. We recount them in some detail because the timing and relationship of various events over more than a decade are critical to our assessment of defendant\u2019s contentions, especially the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In May 1996, defendant was indicted on charges of FIP and murder. In February 1997, the trial court made a pretrial evidentiary ruling, excluding evidence of uncharged misconduct, and the state appealed pursuant to ORS 138.060. On appeal, we concluded that the trial court had erred in excluding some of the disputed evidence. <em>State v. Davis, </em>156 Or App 117, 967 P2d 485 (1998) <em>(Davis </em>2).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">After remand, in January 1999, defendant was tried and found guilty of both murder and FIP. The trial court imposed a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment with lifetime post-prison supervision on the murder conviction and, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>FIP conviction, imposed an upward dispositional and durational departure sentence of 36 months, to run consecutively to defendant\u2019s murder sentence. The court based the imposition of the upward departure on a variety of aggravating circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">\u201cNumber one, it resulted or was connected to the commission of a murder and the death of a human being; number two, it was and did cause greater violence; number three, it caused undue and extraordinary pain and suffering to the family of the victim; and number four, it caused extraordinary pain and undue suffering to the family of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Defendant did not, at that time, raise any objection to the upward departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Defendant appealed and challenged his murder conviction. He argued, particularly, that the trial court had erroneously excluded certain evidence offered in support of the theory of defense that the victim had not been murdered but, instead, had committed suicide. Defendant did not challenge his FIP conviction. We affirmed without opinion. <em>State v. Davis, </em>181 Or App 467, 46 P3d 229 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Supreme Court allowed review. In briefing to the Supreme Court, the state acknowledged that the excluded evidence that was the subject of defendant\u2019s appeal was, in fact, admissible, but contended that its erroneous exclusion was harmless. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed \u201cthe judgment of the circuit court\u201d based on the asserted evidentiary error and \u201cremanded to the circuit court for farther proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 35, 77 P3d 1111 (2003) <em>(Davis II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Following the remand directed in <em>Davis II, </em>defendant moved in July 2004 to dismiss the case pursuant to Article I, section 10.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant emphasized that approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>eight years had elapsed since the indictment and contended that the passage of more than five years between his first trial and the scheduled second trial on the murder charge was necessitated by the state\u2019s erroneous evidentiary objection in the first trial and its failure to timely acknowledge the trial court\u2019s error in sustaining that objection. The trial court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On retrial, in August 2004, defendant abandoned his original trial defense that the victim had committed suicide and, instead, testified that he had pointed the gun at the victim and it had gone off accidentally. The jury, rejecting that account, convicted defendant of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">At sentencing, defendant advanced the two arguments that underlie his second and third assignments of error on appeal. First, defendant argued that, under <em>Turner, </em>he could not receive a sentence on his murder conviction that was greater than the originally imposed 25-year sentence with lifetime post-prison supervision. Second, defendant contended that the trial court\u2019s original upward departure sentence on his FIP conviction \u2014 -a conviction and sentence that he had not challenged in <em>Davis II </em>\u2014 was erroneously predicated on judicial factfinding, in violation of the principles announced in <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The trial court rejected both arguments. First, invoking an exception to <em>Turner </em>recognized in <em>State v. Alvarez, </em>168 Or App 393, 7 P3d 616, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 244 (2000), the court concluded that <em>Turner </em>did not preclude the imposition of a more severe sentence for murder, because the sentence imposed following defendant\u2019s original trial was erroneous. Consequently, the trial court, pursuant to ORS 163.115(5)(a) and (b), sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with a 25-year minimum incarceration term. Second, the court held that it lacked the \u201cpower or authority\u201d to consider defendant\u2019s Blakely-based challenge to the FIP sentence, because defendant had failed to challenge that sentence in <em>Davis II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">On appeal, as noted, defendant argues that (1) his retrial for murder following the <em>Davis II </em>remand was barred as untimely under Article I, section 10; (2) <em>Turner </em>prohibited the imposition of a more severe sentence for murder following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>his conviction on remand; and (3) the trial court erred in determining that it lacked the \u201cpower or authority\u201d to address defendant\u2019s Blakely-based challenge to the FIP sentence in the context of resentencing following the <em>Davis II </em>remand. We address each assignment in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error requires little discussion. Defendant\u2019s position depends on the premise that, although there was no constitutionally impermissible delay between the issuance of the indictment (May 1996) and the original trial resulting in defendant\u2019s conviction (January 1999), the protections of Article I, section 10, were implicated by the time expended in resolving <em>defendant\u2019s </em>successful appeal from his first conviction, <em>i.e., </em>the time between January 1999 and the 2004 retrial. Defendant contends that the latter interval is material to a constitutional \u201cspeedy trial\u201d analysis, because the state ultimately acknowledged that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling that was the subject of defendant\u2019s appeal was erroneous \u2014 and, if the state had done so earlier, much of that \u201cdelay\u201d could have been avoided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Defendant\u2019s position fails because the Supreme Court and we have consistently construed the \u201cwithout delay\u201d provision of Article I, section 10, as pertaining to the time between indictment and a defendant\u2019s original trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Vasquez, </em>336 Or 598, 609-10, 88 P3d 271 (2004) (emphasizing that purpose of \u201cspeedy trial\u201d provisions is \u201cto prevent prolonged <em>pretrial </em>incarceration\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>State v. Harberts, </em>331 Or 72, 82, 11 P3d 641 (2000) (same). No reported Oregon decision has ever extended the protections of Article I, section 10, to the period between a defendant\u2019s original trial and the remand following a successful appeal. Indeed, if defendant were correct, then the ultimate extension of his logic would be that whenever a defendant successfully appealed and secured a remand for retrial \u2014 or, indeed, whenever a post-conviction petitioner succeeded in obtaining a new criminal trial \u2014 the time elapsed in those processes would be cognizable under Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>1, section 10, to preclude any continuation of the prosecution. We decline defendant\u2019s unprecedented invitation to go so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s imposition of a more onerous sentence for murder following his retrial <em>{viz., </em>a life sentence with a 25-year minimum prison sentence) than that imposed following the original sentence <em>{viz., </em>a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment with lifetime post-prison supervision) violated <em>Turner. </em>The parties do not dispute that defendant\u2019s present murder sentence is, in fact, harsher than that originally imposed. However, they do dispute whether the original sentence was erroneous. The trial court, in rejecting defendant\u2019s arguments, concluded that \u201ca series of cases basically allows the court to correct what was an erroneous judgment in 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The proper resolution of this matter requires an understanding of the iterations of the statute prescribing the sentence for murder, ORS 163.115, judicial constructions and applications of that statute as it evolved, and the nuanced interplay between those statutory iterations and judicial constructions <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>the timing of the original imposition of sentence (March 1999) and the ultimate imposition of sentence (November 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In 1989, the legislature enacted the state sentencing guidelines, which placed the crime of murder on the sentencing guidelines grid, with presumptive or departure sentences, expressed in terms of months of imprisonment, to be determined based on the offender\u2019s criminal history and the severity of the crime. However, at that time, ORS 163.115(3) required that a person convicted of murder receive an indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment, with the possibility of parole after 10 to 25 years. In <em>State v. Morgan, </em>316 Or 553, 856 P2d 612 (1993), the court held that the indeterminate life sentence for murder provided in the then-existing version of ORS 163.115(3)(a) had been impliedly repealed by the enactment of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In 1995, the legislature amended the same provision of ORS 163.115 that the <em>Morgan </em>court had held was repealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>by the legislature\u2019s 1989 enactment of the sentencing guidelines. Or Laws 1995, ch 421, \u00a7 3. The amended version, ORS 163.115(5) (1995), provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201c(a) A person convicted of murder, who was at least 15 years of age at the time of committing the murder, shall be punished by imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201c(b) When a defendant is convicted of murder under this section, the court shall order that the defendant shall be confined for a minimum of 25 years without possibility of parole [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In <em>State v. Francis, </em>154 Or App 486, 962 P2d 45, <em>rev den, </em>327 Or 554 (1998), we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that, under <em>Morgan, </em>he was entitled to be sentenced for murder pursuant to the sentencing guidelines. We concluded that the legislature, through its 1995 amendments to the statutory provision that the <em>Morgan </em>court had held to be repealed, had reenacted it, and that ORS 163.115, when read together with ORS 137.700, required \u201cthat a person convicted of murder shall be punished by an indeterminate term of life in prison, with a mandatory minimum of 25 years [.] \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. Thus, if <em>Francis </em>had been the \u201clast word\u201d as of defendant\u2019s sentencing in 1999, then-extant authority would have compelled the imposition of an indeterminate life sentence with a 25-year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>Francis </em>was not, however, the \u201clast word\u201d as of March 1999, when the trial court imposed its original sentence in this case. Rather, roughly a month before, we had decided State <em>v. McLain, </em>158 Or App 419, 974 P2d 727 (1999), whose significance is the focus of much of the parties\u2019present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In <em>McLain, </em>the defendant was convicted of murder, and the trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years. <em>Id. </em>at 421. On appeal, the defendant contended that the provision of ORS 163.115(5)(a) that required a sentence of life imprisonment was unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution. Specifically, the defendant argued that constitutional \u201cdisproportionality\u201d protections were offended because (1) a person convicted of aggravated murder could, in some circumstances, be released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>on parole after 25 years, but (2) a person convicted of the lesser offense of murder under ORS 163.115 effectively received a \u201ctrue life\u201d sentence because there were no statutory provisions for releasing such persons after they had completed the 25-year mandatory minimum portion of the sentence, as prescribed in ORS 163.115(5)(b) (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agreed, concluding that \u201cthe proper sentence [for murder] is the 25-year mandatory minimum sentence required by ORS 137.700 [(2)](a)(A) and ORS 163.115(5)(b), followed by post-prison supervision for life in accordance with OAR 213-005-0004.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Thereafter, the trial court in this case, consistently with our decision in <em>McLain </em>\u2014 and, indeed, relying explicitly on <em>McLain </em>\u2014 sentenced defendant to a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence followed by lifetime post-prison supervision. The state did not take issue in <em>Davis II </em>with that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In the wake of <em>McLain, </em>and after the imposition of the original sentence in this case, the 1999 legislature enacted amendments to ORS 163.115(5), now codified at ORS 163.115(5)(c) to (e), which granted the parole board authority to parole any person who had been convicted of murder and sentenced to \u201cimprisonment for life,\u201d regardless of the date of the underlying crime. Or Laws 1999, ch 782, \u00a7 2. Those amendments remedied the constitutional disproportionality defect identified in <em>McLain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Next, in <em>State v. Haynes, </em>168 Or App 565, 7 P3d 623, <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 283 (2000), we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that retroactive application of the 1999 amendments to ORS 163.115(5) would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the state and federal constitutions. There, the defendant had been convicted in 1997 of murder and sentenced to \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d with a mandatory minimum of 25 years, in accordance with ORS 163.115(5)(b). 168 Or App at 567. Thereafter, while the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, we decided <em>McLain. </em>The defendant contended that, given <em>McLain, </em>his sentence was invalid and that the subsequent amendments to ORS 163.115(5) could not, constitutionally, be retroactively applied to correct that invalidity. Following <em>Dobbert v. Florida, </em>432 US 282, 97 S Ct 2290, 53 L Ed 2d 344 (1977), and our prior case law adopting its test, we held that the 1999 legislation presented no <em>ex post facto </em>violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">\u201cIn this case, the statute in force at the time defendant committed the crime mandated an \u2018imprisonment for life\u2019 sentence on a conviction of murder. Under the current statute, defendant faces the possibility of parole upon completion of the minimum term. Plainly the statute is ameliorative, and its application to defendant presents no <em>ex post facto </em>violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Haynes, </em>168 Or App at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Thus, if \u2014 as in <em>Haynes </em>\u2014 defendant in this case had been sentenced before <em>McLain </em>to life imprisonment with a 25-year minimum and had appealed that sentence, and if we had decided that appeal after the effective date of the 1999 amendments, we would have sustained that sentence. Similarly, and consistently with <em>Haynes, </em>if the trial court in this case had imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with a 25-year minimum during the \u201cwindow\u201d period between our decision in <em>McLain </em>and the effective date of the 1999 amendments, and if we had decided defendant\u2019s appeal challenging that sentence after the effective date of the 1999 amendments, we would (again) have sustained that sentence, even though it was contrary to McLain,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, and most obviously, if defendant had been originally sentenced after the effective date of the 1999 amendments, the only sentence that the trial court could lawfully have imposed was that prescribed by ORS 163.115(5), <em>viz., </em>life imprisonment with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>25-year minimum. Indeed, ORS 163.115(5) prescribed the imposition of that sentence as of the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing following retrial in 2004 and continues to do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Nevertheless \u2014 at least as the parties frame the dispute \u2014 the question for purposes of <em>Turner\u2019s </em>applicability is whether a sentence consistent with <em>McLain </em>that was imposed during the <em>McLain </em>\u201cwindow\u201d (after we decided <em>McLain </em>and before the effective date of the 1999 amendment) was \u201cerroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we do not determine that question. Rather, we conclude that, given the prudential considerations that inform <em>Turner, </em>even assuming that the original 1999 murder sentence was not erroneous, the trial court did not err on remand in imposing the sentence prescribed by the existing version of ORS 163.115(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We turn to <em>Turner. </em>There, following his first trial, the defendant was convicted of assault with intent to rob, and the trial judge imposed a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Turner, </em>247 Or at 302. On his first appeal, the defendant successfully raised a constitutional challenge to his conviction. <em>Id. </em>On remand, following a retrial before a different judge, the defendant was again convicted, and the court imposed a sentence of seven years\u2019 imprisonment with credit ' for the two years that the defendant had served. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the sentence imposed following the defendant\u2019s successful appeal was harsher than the originally imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>On appeal from that disposition, the defendant contended that the trial court could not, on remand, \u201cconstitutionally impose a sentence\u201d exceeding that originally imposed. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court remanded for resentencing, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cAfter an appeal or post-conviction proceeding has resulted in the ordering of a retrial for errors other than an erroneous sentence * * * and the defendant has again been convicted, no harsher sentence can be given than that initially imposed. If the initial sentence was incarceration, the defendant subsequently cannot be sentenced to any longer term than the time still to be served upon his initial sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The foregoing quotation constitutes <em>Turner\u2019s </em>\u201crule.\u201d However, in understanding <em>Turner\u2019s </em>application here, the court\u2019s rationale underlying that result is equally important.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court began by considering a broad range of cases from various jurisdictions. The court first observed that the question of imposition of a harsher sentence after a successful appeal did not appear to present a double jeopardy or due process concern. <em>Id. </em>at 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The court then acknowledged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201c[a] numerical majority of the decisions from other jurisdictions supports the state\u2019s position in this case that upon resentencing the sentencing court can assess any sentence it believes appropriate within the maximum set by statute and the previous sentence is no limitation upon that authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 307. The court further noted, however, that some courts had advanced no supporting reason for such a conclusion; that other courts had based that conclusion on the ground that the original sentence was a \u201cnullity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 309; that still others had refused to \u201cundermin[e] the traditional role of the trial judge\u201d in imposing sentence by limiting the second judge\u2019s ability to rely on additional information that was unknown to the first sentencing judge, <em>id.; </em>and, finally, that some courts had reasoned that a defendant who chooses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>have a retrial \u201ctakes a chance after conviction on the trial judge\u2019s discretion in sentencing him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The Supreme Court rejected those rationales, concluding with respect to impairment of judicial discretion on resentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cSome of the courts have refused to limit the second sentencing court because the sentencing court traditionally is granted almost complete discretion, within the statutory limits, in determining the appropriate sentence. We. do subscribe to the principle that the trial court should be given wide latitude in fixing the sentencing; however, in this class of case one trial court has already exercised its discretion and best judgment and imposed a sentence. Under ordinary circumstances there is no reason to conclude that the public interest is better s\u00e9rved by the second sentence than the first.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 312-13. The court acknowledged that a bright-line rule precluding imposition of harsher sentences on resentencing would prevent a court from acting on new information warranting a more severe sentence. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court concurred in the assessment of the Advisory Committee on Sentencing and Review of the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice that \u201cit is preferable to establish a standard that is prophylactic in effect, and easily administered, whereby sentencing judges are not given power to increase a sentence when an applicant has exercised his right to seek a post-conviction remedy [or appeal].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">After reaching its substantive conclusion about what the law should be, the court in <em>Turner </em>then turned to the question \u201cof whether the rule proposed should be grounded upon the due process or double jeopardy provisions of the state or federal constitutions or whether it should be grounded upon the statutes or the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The court concluded that its preclusive approach was ultimately derived from the statute authorizing criminal appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201c[W]hen the state grants a criminal appeal as a matter of right to one convicted of a crime, as it has, our procedural policy should be not to limit that right by requiring the defendant to risk a more severe sentence in order to exercise that right of appeal. ORS 138.020.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The foregoing conclusion was not based on any construction of the language of ORS 138.020 or the legislative history of that provision. <em>Cf. PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). Instead, it was driven by prudential/policy <em>considerations </em>\u2014 e.g., mitigating potential \u201cchilling effects\u201d pertaining to the statute\u2019s practical availability and operation. <em>See Turner, </em>247 Or at 315 (quoting with approval <em>State v. Wolf, </em>46 NJ 301, 308-09, 216 A2d 586 (1966)) (\u201cOur decision finds its base in procedural policies which are of the essence of the administration of criminal justice. * * * Consequently, we hold that since the State has granted the universal right of appeal, standards [of] procedural fairness forbid limiting the right by requiring the defendant to barter with his life for the opportunity of exercising it.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, the principle announced in <em>Turner </em>is, at least by its own terms, ultimately \u201cstatutory\u201d and not constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Given the foregoing understanding, we conclude that, in this case, the court\u2019s imposition following retrial of the sentence prescribed by the then-existing version of ORS 163.115(5)(a) and (b) did not violate <em>Turner </em>for three related reasons. <em>First, Turner </em>arose in a context of broad sentencing discretion, long antedating the sentencing guidelines, mandatory minimum sentences under ORS 137.700, and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely, </em>and their mutating progeny. Because of that discretion, a defendant convicted of even a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>crime was subject to a range of judicially imposed lawful punishment. That range of judicial discretion, in turn, presented at least a hypothetical prospect of retaliation for a successful appeal. <em>See, e.g., Turner, </em>247 Or at 313 (\u201c[I]t seems quite obvious that the possibility of a more severe sentence in the event of a successful appeal or post-conviction proceeding and a subsequent new trial and conviction would \u2018chill\u2019 a defendant\u2019s desire to correct an erroneously conducted initial trial.\u201d). <em>Turner </em>was calculated to remedy that ambient \u201cchilling effect\u201d in an environment of pervasive judicial sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Here, in contrast, neither the court that originally sentenced defendant in 1999 nor the one that sentenced him in 2004 was in a position to exercise any judicial discretion in determining his sentence for murder. The legislature dictated the proper sentences. In 1999, in accordance with our interpretation of the relevant statutes and constitutional provisions in <em>McLain, </em>the trial court imposed a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence followed by lifetime post-prison supervision. No judicial discretion was implicated. In 2004, in light of the retroactive statutory fix to ORS 163.115(5), the court was required to, and did, impose a sentence of imprisonment for life, with \u201ca minimum of 25 years without possibility of parole.\u201d Again, no judicial discretion was exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In sum, the difference in the sentences imposed here was not, as in <em>Turner, </em>the product of a choice among various lawful sentencing options. Rather, that difference was the product of a legislatively mandated, nondiscretionary change in the prescribed sentence, which did not violate <em>ex post facto </em>protections.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\"><em>Second, </em>in 2004, Oregon statutes permitted a trial court to impose only one sentence for <em>murder </em>\u2014 viz., a life sentence with a 25-year minimum, as prescribed in ORS 163.115(5). Thus, if the trial court, on remand in this case, had imposed a different sentence, it would have violated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>statutory mandate. Nothing in any case applying <em>Turner </em>purports to compel a trial court not to impose a legislatively mandated sentence, as opposed to a sentence permitted within a range of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><em>Third, </em>as emphasized, the <em>Turner </em>doctrine purports to be grounded in statute. Thus, to the extent that there is any conflict between imposing the sentence prescribed under ORS 163.115(5)(b) and <em>Turner\u2019s </em>\u201cgloss\u201d on ORS 138.020, one must give way \u2014 by way of \u201crepeal by implication\u201d or otherwise \u2014 unless the two can somehow be \u201charmonized.\u201d Given our assessment of the considerations upon which <em>Turner </em>was predicated, we believe that the two can be harmonized, so that <em>Turner </em>does not purport to preclude a court, on resentencing, from imposing (again, consistently with constitutional <em>ex post facto </em>constraints) the only statutorily permitted sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">If, however, <em>Turner\u2019s </em>statutory \u201cgloss\u201d must be deemed to be in irreconcilable conflict with the application of ORS 163.115(5)(a) and (b) in this case, the latter must control. The legislature, obviously, is free to enact or amend statutes at will, within constitutional boundaries. When two statutes are in conflict, \u201cthe later will prevail.\u201d <em>State v. Lawler, </em>144 Or App 456, 463, 927 P2d 99 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>326 Or 390 (1998) (citing cases). Given the legislature\u2019s clearly expressed intent regarding the sentence that defendant should receive for murder, and given that imposition of such a sentence would not be unconstitutional, <em>see Haynes, </em>168 Or App at 565, the trial court properly imposed the legislatively mandated sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We turn, finally, to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, regarding the trial court\u2019s determination after remand that it \u201chad no power or authority\u201d to act on defendant\u2019s <em>Blakely-based </em>challenge to the upward departure sentence previously imposed on defendant\u2019s conviction for FIP. As noted, defendant did not raise any challenge to the upward departure sentence (or the underlying conviction) when it was imposed in 1999 or in the ensuing appeal in <em>Davis II. </em>Defendant argues, however, that, because the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Davis II </em>had reversed the original judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>trial court reacquired jurisdiction over the entire case, including with respect to sentencing on the affirmed conviction. The state counters that the sentence on the FIP conviction was \u201cbeyond the scope\u201d of the remand in <em>Davis II </em>and further that, even if the trial court had authority to resentence on that conviction, it was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The question before us, specifically, is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition in <em>Davis II </em>functioned effectively as an affirmance of the sentence originally imposed on the FIP conviction, precluding any review or modification of that sentence on remand. The state suggests that, because the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition did not invoke or track any of the then-extant statutory language of ORS 138.222(5) (2003), <em>amended by </em>Oregon Laws 2005, chapter 563, section 1, the court\u2019s disposition merely reversed defendant\u2019s murder conviction, leaving the FIP conviction and sentence intact. ORS 138.222(5) (2003) provided, as pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u201cIf the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand <em>the entire case </em>for resentencing. The sentencing court may impose a new sentence for any conviction in the remanded case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">(Emphasis added.) In a related sense, the state emphasizes that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Davis II </em>did not mention defendant\u2019s conviction for FIP; rather, it referred only to the murder conviction, and its holding pertained only to the murder conviction. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">\u201cThe error could have affected the jury\u2019s determination whether there was reasonable doubt that defendant murdered the victim, as the state claimed. Because we cannot conclude, in the terms of Article VII (Amended), section 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that the judgment \u2018was such as should have been rendered in this case,\u2019 we must reverse and remand for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">\u201cThe decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The <em>judgment </em>of the circuit court is reversed, and the <em>case </em>is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Davis II, </em>336 Or at 34-35 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In criminal cases, appellate courts have authority to \u201creverse, affirm or modify the judgment\u201d that has been appealed from. ORS 138.240. Moreover, ORS 138.222(5) (2003) indicated a legislative intent that, when an appellate court discerns certain errors in a case, the \u201centire case\u201d should be remanded so that any conviction in the case may be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In <em>State v. Rodvelt, </em>187 Or App 128, 66 P3d 577, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 17 (2003), we interpreted that language from ORS 138.222(5) (2003) to require a remand for resentencing on all convictions in a case when a reversible error affects any of the convictions in a case, because the reversal of one conviction can affect how the remaining convictions were, or should be, sentenced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cGiven the way that sentences are calculated under the felony sentencing guidelines, we conclude that, when some but not all convictions in a case are reversed, there necessarily has been an \u2018error in imposing a sentence in the case,\u2019 and such an error \u2018requires resentencing.\u2019 That is so because felony sentencing under the guidelines is complex, and the way that one conviction is sentenced affects how the remaining convictions are classified on the sentencing guidelines grid for purposes of determining what sentences may be imposed on those convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 132. Thus, in <em>Rodvelt, </em>although only certain convictions were reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment merging those convictions while other convictions were affirmed, the entire case was remanded for resentencing. <em>See also State v. Sanders, </em>189 Or App 107, 112, 74 P3d 1105 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 657 (2004) (\u201c[W]hen one conviction in a multiple-conviction case is reversed * * * ORS 138.222(5) * * * requires remand of the entire case.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Thus, under this court\u2019s case law, if we had been confronted with the type of error at issue in <em>Davis II, </em>we would have reversed and remanded the murder conviction and remanded the entire case for resentencing. The question is whether the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition in <em>Davis II </em>had that effect \u2014 or whether, as the state asserts, it operated, more restrictively, as an affirmance of the FIP sentence (as well as the underlying conviction) and a reversal of only the conviction and sentence on the murder count. Although it is true that the Supreme Court has never addressed our construction of ORS 138.222(5) (2003) in <em>Rodvelt </em>or related cases\u2014 and, presumably, given the 2005 amendment to the statute, never will \u2014 we understand the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s remand in <em>Davis II </em>to conform to the same construction. We note, particularly, that the Supreme Court in <em>Davis II </em>stated that the \u201cjudgment\u201d was \u201creversed\u201d (not affirmed in part or modified) and that the \u201ccase\u201d was \u201cremanded\u201d to the circuit court. Further, as noted, <em>see </em>216 Or App at 459, the reasons that the trial court gave for imposing the upward departure sentence on the FIP conviction were inextricably interrelated with the circumstances of the murder conviction, which the Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">In sum, contrary to its understanding, the trial court did, and does, have the \u201cauthority\u201d to entertain defendant\u2019s Blakely-based challenge to the imposition of the upward departure sentence on the FIP conviction. We leave for the trial court to address, in the first instance, various responses proffered by the state, including that defendant waived his present challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Convictions affirmed; remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\"> Article I, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">\u201cNo court shall be secret, but <em>justice shall be administered, </em>openly and without purchase, completely and <em>without delay, </em>and every man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> As noted, the state never conceded that the acknowledged evidentiary error compelled reversal in <em>Davis II; </em>rather, the state contended that the exclusion of the disputed evidence, albeit erroneous, was harmless. <em>See </em>216 Or App at 459.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> We summarized our understanding of the defendant\u2019s argument and the practical operation of the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\u201cThus, under current law, the Board [of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision] has authority to parole offenders who are serving indeterminate sentences for pre-1989 crimes and to parole aggravated murderers; the Board lacks authority to parole any other offenders, such as murderers sentenced under ORS 163.115(5)(a) to \u2018imprisonment for life.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">\u201cDefendant is correct that his sentence of imprisonment for life under ORS 163.115(5)(a) is, in effect, a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, because nobody has the authority to parole him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-12\"><em>McLain, </em>158 Or App at 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> That putative disposition is premised on the assumption that <em>Haynes </em>was correctly decided. Defendant, in passing, invites us to revisit <em>Haynes, </em>but we decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b504-6\"> The parties\u2019 contending positions can be broadly summarized as follows: Defendant contends that, after <em>McLain </em>and before the effective date of the 1999 amendments, the only lawful sentence that could be imposed was the sentence prescribed by <em>McLain, i.e., </em>the sentence that the trial court originally imposed here. Thus, defendant contends that, to the extent that <em>Turner </em>does not preclude the imposition of a harsher sentence following retrial when the originally imposed sentence was \u201cerroneous,\u201d <em>Turner, </em>247 Or at 313, that condition was not satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Conversely, the state contends that if (as in the second hypothetical scenario set out above), the trial court had originally imposed the sentence that was ultimately imposed here \u2014 a life sentence with a 25-year minimum \u2014 that sentence would have been sustained on appeal under Haynes\u2019s analysis. Given that putative result, the state posits that the ultimate imposition of sentence here did not violate <em>Turner. </em>However, the state does not explain how or why the enactment of the 1999 amendments to ORS 163.115(5) would render the sentence originally imposed <em>here </em>\u2014 i.e., a sentence imposed in accordance with <em>McLain </em>before the effective date of those amendments \u2014 \u201cerroneous\u201d for <em>Turner </em>purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> The court had not yet explicitly stated that the Oregon Constitution does not contain a \u201cdue process\u201d clause. <em>See State v.
