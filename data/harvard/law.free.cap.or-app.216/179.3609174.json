ORS 813.010. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s order permanently revoking his driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235(l)(b), which requires a court to order the permanent revocation of a person\u2019s driving privileges upon the person\u2019s third or subsequent conviction for misdemeanor DUII.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that, because his first two DUII convictions occurred before the effective date of ORS 809.235(l)(b), revoking his driving privileges on the basis of those convictions violates the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of the Oregon and United States constitutions. Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 21; US Const, Art I, \u00a7 10. We held in <em>State v. Vazquez-Escobar, </em>211 Or App 115, 153 P3d 168 (2007), that permanent revocation of driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235(l)(b) based on misdemeanor DUII offenses that predate the enactment of the statute does not violate the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of either constitution. Hence, defendant\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s revocation order is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> At the time of defendant\u2019s conviction, ORS 809.235(l)(b) required permanent revocation for a third misdemeanor DUII conviction. The legislature subsequently amended the provision to require permanent revocation for a third or subsequent conviction. That change has no bearing on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
