J.</author>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">This appeal arises from two cases, Tillamook County Circuit Court Nos. 031183 and 031199, which were consolidated for trial before a jury. With respect to Case No. 031183, defendant challenges his convictions and sentences on three counts of attempted first-degree assault, ORS 161.405; ORS 163.185, and one count of felony attempt to elude a police officer, ORS 811.540. Defendant contends, principally, that (1) the trial court erred in precluding testimony from an expert witness that the actions of police officers, in attempting to apprehend defendant, had not comported with proper police practice, including with respect to the use of deadly physical force and (2) the court erred in determining that, for purposes of calculating defendant\u2019s criminal history score under the sentencing guidelines, one of defendant\u2019s attempted assault convictions did not arise from the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d as the other two. As described below, we reject defendant\u2019s first contention, as well as his other assignments of error pertaining to his convictions, but agree with his second contention. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions but reverse and remand for resentencing in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">With respect to Case No. 031199, defendant challenges the imposition of an upward departure sentence on his conviction for second-degree burglary, ORS 164.215. In that case, the jury convicted defendant of second-degree burglary and unauthorized use of a vehicle, ORS 164.138, based on conduct that occurred on August 9, 2003. The trial court subsequently imposed an upward departure sentence on the burglary conviction based on \u201cpersistent involvement in similar offenses.\u201d As amplified below, we agree that the court erred in imposing that sentence, <em>see State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d, to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), and, consequently, we reverse and remand for resentencing in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The circumstances material to our review are undisputed, except as specifically noted below. In Case No. 031183, defendant\u2019s convictions arose from a series of events that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>occurred on August 19, 2003. At that time, defendant was staying with his ex-wife, Mitsi Norman, in Tillamook, helping her move into a new house. That afternoon, Norman\u2019s next-door neighbor, Lindsey Mays, telephoned her at work to tell her that he believed that defendant had broken into his house. Norman came home from work and found defendant in her home. Defendant was extremely anxious because a police officer had arrived outside of Mays\u2019s house, and he was worried that the officer suspected that he was the burglar. Norman, knowing that the police likely did suspect defendant, suggested to defendant that he leave through a bedroom window at the rear of the house. Norman then went outside and told the officer \u2014 Tillamook County Sheriffs Sergeant Jonathan Zimmerman \u2014 that defendant had just left her house. Tillamook City Police Officers Kurtis Wagner and Jana McCandless arrived to assist in the investigation, and the three officers began searching for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">As the officers conducted their search, a man told them that he had seen a suspicious person matching defendant\u2019s description changing the tire on a truck on a nearby gravel road. Zimmerman, Wagner, and McCandless drove to the gravel road, left their cars, and walked up the road to investigate, with Zimmerman and Wagner in the lead and McCandless trailing behind at some distance to \u201cwatch the back.\u201d After walking up the gravel road \u201cfor a little bit,\u201d the officers heard a truck start up.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">What happened next is a matter of sharp dispute between the state and defendant. Although the three officers\u2019 accounts varied in their details, they agreed on the substance of the following scenario: As the truck came around the corner into view, about 20 feet in front of the officers, Zimmerman and Wagner raised their hands and shouted for the driver to stop. Zimmerman could see that it was defendant who was driving the truck \u2014 and, once defendant made eye contact with the officers, he began to accelerate towards them, \u201crevving\u201d the engine higher. Believing that defendant intended to run over them, Zimmerman and Wagner moved to avoid being hit. Each officer drew his weapon, and Zimmerman fired three or four rounds at the truck as it came at and passed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The truck then continued a few yards down the gravel road towards McCandless, who, having heard the first shots, had unholstered her weapon. When McCandless determined that the truck was not going to stop, and would hit her if she did not move, she moved into blackberry brambles at the side of the road and fired several shots at the truck. The truck continued down the road, with the three officers running after it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Meanwhile, a fourth officer, Tillamook County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Mark Hannigan, was also involved in searching for defendant and began driving up the gravel road. As he did so, Hannigan saw defendant\u2019s truck coming at him from the opposite direction, about 75 yards away. At the same time, Hannigan could see the three officers running down the road behind the truck, and he heard one of them on the radio stating that the driver of the truck was the suspect. Hannigan believed that the truck was not going to stop and was \u201cgoing to run over the top\u201d of him, so he put his patrol car into reverse. At one point, defendant\u2019s truck and Hannigan\u2019s patrol car were \u201cbumper-to-bumper\u201d for about 15 to 20 feet, but Hannigan\u2019s car spun into a ditch, and defendant continued down the road. A high speed chase ensued, with defendant ultimately being apprehended the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Defendant\u2019s account was very different. According to defendant, as he was driving down the gravel road at between five and ten miles per hour, he saw a police officer standing by the side of the road, pointing a gun at him. Defendant never saw that officer \u2014 or any officer \u2014 signal for him to stop. Instead, the officer just shot at him. At that point, according to defendant, he \u201cfreak[ed] out\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m like I didn\u2019t know what I did wrong, man\u201d \u2014 and, \u201clayfing] over in the seat,\u201d accelerated with the officers shooting after him. When defendant finally \u201crais[ed] up,\u201d he saw a police car (Hannigan\u2019s) \u201cbacked up\u201d \u201cparked sideways on the road but not in the road\u201d; defendant did not slow down but, instead, \u201cwent around him\u201d and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Defendant denied attempting to run over the officers or driving \u201cbumper-to-bumper\u201d with Hannigan. At trial, as described below, defendant presented the testimony of a forensics expert, Verne Hoyer, who reconstructed what had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>occurred based on his investigation and analysis of bullet trajectory patterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Defendant was charged with, <em>inter </em>alia, attempted first-degree assault against each of the four officers and felony attempt to elude. Defendant was convicted, by a non-unanimous verdict, of attempted first-degree assault against Zimmerman, McCandless, and Hannigan, but was acquitted with respect to the same charge involving Wagner. The jury also convicted defendant of felony attempt to elude. The court, in imposing sentence on the conviction for attempted first-degree assault involving Hannigan (Count 9), determined that that offense was not part of the same criminal episode as the attempted assaults against Zimmerman and McCandless (Counts 6 and 7); consequently, the court used the convictions on those two counts to \u201creconstitute\u201d and enhance defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 9 from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cB.\u201d The court further imposed upward departure sentences, based on judicial findings of aggravated factors, on each of the convictions for attempted assault and felony attempt to elude.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to (1) the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling pertaining to the admissibility of certain aspects of the testimony of defendant\u2019s expert, Hoyer; (2) the trial court\u2019s refusal to give defendant\u2019s proffered \u201cjury unanimity\u2019 instruction; (3) the court\u2019s subsequent entry of judgments of conviction based on nonunanimous verdicts; (4) the court\u2019s calculation of defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 9, based on its determination that the attempted assault against Hannigan did not arise from the same criminal episode as the attempted assaults against Zimmerman and McCandless; and (5) the court\u2019s imposition of upward departure sentences based on judicial findings in both Case Nos. 031183 and 031199. For the reasons that follow, we reject defendant\u2019s first three assignments of error but agree with both the fourth assignment of error and with the fifth assignment of error with respect to the imposition of the departure sentence in Case No. 031199.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Before addressing the particulars of the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling pertaining to the admissibility of some aspects of Hoyer\u2019s testimony, it is useful to put that matter into context. Defendant\u2019s theory of defense against the attempted assault and attempt to elude charges was that he had not attempted to run the officers down but, instead, had panicked after the officers fired at him. Central to that defense was the premise that the officers had lied about the events that took place on the gravel road \u2014 and had done so in order to cover up their use of firearms in violation of departmental policies governing use of \u201cdeadly physical force.\u201d That is, defendant contended, the officers fabricated a self-defense justification to avoid being disciplined for violating official policies that regulate police use of deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">As support for that theory of defense, defendant sought to introduce expert testimony from Hoyer. In particular, Hoyer would (1) describe his conclusions, based on analysis of bullet trajectories, the officers\u2019 locations, and the speed of defendant\u2019s vehicle, as to what had occurred on the gravel road \u2014 and, particularly, testify that the officers had fired at defendant from the side of the road as he approached, passed, and was then past them; and (2) render his opinion that certain conduct by the officers in their efforts to apprehend defendant did not comport with competent police practice, including with respect to the use of deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The substance of Hoyer\u2019s putative testimony was set out in two letter reports that he had submitted to defense counsel. Neither of those reports referred specifically to written policies, including \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d policies applying to Tillamook County or Tillamook City law enforcement personnel, much less expressed an opinion that any or all of the officers had, in fact, violated those particular policies. Rather, Hoyer rendered the opinion that Zimmerman, in particular, had deviated from sound police practices in several respects, including failing to secure the perimeter adequately, failing to maintain adequate communication with other officers, and employing deadly physical force without first exhausting other, less extreme measures and doing so in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>circumstances not warranting the use of such force. In that regard, Hoyer concluded that police conduct at the scene was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d \u201cdemonstrated poor judgment,\u201d needlessly resulted in a dangerous high speed chase, and could have resulted in a wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The state filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Hoyer\u2019s anticipated testimony in its entirety because that testimony, by focusing on the officers\u2019 conduct, as opposed to defendant\u2019s, represented an effort to \u201cshift the blame\u201d to the officers and, thus, \u201cconstitutes an attempt to create a special classification of victim covering law enforcement officers.\u201d The state also sought to exclude any reference to departmental policies governing the use of deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In the colloquy on that motion, the court addressed various aspects of Hoyer\u2019s putative testimony, as expressed in his written reports to defense counsel. The court determined that the results of Hoyer\u2019s investigation as to how many shots had been fired, where the officers had been standing \u201cgenerally,\u201d and where the officers\u2019 shots struck defendant\u2019s truck would be admissible. The court further ruled that Hoyer\u2019s conclusions regarding time, distance, speed, and road condition were also admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The trial court then addressed the portions of Hoyer\u2019s putative testimony pertaining to whether the officers\u2019 actions comported with sound police practice and procedure. The court concluded that Hoyer\u2019s testimony in that regard was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s culpability. In so ruling, the court went to great lengths, in a series of extensive colloquies with counsel, to emphasize that it was not precluding defendant from (1) presenting evidence through Hoyer that the \u201con the ground\u201d facts comported with defendant\u2019s account rather than the officers\u2019; (2) establishing, through cross-examination of the officers, the existence of the \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d policies and the officers\u2019 familiarity with those policies and possible sanctions for their violation; and (3) if (1) and (2) were shown, arguing to the jury that the combination of those factors established a motive to fabricate, implicating bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>During trial, following a clarifying offer of proof, defendant did present Hoyer\u2019s incident reconstruction testimony to the jury. Hoyer rendered the opinion that, given physical and temporal constraints, Zimmerman\u2019s account was not \u201chumanly possible\u201d and, for the same reasons, defendant would not have had time to have formed the intent to run over the officers and to have acted on any such intent. Neither during the offer of proof that preceded that testimony, nor at any other time, did defendant adduce testimony from Hoyer that the officers\u2019 conduct did, in fact, violate their departmental policies governing use of deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In addition, through cross-examination of Zimmerman, Wagner, and McCandless, defendant established that those officers\u2019 departments had published \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d policies, that they were aware of those policies, and that they were aware that violation of those policies could result in termination. Defense counsel chose, for self-described \u201ctactical reasons,\u201d not to offer the policies themselves into evidence but, instead, inquired of the officers regarding their content.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In closing argument, defense counsel referred to the officers\u2019 possible motive to fabricate to avoid the \u201cvery serious repercussions\u201d of violating the \u201cstrict\u201d policies limiting the use of deadly physical force. The jury, as noted, convicted defendant of three of the four attempted first-degree assault charges, as well as felony attempt to elude.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Against that backdrop, we return to the particulars of the first assignment of error. Defendant frames that assignment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cDefendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s order granting the state\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>thereby precluding defendant from presenting expert testimony to assist the jury in determining whether the police officers violated policies and thus were subject to discipline, when they fired at defendant in his moving vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">There are at least two threshold defects with that assignment of error. First, to the extent that defendant suggests that the court\u2019s ruling precluded Hoyer from testifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>that some or all of the officers had violated \u201cpolicies\u201d \u2014 as opposed to testifying that their conduct evinced poor judgment and did not comport with competent practice\u2014 the court did not so rule. That is unsurprising because nothing in Hoyer\u2019s letter reports, which framed the discussion of the <em>in limine </em>ruling, referred to specific policies, including, particularly, the Tillamook County and city departmental policies regarding use of \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d that were the predicate for defendant\u2019s \u201cfabrication\u201d attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Second, in a related sense, at no point did defendant ever adduce from Hoyer, by way of an offer of proof, what his opinion, if any, would have been regarding actual violation of the pertinent policies governing use of deadly physical force. Accordingly, the matter is not preserved. OEC 103(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Beyond those deficiencies, to the extent that defendant is now suggesting that the trial court\u2019s ruling precluded defendant from presenting testimony, by Hoyer, that the officers\u2019 physical conduct did not, in the totality of circumstances, justify the use of deadly physical force, defendant is wrong. As described above, Hoyer testified that his assessment of the physical evidence flatly contradicted the officers\u2019 accounts. That testimony, in combination with that adduced through cross-examination of the officers regarding their awareness of their departmental policies and potential sanctions for their violation, permitted the jury to infer, if it so chose, that the officers had a motive to fabricate. Indeed, defense counsel so contended in closing argument. Accordingly, we reject the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error pertain to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give defendant\u2019s proffered \u201cjury unanimity\u201d instruction and the court\u2019s subsequent entry of judgment on some counts based on nonunanimous verdicts. Those assignments of error are unpreserved. Defendant\u2019s contention that the constitutional measure by which the \u201cjury unanimity\u201d language was added in 1934 to Article I, section 11,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Oregon Constitution does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>comport with the \u201cseparate vote\u201d provision of Article XVII, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not satisfy the requisites for error apparent on the face of the record, ORAP 5.45, in that it presents a matter that is \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Further, to the extent that defendant now invokes <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), as overruling <em>Apodaca v. Oregon, </em>406 US 404, 92 S Ct 1628, 32 L Ed 2d 184 (1972), <em>sub silentio, </em>we have previously rejected that contention in the context of a preserved assignment of error. <em>State v. Bowen, </em>215 Or App 199, 168 P3d 1208 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"> We proceed to defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, which challenges the court\u2019s calculation of his criminal history score on his conviction for the attempted first-degree assault against Hannigan (Count 9). The court, over defendant\u2019s objection, declined to treat that offense as part of the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d as the attempted assaults against Zimmerman and McCandless (Counts 6 and 7) and, consequently, used the convictions on those two counts to enhance defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 9 from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cB.\u201d We review the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision \u2014 specifically, its determination that the conviction on Count 9 did not arise from the same criminal episode as Counts 6 and 7 \u2014 for errors of law. <em>State v. Fore, </em>185 Or App 712, 716, 62 P3d 400 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"> We begin by putting the asserted error in context. A defendant\u2019s criminal history score is used to calculate the sentence the court is to impose. OAR 213-004-0006. The score is determined by several factors, including the number and character of the offender\u2019s prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>When multiple convictions occur in the same proceeding, ones occurring in an earlier criminal episode may be used to recalculate the defendant\u2019s criminal history score with respect to convictions stemming from a later criminal episode. <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 317, 855 P2d 1100 (1993); <em>State v. Allen, </em>151 Or App 281, 290-91, 948 P2d 745 (1997). In contrast, when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>defendant\u2019s multiple convictions stem from the same criminal episode, his criminal history score remains the same with respect to all of those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">To determine whether convictions arise from the same criminal episode, we apply the same test that governs our double jeopardy analysis. <em>State v. Kautz, </em>179 Or App 458, 466-67, 39 P3d 937, <em>rev den, </em>334 Or 327 (2002). Crimes arise from the same criminal episode when they are part of \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that * * * is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d ORS 131.505(4). As we explained in <em>State v. Sparks, </em>150 Or App 293, 297, 946 P2d 314 (1997) (citing <em>State v. Boyd, </em>271 Or 558, 565-66, 533 P2d 795 (1975)), the term \u201ccriminal episode\u201d is synonymous with the phrase \u201csame act or transaction.\u201d The Oregon Supreme Court has explained that \u201ctwo charges arise out of the same act or transaction if they are so closely linked in time, place and circumstance that a complete account of one charge cannot be related without relating the details of the other charge.\u201d <em>State v. Fitzgerald, </em>267 Or 266, 273, 516 P2d 1280 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Here, defendant argues that the three assaults (against Zimmerman and McCandless and against Hannigan) all arose from one criminal episode because the actions are so fundamentally related that a complete account of the third assault cannot be made without discussing the first two. As primary support for that argument, defendant invokes <em>Kautz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">In <em>Kautz, </em>the defendant was convicted of numerous crimes, including one count of burglary and one count of robbery. 179 Or App at 460. The defendant had broken into a garage, taken various items, and attempted to leave in the victim\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>As the defendant was leaving, the victim saw the defendant and attempted to stop him. <em>Id. </em>To prevent his capture, the defendant pointed a shotgun at the victim, told him to back off, and then fled. <em>Id. </em>The trial court treated the two convictions, one for unlawfully taking property (burglary) and one for overcoming resistance to the taking of property (robbery), as arising from separate criminal episodes and, based on that determination, declined to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule, OAR 213-012-0020, in imposing consecutive sentences for those crimes. <em>Kautz, </em>179 Or App at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">On appeal, we reversed, holding that all of the defendant\u2019s acts were directed at one criminal goal and that the robbery was, in essence, simply a continuation of the burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 467. We concluded that, \u201c[w]hile defendant may have acquired an additional criminal objective to escape when confronted by [the victim], his earlier objective to steal [the victim\u2019s] property continued during the course of all of the events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of the continuity of purpose, and the fact that all the events took place in such a short period of time, it would be impossible to give a complete account of the robbery without first discussing the burglary. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the state would have needed to relate the facts of the burglary in order to explain why the defendant was using force to escape. As a result, we held that the two convictions arose from a single criminal episode. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Defendant contends that his case is similar to <em>Kautz, </em>because the three assaults are so connected in time, place, and purpose that the circumstances of the third offense cannot properly be understood and assessed without reference to the first two. Defendant asserts that he had only one purpose throughout his interaction with the police \u2014 to flee from them \u2014 and, although he may have attempted to commit three assaults in the process, his actions occurred over the span of only a few hundred feet and within a few seconds, during which his goal to escape never wavered. Thus, defendant reasons, as with the two criminal acts in <em>Kautz, </em>it would be impossible to explain why and how he encountered Hannigan without reference to his encounter with the other officers mere seconds before. In sum, defendant asserts, everything that occurred on the gravel road was a single criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The state counters that defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Kautz </em>is misplaced for several reasons. First, the state points out that, while in <em>Kautz </em>there was only one victim, here, defendant assaulted three officers. Second, the state argues that the criminal acts in <em>Kautz </em>all transpired in one place, a garage and its driveway, whereas here, the encounters were separated by approximately 100 yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Further, invoking <em>Fore, </em>the state notes that, even assuming that the events transpired in a relatively brief time and proximate space, that is not, by itself, dispositive. In <em>Fore, </em>the defendant, an inmate working on a road crew in Marion County, ran away from the crew and, 20 minutes later, was seen three blocks away driving away from the area in a van. 185 Or App at 714. Later the same day, the defendant was apprehended near the same van in Josephine County. <em>Id. </em>The defendant was charged in Josephine County with unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV). The defendant was also charged in Marion County with both second-degree escape and UUV. After being convicted on the Josephine County UUV charge, the defendant moved to dismiss the Marion County prosecution as being barred by, <em>inter alia, </em>statutory former jeopardy, ORS 131.515(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arguing that the Marion County charges arose from the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d as the Josephine County prosecution. The Marion County court granted that motion. <em>Fore, </em>185 Or App at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The state appealed only the dismissal of the second-degree escape charge, arguing that the defendant\u2019s escape and his subsequent UUV were not part of the \u201csame criminal episode\u201d for purposes of ORS 131.515(2), \u201cbecause [the] defendant\u2019s escape was complete when he ran away from the work crew and before he took the van\u201d and because \u201ca complete account of each crime is possible without relating the details of the other.\u201d <em>Fore, </em>185 Or App at 715. The defendant responded that the two events \u2014 the escape and UUV \u2014 were very closely linked in time and place. We acknowledged those circumstances but concluded, nevertheless, that mere temporal and spatial proximity was \u201cnot dispositive\u201d because, as the state contended, a complete account of the escape could be related without relating the details of the defendant\u2019s theft of the van. <em>Id. </em>at 718. The state contends that the same reasoning controls here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Finally, the state challenges defendant\u2019s theory that, because his acts were geared to one criminal objective, they are all part of one criminal episode. The state points out that the Oregon Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe test of a single criminal objective is no panacea,\u201d <em>State v. Kessler, </em>297 Or 460, 465, 686 P2d 345 (1984), for ascertaining the contours of a criminal episode.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In <em>Kessler, </em>the defendant was one of six inmates who escaped from prison, in the process of which they kidnapped two correctional officers and four lay ministers who were visiting the prison at the time. <em>Id. </em>at 462. The prisoners captured the six victims and stole their clothes in order to obtain disguises to effect their escape. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to treat each kidnapping conviction as having arisen from a separate criminal episode, even though each act was committed within a short space of time and place and all were aimed at achieving the same purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 465-67. In so holding, however, the court cautioned that \u201cthe fact that the criminal conduct involved multiple victims was no casual coincidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. Rather, \u201c[e]ach of the civilian victims was summoned for a purpose, to obtain his clothing for one of the prisoners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, because \u201cit mattered to the defendant or to his objective who or how many persons\u201d were kidnapped, the court reasoned that these were all separate criminal episodes. <em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The state is correct that various <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 e.g., temporal and spatial proximity and commonality of purposes \u2014 are, when considered in isolation, insufficient to compel a determination that different offenses arose from the same criminal episode. Nevertheless, where those circumstances are so interrelated that a complete account of one offense cannot be related without relating details of the other(s), the offenses must be deemed to have arisen from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>same criminal episode, including with respect to calculation of criminal history score. That standard was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We begin by emphasizing the extreme temporal (a matter of seconds) and spatial (roughly 100 yards) proximity here. Indeed, Hannigan could see the other officers running down the gravel road, chasing defendant\u2019s truck, as the truck bore down on him. In cinematographic terms, the \u201caction\u201d all occurred in a single \u201cscene.\u201d Further, as defendant contends for sentencing purposes \u2014 and we do not understand the state to dispute \u2014 defendant\u2019s actions within that extremely limited \u201cwindow\u201d were motivated by a single, undifferentiated objective to avoid apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Most significantly, in large part as a product of those circumstances, it would have been functionally impossible for defendant to present his defense as to attempted assault against <em>Hannigan </em>\u2014 viz., that he was crouched down behind the wheel of his truck in a panicked response to avoid being hit by the other officers\u2019 gunshots \u2014 without relating details of the encounter with those officers. By the same token, those circumstances bear directly on the state\u2019s ability to prove that defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to Hannigan, as opposed to merely acting recklessly. Because of that inextricable functional intertwining, this case differs sharply from those, like <em>Fore </em>and <em>Stoltz, </em>that the state invokes. We thus conclude that, because the conviction on Count 9 arose from the same criminal episode as Counts 6 and 7, the trial court erred in its determination of defendant\u2019s criminal history score on Count 9. That error requires a remand for resentencing in Case No. 031183.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We turn, finally, to defendant\u2019s challenge to the imposition of an upward departure sentence on his conviction for second-degree burglary in Case No. 031199. Although defendant did not raise his present Blakely-based objection before the trial court, we conclude, under the reasoning of <em>Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, that the imposition of the departure sentence was error apparent on the face of the record. ORAP 5.45(2). Further, for the reasons described <em>in Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 823 P2d 956 (1991), to address that error. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing in Case No. 031199.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>In Case No. 031183, reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed. In Case No. 031199, reversed and remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> Given our disposition of the fourth assignment of error, which necessitates resentencing in Case No. 031183, we do not address the fifth assignment of error as to that case. We elect to follow that course, rather than the obverse, because of the virtual certainty that, if we did not address the fourth assignment of error on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>appeal, the court\u2019s ruling underlying that assignment of error would reoccur on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> For example, Wagner testified that the Tillamook Police Department policy authorized the use of such force only if \u201cthe life or safety\u201d of the officer or of a third person is \u201cin jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> Article I, section 11, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201c[I]n the circuit court ten members of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, save and except a verdict of guilty of first <em>degree </em>murder, which shall be found only by unanimous verdict, and not otherwise!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em> </em>Article XVII, section. 1, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cWhen two or more amendments shall be submitted in the manner aforesaid to the voters of this state at the same election, they shall be so submitted that each amendment shall be voted on separately.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b528-5\"> ORS 131.515(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">\u201cNo person shall be separately prosecuted for two or more offenses based upon the same criminal episode, if the several offenses are reasonably known to the appropriate prosecutor at the time of commencement of the first prosecution and establish proper venue in a single court.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\"> Similarly, the state refers to <em>State v.

In <em>Stolz, </em>the defendant resisted arrest after being arrested for violating a restraining order and was charged with both offenses. We concluded that the resisting arrest charge arose from a separate criminal episode from the charge (violation of the restraining order) for which the defendant was arrested, because \u201c[djetails of the offense underlying an arrest are not required to be shown to prove any element of resisting arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b529-13\"> <em>Kessler </em>addressed the closely analogous question of whether the defendant\u2019s crimes constituted a \u201csingle criminal episode\u201d \u201cassessing whether multiple statutory violations were meant to carry cumulative punishment * * 297 Or at 465.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
