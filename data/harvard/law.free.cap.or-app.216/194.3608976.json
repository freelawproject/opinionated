J.</author>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for felony driving under the influence of initoxicants (DUII). ORS 813.010(5) provides that the offense of DUII is a felony \u201cif the defendant has been convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of this section or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction\u201d at least three times in the preceding 10 years. At issue in this case is whether defendant\u2019s two prior convictions under an Alaska DUII statute qualify as prior convictions under the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to Oregon\u2019s DUII statute. The trial court concluded that they do. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Defendant was charged with \u2014 and later convicted of \u2014 DUII in Oregon in 2004. In the preceding 10 years, defendant had been convicted twice in Alaska of offenses related to driving while intoxicated, and he had been convicted once in Oregon <em>of </em>violating ORS 813.010(5) during that same period. The Alaska convictions occurred in 1995 and 1996, respectively, and they were for violation of Alaska Statute (AS) 28.35.030 (1995), which provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201c(a) A person commits the crime of driving while intoxicated if the person operates or drives a motor vehicle or operates an aircraft or a watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201c(1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, or any controlled substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201c(2) when, as determined by a chemical test taken within four hours after the alleged offense was committed, there is 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the person\u2019s blood or 100 milligrams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood, or when there is 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of the person\u2019s breath; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201c(3) while the person is under the combined influence of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">At trial, following defendant\u2019s conviction for the Oregon DUII, the state contended that the conviction should be treated as a felony pursuant to ORS 813.010(5). The state argued that the two prior Alaska convictions, together with the prior Oregon conviction, satisfied the requirement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>statute that a defendant have three prior convictions under either that statute \u201cor its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction.\u201d Defendant objected, arguing that the two prior Alaska convictions did not qualify as convictions under the \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d of ORS 813.010 because the Alaska statute under which he was convicted criminalized a broader range of conduct than ORS 813.010. Defendant noted that, as interpreted by the Alaska Court of Appeals, the Alaska statute, unlike the Oregon statute, permitted a conviction for operation of a vehicle if the defendant was in physical control of the vehicle, even if the circumstances rendered it impossible for the defendant to move the vehicle, and even if the defendant \u2014 while intoxicated \u2014 neither attempted nor intended to cause the vehicle to move. <em>See, e.g., Kingsley v. State, </em>11 P3d 1001, 1002 (Alaska Ct App 2000). The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s argument, admitted the evidence of defendant\u2019s Alaska convictions, and entered a judgment of conviction and sentence for felony DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s two Alaska convictions and entering judgment on the offense of felony DUII. He argues that, because his two prior Alaska convictions were not entered under a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to ORS 813.010, he should have been convicted of, and sentenced for, misdemeanor DUII. Defendant renews his argument to the trial court that AS 28.35.030 is not a statutory counterpart of ORS 813.010 because the Alaska statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute a crime under ORS 813.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The state responds that defendant\u2019s proposed definition of \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d is too exacting. According to the state, a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d \u2014 at least for purposes of ORS 813.010(5) \u2014 is simply one that \u201cconstitutes [another] state\u2019s \u2018closest match\u2019 to ORS 813.010.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, \u201c[i]n most cases, if a statutory provision in another state generally prohibits the driving or operating of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants, it will qualify as ORS 813.010\u2019s statutory counterpart.\u201d Because AS 28.35.030 is the Alaska provision that most closely matches ORS 813.010, the state reasons that the trial court correctly admitted the challenged evidence and convicted defendant of felony DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The parties\u2019 contentions reduce to a question of statutory construction that is guided by the interpretive method set outin PGE <em>v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We begin with the text of the relevant statutes in context and, if necessary, also resort to the legislative history and other aids to statutory construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">ORS 813.010 is Oregon\u2019s general DUII statute. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicants if the person drives a vehicle while the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201c(a) Has 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood of the person as shown by chemical analysis of the breath or blood of the person * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">* * <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201c(4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the offense described in this section, driving while under the influence of intoxicants, is a Class A misdemeanor and is applicable upon any premises open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201c(5) Driving while under the influence of intoxicants is a Class C felony if the defendant has been convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicants in violation of this section or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction at least three times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current offense and the current offense was committed in a motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">AS 28.35.030 is Alaska\u2019s general DUII statute. Like ORS 813.010, it criminalizes the operation or driving of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Furthermore, the Alaska statute similarly authorizes the state to prove guilt in either of two different ways. First, the state may prove guilt by showing that the defendant possessed a certain blood alcohol content while operating or driving a motor vehicle. <em>See Conrad v. State, </em>54 P3d 313, 313-14, 314 n 1, <em>adh\u2019d to on denial ofreh\u2019g, </em>60 P3d 701 (Alaska App 2002) (holding that AS 28.35.030(a)(2) \u2014 prohibiting the operating of a motor vehicle \u201cwhen, as determined by a chemical test taken within four hours after the alleged offense,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>person\u2019s blood alcohol content is 0.10 or higher \u2014 requires \u201cproof of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time the defendant operated or controlled a motor vehicle\u201d). Second, under both statutes, the state may prove guilt by showing that the defendant\u2019s driving or operating abilities were, regardless of blood alcohol content, impaired by an intoxicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">However, there are two substantive differences between AS 28.35.030 and ORS 813.010. First, as defendant points out, the Alaska statute, unlike the Oregon statute, has been interpreted to permit a conviction for operation of a vehicle even if the circumstances rendered it impossible for the defendant to move his or her vehicle, even if the engine was off, and even if the defendant \u2014 while intoxicated\u2014 neither attempted nor intended to cause the vehicle to move. In that respect, the substantive scope of the Alaska statute is broader than ORS 813.010. Second, the Alaska statute gives the state the option of proving guilt by showing that the defendant drove with a 0.10 percent blood alcohol content, whereas ORS 813.010(l)(a) requires proof that a defendant drove with a 0.08 blood alcohol content. In that respect, the substantive scope of the Alaska statute is narrower than ORS 813.010. We conclude that neither of those differences, either separately or in conjunction, disqualifies the Alaska statute as a statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Our analysis is informed by our decision in <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>202 Or App 695, 124 P3d 611 (2005). In that case, we held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction under an Idaho statute that prohibits persons under 21 years of age from driving with a blood alcohol content of \u201c \u2018at least 0.02 but less than 0.08\u2019 \u201d percent, <em>id. </em>at 697 (quoting Idaho Code section 18-8004(l)(d)), did not constitute a conviction under a statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010. With respect to the meaning of \u201cstatutory counterpart,\u201d we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cIn ordinary parlance, a \u2018counterpart\u2019 refers to a \u2018duplicate,\u2019 something that is \u2018remarkably similar to another,\u2019 or \u2018something or someone having the same use, role, or characteristics often in a different sphere or period.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>520 (unabridged ed 2002). Consistently with that ordinary meaning, the text of ORS 813.010(5) itself suggests a relatively limited meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the term \u2018statutory counterpart/ as it specifies that its focus is a statutory counterpart to \u2018this section/ that is, to ORS 813.010, not, as the state suggests, to the broader subject of using intoxicants and driving.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Ortiz, </em>202 Or App at 699. We elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018statutory counterpart\u2019 in ORS 813.010(5), by its terms, refers to \u2018this statute/ that is, ORS 813.010 itself. It would seem reasonably to follow that the phrase does not refer to counterparts to statutes other than ORS 813.010; otherwise, the statute would not have referred solely to \u2018this statute\u2019 and would have mentioned others, as well. As a result, for example, another state\u2019s zero tolerance statute is unlikely to be the sort of statute that the Oregon legislature would have contemplated as a counterpart to ORS 813.010, as it would clearly correspond more closely to Oregon\u2019s zero tolerance statute. That would seem to be the case especially in light of the fact that the Oregon legislature has determined, as a matter of policy, that violating the zero tolerance statute is not a criminal offense. It strikes us as highly unlikely that the legislature would define such conduct as an administrative offense if committed in this state, but treat it as a criminal offense if committed elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">We noted that, if there is an Idaho \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to ORS 813.010, it is Idaho Code section 18-8004(l)(a), which prohibits a person who is under the influence of intoxicants, or who has an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, as shown by analysis of his blood, urine, or breath, from \u201cdriv[ing] or be[ing] in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701 (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that, because the Idaho statute under which the defendant had been convicted \u201ctargets only * * * those under the age of 21\u201d and \u201cprohibits driving with a [blood alcohol content] of <em>lower than </em>0.08 percent,\u201d it is more similar to ORS 813.300(3), which defines those under 21 with \u201cany amount of alcohol in the blood,\u201d as \u201cbeing under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d and therefore subject to a driver license suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 700-01 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The parties read <em>Ortiz </em>differently. Defendant seizes on our reference in that case to one of the ordinary dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>meanings of \u201ccounterpart,\u201d that is, \u201cremarkably similar,\u201d and argues that the Alaska statute implicated in this case does not satisfy that definition because it criminalizes conduct that ORS 813.010 does not. The state replies that <em>\u201cOrtiz </em>is of limited significance in this case\u201d because it involved a different kind of statutory comparison than this case requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In <em>Ortiz, </em>we described multiple, disjunctive, ordinary meanings of \u201ccounterpart,\u201d one of which is \u201csomething or someone having the same use, role, or characteristics often in a different sphere or period.\u201d 202 Or App at 699. A same \u201cuse\u201d or \u201crole\u201d refers to an identity of purpose or function, not elements. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 1968, 2523 (defining \u201crole,\u201d among other meanings, as \u201ca function performed by * * * something in a particular situation,\u201d and defining \u201cuse,\u201d as pertinent here, as \u201ca particular service or end: purpose, object, function\u201d). Statutes having the same \u201ccharacteristics\u201d have the same \u201ctrait[s], qualities] or properties],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376; they need not be identical in every detail. In short, although statutory counterparts can be duplicates of, or remarkably similar to, each other, the alternative meaning that they may have the same use, role, or characteristics demonstrates that the comparison need not be perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>Ortiz, </em>the defendant\u2019s Idaho conviction was based on a statute that had the same use, role, or characteristics as ORS 810.300(3), Oregon\u2019s implied consent statute for persons under 21. The Idaho statute was not the counterpart of ORS 813.010, Oregon\u2019s general DUII statute. Instead, we opined that, if there was an Idaho counterpart to ORS 813.010, it was that state\u2019s general DUII statute. 202 Or App at 701. That surmise was both logical and consistent with the text of ORS 813.010(5). Under ORS 813.010(5), a DUII conviction is a felony if the defendant previously was convicted of DUII \u201cin violation of this section or <em>its </em>statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction,\u201d and not of \u201ca\u201d or \u201cany\u201d statutory counterpart. (Emphasis added.) In choosing that particular possessive form, and in using the singular form of the norm \u201ccounterpart,\u201d the legislature appears to have assumed that other jurisdictions\u2019 statutes include a \u201csingle\u201d counterpart to ORS 813.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Our decision in <em>State v. Torrey, </em>32 Or App 439, 448-49, 574 P2d 1138 (1978), also informs our analysis. In that case, we addressed the meaning of \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d as used in <em>former </em>ORS 484.365 (1977), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 803, \u00a7 26. The defendant had been convicted of DUII under <em>former </em>ORS 487.540 (1975), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978, which provided that a person committed DUII by driving with .10 percent or more blood alcohol content. The defendant had previously been convicted of DUII under <em>former </em>ORS 483.999(1) (1973), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 1975, ch 451, \u00a7 291, which prohibited driving with a .15 percent blood alcohol content. <em>Torrey, </em>32 Or App at 443. Under <em>former </em>ORS 484.365, the prior DUII conviction could elevate the current conviction from a traffic infraction to a Class A misdemeanor if it constituted a conviction under a \u201cstatutory counterpart\u201d to <em>former </em>ORS 487.540. We held that \u201cthe charge of driving with a blood alcohol level of .15 percent under <em>former </em>ORS 483.999(1) is a statutory counterpart of the Class A traffic infraction of driving under the influence of intoxicants under ORS 487.540.\u201d <em>Torrey, </em>32 Or App at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Significantly, the two statutes at issue, <em>former </em>ORS 483.999(1) <em>ajad former </em>ORS 487.540, required proof of different blood alcohol levels. As a result, the elements defined by those two provisions could not be described as identical or as duplicates. Nonetheless, we concluded that the two provisions were \u201cstatutory counterparts.\u201d <em>Torrey </em>is thus persuasive authority for the proposition that the second difference between the Alaska statute and ORS 813.010, namely, that the latter permits a conviction for a lower blood alcohol content than the former, is not disqualifying. Defendant does not challenge that conclusion. Instead, defendant focuses solely on the first difference between the statutes, which is Alaska\u2019s application of AS 28.35.030 to persons who are unable to drive but who are in physical control of the vehicle. However, we are not persuaded that, for purposes of ORS 813.010, that is a meaningful distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Reduced to its core, defendant\u2019s argument is that, in order to qualify as a statutory counterpart to ORS 813.010(5), another state\u2019s general DUII statute must have the same elements as the Oregon statute or, alternatively, consistently with <em>Torrey, </em>must be a \u201clesser-included\u201d version of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Oregon statute and, thus, constitute its \u201cequivalent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the legislature did not describe the necessary correlation in those terms. Where the legislature intends to require element matching or criminal equivalence, or to specify a lesser-included relationship between offenses, it knows how to explicitly say so. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 181.597(2)(a) (requiring persons moving to Oregon who have been convicted of a crime in another jurisdiction to report to authorities \u201cif the elements of the crime would constitute a sex crime\u201d); ORS 163.160(3)(b) (elevating fourth-degree assault to a felony if the defendant has at least three prior convictions in Oregon \u201cor under equivalent laws of another jurisdiction and all of the assaults involved domestic violence\u201d); ORS 131.515(4) (\u201cA finding of guilty of a lesser included offense on any count is an acquittal of the greater inclusive offense only as to that count.\u201d). That the legislature failed to use such terms in ORS 813.010(5) undercuts defendant\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">To recapitulate: The universe of statutory counterparts is not limited to statutes that have identical elements and, therefore, are duplicates. It is sufficient that, in keeping with the ordinary meaning of \u201ccounterpart,\u201d the statutes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>either remarkably similar or have the same use, role, or characteristics. In this case, we need not decide whether the comparator statutes are remarkably similar, because we conclude, in any event, that they have the same use, role, or characteristics. Both the Alaska statute and ORS 813.010 constitute the general DUII statutes in their respective jurisdictions and both identify alternative means \u2014 one based on proof that a person was \u201cunder the influence\u201d while driving and one based on proof of a particular blood alcohol content\u2014 for proving DUII. Those common uses, roles, or characteristics are sufficient, despite the two differences in substantive scope between the statutes, to make them statutory counterparts for purposes of ORS 813.010(5). It follows that the trial court did not err in relying on defendant\u2019s Alaska convictions for DUII in convicting defendant of felony DUII under ORS 813.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-5\"> As pertinent here, the ordinary meaning of \u201cequivalent\u201d is \u201ccorresponding or virtually identical esp. in effect or function.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-6\"> Subsection (5) was added to the statute by the 1999 legislature. Or Laws 1999, ch 1049, \u00a7 1. When Representative Mannix presented the bill \u2014 HB 2002 \u2014 to the House of Representatives, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201cThis is actually the most significant drunk driving bill that we will have this session. This is the number one priority for the Governor\u2019s Commission on Drunk Driving. And the essence of the bill is that it will allow us to make driving under the influence a felony if you\u2019ve had three prior convictions and you\u2019re out there again and you do it again and this time if you are caught driving under the influence we will toughen the sanctions and at that point the drunk driver faces serious, serious prison time. Having said that much I think I\u2019ll stop right there and see if I get a quick aye vote, and if not I\u2019ll be glad to answer questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">House Floor Debate, July 18, 1999, Tape 317, Side A. The bill then passed the House without dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">It is apparent that, in enacting ORS 813.010(5), the legislature intended to expand the scope of Oregon\u2019s DUII law. It did so by adopting a generally worded term, \u201cstatutory counterpart,\u201d and by describing subsection (5)\u2019s purpose in equally general terms, that is, by articulating a general intent to increase the penalty for repeat \u201cdrunk driv[ing],\u201d and for persons who \u201cdo it again.\u201d Although the legislative history is too generic to answer the precise question presented in this case, it does reveal a general legislative intent to toughen the DUII laws, which is difficult to reconcile with defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
