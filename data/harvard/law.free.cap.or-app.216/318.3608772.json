On appeal, defendant argues that the court erred in imposing a sentence in violation of OAR 213-005-0002(4), which provides that a \u201cterm of post-prison supervision, when added to the prison term, shall not exceed the statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for the crimes of conviction.\u201d Because the crime of conviction is a Class C felony, the maximum indeterminate sentence is five years. ORS 161.605(3). Therefore, defendant reasons, his sentence, which, including post-prison supervision, totals 63 months, exceeds the maximum by three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Although defendant did not preserve the error in the trial court, he asserts that the error is apparent on the face of the record, and urges this court to exercise its discretion to correct it. <em>See State v. McCormick, </em>185 Or App 491, 60 P3d 1089 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 391 (2003) (correcting similar error). The state concedes that the error is apparent on the face of the record, but argues that this court should not exercise its discretion to correct it because it means, at most, that defendant will serve an additional three months of post-prison supervision. Because the state has no valid interest in having defendant serve an unlawful sentence, we choose to exercise our discretion to address the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Conviction affirmed; remanded for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
