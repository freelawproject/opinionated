Petitioners seek judicial review, raising two assignments of error: First, they argue that LUBA erred in approving the county\u2019s use of 1983 prices in calculating the potential value of timber on that land; and, second, they argue that LUBA erred by allowing the county, in the same calculation, to presume a uniform 50-year growth cycle for the timber. In <em>Herring v. Lane County, </em>216 Or App 84, 171 P3d 1025 (2007), we held that LUBA erred in using 1983 prices but did not err in using a 50-year growth cycle. <em>Herring </em>resolves the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Reversed and remanded to LUBA with instructions to remand to county for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
