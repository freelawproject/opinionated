The post-conviction court concluded that, because petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had not informed petitioner that he would be deported if he pleaded guilty, counsel\u2019s assistance fell below constitutional requirements. Initially, we granted petitioner\u2019s motion to summarily affirm based on our decision in <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>191 Or App 587, 83 P3d 921 (2004). The Supreme Court subsequently reversed our decision in <em>Gonzalez v. State of Oregon, </em>340 Or 452, 134 P3d 955 (2006), allowed the state\u2019s petition for review in this case, and remanded the case to us for reconsideration. <em>McCleod v. DeHann, </em>341 Or 140, 139 P3d 258 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On remand from the Supreme Court, the state contends that we must remand the case to the post-conviction court so that it can first determine exactly what trial counsel told petitioner regarding deportation and then determine whether that advice was constitutionally inadequate or ineffective in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzalez. </em>Petitioner argues that, under <em>Peiffer v. Hoyt, </em>339 Or 649, 660, 125 P3d 734 (2005), we must presume that the post-conviction court implicitly resolved in favor of petitioner any factual dispute about what advice was given by trial counsel. However, that presumption is inapplicable to this case where the post-conviction court explicitly stated that it would \u201cnot make a detailed factual finding on who said or did what regarding the deportation issue. This is because, under anyone\u2019s version of the facts, I must find ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the post-conviction court to make the requisite factual findings and to apply the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Gonzalez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
