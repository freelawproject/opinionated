He argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence did not establish that he had been \u201creleased from custody\u201d as that term is used in ORS 162.205(l)(a) and ORS 162.195(l)(a). The state concedes that, under our reasoning in <em>State v. Ford, </em>207 Or App 407, 142 P3d 107 (2006), its evidence did not establish that defendant had been \u201creleased from custody.\u201d The state therefore concedes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. We find the state\u2019s concession to be well founded, and accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
