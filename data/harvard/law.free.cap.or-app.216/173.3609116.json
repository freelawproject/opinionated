In his first assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the state did not produce sufficient evidence that the suspension of defendant\u2019s driving privileges occurred for one of the reasons listed in ORS 811.182(4), the predicate for elevating the offense of driving while suspended or revoked from a violation to a misdemeanor. We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">In his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in giving an instruction that did not require the jury to find that defendant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended for one of the reasons listed in ORS 811.182(4). The state concedes that the jury was required to find that defendant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended for one of the reasons enumerated in subsection (4) of the statute and that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury accordingly. The state further concedes that, on this record, the error requires reversal and remand for a new trial. We agree with the state and accept the concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Because we reverse and remand for a new trial, we need not address defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, which pertains to an evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
