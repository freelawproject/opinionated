The trial court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that PDC had not \u201ccontracted for\u201d the Tin Roof construction project in Portland and, thus, that project was not a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3); consequently, the prevailing wage payment requirements <em>o\u00ed former </em>ORS 279.350 did not apply to that project. We agree with the trial court\u2019s determination in that regard and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The material facts for purposes of our analysis and disposition are uncontroverted. PDC is Portland\u2019s urban renewal and development agency, established pursuant to ORS 457.035, which encourages and coordinates projects throughout the city. The property involved in this case, known as the Tin Roof property, is located within one of PDC\u2019s urban renewal areas. PDC\u2019s stated goal for the area is to \u201cimprove the condition and appearance of the [urban renewal area], eliminate blight and blighting influences, to expand and improve public facilities and to stimulate private investment and economic growth in the [urban renewal area].\u201d To promote those goals, in May 2000, PDC purchased the Tin Roof property, a dilapidated site, for $1,715,600. PDC then, through a real estate firm, marketed the property to third parties to purchase and redevelop the site in a manner compatible with PDC\u2019s urban renewal objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In December 2003, after protracted negotiations, PDC agreed to sell the Tin Roof property to National Meeting Company, Inc. (NMC), a local business that would relocate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>headquarters to the site. The ultimate purchase price was $1,210,000. In January 2004, NMC\u2019s principals, Douglas Daggett and Patrick Eckford, formed a separate limited liability company, Tin Roof Enterprises, LLC (the developer), to purchase and develop the land and then lease it back to NMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">In June 2004, PDC entered into a \u201cdisposition and development agreement\u201d (DDA) with the developer for the sale of the Tin Roof property. Under the DDA, PDC agreed to lend the developer $1,160,000 towards the purchase price. The DDA also bound the developer to comply with the general goals and objectives of the redevelopment area and, further, gave PDC the authority to review and approve significant changes in the developer\u2019s design development drawings, but only to the extent that elements in those drawings did not conform to the developer\u2019s initial conceptual plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In November 2004, without any involvement or participation by PDC, the developer entered into a contract with Precision Construction Company (the contractor) to undertake the construction project. The developer and the contractor, again without any involvement by PDC, selected and entered into agreements with all subcontractors for the construction. Work on the Tin Roof construction project began in January 2005 and was substantially completed in August 2005. PDC had no involvement in the supervision or performance of that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In January 2005, the developer entered into a 10-year lease with NMC, which subsequently occupied the entire building.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">This case arose and evolved in a procedurally convoluted posture that need not be recounted. It suffices to say that the litigation was precipitated by a letter to PDC from BOLI in March 2005 stating that BOLI had determined that the Tin Roof construction project was subject to the requirements of the prevailing wage rate statutes. Thereafter, the central \u2014 and ultimately dispositive \u2014 question, as framed by the parties\u2019 pleadings and evidentiary submissions, was whether the Tin Roof construction project was subject to the requirements of the Prevailing Wage Rate Law. As noted, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court answered that question in the negative, for several alternative and independently sufficient reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">On appeal, the parties substantially reiterate their arguments to the trial court. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the trial court that the Tin Roof construction project was not a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3), because PDC had not \u201ccontracted for\u201d that project \u2014 and, thus, that project was not subject to the requirements of <em>former </em>ORS 279.350. Accordingly, we do not consider other, alternative, bases for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The question is one of straightforward statutory construction. The Prevailing Wage Rate Law provides that \u201c[t]he hourly rate of wage to be paid by any contractor or subcontractor to workers upon all <em>public works </em>shall be not less than the prevailing rate of wage for an hour\u2019s work in the same trade or occupation in the locality where such labor is performed.\u201d <em>Former </em>ORS 279.350(1) (emphasis added). <em>Former </em>ORS 279.348(3), in turn, defines \u201cpublic works\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">\u201c \u2018Public works\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, roads, highways, buildings, structures and improvements of all types, the construction, reconstruction, major renovation or painting of which is <em>carried on or contracted for by any public agency to serve the public interest but does not include the reconstruction or renovation of privately owned property which is leased by a public agency.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\"><em>Former </em>ORS 279.348(3) (emphasis and boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">It is undisputed that the Tin Roof project qualifies as a \u201cbuilding\u201d under the definition of \u201cpublic works\u201d and that PDC is a \u201cpublic agency.\u201d Further, BOLI does not contend that PDC itself \u201ccarried on\u201d the construction project. Thus, the inquiry reduces to whether PDC \u201ccontracted for\u201d the \u201cconstruction, reconstruction, [or] major renovation\u201d of the Tin Roof property. In resolving that question, we apply the methodology prescribed in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We first consider the text and context of the statutory language and, if the legislature\u2019s intent is clear, our inquiry is complete. <em>Id. </em>at 611. If, however, ambiguity remains, we turn to the legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>We begin with the statutory text, on which the parties\u2019 competing constructions are predicated \u2014 somewhat remarkably \u2014 on the meaning of \u201cfor.\u201d BOLI argues that, in employing the term \u201ccontracted for,\u201d the legislature intended to encompass any circumstance in which \u201ca contract between a public agency and another entity requires that entity to construct, or arrange for the construction of, the building or other improvement.\u201d Thus, BOLI reasons, the Prevailing Wage Rate Law applies, because PDC\u2019s ultimate goal in entering into the DDA was to have a building constructed at the Tin Roof site.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">BOLI contends that \u201ccontracted\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d are words of common usage and that its construction of those terms comports with the \u201c \u2018plain, natural and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Haynes v. Tri-County Metro., </em>337 Or 659, 663, 103 P3d 101 (2004) (\u201cwords of common usage\u201d should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning). BOLI acknowledges that, although the dictionary includes numerous definitions of \u201cfor,\u201d only the following definition \u201cmakes any sense\u201d in context: \u201cwith the purpose or object of.\u201d <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>886 (unabridged ed 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Reasoning from that definitional premise, BOLI contends that it is immaterial who will do the construction, who will own the building, or who will use the project once complete. Rather, so long as the ultimate goal of the agency\u2019s contract is to produce a building, even if the agency does not itself own or later use the building, the agency has \u201ccontracted for\u201d the building, and the Prevailing Wage Rule Law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">PDC remonstrates that, as a matter of plain and practical understanding, the meaning of \u201ccontracted for\u201d in <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3) is much narrower than BOLI posits. PDC does not dispute that the definition of \u201cfor\u201d BOLI espouses is, indeed, among the myriad definitions in <em>Webster\u2019s Third. </em>However, PDC contends that it is patently implausible. Rather, PDC suggests, the apposite definition of \u201cfor\u201d is \u201cbecause of\u2019 or \u201cin order to obtain.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>886 (unabridged ed 1993). From that definitional premise, PDC reasons that the \u201ccontracted for\u201d language extends the prevailing wage requirements.only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>those projects in which the public agency is itself a party to the construction contract or the agency has committed, as of the time of the construction, to own or use the improved property. Thus, PDC asserts, the Prevailing Wage Rate Law does not apply to private development, even if that development is of property conveyed by a public entity and, ultimately, promotes the objectives of that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">PDC further contends that, as a contextual matter, the historical evolution of <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3) corroborates that construction. The legislature inserted the term \u201ccontracted for\u201d into the statutory definition of \u201cpublic works\u201d in 1989. Or Laws 1989, ch 752, \u00a7 1. Previously, that definition had encompassed only projects \u201ccarried on by any public agency.\u201d ORS 279.348(3) (1987). <em>See </em>Or Laws 1989, ch 752, \u00a7 1. In PDC\u2019s view, given that evolution,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201c[t]he surgical nature of the amendment suggests that its purpose was to clarify the definition, but not to alter its basic thrust. * * * By adding the phrase \u2018or contracted for,\u2019 the legislature clarified that a construction project is a public work regardless of whether the public agency conducts the construction project itself or contracts with a third party to perform that task on the public agency\u2019s behalf.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">On balance, at <em>PGE\u2019s </em>\u201cfirst level,\u201d PDC\u2019s construction is more persuasive than BOLI\u2019s. Nevertheless, BOLI\u2019s construction remains plausible. As a linguistic and functional matter, it is at least possible that, in amending <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3) in 1989, the legislature did intend to broaden the scope of the Prevailing Wage Rate Law in the manner BOLI urges. So long as a proposed interpretation is not \u201cwholly implausible\u201d in the face of the text and context, the statute remains ambiguous. <em>Owens v. MVD, </em>319 Or 259, 268, 875 P2d 463 (1994); <em>State v. </em>Stamper, 197 Or App 413, 417, 106 P3d 172, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 230 (2005). Accordingly, we turn to the legislative history, which conclusively confirms PDC\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">That history shows that, in 1989, the legislature added the phrase \u201ccontracted for\u201d to the definition of \u201cpublic works\u201d in specific response to the circumstances that we ultimately addressed in <em>Columbia-Pacific v. OPB, </em>102 Or App 212, 794 P2d 438 (1990). In the mid-1980s, Oregon Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Broadcasting (OPB) developed plans to build a new production facility but subsequently determined that it lacked the resources to immediately fund the construction of such a facility. Accordingly, OPB entered into an agreement with a private developer by which the developer (using private financing) agreed to build the new facility to OPB\u2019s specifications, and OPB agreed to lease the facility for up to 20 years, with an option to purchase after five years. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15. The developer began construction in 1987 and did not pay prevailing wage rates for the work performed. <em>Id. </em>In 1988, various labor organizations filed an action to compel BOLI to enforce the Prevailing Wage Rate Law against OPB; BOLI, in turn, filed a cross-complaint against OPB, alleging that the construction of the new facility was a \u201cpublic work\u201d within the meaning of <em>former </em>ORS 279.348(3). The trial court granted summary judgment for OPB, concluding that the project was not a \u201cpublic work\u201d under the then-extant statutory definition, which was limited to the \u201ccarried on by\u201d formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">It was against that backdrop, as BOLI\u2019s (and the unions\u2019) appeal from the summary judgment was pending, that the legislature added the \u201ccontracted for\u201d language to the statutory definition of \u201cpublic works.\u201d BOLI, while continuing to maintain that the OPB project was, in fact, subject to the prevailing wage requirements,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> proposed that the \u201ccontracted\u201d language be added to ensure that the statute encompassed circumstances closely, functionally similar to those presented in the OPB case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The testimony of BOLI\u2019s legal policy adviser before the House Committee on Labor, explaining the purpose of BOLI\u2019s proposal, is exemplary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201cThe intent is to narrowly craft an amendment that would make sure that build-to-suit lease arrangements are covered under the law. It has been the Bureau\u2019s consistent position that the OPB project is covered under the law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>that I think is \u2014 explains why we believe that this amendment creates no new coverage but makes clear that build-to-suit arrangements like that involved in OPB are covered by the law. The amendment is not addressed specifically at any other intention. * * * That is the purpose of that second sentence to make clear that the policy thrust is whether or not the initiation and the reason for existence of the building was the promise to lease on the part of the public agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Tape Recording, House Committee on Labor, HB 2609, Apr 17, 1989, Tape 114, Side A (statement of Kelly Hagen). Colloquy among members of the committee further substantiates the focused purpose and limited scope of the proposed amendment. In particular, various legislators raised questions as to whether, under that amendment, the prevailing wage rate statute would apply when a public agency rented only part of the building or leased space for only a very limited period of time. Tape Recording, House Committee on Labor, HB 2609, Apr 17, 1989, Tape 114, Side A. There is no suggestion that the \u201ccontracted for\u201d language was intended to encompass situations like that here, where the public agency was not a party to the construction contract, did not own the property at the time the work was undertaken, and made no subsequent use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The comments of Senator Shoemaker, who carried the bill on the Senate floor, also, and finally, corroborate the narrow scope of the proposed amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cWhen a public agency contracts for the construction of a building, the spending power of the government is at work regardless of the form of the agreement. Ownership is not the critical issue. The issue is whether a project owes its existence to the financial commitment of a public agency. <em>That commitment may be in the form of a promise to purchase or a promise to lease, either way construction undertaken on the basis of such a commitment is precisely the circumstance in which the prevailing wage rate law is meant to apply.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Tape Recording, Senate Floor Debate, HB 2609, June 15, 1989, Tape 181, Side B (statement of Sen Robert Shoemaker) (emphasis added). Again, there was no suggestion of some broader purpose. In sum, the 1989 amendment was narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>tailored to ensure that the prevailing wage requirements applied to circumstances analogous to those presented in the OPB case. Nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Given the foregoing history, we agree with the trial court that PDC had not \u201ccontracted for\u201d the Tin Roof construction project. Specifically, where, as here, a public agency merely sells land to a private entity to develop for its own private purpose, without continued participation akin to that presented in the OPB case, the agency has not \u201ccontracted for\u201d the construction, even if the agency retains some control over the type or style of the development to ensure that the development is compatible with the agency\u2019s objectives. Accordingly, the trial court correctly allowed PDC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\"> The Prevailing Wage Rate Law was substantially recodified in 2003 at ORS 279C.800 to 279C.870. Or Laws 2003, ch 79, \u00a7\u00a7 165-76. Because those amendments apply only to public contracts first advertised for bid or entered into after March 1, 2005, Or Laws 2003, ch 794, \u00a7\u00a7 336,337, and the operative transactions in this case occurred before that date, this opinion refers to the antecedent statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\"> We ultimately affirmed the trial court\u2019s allowance of summary judgment, agreeing that, in the totality of the circumstances, the construction of the new facility was not \u201ccarried on by\u201d OPB. <em>See Columbia-Pacific, </em>102 Or App at 219-20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
