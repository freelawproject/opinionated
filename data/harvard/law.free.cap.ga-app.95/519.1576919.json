Where there is a conflict in the testimony of witnesses, their credibility is for the jury, and not this court, to decide. Accordingly the verdict of guilty, based on the testimony of two witnesses, is authorized by the evidence and cannot be set aside here. <em>Aycock </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 <em>Ga. App. </em>812 (10 S. E. 2d 84); <em>Britt </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>53 <em>Ga. App. </em>783 (187 S. E. 125). That general ground of motions for new trials, embodied in Code \u00a7 70-206, that \u201cthe verdict may be decidedly and strongly against the weight of evidence,\u201d is discretionary with and is addressed alone to the trial judge, not the appellate court. <em>Josey </em>v. <em>State, </em>197 <em>Ga. </em>82, 93 (28 S.
