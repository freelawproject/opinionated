Thereafter the relator obtained this rule to show cause why the board of commissioners and the superintendent of buildings should not be commanded to grant such permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">We think that the writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">The factual situation of the present case we think brings it within our decision in <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South </em>Orange, 6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>489. The result is that the rule to show cause in the present case will be discharged, and the writ denied accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">Having reached the conclusion stated, we deem it important to all parties in interest to announce it promptly, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>we do so in this somewhat informal manner in order to enable the relator to avail himself of the earliest possible opportunity for review, if a review is desired. And if a review is desired the relator is hereby given permission to enter a rule allowing and directing the molding of the pleadings so as to permit of such review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
