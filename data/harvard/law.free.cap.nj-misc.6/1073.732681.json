L. </em>1917, <em>pp. </em>370, 375, \u00a710; <em>2 Cum. Supp. Comp. Stat. </em>1924, <em>p. </em>2194; <em>Pamph. L. </em>1925, <em>p. </em>392.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-10\">The prosecutor asks for the writ on three <em>grounds </em>\u2014 first, it is alleged protests were filed with the borough council by owners of lands that would be affected under the ordinance, constituting more than two-thirds in assessed valuation of all the lands to be assessed for the improvement, as provided by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>p. </em>375, \u00a7 10. <em>Second, </em>the ordinance was passed by the borough council without any determination that such local improvement is a public necessity, in which case the municipality may undertake such local improvement notwithstanding such objection, as provided by the statute. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>p. </em>319, <em>art. </em>20, \u00a7 10. The Home Rule act, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1922, <em>p. </em>201; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>City of Passaic, 2 N. J. Mis. R. </em>953. <em>Third, </em>the borough failed to give the ten days\u2019 notice required by the. statute and gave only nine'days; <em>Pamph. L. 1917,'p. </em>374, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>Without attempting definitely to decide these questions, it is sufficient to say that the record as presented to us raises an arguable question which entitled the prosecutor to a writ, and therefore a writ of <em>certiorari </em>is allowed to issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
