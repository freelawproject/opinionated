The defense was that the car was carefully driven and that the accident was due to a breaking spring which disarranged the steering gear. This presented a question of fact for the judge sitting as a jury, which he decided in favor of the plaintiffs, and in which we cannot interfere, as there was evidence to support his finding. Hence, there was no error in refusing to nonsuit. The other point made is that it was error for the judge to remark at the close of the case: \u201cThese people hired a cab and they have a right to expect that they will be carried to their destination in safety.\u201d While the proposition may not be technically flawless, every passenger carried by a common carrier for hire expects, and properly so, to be carried to his destination in safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
