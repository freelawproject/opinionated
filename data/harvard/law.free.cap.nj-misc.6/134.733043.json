There was also testimony that at the time of delivery it was in blank except for the signature of appellant, and was delivered to the appellee purely as an accommodation to it, and upon the agreement that it would not become due and payable unless and until the machines in question were made to operate satisfactorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">There was therefore a question for solution by the jury. If the trade acceptance was, as contended for by the appellee, complete at the time of delivery, or if not complete, but, subsequently, was completed as agreed upon and was unconditional, then appellee was entitled to recover, but, upon the other hand, if it was not complete at delivery, and was filled out in a manner not authorized, and it was conditional as asserted by appellant, and such condition had not been met, then appellee was not entitled to have a recovery thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Eor this reason, therefore, the judgment below is reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
