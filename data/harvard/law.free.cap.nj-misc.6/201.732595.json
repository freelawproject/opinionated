The proofs show the last work was done and materials furnished November 28th, 1926. This would bring the filing of the lien claim and the commencement of the action within the time fixed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The next ground is error in refusing to dismiss upon the ground that a proper bill of particulars is not attached to the lien claim or the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">But such bill of particulars was not required because the work and materials were furnished by a contract at a stated price for work and materials therein specified. <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>3304, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Finding no error the judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
