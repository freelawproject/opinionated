Our examination of the proofs satisfies us that the jury was entirely justified in finding him guilty of the charge laid against him in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The next contention is that the court erred in charging the jury as follows: \u201cYou may convict on all or each of the counts in the indictment.\u201d The argument is that this was error, because the court failed to instruct the jury that it might acquit the plaintiff in error on any or^all of the counts. It is not suggested that the instruction was not proper so far as it went. If counsel had desired the court to speak with relation to the acquittal of the plaintiff in error on any or all of the counts, he should have requested such an instruction. This he did not do, as appears from an examination of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">We find nothing of merit in any other of the grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The judgment under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
