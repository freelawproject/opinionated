Stat. of N. J., p. </em>5396. The words of section 1, drawn into this controversy, are \u201cdestroy any <em>tree, sapling or pole </em>standing or, lying on any land within this state,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>The complaint alleges that the defendants unlawfully entered in and upon the land of the plaintiff and cut, felled and destroyed seven hundred and fifty-three trees and saplings standing thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The trial resulted in the direction of a nonsuit as to the defendant Public Service Electric and Gas Company by the court, and a verdict by the jury in favor of the plaintiff for $3,936.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">We find nowhere in the record a rule to show cause, but in the brief of the plaintiff it is stated a rule to show cause was taken out by the individual defendants, and at page 122 there are sixteen reasons filed why the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted. A further examination of the record at page 1 \u201cshows the rule printed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Our examination of the record, the reasons filed and the briefs, lead us to the conclusion that the rule or rules granted should be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
