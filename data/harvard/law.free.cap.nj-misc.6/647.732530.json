He was treated for the first injury by his employer\u2019s doctor, who was not called, as a witness in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s doctor testified that a hernia could only be cured by an operation; he also testified in explanation of the fact that the petitioner worked even after discarding the truss, that \u201cthe intestine will go back up itself and will only come down again under a strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The employer contends that since the petitioner admitted that he had a hernia two and a half years ago, and never submitted to an operation therefor, he still had it on the date of this accident, and could not then have sustained another and distinct injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We think the medical testimony leads to a different conclusion, from which it may be legally inferred that the petitioner\u2019s present condition is the result of the injury he received under the circumstances stated. The result is that the judgment of the Common Pleas will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
