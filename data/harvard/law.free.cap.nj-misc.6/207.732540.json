THE TOWN OF KEARNEY, IN THE COUNTY OF HUDSON, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b223-4\">Argued January 18, 1928</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKs\">Decided February 1, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b223-7\">Before Justices Parker, Minturn and Campbell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-8\">For the prosecutor, <em>Frank </em>Bergen, <em>William, H. Speer </em>and <em>Wendell J. Wright.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-9\">For the respondent, <em>John H.

The assessment for Midland avenue being $13,627.87 and that for Elm street $4,491.45. No other assessments were levied; the balance of the cost in each case being placed upon the town at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">These assessments were reported to the town council by the board of assessors and confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Under the two writs, bringing these assessments before us for review, we are asked to vacate and set them aside, and this we must do because the prosecutor has no lands subject to assessment for benefits but possesses a mere right of use of the highways in question for the operation of its street railway, under legislative sanction. There was no benefit accruing to the prosecutor as a result of such repaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Furthermore, the legislature has by chapter 129 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1927, <em>p. </em>243) fixed the obligation of street railway and traction companies in respect to matters of this character and thereby has established a method to he pursued in respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The assessments under review are set aside and vacated, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
