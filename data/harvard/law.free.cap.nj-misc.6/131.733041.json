The assignment of error is that the court erred in refusing to direct an acquittal of the defendant at the close of the state\u2019s case, because the prosecutor moved to <em>nolle pros, </em>an indictment number 479 against the defendant for a like offense at a different place, viz., in the city of Paterson, on the 14th day of April, 1925. This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">We find no error in the record. The judgment of the Special Sessions of the Passaic County Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
