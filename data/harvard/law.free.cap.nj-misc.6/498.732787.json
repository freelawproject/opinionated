The ground or basis of the judgment of the state board of taxes and assessment was, there was \u201cno proof produced before the board indicating that any of the parties claiming the exemption <em>(i. e., </em>for school purposes), and holding the legal or equitable title to the property in question, are incorporated or organized under the laws of New Jersey and authorized to carry out a purpose for which this exemption may be allowed,\u201d as provided for in the General Tax act. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1925, <em>p. </em>537, \u00a7 203 (4). The property is owned as a subsidiary to the Presbytery of Newton, New Jersey, under three trust deeds, <em>Exhibits P-1, P-2 </em>and <em>P-3. </em>An academy, school or institution of learning is operated under these trust deeds under the control of the Presbytery.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It is entirely settled to claim exemption the facts must clearly bring the case within the terms of the statute. Nothing can be left to implication. A statute granting immunity from taxation must be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Our reading of the record satisfies us that the judgment of the state board under the facts as disclosed by the record was proper. The result is the judgment of the state board is affirmed and the <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
