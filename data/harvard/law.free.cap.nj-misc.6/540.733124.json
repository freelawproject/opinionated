H. REALTY COMPANY, PROSECUTOR, v. BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE CITY OF EAST ORANGE, NEW JERSEY, AND JOHN SCOTT, SUPERINTENDENT OF BUILDINGS OF THE CITY OF EAST ORANGE, RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b556-8\">Decided June 6, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b556-11\">Before Justices Trenchard, Kalisch and Katzenbach.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-X\">For the prosecutor, <em>M.

An application was made in due form to the respondent John Scott, superintendent of buildings of the city of East Orange, who declined to issue a permit because of the provision of section 3 of the zoning ordinance of East Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Section 3 of the ordinance, <em>inter alia, </em>provides, among other things, under the caption, \u201csmall volume residenc\u00e9 district\u201d in subdivision A, as follows: \u201cNo buildings or premises within any district shown as a small volume residence district on the use and volume district map shall be used for other than one or more of the following specified uses: 1. Dwellings for one family only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The prosecutor appealed to the board of adjustment, which board affirmed the action of the building inspector in refusing the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We find nothing in the facts of this case which distinguish them from those facts which appeared in the case of Eeldman &amp; Pivnick, Incorporated, <em>v. </em>Board of Adjustment of East Orange, decided at the present term of this court, and, therefore, the facts of the instant case do not call for the application of a different legal principle than that which - was held controlling in the case cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The writ is dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
