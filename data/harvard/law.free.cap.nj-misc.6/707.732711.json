The defendants were engaged to perform the necessary rock excavating which was done by blasting with dynamite. As a result of such blasting, a water pipe, belonging to the plaintiff company, was broken, and this action was brought to recover the cost of replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The grounds of appeal are error in refusing to nonsuit and in refusing a direction on the ground of no evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The maxim <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is, perhaps, applicable, but the defendant claims that _ the plaintiff may take no advantage of the maxim because the complaint alleged specific negligence \u2014 (1) in the failure to use proper care and reasonable measures to prevent the rock and debris from scattering upon the firing dynamite; (2) defendant\u2019s failure to use proper equipment, and (3) defendant\u2019s employment of incompetent employes.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The pipe in question rested upon a ledge of rock; the blast that caused the damage was set off about three feet from the rock and at a level two feet below the water pipe. There was evidence that the blast could have been regulated to break a less volume of rock, while the blast in its velocity actually took the rock from the bottom up.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">It is also contended that the plaintiff consented to the'act which caused the injury, as the plaintiff, in response to notice from defendant, sent a representative to the job and he approved the precautions taken. It could have been found as a fact, however, that the sole duty of the plaintiff\u2019s representative was merely to turn the water off, and otherwise protect the plaintiff\u2019s property in case <em>of </em>injury from the blasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The facts and circumstances, with the reasonable inferences derivable therefrom, are sufficient to support the judgment which will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
