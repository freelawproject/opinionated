Some ten or fifteen minutes thereafter another employe of the defendant, a boy of fourteen years of age, came to the standing truck to obtain some cord to tie some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>bundles, and he says he accidentally stepped upon the starter of defendant\u2019s truck, which was set in motion and proceeded forward and collided with the coal truck, damaging the truck and injuring both Prank Vitale and his son, Vincent, the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The sole ground for reversal is error in refusing to direct a verdict upon the ground that there was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s automobile was being operated by its authorized agent or servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It appears to us that the grounds of negligence relied upon below are misunderstood by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Such grounds appear to be that it was negligent for the driver of defendant\u2019s truck to have left it in such condition that its motor could have been readily started and the truck proceed forward, and secondly, that the boy, concededly a servant of defendant, and acting within the scope of his employment when he went to the truck for cord, was negligent when he stepped upon the starter and set the motor in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">There was testimony upon both of the points permitting the trial judge to find negligence attributable to the defendant, and, therefore, his findings of fact are not open to review, and the judgments below are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
