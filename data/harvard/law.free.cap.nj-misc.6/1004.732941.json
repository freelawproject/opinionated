A return was made to the writ; a demurrer was filed to the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">The case is presented to this court under a stipulation of facts. It appears that on January 20th, 1927, the building inspector of the township of Maplewood, Albert E. Pancoast, Jr., refused to issue a permit to the relator to build a four-story brick apartment house to accommodate forty-four (44) families, on premises known as No. 13 Highland Place, in the township of Maplewood, Essex county. The refusal to issue a permit was based upon the fact that such a permit would be in violation of a building zoning ordinance of the township of Maplewood, adopted April 2d, 1923. Part of the above premises are in what is called the \"single-family residence district,\u201d in which the erection of an apartment house is forbidden, and part of the premises are in the business district, to wit: the northerly twenty feet thereof, on which buildings permitted are such as can be occupied, by an apartment house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">There is nothing in ordinance that prevents the relator from using any part or all of the premises for a single-family residence. The ordinance expressly provides that in a business district, No. 8, \"any use permitted in a single residence district or a general residence district\u201d is also permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">In this situation, we think, the case is controlled by our decision in the case of <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South Orange, 6 N. J. Mis R. </em>489.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">The result is, the demurrer to the return of the alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>is overruled and a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
