Whether-that be so or not we think that under the circumstances relators should not at this time have the benefit of this writ but that respondents should, by virtue of this constitutional amendment which became effective October 18th, 1927, and the legislation thereunder <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1927, <em>p. </em>818), have an opportunity to adopt proper municipal legislation thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">The rule to show cause is therefore discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
