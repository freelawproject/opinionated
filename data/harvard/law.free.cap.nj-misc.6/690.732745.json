It is a zoning case. The zoning ordinance of Elizabeth prohibits stores in residence B district, which is the district in which the relator\u2019s property is located. After the refusal of the building inspector to grant the permit an appeal was taken by the relator to the board of adjustment. The board of adjustment refused to issue a permit. The relator then applied for and was granted a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the proceedings of the board of adjustment. This case was presented to this court and is number 269 of the January term, 1928. In that case the action of the board of adjustment in refusing to issue the permit has been held to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>This decision is a.bar to the prosecution of the <em>mandamus </em>proceedings instituted in the present case. The proper remedy to review the action of the board of adjustment was by <em>certiorari. </em>This case having been disposed of adversely to the contention of the relator in the present case, the rule to show cause allowed in the present case will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
