Such board of adjustment reversed the action of the building department and granted the permit. Thereafter the Newark Athletic Club applied for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the proceedings and decision of the board of adjustment. The result of that application was that this rule to show cause why a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should not issue was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The applicant for the writ contends, among other things, that the action of the board of adjustment was taken \u201cwithout proofs;\u201d and further, that the two-hundred-foot provision of the ordinance is binding, and effectively prohibits the erection of the garage in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Our examination of the matter results in the conclusion that the applicant has raised questions fairly debatable and is entitled to formally present them to the court for decision. The result is that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
