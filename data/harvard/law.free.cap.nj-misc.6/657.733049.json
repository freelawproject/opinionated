L. </em>1927, authorized such action. That act is a supplement to the Walsh act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>ch. </em>221), and was adopted as the result of the finding of the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Daly et al., </em>4 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Such legislation permits and authorizes the action taken as evidenced by the resolution under review. The result is that such action and the resolutions are affirmed and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
