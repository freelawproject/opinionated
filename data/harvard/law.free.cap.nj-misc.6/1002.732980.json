The writ was directed to the building inspector of the city of East Orange to compel him to issue a permit to erect a four-story building or apartment house, containing thirty-two apartments on premises known as No. 145 North Arlington avenue, in East Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">The permit was refused on the ground that it would be in violation of an ordinance of the city of East Orange, approved March 16th, 1921, prohibiting such a building on lands located in what the ordinance defines as \u201csmall volume residence district.\u201d The ordinance provides that in such a district only certain enumerated uses shall be allowed, among which is not included apartment houses. A return was filed to the alternative writ of <em>mandamus. </em>A demurrer was then filed to the return. A stipulation of facts was made part of the printed book sent up with the record. In this situation, we think our decision, in the recent case of <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South </em>Orange, 6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>489, is applicable and controlling; applying that decision to the facts of this case, the demurrer is overruled and a peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>is refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
