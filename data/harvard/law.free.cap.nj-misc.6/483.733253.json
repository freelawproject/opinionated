These two offenses, among others, were charged against the accused and he was given due notice thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">With respect to the two charges mentioned, as we have indicated, the proofs were ample to justify the township committee in finding him guilty upon such charges. The testimony, which it would serve no useful purpose to detail in the absence of denial, clearly and satisfactorily supported the finding. It is noteworthy that the accused, although present and represented by counsel who participated in the trial, did not see fit to testify himself or to call any witnesses. The principle governing this phase of this case is that where the evidence on which the accused is found guilty furnishes a rational basis for the judgment this court will not interfere. <em>Alcutt </em>v. <em>Board of Police </em>Commissioners, 66 <em>N. J. L. </em>173.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Counsel for the accused argues that the rules of the police department forbidding \u201cgross neglect of duty\u201d were not served upon him. Assuming, without deciding, that this was necessary upon a charge of this kind, it is sufficient to say that the evidence justified the inference that the rules were served upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The resolution brought up for review will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
