The suit arose out of a collision between an automobile in which the plaintiff was riding and a car belonging to the defendant Elsie Crosthwaite, and driven by her son, John, the other defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was that the accident resulted solely from the carelessness of John and was not contributed to by the carelessness of her own chauffeur. Our examination of the testimony satisfies us that the jury was justified in finding that the collision was partly, if not wholly, the result of the-negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s own chauffeur.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">The rule to show cause will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
