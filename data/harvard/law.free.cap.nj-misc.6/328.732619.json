The contemplated gas station was to consist of the building, five one-thousand-gallon tanks to be used for gasoline and three two-hundred-gallon tanks to be used for lubricating oil and a safety lift to be used in changing oil in automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The printed record shows that the relators first made application to the building department of Jersey City for a permit, and afterward applied to the city commissioners of Jersey City, at which time, and after a hearing, the application was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">It appears that an application of the previous owner had also been rejected by the city commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The two points relied on in brief of counsel of prosecutor are \u2014 first, that the refusal to grant relators a permit was an arbitrary ruling, and secondly, that the proposed structure would neither increase the fire hazard in the locality nor jeopardize life, limb or public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Neither of the points relied on is supported by the testimony taken under the rule to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The rule to show cause is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
