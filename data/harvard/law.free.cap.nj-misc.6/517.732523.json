It, seems perfectly clear that the building proposed is in violation of the terms of the ordinance, notably in respect to the size of the building, which in the brief of the relator is stated to be forty feet in width and twenty feet in depth. The building inspector declined to issue a permit, whereupon the relator applied to the board of commissioners, and that board denied the application, after investigation and a finding that the proposed garages would increase the fire hazard, would be dangerous to children in the neighborhood, and detrimental to the health, welfare and public safety of the community at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Thereupon, in September, 1927, the relator obtained this rule to show cause why such permit should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">We think the writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The factual situation we think brings this case within our decision in <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South Orange, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>489.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The result is that the rule to show cause in the present case will be discharged and the writ of <em>mandamus </em>denied accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Having reached the conclusion stated, we deem it important to all parties in interest to announce it promptly, and we do so in this somewhat informal manner in order to enable the relator to avail herself of the earliest possible opportunity for review, if review is desired. And if a review is desired the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>relator is hereby given permission to enter a rule allowing and directing the molding of the pleadings so as to permit of such review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
