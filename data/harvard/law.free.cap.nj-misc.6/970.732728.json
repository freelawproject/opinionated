(Testimony of Morris Brodman, page 43, <em>et seq., </em>of the record.) Our examination of the record, together with the reasons filed for setting aside the resolution, lead us to the conclusion that the defendant Isadore Kaplan, previous to the passage of the resolution by the board of commissioners, complied with all the provisions of the cited ordinance. We find no substantial reasons for disturbing the resolution granting the permits. The action of the board of commissioners of the city of Bayonne, granting the permits to Isadore Kaplan, dated June 5th, 1928, is affirmed, and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
