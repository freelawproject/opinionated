That it is contrary to the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">2. That it is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">3. That it is contrary to the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">4. That it is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">5. That it is contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">6. At the close of the case the great weight of the evidence was in favor of the defendant and a verdict in his favor, as requested, should have been directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">7. Because remarks of the trial judge were prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-20\">We have examined the case in all of these directions and have concluded that a setting aside of the verdict is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-21\">The rule to show cause is therefore discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
