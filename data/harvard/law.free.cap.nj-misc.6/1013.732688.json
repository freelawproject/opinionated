PAUL SOSSNER, DEFENDANT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b1029-7\">Submitted May 12, 1928</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AED\">Decided November 14, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1029-10\">Before Justices Trenchard, Kalisch and Lloyd.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1029-11\">For the rule, <em>Thomas E. Brown.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1029-12\">Contra, <em>William B.

It was a ease of an automobile collision, the car of the defendant striking the ear of the plaintiffs in the rear, while both were proceeding in the same direction on a public street in Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">Plaintiffs and her driver testified that the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile, at the time of the collision, had been brought to a stop near the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">The defendant\u2019s testimony was that, following the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile down the street, and proceeding in the same direction, about fifteen feet away, he was suddenly confronted with an unexpected and dangerous situation by reason of the sudden stopping of plaintiffs\u2019 automobile directly in front of him without any warning or signal of any kind whatsoever, and that in spite of his quick action in immediately applying his brakes, he bumped into the plaintiffs\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">The trial judge charged the jury, in effect, that if they believed the plaintiffs\u2019 version they should find for the plaintiffs, and that if they believed the defendant\u2019s version they should find for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">No complaint is made of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Now, we cannot say that the verdict for the defendant is against the great weight of the evidence, more especially in view of the admitted fact that plaintiffs\u2019 driver was engaged in testing the brakes of plaintiffs\u2019 car at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">It likewise follows that we cannot say that the verdict was contrary to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">The rule will be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
