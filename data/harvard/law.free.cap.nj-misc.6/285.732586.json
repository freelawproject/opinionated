The rul\u00e9 to show cause allowed the defendant reserves all of the exceptions taken by the defendant upon the trial of the cause. The reasons assigned for a new trial are first, the verdict is excessive; second, the verdict is inordinate, the result of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was twenty-nine years old at the time of his death. He had a life expectancy of thirty-nine years. The widow was twenty-nine years old and their two children were four and six years old, respectively. At the time of the decedent\u2019s death, he was contributing from $120 to $140 each month to his wife for the support of herself and their children. He was a man of good habits, health, character and intelligence.
