The single reason urged for making the rule absolute is that the damages are excessive. There was a verdict for $2,500 in favor of the plaintiff for personal injuries received in a collision between defendant\u2019s automobile and the wagon in which plaintiff was riding. Our reading of the proofs convinces us that the damages are not so clearly excessive that the verdict should he disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">The rule for new trial is therefore discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
