The rule before us is limited 'to the amount of the verdict, which is said to be excessive under the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">We find this to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">Plaintiff did not produce any of the three physicians who attended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">The evidence of injury and disability came from the plaintiff himself and a physician who examined but did not treat him.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">The principal complaint appears to be a restricted use of the joint of the right shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">This plaintiff\u2019s physician witness said was \u201cdue to some injury or some other cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">The only other medical testimony was that of a physician called bjr the defendants, who testified to finding two scars on plaintiff\u2019s forehead, and, although there was a complaint of pain in the right shoulder, he had good function of the shoulder, and he could not determine any cause for the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">The verdict was therefore not warranted by the proofs, and the rule to show cause is made absolute and a <em>venire de novo </em>is ordered to the end that a new trial may be had upon the question of damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
