CHARLES D.

In the window of his office there was displayed a white sign Avith black letters, \u201cDr. Chas. Baudendistel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">There was testimony that the prosecutor on divers dates mentioned in the complaint treated persons who came to him for medical treatment by giving them medicines to effect a cure for the bodily ailments of which they complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">There was also proof that the prosecutor had been convicted in the First District Court of Jersey City for a previous violation of the provisions of the section of the above-cited act.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The prosecutor made no 'attempt to refute the charges against him and only offered in his defense a license to practice osteopathy issued by-the state board to him, on January 12th, 1917, and also an official license issued to him to practice chiropractics, by the state board of chiropractor examiners, on November 22d, 1920. The defense then rested its case and contended, and now contends here, that under the .license granted to the prosecutor, to practice osteopathy, the acts complained of and testified to by the witnesses, did not come within the inhibition of section 10 of the statute alleged to have been violated, since osteopaths were expressly excluded from the application of the prohibitory provisions regulating the practice of medicine and surgery, by virtue of section 9 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We think the practice of osteopathy is confined to the manipulation of the human body by applying the hands only to the body of the patient. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>34.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
