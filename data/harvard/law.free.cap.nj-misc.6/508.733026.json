The building department refused to issue such permit, and the matter was thereupon brought before the board of commissioners of Jersey City. The commissioners denied such application upon the grounds (1) that it would endanger the health and safety of the residents of the neighborhood; (2) would be a fire hazard, and would depreciate the value of residential property in the iipmediate vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">On January 8th, 1927, the relator obtained this rule to show cause why a writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not issue commanding the building department and the board of commissioners of Jersey City to issue such permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">We think that the writ must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">It is stipulated that the land upon which this garage was sought to be erected was zoned by ordinance of Jersey City as a residential district.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">We are therefore constrained to think that this case falls within our decision in <em>Koplin </em>v. <em>Village of South Orange, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>489.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">The result is that the rule to show cause in the present case will be discharged and the writ of <em>mandamus </em>denied accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">Having reached the conclusion stated, we deem it important to all parties in interest to announce it promptly, and we do so in this somewhat informal manner in order to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>able the relator to avail himself of the earliest possible opportunity for review, if a review is desired. And if a review is desired, the relator is hereby given permission to enter a rule allowing and directing the molding of the pleadings so as to permit of such review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
