A verdict was rendered in favor of Frank, the son, for $7,500, and a verdict in favor of John, the father, for $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">On the defendant\u2019s rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted we are urged to set the verdicts aside on the ground that a nonsuit should have been entered; that the verdicts are contrary to the weight of the evidence; that the verdicts are excessive and for alleged trial errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">An examination of the proofs sent up with the record of the case convinces us that all of these reasons are without merit and that the verdicts should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">The rule for new trial will, therefore, be discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
