He was therefore properly deemed to have submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court, notwithstanding his motion to quash the summons, made later by way of so-called special appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The second point is \u201cthat upon the return day of the summons issued in said proceeding no day or time was set for the trial of said cause.\u201d We think that the answer to this point is that the defendant finally went to trial without objecting to the alleged failure to enter the continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The last point is to the same effect as the second point, and we think it without merit for the reason given in answer to the second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
