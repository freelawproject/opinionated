BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE CITY OF PATERSON, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b567-7\">Decided June 8, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b567-10\">Before Justices Trenchard, Kalisch and Katzenbach.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-11\">For the prosecutor, <em>Stein &amp; Stein.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-12\">For the respondent, <em>Benjamin J.

J. Mis. </em>R. 520: \u201cThe presumption is that the requirements and regulations of the ordinance are reasonable unless the contrary is shown <em>[Burg </em>v. <em>Ackerman, 5 N. J. Mis. R. </em>96], and there is further presumption that the action of the board was right. <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>Princeton, </em>5 <em>N. J. Adv. R. </em>1801. It follows, therefore, that the action of the board in refusing to vary or modify the terms of the ordinance will not be disturbed unless its action is shown by law evidence to be wrong. <em>Oxford Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>5 <em>Id. </em>729.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">As nothing was presented by the prosecutor to that effect, the writ will be dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
