Erom these it appears that the state highway commission has taken over a portion of London street, in the city of Newark, as a part of route number 1 of the state highways, and that it proposes as part of the construction of a portion of this route to raise the body of the street so that its centre will be thirteen feet above the present level; that the embankment will slope to the old level at a point seven feet from the private property line, which property is owned by the relator, Louis Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">No action having been taken to condemn the rights of the relator, application was made to this court, through the above <em>mandamus </em>proceedings, to compel the highway commission to petition the court for the appointment of commissioners to assess the damages sustained by the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Erom the undisputed facts it is, we think, apparent that the steps being taken by the highway commission to utilize London street for the purpose of a state highway constitute a change of grade only, and that this being true the writ of <em>mandamus </em>prayed for must be denied. It is settled in this state that a change of grade alone, in the absence of statutory authority directing otherwise, imposes no additional servitude on the land within the confines of a highway or liability to the abutting owner for damages <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Elizabeth, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>590), and no legislative authority has been presented to us imposing liability in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">On the facts developed in the pleadings and stipulation of counsel (and without passing on the legal right of a property owner to seek redress through <em>mandamus </em>proceedings in a case like the present) relator has shown no proper property rights to have been invaded, and the peremptory writ of <em>mandamus </em>must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
