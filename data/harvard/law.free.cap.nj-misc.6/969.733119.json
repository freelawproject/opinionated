The chief of the fire department, Reginald H. Bowker, testified that it would not add to the fire risk of the buildings as a hazard\u2014 positively not. It is a two-story brick building. The prosecutor owns Nos. 37-39 Aspen street immediately adjoining, oh which he conducts a bakery shop. The writ is asked for on the ground that the board of adjustment was without jurisdictioon to hear the appeal under the act <em>Pamph. L. </em>1928, <em>p. </em>701, \u00a7 2, as there was no proof \"that no such structure or use shall be allowed more than one hundred and fifty [150] feet beyond the boundary line of the district in which structure or use is authorized by the zoning ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Before the justice of the Supreme Court before whom the application was made in the first instance, it was admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>in open court and made a part of the order denying the writ, which is before us now by a written stipulation to the effect; that the building in question, No. 43 Aspen street, \u201cis not more than, hut within, one hundred and fifty [150] feet beyond the boundary line of the district in which said structure or use is authorized by the zoning ordinance of the city of Passaic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">It seems to us that this is dispositive of the case on the question of jurisdiction. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>is therefore refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
