The rule brings up only the question of the inadequacy of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">The decedent was fifty-five years of age and in robust health; he earned $60 a week as a fancy cake baker, and gave his wife $50 a week, which sum included expenditures for his board and clothes; he left surviving him his wife, sixty years old, and four sons, aged, respectively, eighteen, twenty-two, twenty-four and twenty-seven. Two of the sons are married. The actuary gave his expectancy of life as seventeen and six-tenths years.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">We think under the testimony and the circumstances arising therefrom that the rule should be made absolute as to damages only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
