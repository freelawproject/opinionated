' The action was to recover damages to the automobile and appellee has a judgment for $125, which it is urged should be reversed for two reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">1. Because the proofs do not show that the proximate cause of the happening was a condition of disrepair of the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We find, however, that there was proof in this direction warranting and requiring the submission of that question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">2. Because the only proof of ownership of the automobile was by parol, and should have been by and through a bill of sale as required by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1919, <em>ch. </em>168, as amended by <em>Pamph. L. </em>1920, <em>ch. </em>247.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">No authority is cited in support of this contention, and we think that proof of ownership by parol was sufficient and not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
