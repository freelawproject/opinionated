The rule was made absolute on the question of damages only. In other words, the prosecutor applies for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review the order granting the new trial as to damages only. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>cannot be allowed for two substantial reasons\u2014 <em>first, </em>because the granting or refusing to grant a rule to show cause is a matter addressed to the discretion of the trial court. It is not reviewable upon appeal. <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>99 <em>N. J. L. </em>274; <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>44 <em>Id. </em>366. <em>Second, </em>what was said by Mr. Justice Dixon in the case of <em>Taylor Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Adams Express Co., </em>72 <em>Id. </em>220, is applicable to the facts of this case, viz., the Circuit Court is a constitutional court of record, having general jurisdiction over common law actions, inter-parties, and proceedings therein according to the course of the common law. As such, its orders are reviewable, not by <em>certiorari, </em>but by writ of error (now appeal), 'and only after final judgment. So is the Court of Common Pleas, which is a constitutional court proceeding according to the course of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The order to show cause, dated April 3d, 1928, is discharged and the writ of <em>certiorari </em>applied for refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
