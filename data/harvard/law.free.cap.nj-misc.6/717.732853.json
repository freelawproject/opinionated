EDWARD G. YERG AND JENNIE E. YERG, DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b733-4\">Argued January 18, 1928</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Al1\">Decided July 7, 1928.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b733-7\">Before Gummere, Chief Justice, and Justices Black and Lloyd.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-8\">For the appellants, <em>William L. Greenbaum.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-9\">For the respondent, <em>Philip J.

Affidavits for and against the motion were filed, and upon consideration of these the motion was granted as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Our examination of the. pleadings and the affidavits of the respective parties leads us to the conclusion that the order and the judgment appealed from were proper. The defense attempted to be interposed was that while $11,000 was paid by the vendor on account of the principal contract, the purchaser defaulted in its further performance; that no commission was due to the plaintiff because he was not the broker who made the sale; that he had acted for both parties, and that he had agreed to turn over to the purchaser on the passing of title the $3,200 specified as commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">If these facts constituted a valid defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, they, nevertheless, presented an attempt to vary the terms of the written agreement in contravention of the rule which forbids the alteration of writings by parol testimony. <em>Naumberg </em>v. Young, 44 <em>N. J. L. </em>331.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
