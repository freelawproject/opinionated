A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"APm\">Charles E. Villanueva, as guardian <em>at litem </em>for Bruce Alexander Johnson and Jennie Anne Josephine Johnson, appeals from that portion of the Chancery Division judgment, entered on May 29, 1968, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">\u201c1. The determination of the plaintiffs to distribute and pay over to John Seward Johnson, Jr. all of the Trust Property to enable him to establish a new trust in the form annexed hereto is confirmed, ratified and approved, and the plaintiffs are authorized to make such distribution at such time as they shall determine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Plaintiffs cross-appeal from that part of the same judgment, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201c5. Charles E. Villanueva is allowed $40,000 for his services as Guardian <em>Ad Litem, </em>as well as his unreimbursed expenses and out-of-pocket disbursements aggregating $806.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">They assert that the allowance was excessive and should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Alfred C. Clapp, as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for John Seward Johnson, III, also cross-appeals, and for the same reason, from that part of the judgment allowing \u201cCharles E. Villanueva * * * $40,000 for his services as Guardian <em>Ad Litem.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\"><em>We </em>affirm the portions of the judgment brought before us for review, both as to the main appeal and as to the cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">As to the main appeal we affirm essentially for the reasons expressed by Judge Kingfield in his oral opinion rendered at the close of the proofs, and for the further reasons expressed in the brief supplement herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">As to the cross-appeals covering the $40,000 award made to Charles E. Villanueva for his services as guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>ad litem, </em>we find a proper exercise of the discretion vested \u25a0in the trial judge in such matters, based upon the totality of the circumstances, as evidenced by the record herein, especially in the light of the fact that the subject matter of this trust is valued at approximately $18,000,000 and the litigation involved important and difficult issues of law and equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The <em>inter vivos </em>trust in issue was one of six substantially similar trusts which John Seward Johnson established in 1944 for each of his six children. We are concerned herein only with the one established essentially for the benefit of his son John Seward Johnson, Jr. The original <em>corpus </em>of the trust consisted of shares of common stock of Johnson <em>&amp; </em>Johnson, Inc., and the approximate value of that <em>corpus </em>as of this time is the large sum mentioned above.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The trustees were directed to pay to the son \u201cso much of the net income in any year as the trustees in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion may deem to be for his best interests,\u201d following his attainment of majority. We are not concerned herein with the payment of income. Our concern is with the power given to the trustees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201c3. To distribute the Trust Property as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(a) from time to time and whenever in their absolute and uncon- ' trolled discretion they deem it to be for his best interests, to use for or to distribute and pay over to John Seward Johnson, Jr., or to his guardian <em>ad litem </em>if he is under the age of twenty one (21) years, to be his absolutely, outright and forever, any or all of the Trust Property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The son reached his majority a number of years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\u201cThe absolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d of the trustees to distribute and pay over to the son \u201cany or all of the Trust Property\u201d is limited only by the <em>trustees\u2019 </em>determination that such distribution of the <em>corpus </em>is for the son\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d The trustees so decided herein. If they could make that distribution to the end, as the trust indenture expressly stated, that the trust property would be the son\u2019s \u201cabsolutely, outright and forever,\u201d it seems logical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>to conclude that the trustees could, to safeguard the son\u2019s best interests, condition the distribution upon his setting up a substituted trust. The son is satisfied with that condition and the distribution was approved and confirmed, a copy of the son\u2019s trust agreement being annexed to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The son\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d is not defined in his father\u2019s trust indenture. The expression is not limited to a finding that distribution must be to the son\u2019s best \u201cpecuniary\u201d interests. His best interests might bo served without regard to his personal financial gain. They may be served by the peace of mind, already much disturbed by matrimonial problems, divorce and the consequences thereof, which the new trust, rather than the old contingencies provided for in his father\u2019s trust indenture, will engender. Of what avail is it to rest one\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d on a purely financial basis, and without regard to the effect upon a man\u2019s mind, heart and soul, if the end result would produce a wealthier man, but a sufferer from mental anguish?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The creator of this <em>inter vivos </em>trust was obviously concerned primarily with his son\u2019s best interests. The interests of others were important, but they were only secondary in relation to the son. Courts may not substitute their opinions as to the son\u2019s \u201cbest interests,\u201d as opposed to the opinion of the trustees vested by the creator of the trust with the \u201cabsolute and uncontrolled discretion\u201d to make that determination. The trustees\u2019 decision herein was made in good faith, after consideration of all the facts and attendant circumstances, and for reasonably valid reasons. Only unwarranted judicial interference would induce a negating of the eom'se pursued by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The basis of the argument by those attacking the action of the trustees is that the children, Bruce and Jennie, would suffer under this new arrangement a loss of their contingent remainder interest, provided for in the settlor\u2019s original trust indenture. However, if distribution of the <em>corpus </em>of the trust were made to the son absolutely, as permitted within the unqualified discretion of the trustees, as opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to the challenged distribution subject to the condition imposed, the same loss of the contingent remaindermen\u2019s interest would equally be effected. Thus, these children are not suffering by this approved new setup the loss of any vested remainder interest. The basic intention of the original creator of the trust, that the trustees\u2019 decision should serve the son\u2019s best interests, is not being defeated by the distribution made by the trustees.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-4\">Conford, S. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A7R\">(dissenting in part). I concur in the court\u2019s affirmance of the counsel fee awarded appellant guardian <em>ad litem. </em>I dissent from the affirmance of the trial court\u2019s order of approval of the so-called \u201cdistribution\u201d by the trustees of the trust <em>corpus </em>to the life beneficiary, John Seward Johnson, Jr. (\u201cSeward\u201d hereinafter), solely for the reason that I do not believe that what the trustees propose to do constitutes a distribution at all, within the fair intent of the trust instrument, but rather an impermissible alteration of the substantive trust terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">I conceive that what has happened here is the formulation by Seward and the trustees of a plan simply to alter the provisions of the trust so as to eliminate therefrom the contingent remainder to Seward\u2019s \u201cissue in equal shares <em>per stirpes \u201d </em>in the event of his failing effectively to exercise a power of appointment by will, and to substitute a different contingent remainder which would, among other things, disqualify two of his children, Bruce and Jennie, <em>eo nomine, </em>from participation as his \u201cissue\u201d under the contingent remainder formulated by the settlor. The plan would also disqualify those children as potential appointees under any will of Seward.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The proposal approved by the trial court was eoncededly submitted to the trustees by Seward\u2019s counsel. The record of this case indicates beyond doubt that the trustees had previously refused a number of requests by Seward for advance of part of the principal trust estate, and this primarily for a reason I need not specify but well-known to all involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>in this case. They are satisfied that his needs are amply provided for by their distribution to him of all of the net income of the estate. They have been making such distribution and will continue to do so. They do not now intend, and never have, \u201cto use for or to distribute and pay over\u201d to Seward \u201cto be his absolutely, outright and forever,\u201d any part or all of the trust property, as the trust instrument empowers them to do in their absolute discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The specific proposal approved below is for the trustees to execute an instrument purporting to distribute the trust estate to Seward, but expressly conditioned upon his simultaneously executing an irrevocable trust of the whole estate back to the trustees on the identical trust terms, insofar as control of distribution of the trust principal to Seward thereafter is concerned, and otherwise significantly altered from the original trust terms primarily to cut out Bruce and Jennie as eligible contingent remaindermen after Seward\u2019s life estate or as eligible appointees under Seward\u2019s power of appointment by will. There is no question whatever that the trustees would not transfer anything to Seward without the simultaneous transfer back by him in trust. And this charade is approved solely in order to promote Seward\u2019s present peace of mind in knowing that Bruce and Jennie are forever and irrevocably disqualified as potential sharers in the settlor\u2019s disposition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">My basic disagreement with the majority can be simply stated. Preliminarily, I do not reach the question as to the scope of the trustees\u2019 discretion. What concerns me is that there has neither been, nor proposed, any distribution, but only the going through the motions of one. The terms of the trust instrument relating to distribution call for realistic, not sophistic, construction. When the transaction here ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>proved is consummated, as it must be, in a single, integrated exchange of signed documents, Seward will walk out of the closing transaction with not one iota of greater beneficial interest, present or future, in the principal of the trust estate, than when he walked into the closing to play his part. But the trust terms will, in effect, have been materially altered. That alteration will have been the only net result of the arrangement \u2014 just as it is the only result intended by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The argument advanced by respondents is that the proposal is for a conditional distribution \u2014 that if the trustees may \u201cuse for\u201d or \u201cdistribute to\u201d Seward all of the principal absolutely, as the instrument states, they may do so conditionally \u2014 and this is all they have done here, <em>i. e., </em>distributed it to him on condition that he turn it back to the trustees on the proposed terms. But the obvious fallacy of this approach is that when the smoke clears, the whole trust estate, every whit and tittle of it, is back with the trustees, and no part of it has been used for or distributed to Seward, conditionally or otherwise. Certainly, when the trust document speaks of the trustees <em>using </em>all or part of the principal <em>for </em>Seward, or <em>distributing </em>it <em>to </em>him, it contemplates using up, consuming, or expending such part or the whole, for such purpose. But here, after having purportedly been used <em>for </em>or distributed <em>to </em>Seward, the whole remains intact in the hands of the trustees, as before, for potential use for or distribution to him thereafter. It may accurately be said that the trust estate will have been manipulated for Seward\u2019s peace of mind, but not that it has been \u201cused for\u201d him or \u201cdistributed to\u201d him, in the common and reasonable signification of such terms when employed in a trust instrument in as clear and conventional a manner as here.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The fact noted in the opinion of the majority that Bruce and Jennie have no <em>vested </em>remainder in the trust, in that <em>if </em>a genuine distribution of principal were made to Seward they would automatically lose their contingent remainder interest therein <em>pro tanto, </em>is not germane to the issue which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>concerns me. This is the lack of power of the trustees to impair their interest, albeit contingent, absent a genuine distribution to Seward.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">No comfort can be taken by the respondents from <em>Capron v. </em>Luchars, 110 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>338 <em>(Ch. </em>1932), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>112 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>373 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1933), upon which they rely. There the trust was not irrevocable, as here, (par. 11), but expressly subject to termination at any time in the discretion of the trustee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The arrangement challenged there was a voluntary recasting of the trust, after termination by the trustee, by what the court treated as a contract between the settlors-beneficiaries, having full capacity, and the trustee, the former voluntarily agreeing as part of the arrangement to turn over a portion of the trust <em>res </em>to the trustee. The settlors were held to their agreement by the court notwithstanding the intervening death of the trustee (three judges in the Court of Errors and Appeals dissenting). The distinctions between that situation and the present are too obvious and numerous to require extended exposition here.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It remains that the instant trustees will not, actually, in substance as distinguished from form, have distributed the trust estate to Seward or used it for him. They therefore have no power under the trust instrument to do what is here proposed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\"> Even if Seward changes his mind 10 or 20 years from now and decides Bruce and Jennie should share, the terms of the proposed new trust will make that desire impossible of attainment (unless, of course, the trustees agree for the sake of Seward\u2019s <em>then </em>peace of mind to another \u201cwash\u201d exchange of trusts as in the instant manner).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> The instant trust was not absolutely terminable at the mere will of the trustees, as in <em>Capron. </em>Termination here would merely follow as a legal incident of any distribution of principal, <em>pro tanto. </em>Absent distribution, there can be no termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
