FRED WILLIAMS, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b190-5\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b190-6\">Argued May 26, 1969</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arf\">Decided June 18, 1969.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b191-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Before Judges Gauletn, Collestek and Labkecque.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-8\"><em>Mr. Robert S. Miller </em>argued the cause for appellant <em>(Mr. Stanley 0. Van </em>Ness, Public Defender, attorney).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-9\"><em>Mr. David J. </em>MonyeTc, Assistant Prosecutor, argued the cause for respondent <em>(Mr. Edward J.

He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The primary ground urged for a reversal is that the trial judge erred in excluding testimony pertaining to the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The record indicates that immediately following the shooting defendant got into his car and drove a distance of 12 to 15 miles to the home of a friend, Peter Cassidy. The trip took approximately 20 minutes. Cassidy, called as a defense witness, testified that Williams was emotionally upset and incoherent when he arrived at Cassidy\u2019s home. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>witness was questioned about statements made by the defendant the prosecutor objected and the court heard the testimony out of the presence of the jury. Cassidy testified that when he asked Williams to tell him what had happened the defendant said the shooting was accidental and occurred when he was trying to get rid of a gun which he had taken away from a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Defendant argued that the testimony concerning statements he had made to Cassidy were admissible as spontaneous and contemporaneous statements under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63 (4) (b) and to show his intent at the time of the homicide under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(12) (a). The court ruled that such testimony could not be received under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(4) (&amp;) because the statements were not spontaneous, they had not been made in reasonable propinquity to the homicide, the defendant had an opportunity to deliberate and reflect during the 12-15 mile drive to Cassidy\u2019s home, and that defendant\u2019s self-serving declarations resulted from questions put to him by Cassidy. He further concluded that <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(12) <em>(a) </em>was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"> In determining whether a statement is admissible as an excited utterance or spontaneous declaration under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(4) (&amp;) the court must decide the preliminary question of whether the defendant had any opportunity for deliberation, reflection, contrivance or misrepresentation before he made the statement or whether the utterance was spontaneous and made solely under the stress of nervous excitement. The factors which the court must consider are the element of time, the circumstances of the incident, the mental and physical condition of the declarant, and the nature of the utterance (whether against the interest of the declarant or not, or made in response to questions or involuntary). <em>Lieberman v. Saley, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>156, 161 <em>(App. Div. </em>1967); <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 272, <em>pp. </em>579\u2014 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In deciding whether a statement is admissible under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(12) (a) to show the declarant\u2019s previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>state of mind <em>(i. e., </em>defendant\u2019s intent at the time of the homicide), the court is invested with a discretion to refuse to admit such evidence where because of the circumstances and the interval between the time of the declaration and the previous time referred to, it concludes that there is no reasonable basis for finding that a continuity of that state of mind exists. <em>In re </em>Spiegelglass\u2019 <em>Estate, </em>48 <em>N. J. Super. </em>265, 272-273 <em>(App. Div. </em>1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Here the trial judge made a finding that the defendant\u2019s statements were not spontaneous and therefore they were not admissible under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(4) (6). Moreover, in the exercise of his discretion he refused to admit such statements under <em>Evidence Buie </em>63(12) (a). We conclude that there was ample factual justification for his rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Defendant also contends that the court erred in its charge to the jury and in denying requests to charge which he had submitted. We have reviewed the record and conclude that there is no merit to such contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
