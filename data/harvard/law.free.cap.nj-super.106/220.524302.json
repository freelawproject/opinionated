J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AXX\">Plaintiffs sue for a judicial declaration revesting full title in them to certain corporate securities previously placed by them in the name of their daughter, Mrs. Albert, who has disappeared and whose whereabouts are unknown. The Chancery Division refused the relief sought, but held that Mrs. Albert was a trustee of the stock, and directed the designation of a substituted trustee to carry on her duties as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">In November 1962 plaintiffs contemplated transferring certain securities to their daughter and son, and expressed their intention in a memorandum to them reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">\u201c ALAN AND EVELYN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">As gifts of corporate stock are made, start a separate savings account with dividends from stock, and deposit all dividends in this savings account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">Dividends and bank interest in the account will be subject to income tax payments.

She also executed a will in accordance with the memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">On September 28, 1965 Mrs. Albert, who had been living in Canada with her husband and children, disappeared and has not since been heard from. She last sent her parents dividends from the account in August 1965. In March 1965 Mr. Dierksen visited his daughter to help salvage her marriage. At the suggestion of his son-in-law, the shares of stock were redelivered by Mrs. Albert to Mr. Dierksen as \u201csafer\u201d in his custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\"> The trial court construed the arrangement as an express trust and held plaintiffs could not revoke it in the absence of the reservation of a power by the plain tiff s-settlors to do so. This is undoubtedly good law, generally speaking, if an effective trust was created. But note the parallel of the terms of this memorandum with the instrument involved in <em>Trenton Banking Co. v. Howard, </em>187 <em>A. </em>569, 571 (Ch. 1936), affirmed 121 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>85 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1936), which provided: \u201cThe grantor reserves the right to add to or decrease said fund from time to time as she may desire.\u201d It was held that this clause \u201cno doubt\u201d comprised the right to revoke the trust, either in whole or in part. It is clearly inferable from the third-from-the-last paragraph of the instant memorandum that plaintiffs reserved the right to direct a sale of any of the shares and have the proceeds re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>raitted to them (as well as to add shares to the trust). Even if this is a trust, therefore, plaintiffs had the power under <em>Howard </em>to revoke it.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"> However, we conclude the language of the memorandum and surrounding circumstances repel any proper conclusion that a trust was created. It is true that no particular form of words is necessary to create a trust so long as the intent to create the relationship which the law denominates a trust is found to exist, in all the circumstances, and the other legal requisites therefor are satisfied. See <em>Wolf v. Wolf, </em>136 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>403, 404-405 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945). But it is equally true that a donative transfer which fails as a valid gift because of the absence of one of the essential elements of a gift <em>inter vivos </em>will not be saved by construing the transaction as a trust. 1 <em>Scott on Trusts (3rd ed. </em>1967), \u00a7 31, <em>pp. </em>243-44. <em>Restatement of Trusts 2d, </em>\u00a7 31 and <em>comment </em>a.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The essential elements of a valid <em>inter vivos </em>gift are: (a) donative intent, (b) actual delivery of the subject matter, and (c) donor must strip himself absolutely and irrevocably of all dominion and control over the subject matter of the gift. <em>In re Dodge, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>192, 216 (1967); <em>Swayze v. Huntington, </em>82 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>127, 133 <em>(Ch. </em>1913), affirmed o. b. 83 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>335 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The donative feature of the instant transaction was the delivery of the securities to Mrs. Albert, with the intent that she should have a future absolute interest in what was left of them in her possession should she survive both grantors, her parents. But dominion, control and right of disposition of the subject matter of the gift was substantially retained by grantors for their lifetimes. <em>Not </em>only were they to receive all net income from the securities and reversion of title should Mrs. Albert predecease them, but they reserved the right to direct sale of any of the securities and to receive the proceeds of such sales should they so advise Mrs. Albert. These features clearly precluded the existence of the third element above referred to as requisite for a valid gift, <em>i. e., </em>absolute surrender of dominion and control by the donor. The rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>no third person intervening, plaintiffs had the right to return of the subject matter of the transfer, <em>vis a vis </em>the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Looked at another way, a gift of an equitable interest in property (here, Mrs. Albert\u2019s putative future interest in the stock) must contain the same elements as a legal gift \u2014those specified above. As well stated in Annotation 96 <em>A. L. R. </em>383, 384 (1935), \u201ca gift of the equitable or beneficial title must be as complete and effectual in the case of a trust as in the gift of the thing itself in a gift <em>inter vivos. </em>There must be an executed gift of the equitable title, without any reference to its taking effect at some future time.\u201d Applying that rule in this State is <em>Bendix v. Hudson County National Bank, </em>142 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>487, 490 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). See also <em>Frazier v. Hudson, </em>279 <em>Ky. </em>334, 130 <em>S. W. 2d </em>809 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1939); <em>Eschen v. Steers, </em>10 <em>F. 2d </em>739 (8 <em>Cir. </em>1926). <em>Cf. Whittingham v. Lighthipe, 46 N. J. Eq. </em>429, <em>432-433 (Ch. </em>1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In most respects, the relationship between parents and daughter in this case is more assimilable to that of principal-agent rather than settlor beneficiary-trustee beneficiary. Mrs. Albert\u2019s subjection of herself to the detailed direction and control of plaintiffs as to these shares of stock partakes of the agency relationship, but her vestment with title (though nominal) was a trust characteristic. Scott says that in such a case \u201cit is the agency relationship which predominates, and the principles of agency, rather than the principles of trust, are applicable.\u201d 1 <em>op cit., </em>\u00a7 8, <em>p. </em>79. As an agency relationship, it was terminable at any time at the will of the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration revesting in them full ownership of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Eeversod; no costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
