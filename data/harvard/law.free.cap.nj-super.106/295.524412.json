J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AqD\">The substantial question here is whether a written confession given the police by defendant as to his participation in a gas station robbery on South Orange Avenue, Newark, was admitted in evidence erroneously because of the absence of timely warning to defendant of his rights as required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>694, 10 <em>A. L. R. 3d </em>974 (1966). Defendant was convicted of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">A preliminary hearing on admissibility of the confession in relation both to compliance with <em>Miranda </em>and voluntariness was held out of the presence of the jury. At the hearing Detective Bostic of the Newark police testified that defendant surrendered himself at police headquarters the evening of October 5, 1967, saying that he understood from his wife that detectives had been at the house looking for him \u201cin connection with another crime,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>other than the gas station robbery. He was promptly arrested for the other crime and remained in custody over night. The record does not indicate that he confessed to the other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Bostic testified that on the morning of October 6, 1967, having received information that defendant was involved in the South Orange Avenue gas station robbery, he began an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>interrogation of him. Bostic\u2019s first question to defendant, <em>before </em>giving him any of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was whether he knew anything about the holdup on South Orange Avenue. Defendant\u2019s response was that he wanted to make a \u201cclean sweep.\u201d <em>Thereafter </em>Bostic informed defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and presented to him a written waiver of all such rights, which defendant signed. Thereupon, on further inquiry, defendant confessed his complicity in the robbery, the confession was put into written form, and defendant signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objection to admission of the confession on the ground that <em>it </em>was obtained after the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given; that the only effect of failure to give the warnings before the commencement of the interrogation was to prevent the State from introducing into evidence anything incriminatory said by defendant <em>before </em>the warnings were given and waiver obtained, but not to exclude anything said by defendant subsequent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> Under the circumstances here present, we are firm that the trial court erred. The <em>Miranda </em>opinion itself states and emphasizes five or six times that the warnings must be given <em>at the outset </em>of any interrogation of a suspect of a crime in police custody. Our own Supreme Court says that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings must be given whenever a suspect is in custody and \u201cis subjected to questioning.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>1, 5-6 (1969). While violation of that enjoinder might not be fatal in relation to any nonincriminatory response to such interrogation made before the warnings, it clearly is fatal to the entirety of an ensuing confession if it is preceded by an incriminatory response elicited before the warnings are given and an effective waiver obtained from the suspect. This is what occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">This situation is not comparable with <em>State v. Barnes, supra, </em>where the question was asked of a defendant, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>sought for escape, present in a car with others, \u201cWhose stuff is this ?\u201d, in reference to some checks seen on the floor of the car. There defendant, who made an incriminatory response, was not at all a suspect of any crime related to the checks. The court stressed that the question did not focus \u201con any particular suspect.\u201d (At <em>p. </em>6)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Certainly <em>Miranda </em>will not stand the interpretation that the police need not give the warnings to a <em>known suspect, </em>as here, merely because the <em>form </em>of the interrogation is: \u201cDo you know about the <em>x </em>robbery?\u201d rather than: \u201cWe know you did the <em>x </em>robbery. Tell us about it.\u201d The inherently compulsive effect of <em>all </em>custodial interrogation of a suspect is presumed, the purpose of the rule being prophylactic. <em>Miranda, </em>at <em>p. </em>467, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant was a suspect of this particular crime when the interrogation began that morning. Bostic said so. When, on specific query concerning this crime, defendant said he wanted to make a \u201cclean sweep\u201d (undoubtedly meaning a \u201cclean breast of it,\u201d in common parlance), Bostic could have had little doubt that defendant was telling him he was involved in the crime. At the very least, that interpretation is, if not the only conceivable meaning of such a remark, a common and generally taken signification of it. The trial court did not find that this did not constitute self-incrimination, and we conclude it plainly did. <em>Miranda </em>applies regardless of the <em>degree </em>of self-incrimination evoked in violation of the rule. (At <em>pp. </em>476-477, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1602).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Once defendant, unarmed with the necessary warning of his rights, confirmed Bostic\u2019s suspicions of his involvement in this crime with his first response to Bostic\u2019s initial probe, defendant\u2019s psychological defenses against full self-incrimination were down, contrary to the policy implicit in the very rationale of the <em>Miranda </em>rule, and the giving subsequently of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings could not have had the protective effect, as to this defendant, against unadvised self-incrimination envisioned by the United States Supreme Court in formulating the doctrine. Looked at another way, the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>confession was tainted by tlie poisonous tree of the illegally accomplished initial, general self-incrimination by defendant, <em>cf. Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 <em>U. S. </em>471, 487-488, 83 <em>S. Ct. </em>407, 9 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>441 (1963), and the poison could not be purged by the later <em>Miranda </em>admonition to defendant. Defendant\u2019s psychological capacity effectively to use the warnings, when given, against further self-incrimination, had been dealt a crippling blow as a result of the blanket incrimination effected without the warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Since we think a reversal and a new trial must attend the foregoing conclusions, we need not deal with defendant\u2019s other assertions of error, except to warn that the State must be careful not unjustifiably to refer to prior criminal involvement of a defendant where not offering to show a conviction relevant to credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Iteversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\"> The stated time sequence, which is not disputed by the State, is made clearer by Bostic\u2019s testimony before the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b319-7\">Kilkenny, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AYm\">(dissenting). I do not agree with the majority\u2019s holding that, under the facts herein, <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>1603, 16 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>694, 10 <em>A. L. R. 3d </em>974 (1966), requires a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction of robbery. In my view, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were duly and timely given, under the circumstances, before defendant confessed his participation in the robbery. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">There was ample proof that a robbery was perpetrated on October 3, 1967, at about 11 :45 p.m., at a gas station located at 347 South Orange Avenue, in Newark. The station attendant was robbed of about $100 in cash by a bandit who brandished a short-barreled revolver and demanded the turnover of the money. While expressing a desire not to kill one \u201cof his own kind,\u201d the robber pointed the revolver \u201cright straight\u201d in the victim\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Two days later, police went to defendant\u2019s home and told his wife that they wanted him to come to the police station to be questioned about \u201csome other crime.\u201d The wife told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>husband and he voluntarily appeared at the station in connection with this other matter. He was not placed under arrest or accused of committing the South Orange Avenue robbery. On the morning of October 6, Detective Bostic, a police veteran of 12 years' and assigned to the bandit squad, introduced himself to defendant. The detective testified that he had some \u201cinformation,\u201d not otherwise specified, that defendant was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the robbery at 347 South Orange Avenue. He did not reveal the information to defendant, or how he might be involved, or accuse him of any participation in that robbery. Bostic then asked defendant only a single, general question, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201cDo you have knowledge of any robbery on South Orange Avenue?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">No <em>Miranda </em>warnings preceded this first and single question.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Instead of giving a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d which would have been a proper response to the question and not <em>per se </em>inculpatory either way, defendant <em>volunteered </em>the nonresponsive answer that \u201che wanted to make a clean sweep of everything.\u201d At this point, <em>before </em>any other questions were asked and <em>before </em>defendant was permitted to make his \u201cclean sweep,\u201d he was given the four-fold warnings required under the <em>Miranda </em>rule. He persisted in his desire to make a \u201cclean sweep,\u201d waived his rights as recited in the preamble of the statement, and answered voluntarily the questions put to him by the police. He portrayed his role in the South Orange Avenue robbery as the driver of the get-away car. He named the two confederates with whom he planned the robbery and assisted in its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">While defendant at trial challenged the voluntariness of his written, signed and witnessed inculpatory statement, the trial judge determined preliminarily its admissibility as having been voluntarily made and the jury ultimately presumably resolved that it was voluntary, as evidenced by its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Miranda </em>does not invalidate every answer to a police question unless the specified warnings are first given. To come within the rule, there must be a so-called \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d This means that the questioning initiated by the law enforcement officers must have been after a person \u201chas been taken into custody\u201d or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. The <em>Miranda </em>rule is a reflection of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. But a person may waive his rights to remain silent and to be assisted by counsel at a custodial police interrogation, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. There was evidence of such a waiver in this case. There was evidence herein that defendant was fully advised of his rights before giving his statement to the police of the facts of his criminal participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">As stated in <em>Miranda:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThere is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime * * *. <em>Volunteered statements </em>of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d (384 <em>U. S., </em>at <em>p. </em>478, 86 S. <em>Ct., </em>at <em>p. </em>1630; emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">When defendant was asked if he had \u201cknowledge\u201d of \u201cany\u201d robbery on South Orange Avenue, and \u201cvolunteered\u201d that he wanted to make \u201ca clean sweep of everything,\u201d there was no compulsory self-incrimination. <em>Miranda, </em>as noted in the quotation above, does not require the police to stop a person who wishes to confess a crime. The police in this case did more than merely let defendant talk on. They stopped him from furnishing his \u201cclean sweep\u201d until after he had been fully warned as to his rights. That such a warning had not preceded the first general question and. defendant\u2019s volunteered willingness to tell \u201ceverything,\u201d the incriminating story after full warnings given would not and should not preclude the detailed questioning and answers that followed the warnings. After all, a promise to make \u201ca clean sweep,\u201d without more, would not <em>per se </em>support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>In <em>State v. Barnes, </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>1, 5 (1969), Justice Proctor pointed out that the rule in <em>Miranda </em>requires the four-fold warnings whenever a suspect is taken into custody and is \u201csubjected to questioning.\u201d He found in the <em>Barnes </em>case that the single question, \u201cWhose stuff is this ?\u201d, relating to checks on the floor of a car stopped by the police, was not a ease where defendant was \u201csubjected to questioning\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda, </em>so as to invalidate her admission that the checks were hers, even though no prior <em>Miranda </em>warnings had preceded the single question. There, as here, as Justice Proctor aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">\u201cMost important, it was not the type of question which centered blameworthiness on the defendant.\u201d (at <em>p. </em>6)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">As in the <em>Barnes </em>case and for the reasons therein expressed, the single, general question addressed to defendant in the prsent case, and his volunteered statement, not directly responsive to the posed question, clearly distinguish this case from the recent decisions in <em>Mathis v. United States, </em>391 <em>U. S. </em>1, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>1503, 20 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>381 (1968), and <em>Orozco v. Texas, </em>394 <em>U. S. </em>324, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>1095, 22 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 311 (March 25, 1969). In the words of Justice Proctor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cIn our efforts to protect a defendant\u2019s essential privilege not to be coerced into self-incrimination, we cannot strain to bar as well those inculpatory situations which so clearly are not the product of inherently coercive police practices.\u201d (54 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">So say we in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">I agree with so much of the majority opinion as finds no substantial merit in any of the other grounds asserted by defendant in his argument for a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">I favor affirmance of the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
