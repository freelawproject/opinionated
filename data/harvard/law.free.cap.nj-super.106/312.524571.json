A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A-R\">Plaintiff is the Superintendent of Elections and the Commissioner of Registration of Essex County (superintendent). The significant issue on appeal is whether plaintiff has the authority to appoint his own counsel, whose salary is to be paid by defendant board, to render legal assistance and advice to him in aid of the discharge of his duties as superintendent and commissioner. The dispositive inquiry is whether plaintiff is an \u201cofficer * * * of the State Government\u201d within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:17A-11 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:17A-4(e). The former statute forbids a \u201cstate officer\u201d from employing \u201cany person to act as attorney, counsel, solicitor, legal assistant or other legal adviser to such officer * * *\u201d (except for service as an administrative hearing officer). The latter act directs that such officer\u2019s sole legal adviser, attorney and counsel shall be the Attorney-General of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The facts are well stated in the lower court\u2019s opinion, 101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>495, 496-497 <em>(Law Div. </em>1968), and need not be repeated here in detail. In brief, plaintiff appointed an attorney as counsel to his office in December of 1965. The appointee served in this position until January 19'68, at which time defendant board removed him from the payroll and directed the treasurer to cease the payment of salary to anyone appointed to such position.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Prior to oral argument, because this case directly involves the scope of the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney-General, we requested the latter, by letter, to file a brief <em>amicus curiae. </em>Such a brief has since been submitted and plaintiff has responded thereto. The Attorney-General supports the conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Judge Antell found in the Law Division that plaintiff was a \u201cstate officer\u201d within the meaning of the previously cited statutes, and that defendant board\u2019s actions were therefore proper. We agree with this determination. The court\u2019s reasoning and disposition of the issue was thorough and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>suasive. In addition, we note two further considerations tending to support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">First, the superintendent of elections is empowered by statute to obtain the use of State Police troopers on election day to aid him \u201cin the enforcement of the election laws of this State.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>53 :2\u20141. Second, the status of the superintendent as a state officer has been recognized in <em>Allan v. Durand, </em>137 <em>N. J. Law </em>30, 33 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1948) (the budgetary affairs of the superintendent are subject to the scrutiny of the State Auditor and the removal of the superintendent for malfeasance is within the executive power of the Governor), and <em>MacPhail v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson Cty., </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>613, 617-619 <em>(Law Div. </em>1950) (although their salaries are paid by the county, employees of the superintendent are \u201cstate employees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Plaintiffs reliance on a 1961 letter opinion of the Attorney-General to the superintendent is misplaced. This opinion states only that plaintiff\u2019s office is not one of the \u201cState department\u201d encompassed by the provisions of the state civil service act, sec <em>N. J. S. A. </em>11:4-4(h), to which the Attorney-General is required to appoint a \u201cspecial counsel.\u201d The opinion then proceeds to advise plaintiff as to how he might obtain reclassification under the civil service procedures. There is nothing in the opinion intimating that plaintiff is not a state officer. In fact, the contrary is true. The opinion assumes that he <em>is </em>such an officer by proceeding to instruct him on how to obtain civil service reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Several collateral matters have <em>been </em>raised <em>on </em>appeal. Plaintiff argues that defendant board is estopped from now questioning the propriety of his appointment of counsel because it allowed two years to pass before undertaking to remove counsel from the payroll. This argument is not sound. The requisite elements of an estoppel are not present in this case. Defendants are not guilty of any conduct that could give rise to a belief by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he or his position would be indefinitely retained, or that his position would not some day be abolished or found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>illegal. Similarly, there has been shown no detrimental reliance by counsel on any conduct of defendants pertaining to the future continuance of his employment. On facts such as these there can be no estoppel. See <em>Highway Trailer Co. v. Donna Motor Lines, Inc., </em>46 <em>N. J. </em>442, 449, <em>certiorari </em>denied <em>Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v Highway Trailer Co., </em>385 <em>U. S. </em>834, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>77, 17 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>68 (1966); <em>Summer </em>Cottagers\u2019 <em>Ass\u2019n of Cape May v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>493, 503-504 (1955). Furthermore, even if the requisite conduct and reliance were here present, they would be of no aid to plaintiff. A governmental body cannot ordinarily be estopped by prior acts that were in violation of law. <em>Adler v. Dept. of Parks &amp; Public Property, Town of Irvington, </em>20 <em>N. J. Super. </em>240, 243 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Casale v. Pension Com., etc., of Newark, </em>78 <em>N. J. Super. </em>38, 41 <em>(Law Div. </em>1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Plaintiff also contends that counsel\u2019s title to his public office cannot be attacked collaterally, and that the administration of the election laws is not a state function. Both of these points lack merit. The latter assertion is expressly refuted by <em>McDonald v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, </em>98 <em>N. J. Law </em>386, 391 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1922), affirmed 99 <em>N. J. Law </em>393, 398 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1923). The former argument is inapposite because counsel\u2019s title to his position is not being collaterally attacked. It is the legal existence of his office, to which he holds undisputed title, that is under assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Plaintiff also complains that the Attorney-General has exceeded the scope of an <em>amicus curiae </em>by assuming and advancing a definite position in his brief regarding the merits of the instant controversy. This point is without merit. The status of an <em>amicus curiae </em>is, of course, advisory rather than adverse, but his function is to provide the court with information pertaining to matters of law about which the court may be in doubt. <em>Casey v. Male, </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>255, 258 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1960). The brief of the Attorney-General does not exceed these bounds. His research into the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>before the court has indicated a particular result to him and there is no error in his expressing his opinion to the court. Indeed, he would be remiss in fulfilling his advisory function if he failed to indicate the position to which his research has led. Further, the materials provided in the Attorney-General\u2019s appendix, which were not part of the record below, have not been considered in our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Plaintiff further maintains that defendant board lacked authority to remove counsel from the payroll. This assertion is frivolous. If county funds were being disbursed to support an illegal position, the board was well justified in ceasing this unwarranted expenditure of public monies. All of plaintiff\u2019s remaining points, which are statutory construction arguments relating to plaintiff\u2019s status as a \u201cstate officer\u201d and the extent of his power to retain assistants as may be necessary to carry out the duties of his office, have been satisfactorily disposed of in the lower court\u2019s opinion. See 101 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>499-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
