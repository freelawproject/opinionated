Appellant, Gerald L. Chadderton, Jr., appeals from a judgment entered after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Harford County, on appellant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim appeal, against appellee, M.A. Bongiovanni, Inc., et al.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found that he suffered an 85 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>permanent industrial disability with 55 percent due to a work-related accidental injury on November 7, 1985, 25 percent due to a pre-existing disability, and 5 percent due to an unrelated disability. On appeal, appellant asks us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">I. Whether the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted into evidence medical evaluations over the objection of counsel and without requiring compliance with the Maryland Rules of Evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">II. Whether the trial court erred in allowing the Subsequent Injury Fund to call a witness to testify, and to introduce evidence, not disclosed in discovery which had been propounded by a co-party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">III. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in qualifying Jada Marie Beach as an expert witness and in allowing her to so testify?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We answer the first question in the affirmative and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">On November 7, 1985, appellant was driving stakes into the ground with a sledgehammer when the top of the stake splintered and appellant hit his left foot with the sledgehammer. Appellant subsequently lost his balance and fell on his hip, injuring his back. On April 28, 1992, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) found that appellant was permanently totally disabled, with 50 percent of the disability due to the accidental injury on November 7, 1985, 40 percent due to pre-existing conditions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 10 percent due to a subsequent disability that was unrelated to the compensable injury. As a result of this decision, appellant received temporary total disability benefits for the period from November 11, 1985, through February 7, 1991. Because, <em>inter alia, </em>he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>not awarded permanent total disability benefits, on May 15, 1992, appellant filed an appeal in the Circuit Court for Harford County and requested a jury trial. <em>See </em>Labor &amp; EmpLArticle, Md.Ann.Code \u00a7 9\u2014745(d) (1991). The Subsequent Injury Fund filed a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\">On October 5, 1993, appellant took the deposition of Dr. Jeffrey D. Gaber, M.D. This deposition and two reports allegedly referred to therein are at the crux of this appeal. During the deposition, Dr. Gaber, on his own volition, commented upon the rating prepared by Dr. Laurence Desi, Sr., M.D. (hereinafter the Desi report).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This six page \u201cDisability Evaluation and Rating\u201d dated November 27, 1990, was prepared by Dr. Desi and included the following sections: \u201cHistory of Injury,\u201d \u201cSubjective Complaints,\u201d \u201cMedical History,\u201d \u201cPersonal and Social History,\u201d \u201cEmployment,\u201d \u201cExamination,\u201d \u201cDiscussion,\u201d \u201cAssessment,\u201d and \u201cSummary.\u201d The report noted that, \u201c[bjased upon [appellant\u2019s] history of pre-existing disc derangement with residual symptoms, [the Doctor] estimate[d] a 15% impairment pre-existing the ... injury; and a 36% impairment due to the 1985 injury\u201d and summarized the Doctor\u2019s findings as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">The report concluded by noting that appellant \u201chas a total overall impairment to the whole person of 58%.\u201d During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>cross-examination, counsel for appellee asked Dr. Gaber to comment on a medical evaluation by Dr. Mark S. Rosenthal dated February 23, 1990 (hereinafter the Rosenthal report). This report was in the form of a letter addressed to Ms. Judith Robinson of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. In pertinent part, the letter states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">Mr. Chadderton has a 40% permanent partial disability due to the injury and subsequent surgery on his lumbosacral spine. He also has a 7% permanent partial disability to the right upper extremity because of his brachial plexus palsy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel objected on the grounds of hearsay to the line of questioning and moved that the testimony be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">A <em>de novo </em>jury trial was held on October 25 and 26, 1993, during which the deposition was introduced into evidence by appellant. During the trial, appellant raised the issue of his earlier objection to the line of questioning of Dr. Gaber and the two reports. The court overruled the objection in the record. At the opening of the defense\u2019s case, SIF moved to have the Desi report admitted into evidence. Appellee\u2019s counsel then moved to have the Rosenthal report admitted into evidence. Over strenuous objection by appellant, the trial court ruled that the two reports were admissible into evidence. Additionally, during the trial, an expert witness, Jada Marie Beach, testified with regard to her evaluation of appellant\u2019s work capacity. This appeal from the jury verdict and judgment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in admitting the Desi and Rosenthal reports because they are inadmissible hearsay. Appellee asserts that this argument is not preserved for our review as appellant \u201cwaived any objection to the reports when he failed to challenge portions of the deposition as provided for by the Maryland Rules of Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>dure.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the alternative, appellee also asserts that because Dr. Gaber referred to the two reports in his testimony, the reports are part of the record before the Commission and part of the record submitted to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">An appeal from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is essentially a <em>de novo </em>trial that may proceed before a judge or a jury. <em>See </em>Labor &amp; Empl.Article, Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-745 (1991); <em>see also General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 78-79, 555 A.2d 542 (1989). Although the trial is considered to be de novo, \u201cthe decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct.\u201d \u00a7 9-745(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In the case now before us, appellant objected to the introduction of the Rosenthal and Desi reports. Neither witness <em>(i.e., </em>Dr. Rosenthal or Dr. Desi) testified before the Commission or before the circuit court. Appellant disputes that Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s report was part of the record. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that these, reports were not admissible at the <em>de novo </em>trial because there was no opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarants. .</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Rosenthal report is written on Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s letterhead. It was addressed to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, one of the parties in this case. This letter states the doctor\u2019s opinion that appellant \u201chas a 40% permanent partial disability due to the injury and subsequent surgery on his lumbosacral spine. He also has a 7% permanent partial disability to the right upper extremity because of his brachial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>plexus palsy.\u201d This letter contains the notation, \u201cDictated not read.\u201d The Desi report is written on Dr. Desi\u2019s letterhead. This report states that appellant has \u201ca total overall impairment to the whole person of 58%.\u201d Additionally, the report states that 36% of appellant\u2019s disability was due to the 1985 injury. This report was signed by Dr. Desi.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Below, counsel for the SIF brought to the court\u2019s attention Labor <em>&amp; </em>Empl., Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 9-745 (1991), which provides in part that \u201c[t]he proceedings in an appeal shall be informal and summary.\u201d In response to appellees\u2019 argument that the hearsay reports by Dr. Rosenthal and Dr. Desi were admissible, the trial judge stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">In all my years of presiding over workmen\u2019s comp trials, I am basically unaware of this provision now codified as section 9-745 of the labor article. No counsel, until yesterday, had ever suggested to me that [a workers\u2019 compensation case] could proceed other than under the normal rules of evidence and the normal formality for litigation in the Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">If the words informal and summary are to mean anything, it seems to me that you can have a Circuit Court proceeding that proceeds in the same way, the same fashion that it did at the Commission level. At the Commission level the Commission is exempted from the common law rules of evidence. They receive hearsay. They receive written reports from doctors, which are hearsay. As far as I am aware, they are just laid on the desk of the Commissioner without any further authentication as business records or the like. Nor is there\u2014most of the time the doctor is not there to verify his or her opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In admitting the reports, the court noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">So the question in this case is are these two reports sufficiently reliable type[s] of information that the jury can consider them? In all probability, if we had the doetor[s] here, [they] would probably qualify them as a business record. I am reasonably sure they were produced in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ordinary course of business and kept as such by the doc-torts\u2019] offices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">In all probability, if both of these doctors were produced in person, and took the stand, there certainly is a very strong likelihood that on direct examination they would testify in conformity with the written reports they have issued. So that gives some indication to me of their reliability- .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The court then ruled that the reports were admissible because they showed sufficient indicia of reliability. The court cited four cases in support of its ruling: <em>Waddell George\u2019s Creek Coal Co. v. Chisholm, </em>163 Md. 49, 161 A. 276 (1932); <em>Savage Manufacturing Co. v. Magne, </em>154 Md. 46, 139 A. 570 (1927); <em>Standard Oil Co. v. Mealey, </em>147 Md. 249, 127 A. 850 (1925); and <em>Yellow Cab Co. v. Bisasky, </em>11 Md.App. 491, 275 A.2d 193 <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 745, 751 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">At the outset, we note that while the cases cited by the trial court hold that certain reliable hearsay evidence may be admissible in workers\u2019 compensation cases, these decisions are inapposite to the case now before us. <em>See generally, Candella v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>277 Md. 120, 125-26, 353 A.2d 263 (1976) (explaining that \u201c[although most, if not all, of the cases approving the admissibility of hearsay in workmen\u2019s compensation cases appear to have involved the statement of a deceased employee describing a simple event, we continue to eschew the adoption of a binding rule, preferring to consider each case on its particular facts.\u201d) Moreover, it is now well settled that the worker\u2019s compensation appeal is conducted as a trial \u201cessentially\u201d <em>de novo </em>and we have held that \u201crealistically\u201d there is no difference between an essential trial <em>de novo </em>and a true trial <em>de novo. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. at 79, 555 A.2d 542. The <em>de novo </em>circuit court trial may not always be an \u201cinstant replay\u201d of the worker\u2019s compensation commission hearing. As the <em>Candella </em>court observed \u201c[w]hile Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.) Art. 101, \u00a7 11, provides that the commission is not to be \u2018bound by the usual common law or statutory rules of evidence,\u2019 such evidence may be subject to rejection in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>circuit court on a review <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Candella, </em>277 Md. at 124, 353 A.2d 263. Additionally, 100 C.J.S. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 768(c) is instructive. It states, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">[njotwithstanding a statute provides that the court may exclude or admit evidence taken before the commission, the court, on appeal from the commission, must apply the rules of evidence in accordance with established principles of law, and may consider only evidence properly before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">Accordingly, immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent evidence, among which objectionable evidence is included such evidence as hearsay, is, ordinarily, inadmissible before the court, board, or commission. Moreover, the fact that the evidence was admitted by the lower tribunal does not, ordinarily, render admissible evidence which is inadmissible under the general rules, such as hearsay evidence, although it has also been held in some jurisdictions that hearsay evidence received by the commission must be admitted to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The reports at issue here contained medical opinions that were less favorable to appellant than the opinion of appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Gaber. Appellee does not contest the fact that these reports were hearsay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we are faced with the question of whether, in light of the trial court\u2019s view that because the proceedings before the Commission were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cinformal and summary\u201d the circuit court proceeding \u201cproceeds in the same way,\u201d the court erred in ruling that these reports were admissible as evidence because the \u201ctwo reports [possessed] sufficiently rehable type of information that the jury [ ] consider them [.]\u201d We therefore examine the \u201creliability\u201d aspect of these reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">As we have found no Maryland case on point, we look to other authorities. In <em>Yates v. Bair Transport, Inc., </em>249 F.Supp. 681 (1965), the parties sought a pre-trial ruling regarding the admissibility of reports of several doctors who had examined the plaintiff regarding a Workmen\u2019s Compensation case. Three different reports were sought to be introduced: (1) two separate reports of doctors who examined the plaintiff on behalf of two insurance companies (the Guthrie report<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Richman report respectively) and (2) the report of the plaintiffs treating physician (the Fleck report).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In determining which of the reports were admissible, the court first divided them \u201cbased on the identity of the party on whose behalf the report was prepared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. The court explained that the Guthrie report was prepared \u201cin the ordinary course of business of both doctors\u201d using the standard set forth in <em>White v. Zutell, </em>263 F.2d 613 (2d Cir.1959). <em>Id. </em>In <em>White, </em>a report made by a specialist was found to have been made as part of the specialist\u2019s business and was found to \u201cbear[ ] its own inherent guaranty of being what it purported] to be.\u201d <em>Yates, </em>249 F.Supp. at 689 (citing <em>White, </em>263 F.2d at 615). The <em>Yates </em>court analyzed the reports in light of <em>Palmer v. Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and concluded that because appellant asserted that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the doctors\u2019 reports were prepared for litigation, the reports must demonstrate \u201can added element of trustworthiness which will counterbalance the fact that these reports were prepared in clear anticipation of litigation.\u201d <em>Yates, </em>249 F.Supp. at 689-90. The court then opined that a doctor\u2019s report, prepared in the regular course of business, is admissible \u201cwhen offered by one other than the entrant or one for whom the entrant is then working.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690 (quoting <em>Rotondi v. McLellan, </em>194 F.Supp. 415, 417 (E.D.N.Y.1961)).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court concluded that the Guthrie report was admissible because it was generated at the behest of one of the insurance companies and the appellant sought to introduce it. <em>Id. </em>at 690. The court noted that the Fleck report was not admissible because it was \u201cself-serving with no added degree of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>id. at </em>691, and that \u201cwhere, as here, there is <em>no </em>counterbalancing force to the desire to promote the self-interest of the party on whose behalf the report was made, discretion dictates that the objection [to the introduction of the report] be sustained and the [appellant] be required <em>to call </em>[the doctors.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692 (emphasis added). In other words, the court concluded that \u201cself-serving\u201d reports without any \u201ccounterbalancing force\u201d were not admissible and that the doctors had to testify in court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>100 C.J.S. Worker\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 768(c), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The rationale behind the trustworthiness requirement of a hearsay exception was explained by the Court of Appeals in <em>Candella, </em>277 Md. at 123-24, 353 A.2d 263, in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">[A]n attending physician may testify as to the medical history related to him by his patient, and may also state his conclusions reached on the strength of that history. The same proposition has been applied ... in workmen\u2019s compensation cases[.] Such testimony is admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule, the underlying rationale being that the patient\u2019s statements to his doctor are apt to be sincere when made with an awareness that the quality and success of the treatment may largely depend on the accuracy of the information provided the physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">In Maryland, however, we have not extended this principle to include the case in which the patient\u2019s history has been related to a nontreating physician, ...; in these instances, the trustworthiness which characterizes the declaration is no longer assured, since the patient is aware that the statements are being received primarily to enable the physician to prepare testimony on his behalf rather than for purposes of diagnosis and treatment.-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEc\">(citations omitted). The Court went on to hold that, in that case, the opinion of the non-treating psychiatrist was not admissible because it was based solely on the statements of the appellant/patient and lacked the requisite \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 353 A.2d 263..</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The rule concerning admissibility of a non-treating physician\u2019s testimony, as explicated in <em>Candella, </em>was substantially modified in <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 326-27, 368 A.2d 1005 (1977). In that case, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>a physician, who examines a patient, not for the purpose of treatment, but in order to qualify as an expert witness, may present his medical conclusions and the information, including the history and subjective symptoms, received from the patient which provide the basis for the conclusions. The conclusions are admissible as substantive evidence. The statements made by the patient, as narrated by the physician, are admissible, with a qualifying charge to the jury, only as an explanation of the basis of the physician\u2019s conclusions and not as proof of the truth of those statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 327, 368 A.2d 1005 (footnote omitted). Thus, a non-treating physician\u2019s conclusions are admissible as \u201csubstantive evidence\u201d and any \u201cnarrations\u201d relating to statements made by the patient to the doctor are admissible only as an explanation of the doctor\u2019s conclusion, with a qualifying charge to the jury, but not for their truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We also note that \u201ca hospital record is admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d <em>Fuget v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 643, 653, 522 A.2d 1371 (1987), as long as the information is \u201cpathologically germane.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr. <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook, </em>\u00a7 804(C) (2nd ed. 1993). <em>See </em>Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc, Md.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-101 (1989) (explaining what is admissible as business records.) <em>See also Newell v. Richards, </em>83 Md.App. 371, 388, 574 A.2d 370 (1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>323 Md. 717, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991) (where a doctor\u2019s office record was admitted as a business record to establish the receipt of a telephone call).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">One of the reasons the two reports were admitted into evidence was that the trial court concluded that had the two doctors been present in court <em>(i.e., </em>Dr. Rosenthal and Dr. Desi), the reports would have qualified under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. We recognize, of course, that had the two doctors been present in court, the appellant would have had the opportunity to cross-examine them and perhaps, this appeal would not have been taken. The trial court went a step further. Despite the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>reports had not been qualified as business records,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the appellant \u201cha[d] no opportunity to cross-examine the doctor,\u201d the court decided that it would \u201cfollow at least in some measure the type of procedure that the Commission followed in having the evidence submitted to the jury.\u201d In other words, the able and experienced trial judge recognized that the submission of the two reports could be detrimental to the appellant but apparently, after thoughtful analysis, felt constrained by the statutory provision allowing the proceedings to be \u201cinformal and summary.\u201d We conclude that given these circumstances, appellant was prejudiced because there was no opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Desi and Dr. Rosenthal regarding the medical opinions contained in their reports. Where hearsay evidence is erroneously admitted and prejudice is shown, reversal is required. <em>Beahm, </em>279 Md. at 331, 368 A.2d 1005, Thus, we hold that the circuit court committed reversible error in admitting both of these reports in their entirety, over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">As we have previously noted, in <em>Candella, </em>277 Md. at 125, 353 A.2d 263, the Court of Appeals explained that while the \u201c[Cjommission is not to \u2018be bound by the usual common law or statutory rules of evidence,\u2019 such evidence may be subject to rejection in the circuit court on a review <em>de novo\u201d </em>(quoting Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.) Art. 101, \u00a7 11). <em>See also General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 78-79, 555 A.2d 542 (1989). We do not intend by this holding to exclude reports or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>portions thereof relied upon by a testifying expert in rendering his/her opinion. It is obvious that they would be deemed trustworthy by the expert who had relied upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Appellant next contends that the court erred by allowing the introduction of Dr. Rosenthal\u2019s February 23, 1990, medical report because it was not produced during discovery and because it was not part of the record before the Commission. As we have concluded that this report was inadmissible hearsay, we need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Additionally, appellant contends that Ms. Beach should not have been permitted to testify because she was not disclosed during discovery as a witness. After the voir dire of Ms. Beach, appellant\u2019s counsel stated, <em>\u201cIf </em>she is only being offered to describe what she technically had Mr. Chadderton perform and what the results were, I don\u2019t have any objections to her testifying essentially as a fact witness. But I have a strong objection to her being offered as an expert....\u201d Thus, the court was not informed that appellant objected to Ms. Beach\u2019s testimony based on any discovery violation but rather that appellant objected to any expert opinion testimony by Ms. Beach. We conclude that an objection based on an alleged discovery violation was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Appellant contends that the court erred in permitting Ms. Beach to testify as an expert because she was unqualified to express an expert opinion on appellant\u2019s ability to perform physical labor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">During the voir dire of Ms. Beach, she testified that she had received a degree in physical education with a minor in athletic training from Towson State University in 1990. Her work experience included employment as an exercise physiologist in the field of exercise rehabilitation and as a \u201ccorporate wellness director,\u201d a position that required her to develop exercise programs for employees. She stated that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>employed as a \u201cwork hardening coordinator\u201d with Health-south, a provider of rehabilitative health care. According to Ms. Beach, \u201cA work hardening program and progress rehabilitation program is designed to increase one\u2019s physical function through cardiovascular fitness, strength training, [and] flexibility____\u201d As part of her employment she conducts \u201cwork capacity assessments\u201d in which she tests an individual\u2019s physical ability, to determine whether he is able to perform certain work or whether rehabilitation is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Over appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection, the court accepted Ms. Beach as an expert in the field of \u201cwork hardening and work capacity.\u201d Ms. Beach testified that on September 13, 1993, appellant was referred, to her for a work capacity assessment. Ms. Beach testified with regard to her personal observations of appellant during the test. Based on the test, she recommended that appellant was \u201ccapable of returning to a job with limited sitting, limited lifting, walking twelve minutes, which basically puts him into the sedentary to light category.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Generally, designation of a witness as an expert is a subject of broad judicial discretion. <em>State v. Bricker, </em>321 Md. 86, 95, 581 A.2d 9 (1990). \u201c[A] person must demonstrate a minimal amount of competence or \u2018expertise\u2019 on the subject on which he is allegedly an expert in order to be qualified to testify as an expert witness.\u201d <em>Beahm, </em>279 Md. at 339, 368 A.2d 1005. Based on the voir dire of Ms. Beach, the court could properly find that she was qualified through her training and work experience to testify as an expert in the area of \u201cwork hardening and work capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Additionally, with respect to Ms. Beach\u2019s testimony, the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">A witness who has'special training or experience in a given field is permitted to express opinions based on observed or assumed facts to aid you in deciding the issues of the case. In weighing the opinion of an expert you should consider the expert\u2019s experience, training and skills, as well as the expert\u2019s knowledge of the subject matter about which an expert is expressing an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>You should give the expert\u2014you should give the testimony the weight and value you believe it should have. You are not required to accept any expert\u2019s opinion. You should consider an expert\u2019s opinion together with all other evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We conclude that the court properly instructed the jury that Ms. Beach\u2019s qualifications could be considered in determining the weight that her testimony should receive. We further conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Ms. Beach to testify as an expert witness in this case. Finally, we conclude that the court properly allowed Ms. Beach to refer to a physical therapist\u2019s report upon which she based her opinions and final conclusions with respect to appellant\u2019s work assessment test results. This was because an expert witness may base her opinion on opinions rendered by third parties, <em>Hill v. Baltimore County, </em>86 Md.App. 642, 657-59, 587 A.2d 1155 (1991), and may rely on hearsay information learned before trial, if it is of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in that field. <em>See Consol. Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. Ball, </em>263 Md. 328, 335-39, 283 A.2d 154 (1971); <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Creswell, </em>235 Md. 220, 227, 201 A.2d 328 (1964) (\u201cIt is not a ground for excluding the testimony of an expert that he bases his statements in whole or in part upon what he has read, provided that his reading can be assumed to constitute part of his general knowledge adequate to enable him to form a reasonable opinion of his own.\u201d). <em>See </em>Lynn McLain, 6 <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 703.1 at 237-29, nn. 6-10. In the instant case, Ms. Beach specifically replied that the physical therapist\u2019s report was of \u201cthe type of information [used] in making [her] assessment.\u201d Accordingly, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL; APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b500-14\">. The following parties were defendants below: The Subsequent Injury Fund (\"SIF\u201d), M.A. Bongiovanni, Inc. (the Employer) and Liberty Mutual Insurance, Co. (the Insurer). On April 22, 1994, SIF filed a Line with this court that it would not take a position in this matter and would not participate in this appeal. Accordingly, the two parties on this appeal, the Employer and the Insurer, are collectively referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>appellee. According to appellee\u2019s brief, the correct spelling of the employer\u2019s name is M.A. Bongivanni, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\">. Appellant testified that \u201cin the early 70\u2019s\u201d he was involved in an automobile accident which \u201cslowed [him] down a little bit.\u201d Appellant was also involved in another automobile accident in 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-5\">. The record reveals that the first reference to the two Reports was made when Dr. Gaber responded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">[s]ince I saw [appellant], I was given additional records to look at, and I reexamined the patient and so forth. In November of 1990, he was seen by a Dr. Desi ... at the employer\u2019s request. And at that time, he did an EKG showing a right bundle branch block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">In July '92, he was seen again by Dr. Rosenthal, the treating orthopedist who altered his medication due to increasing back pain.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\">. Appellee made a similar assertion during the trial below. The trial-court concluded that the court would \"overlook any untimeliness factor and overrule the objections in the record.\u201d Md.Rule 2-416(g) (1994) states that \"[e]vidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objection\u201d and the \"[o]bjections to all or part of the deposition shall be made in writing within sufficient time to allow for rulings on them.\u201d In this respect, appellant\u2019s failure to file a timely motion objecting to the introduction of parts of the deposition is inexcusable. The Rule, however, does grant the trial court latitude in deciding this issue as it states \u201d[t]he court may permit further designation and objections as <em>justice may require.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added). This is a matter clearly within the court\u2019s discretion. The trial judge did not abuse that discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">. In 2B Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 79.25(c), the author states that \u201c[h]ospital or physician\u2019s records have been accepted, sometimes under the rubric of the business-records exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d (footnote omitted). The author further notes that '\u2018[rjeports, letters and depositions of doctors have elicited a difference of view [and that] [t]he majority accepts such evidence.\u201d These cases appear to be inapposite to the case before us because they either are statute-specific or address proceedings at the Commission level rather than at a <em>de novo </em>trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">.

In that case, the Supreme Court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>a deceased engineer\u2019s written report to a railroad officer was not admissible. The Court emphasized the fact that the report was not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa7\">typical of entries made systematically or as a matter of routine to record events or occurrences, to reflect transactions with others, or to provide internal controls. The conduct of a business commonly entails the payment of tort claims incurred by the negligence of its employees.
