Marvin Larvae Williams, appellant, was charged with attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, daytime housebreaking, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Williams waived his right to a jury trial and a court trial commenced in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Kahl, J.) on February 23, 1993, at the close of which, the trial judge requested memoranda concerning the defense of duress. The case was resumed on May 4, 1993, at which time Williams was convicted of the charged offenses. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, eight years for daytime house<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>breaking, and five years imprisonment, without possibility of parole, for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. All sentences were to run concurrently. Appellant noted a timely appeal and asks two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">1. Was the trial court clearly erroneous in convicting Appellant of the offenses with which he was charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">2. Should the docket entries be amended to correctly reflect Appellant\u2019s convictions?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The victim, the Reverend Chris Glenn Hale, lived at 8601 Gray Fox Road, Apartment 102 in Randallstown, Maryland at the time of the incident. On March 1, 1990 at or about 4:45 p.m., Hale heard a knock on his apartment door. He went to the door, looked through the keyhole, and saw Williams standing at the door. Hale asked who was there and Williams answered by mumbling, asking if a certain person resided at Hale\u2019s residence. Hale could not understand Williams so he partially opened the door, whereupon four men, including Williams, rushed through. One of the men, not Williams, proceeded to hold a gun to Hale\u2019s face. Hale noticed that three of the men were armed, but did not see if Williams was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">After the men entered Hale\u2019s apartment, they spread out around the apartment to search for other persons, and the apparent leader demanded that Hale divulge the location of \u201cthe money\u201d and \u201cthe dope.\u201d Williams, in the meantime, kept telling the men that the \u201cdope\u201d was in Hale\u2019s apartment, that he and Hale were friends, and that he had been in the apartment the previous day where he had used the \u201cdope\u201d with Hale. After searching unsuccessfully for the \u201cdope,\u201d Williams was forced to kneel next to Hale, and the three men made more demands of the both of them as to where the money and the dope were located. The men then allowed Williams to get up from the floor to make a telephone call. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Williams spoke on the phone for about ten minutes, and when he got off the phone, he walked out of the bedroom with two of the men (including the leader), where they talked for about five minutes. Hale was then tied up and the men, including Williams, left shortly. Nothing was taken from Hale\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">At the trial, Williams testified that he was abducted by the three men because they believed that he knew the whereabouts of the drug stash of one Chuckie Eubanks, a reputed drug dealer. Williams had borrowed money from Chuckie\u2019s brother, Rodney, and had been induced to make a drug run to New York in order to help repay his debt. The Eubanks organization required Williams to make a second trip to New York,, during which Williams cooperated with the police and obtained the names, phone numbers, addresses, and license tag numbers of the parties involved in the drug deal. Apparently, the three abductors, who were former members of Eubanks\u2019s drug organization, knew of Williams\u2019s relationship with Eubanks and believed that he would know the location of the stash house. When Williams was abducted by the men, he told them that he did not know the location of the stash house. The men did not believe Williams and threatened to kill him if he did not disclose its location. Williams led the men to Hale\u2019s apartment, told them it was the stash house, and knocked on the door. Once inside Hale\u2019s apartment, Williams testified that he pretended to participate in the search of the premises. Williams also said that the phone call he made was to his mother and was done at the request of one of the abductors who instructed him to say that \u201ceverything was all right,\u201d the abductors being concerned because Williams\u2019s sister had witnessed the abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Duress</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Williams asserts that the trial court erred because its decision was \u201cpredicated upon Appellant having engaged in criminal conduct in which he was not specifically directed to engage. Because of this, the trial court never even focused upon the question it actually had to resolve: whether any legal alternative existed for Appellant to the conduct in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>engaged.\u201d In the instant case, the trial court heard the testimony of all the witnesses and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJt\">[t]he [Appellant] wants you to believe that he was victimized, that he was taken off the street, and by point of gun, forced to commit an armed robbery. That simply is not true. No one forced him to commit an armed robbery. No one forced him to go to the Reverend\u2019s house and demand money. The only thing these three persons wanted was to have the debt repaid, and they didn\u2019t care how it was done. The [Appellant] said, I don\u2019t care how I repay the debt, I just want to save my own soul, and I will commit an armed robbery to do it, and I will assist in the commission of an armed robbery if that satisfies the debt, if that appeases you and I am safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The court went on to find that the testimony taken as a whole did \u201clend [ ] some corroboration to [Appellant\u2019s] suggestion that, at least to some degree, [Appellant] was under duress.\u201d The court however, did qualify its finding by noting that the duress was not \u201cto go to the stash house\u201d but rather \u201cduress to pay the debt.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court aptly focused on a very narrow issue: \u201cwhether the fact that [appellant] was under duress to repay the debt, and thereby created the scenario for this offense, operates as a complete defense to the offense.\u201d The court requested additional memoranda on this issue and concluded that facts of this case did not support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>finding of duress. Accordingly, we are faced with the question of whether a defendant\u2019s contributory actions can act as a bar to the availability of the defense of duress, <em>ie., </em>whether the appellant\u2019s conduct presents an exception to the applicability of the duress defense. We conclude that it does and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Chief Judge Orth, speaking for this court nearly a quarter of a century ago, explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0a\">[i]n order to constitute a defense, the duress by another person on the defendant must be present, imminent, and impending, and of such a nature as to induce well grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily injury if the act is not done. It must be of such a character as to leave no opportunity to the accused for escape. Mere fear or threat by another is not sufficient nor is a threat of violence at some prior time. The defense cannot be raised if the apprehended harm is only that of property damage or future but not present personal injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\"><em>Frasher v.

State, </em>29 Md.App. 110, 118, 349 A.2d 421 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976). Additionally, we noted that the defense of duress is not successful if the \u201ccompulsion arose by the defendant\u2019s own fault, negligence, or misconduct.\u201d <em>Frasher, </em>8 Md.App. at 449 (citing 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, supra, </em>\u00a7 123, p. 264; 16 C.J., Criminal Law, \u00a7 59, p. 91; 22 C.J.S., Criminal Law, \u00a7 44, p. 136; <em>Ross v.

State Cases\u2014Recent Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Knight, </em>416 Pa.Super. 586, 611 A.2d 1199 (1992), the appellant, Terrence Knight, attempted to rob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>a bar at gunpoint. When the owner of the bar pulled a gun, Knight said that there were other men outside, and ran out the door. Knight was later picked up by police and identified by the bar owner as the man who tried to rob the bar. <em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1201. At trial, Knight relied upon the defense of duress. He asserted that he was forced to rob the bar by two men from whom he bought $60 worth of drugs earlier that day. Knight claimed that the drug dealers, armed with a knife and a baseball bat, found him at his girlfriend\u2019s house, and forced him under the threat of death to go to the bar and rob it. <em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The court, citing 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 309(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which was adopted from the Model Penal Code, stated that the duress defense is unavailable if the actor <em>\u201crecklessly </em>placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress,\u201d or if the actor was \u201cnegligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices to establish culpability to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1203. Knight argued that the term \u201crecklessly\u201d in subsection (b) could not be easily comprehended by a lay person without legal assistance. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the term \u201crecklessly\u201d should be defined for a jury and that a definition of the term is \u201cefficacious when considering the language and purpose behind the exception to the duress defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>court referred to the definitional section of the Pennsylvania Criminal Code, 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 103, which in turn referred to \u00a7 302 of the Code. Section 302 defined \u201crecklessly\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustified risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\"><em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1204. (quoting 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 302(b)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The court, therefore, concluded that \u00a7 302 provides the normal meaning of \u201crecklessly\u201d throughout the statute encompassing both the defense of duress as well as the elements of an offense. <em>Id. </em>611 A.2dvat 1204. In so doing, the court agreed with Knight\u2019s argument that \u201crecklessly\u201d and \u201cnegligence\u201d did not have the same meaning within the context of the Criminal Code. <em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1205. The court then went on to state that \u201crecklessly\u201d denotes more culpability than negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">there should be no exculpation if the actor recklessly placed himself in the situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. Though this provision may have the effect of sanctioning conviction of a crime of purpose when the actor\u2019s culpability was limited to recklessness, we think the substitution is permissible in view of the exceptional nature of the offense. The provision will have its main room for operation in the case of persons who connect themselves with criminal activities, in which case too fine a line need not be drawn. <em>When there is no more than negligence, however, on the actor\u2019s part in placing himself in a situation where duress was probable ... [tjhe defense is excluded only on a charge which negligence suffices to establish culpability ... [t]he difference between </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number><em>inadvertence and conscious risk creation involved in recklessness appears to justify discriminating in this way.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIV\"><em>Id. </em>611 A.2d at 1205 (emphasis in the original) (quoting Model Penal Code, Comments, Tentative Draft 10, at 8). The court held that the defendant, however, was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to define the term \u201crecklessly,\u201d and affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Court of Appeals of Alaska in <em>Walker v. State, </em>674 P.2d 825 (Alaska Ct.App.1983), held that the trial court\u2019s failure to define the term \u201crecklessly\u201d was not plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 830. Walker, the defendant, and his cohorts knocked on the door of a residence they planned to burglarize to make sure no one was home. <em>Id. </em>at 827. When the owner\u2019s son opened the door, the three men claimed they had car trouble and were in need of a telephone. <em>Id. </em>at 827. The men entered the dwelling, robbed it and later kidnapped and killed the owner and her son. <em>Id. </em>at 827. At trial, Walker claimed that he agreed to participate in the burglary, but from the moment his companions drew a gun, he had to go along with the other greater crimes out of fear for his well-being. Walker was tried for two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping, one count of robbery, one count of burglary, and two counts of theft. Walker was convicted on all counts except the murder counts. <em>Id. </em>at 827. On appeal, the court concluded that under Alaska Stat. \u00a7 11.81.440(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> duress is an affirmative defense and therefore the burden was on Walker to establish this defense. As he never objected to the instructions, the Court held that the trial court\u2019s failure to define the term \u201crecklessly\u201d did not constitute plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 827-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>In <em>Meador v. State, </em>10 Ark.App. 325, 664 S.W.2d 878 (1984), Meador was charged with attempted robbery. Testimony at trial revealed that Meador tried to rob a nursing home after some men to whom he owed money picked him up at his apartment and said they were going to use him to rob an establishment to collect their money. <em>Id. </em>664 S.W.2d at 880. Meador therefore objected to the trial court\u2019s instructions that duress is not a defense if he \u201crecklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was reasonably forseeable that he would be subjected to the force or threatened force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>664 S.W.2d at 881. The Arkansas Court of Appeals found no error in the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, concluding that from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGs\">the evidence adduced at trial, particularly the testimony of the appellant concerning why he owed the debt to the men who allegedly forced him to rob the nursing home, it could be inferred that the appellant\u2019s drug dependence placed him in the position to be forced by these men to do something he might otherwise not do. Thus the trial court\u2019s instructions that the appellant could not claim the defense if he recklessly put himself in that position was proper under the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Id. </em>664 S.W.2d at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The Washington State Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. McKinney, </em>19 Wash.App. 23, 573 P.2d 820 (1978). There the defendant, McKinney, was convicted of robbery in the first degree while armed with a firearm. Apparently, McKinney and a companion, both of whom were escapees from a prison work release program, robbed a tavern where they had been drinking for several hours. <em>Id. </em>573 P.2d at 820. As his companion pointed a gun at the bartender, McKinney emptied out the cash drawer. McKinney testified at trial that he was \u201ccoerced into taking the money from the till and that, had he not cooperated with his companion, either [McKinney] or the bartender might have been shot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>573 P.2d at 821. In dismissing the duress defense, the court cited Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7 9A.16.060, which defines the elements of the duress defense. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court noted subsection (3), which provides that \u201c[t]he defense of duress is not avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>able if the actor intentionally or recklessly places himself in a situation in which it is probable that he will be subject to duress.\u201d <em>Id. 573 </em>P.2d at 821. Finding nothing on the record to suggest that McKinney \u201cacted under any personal constraint or that he was threatened,\u201d the court held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury as to this affirmative defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In <em>People v. Rodriquez, </em>30 Ill.App.3d 118, 332 N.E.2d 194 (1975), the defendant, Rodriquez, was granted a three day furlough from jail and did not return, claiming that he was in fear of retribution from one of the corrections officers. <em>Id. </em>332 N.E.2d at 196. Apparently, the officer had given Rodriquez money to buy a pound of marijuana while out on furlough, which Rodriquez subsequently spent while celebrating. <em>Id. </em>332 N.E.2d at 196. The court held that the defense of compulsion, as defined by Ill.Rev.Stat. Ch. 38, sec. 7-ll(a) (1973),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was not applicable. <em>Id. </em>332 N.E.2d at 196. The court further noted that, even assuming the presence of the alleged threat, Rodriquez\u2019s assertion of compulsion fails because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Kp\">if [the compulsion] actually existed, [it] arose only from the defendant\u2019s appropriation for his own use of the funds given to him by the prison officer. Had the defendant returned the money instead of squandering it or had he completed the illegal scheme as planned, no compulsion would have arisen. Thus the compulsion resulted from the defendant\u2019s own negligence or fault, and the statutory defense is therefore inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">A similar result was reached by the Colorado Court of Appeals in <em>People v. Bailey, </em>41 Colo.App. 385, 590 P.2d 508 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(1978). There the defendants were convicted of the sale of narcotics, dispensing dangerous drugs, and conspiracy to sell narcotic drugs. <em>Id. </em>590 P.2d at 509. The defendants claimed that the conduct of undercover CBI (Colorado Bureau of Investigation) agents, who posed as mafia gangsters and talked of eliminating \u201csnitches,\u201d constituted duress. <em>Id. </em>590 P.2d at 510. The court, citing Section 18-1-708 of the Colorado code (C.R.S.1973),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> held that the facts did not support a finding of duress. The court further noted that, in any case, the duress defense was not available because \u201cdefendants intentionally or recklessly placed themselves in a situation in which it was foreseeable that they might be subjected to force or threatened use of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>590 P.2d at 510. <em>See also State v. Kinslow, </em>165 Ariz. 503, 799 P.2d 844, 848 (1990) (noting that the duress defense was not available to a prison escapee because under Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 13-412(B) the duress defense is unavailable \u201cif the person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placed himself in a situation which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\n<em>B. Federal Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In <em>U.S. v. Liu, </em>960 F.2d 449 (5th Cir.1992), Liu, a government informant on illegal activity in the Houston, Texas, Asian community, was arrested for his involvement in a green card scam during a sting operation. <em>Id. </em>at 451. At trial, Liu claimed that he was acting out of fear of suffering injury or death at the hands of one of the police officers who initiated the sting operation. <em>Id. </em>at 452. The trial court, however, denied the instruction Liu submitted on the affirmative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>fense of duress. <em>Id. </em>at 453. Affirming, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the requested instruction did not conform to Fifth Circuit requirements for a successful duress defense and that even if the instruction was consistent with Fifth Circuit requirements, he was not entitled to the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 454-55. The Court explained that pursuant to <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>897 F.2d 1300, 1304-05 (5th Cir. 1990), the defendant must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">(1) that defendant was under an unlawful and \u2018present, imminent, and impending (threat) of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily injury.\u2019; (2) that defendant had not \u2018recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be (forced to choose the criminal conduct)\u2019; (3) that defendant had no \u2018reasonable legal alternative to violating the law; a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm\u2019, and (4) \u2018that a direct causal relationship may be reasonably anticipated between the (criminal) action taken and the avoidance of (threatened) harm.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The court also cited <em>U.S. v.

The Maryland General Assembly, however, has not enacted any such statute. Accordingly, we now examine cases that do not rely on a statutorily enacted duress defense. Specifically, we focus on whether the rule that disqualifies a defendant from raising the defense of duress if the actor recklessly or negligently placed herself in the situation from which it arose has been recognized in instances where the particular jurisdiction had not statutorily enacted the duress defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>People v. Merhige, </em>212 Mich. 601, 180 N.W. 418 (1920), three bank robbers had defendant Merhige, a public taxi driver, drive them to and from the bank they robbed. At trial, Merhige pled guilty and was convicted of bank robbery. On appeal, Merhige stated that the robbers were total strangers and that he was not aware of their intentions to rob a bank. He further asserted that throughout the robbery, he was afraid for his life and that the robbers forced him to acquiesce to their demands. In reversing Merhige\u2019s conviction the Supreme Court of Michigan cited the definition of the duress defense found in 16 Corpus Juris at 91:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARU\">An act which would otherwise constitute a crime may also be excused on the grounds that it was done under compulsion or duress. The compulsion which will excuse a criminal act, however, must be present, imminent, and impending, and of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done. A threat of future injury is not enough. Such compulsion must have arisen without the negligence or fault of the person who insists upon it as a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Id. </em>180 N.W. at 422. (emphasis added). In <em>People v. Kelly, </em>51 Mich.App. 28, 214 N.W.2d 334, 335 (1974) the Court of Appeals of Michigan relied on <em>Merhige </em>as the \u201ccorrect rule.\u201d In that case, the defendant, Kelly, was charged with armed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>robbery and found guilty by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>214 N.W.2d at 335. On appeal, Kelly alleged that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on the duress defense,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> taken directly from <em>Merhige, </em>constituted prejudicial error. <em>Id. </em>214 N.W.2d at 335. Concluding that <em>Merhige </em>\u201cstill is good law,\u201d the Court of Appeals of Michigan affirmed. <em>Id. </em>214 N.W.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In <em>State v. Patterson, </em>117 Or. 153, 241 P. 977 (1925), the defendant was convicted of larceny by embezzlement. On appeal, the defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury that no evidence existed to support the defense of duress. The Supreme Court of Oregon, citing 16 C.J. 91, affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction noting that the embezzlement \u201chad its origin in the defendant\u2019s own voluntary shortcoming. He himself was the controlling and indispensable factor in the matter. He himself began the digression from the path of rectitude. Without his act, the situation which he claims was compulsory would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>241 P. at 978. <em>See also, State v. Clay, </em>220 Iowa 1191, 264 N.W. 77, 83 (1935); <em>Ross v. State, </em>169 Ind. 388, 82 N.E. 781 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In addition to the case law mentioned above, we also note that the Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09 defines duress as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">(1) It is an affirmative defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(2) The defense provided by this Section is unavailable if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. The defense is also unavailable if he was negligent in placing himself in such a situation, whenever negligence suffices to establish culpability for the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09 (10 U.L.A.) (1974 &amp; Supp.1994). The Comments to Tentative Draft No. 10 indicate that the drafters recognized that \u201c[i]n the absence of governing legislation, the case law generally recognizes the defense but imposes limitations on its scope similar to those articulated in the statutes.\u201d (footnote omitted) ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960). The drafters then specifically noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">[sjubsection (2) accepts the view that there should be no exculpation if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. Though this provision may have the effect of sanctioning conviction of a crime of purpose when the actor\u2019s culpability was limited to recklessness, we think the substitution is permissible in view of the exceptional nature of the defense. The provision will have its main room for operation in the case of persons who connect themselves with criminal activities, in which case too fine a line need not be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 8. Additionally, the Explanatory Note to the Duress section of the Model Penal Code and Commentaries indicate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">[sjubsection (2) deprives the actor of his defense if he recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress. Thus, an actor reckless in this respect can be liable for offenses that carry a higher culpability standard than recklessness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">ALI, <em>Model Penal Code and Commentaries, </em>\u00a7 2.09 at 367 (1985). In 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 52 (C.E. Torc\u00eda, 15th ed. 1993), the author notes that \u201c[t]he defense of duress is not available if the defendant intentionally or recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was reasonably foreseeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that he would be subjected to coercion.\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>See also </em>1 Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 5.3 (1986) (noting that \u201c[t]he defense of duress ... is a common law defense, applicable in appropriate cases although no statute makes it so.\u201d); 22 CJS <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 52 (1989 &amp; Supp.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The reasoning of these cases and other authorities is persuasive and correctly states the law applicable in instances where the actor\u2019s contributory actions bar the availability of the defense of duress. These authorities make it clear that the defense of duress is founded in the common law and, as stated by the drafters of the Model Penal Code, does not provide \u201cexculpation if the actor recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be subjected to duress.\u201d ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960). Additionally, we note that many of the statutes enacting the defense of duress substantially adopt the Model Penal Code definition of duress. <em>See e.g., Knight, </em>611 A.2d at 1202-03 (quoting 18 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 309(b)); <em>Walker, </em>674 P.2d at 827 (quoting Alaska Stat. \u00a7 11.81.440(b)). As noted previously, the Maryland General Assembly has not codified the defense of duress. Based upon the authorities cited above, we hold that where an actor recklessly (as defined in \u00a7 2.02 of the Model Penal Code) places himself or herself in a situation where it is probable that he or she would be subjected to duress, the defense of duress is unavailable. In so holding we are particularly mindful of the Model Penal Code drafters\u2019 reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">though this provision may have the effect of sanctioning conviction of a crime of purpose when the actor\u2019s culpability was limited to recklessness, we think the substitution is permissible in view of the exceptional nature of the defense. The provision will have its main room for operation in the case of persons who connect themselves with criminal activities, in which case too fine a line need not be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN-\">ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.09 (Tentative Draft No. 10, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Because Williams\u2019s prior conduct contributed mightily to the predicament in which he later found himself, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>court did not err in concluding that the defense of duress was inapplicable to the instant case. Here, the evidence reveals that Williams voluntarily became involved with the Eubanks\u2019 drug organization. It is unrefuted that Williams borrowed money from Rodney Eubanks. Because of his inability to repay promptly, Williams allegedly was forced to make the first drug run up to New York. He also participated in another drug run. In other words, the evidence does not suggest that he was forced to make these runs, he did this of his own volition to help pay off his debt. By becoming involved with this drug ring, Williams through his own recklessness made others aware of his connection with Eubanks, including his abductors. Williams was readily identifiable to those in the organization, including his abductors, and the abductors acted accordingly. This was a situation that would not have occurred but for Williams\u2019s association with the drug organization. Considering these facts and the applicable law, we conclude that Williams\u2019s assertion that the defense of duress applies is unavailing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Attempted Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Appellant next asserts that because the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201cReverend Hale was completely innoc\u00e9nt\u201d means that \u201c[Hale\u2019s] apartment could not have been the stash house, and that [Williams] must have known this\u201d and further that \u201c[Williams] could not have entered the apartment with the intent to steal drugs and money from the apartment, because he knew they would not be there.\u201d We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In <em>Osborne v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 57, 60, 241 A.2d 171 (1967), Chief Judge Murphy (now Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals) explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">[rJobbery is larceny from the person, accompanied by violence or putting in fear. <em>Harrison v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 148 [152, 238 A.2d 153 (1968) ]. More specifically, to constitute robbery, the property must, as in larceny, be both taken and carried away, so that an asportation of the stolen property, as well as a trespass, would appear to be indispensable elements of the offense. To constitute an asportation, the robber, like the thief in larceny, must acquire complete control of the property at least for an instant, but the slightest asportation is sufficient to satisfy that element of the offense. <em>Clark and Marshall on Crimes </em>(6th Edition), \u00a7 12.12; <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>p. 275.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>See also McCord v.

State, </em>317 Md. 659, 667, 566 A.2d 111 (1989), the Court of Appeals explained that a criminal attempt is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap6\">governed by a \u2018substantial step\u2019 test, whereby a defendant will be found guilty of attempt only where the evidence demonstrates that he took \u2018substantial step[s] towards the commission of [a] crime whether or not his intention [to commit that crime] be accomplished ... [and] that no \u2018substantial step\u2019 will be found unless the conduct is \u2018strongly corroborative\u2019 of a criminal intention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">(quoting <em>Young v. State, </em>303 Md. 298, 311, 493 A.2d 352 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 280-81, 604 A.2d 489 (1992), the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c[a] <em>principal in the second degree </em>is one who is guilty of felony by reason of having aided, counseled, commanded or encouraged the commission thereof in his presence, either actual or constructive.\u201d (emphasis in the original) (quoting <em>State v. Ward, </em>284 Md. 189, 197, 396 A.2d 1041 (1978), <em>appeal after remand, </em>290 Md. 76, 427 A.2d 1008 (1981)). <em>See also Oates v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 180, 184, 627 A.2d 555 (1993). In the instant case, uncontro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>verted evidence established that Williams directed the other men to Hale\u2019s apartment. Hale testified that Williams helped the men in ransacking his apartment. In fact, the appellant\u2019s fingerprints were found on two drawers. Even if appellant did not intend to steal, he knew that the others did. He aided, counseled and encouraged them in their attempt to steal from Reverend Hale. As a principal in the second degree, he was guilty as charged.
