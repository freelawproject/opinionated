Scheck appeals from an order of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County requiring him to comply with a subpoena duces tecum issued by the Maryland Securities Commissioner (the Commissioner).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner believed that appellant\u2019s business activities possibly violated the Maryland Securities Act (the Act), Maryland Code (1975, 1993 Repl.Vol., 1993 Cum.Supp.), Title 11 of the Corporations and Associations Article (CA), because it appeared that appellant was engaging in securities transactions without first registering with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The subject subpoena duces tecum was served on appellant by certified mail, return receipt requested. After appellant failed to respond, the Commissioner filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County seeking its enforcement. <em>See </em>CA \u00a7 ll-701(c)(l). The circuit court issued an order requiring appellant to show cause \u201con or before the 24th day of August 1993, why the Commissioner\u2019s order should not be granted,\u201d and ordering \u201cthat a hearing regarding this matter [will be held] on 1 September 1993 at 1:30 p.m.\u201d On August 27, four days before the show cause hearing and three days after the filing date ordered by the court, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>responded to the Commissioner\u2019s complaint and put the court \u201con notice\u201d that he would be unable to attend the show cause hearing and asked to be notified of another hearing date. Although the date was not changed, appellant failed to appear. Finding enforcement of the Commissioner\u2019s subpoena duces tecum to be \u201cappropriate and in the interest of protecting actual or prospective investors,\u201d the circuit court ordered appellant to produce the subpoenaed documents within two weeks of the date of the order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZz\">Appellant then noted this appeal, raising numerous questions which, because of appellant\u2019s failure to appear at the show cause hearing, have not been preserved for our review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Tretick v. Layman, </em>95 Md.App. 62, 73-76, 619 A.2d 201 (1993). As phrased by appellee, the sole issue before us is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APJ\">Whether the Circuit Court abused its discretion by ordering enforcement of the Subpoenas Duces Tecum directed by the Securities Commissioner to [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In <em>Banach v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 502, 356 A.2d 242 (1976), the Court of Appeals adopted the three part test for determining the validity of a subpoena duces tecum issued by an administrative agency first articulated in <em>Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, </em>327 U.S. 186, 208, 66 S.Ct. 494, 505, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946). In <em>Banach, </em>the Court of Appeals said that a reviewing court must determine \u201c[wjhether the inquiry is authorized by statute, the information sought is relevant to the inquiry, and the demand is not too indefinite or overbroad.\u201d <em>Banach, </em>277 Md. at 506, 356 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">CA \u00a7 ll-701(a) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In his discretion, the Commissioner may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(1) Make public or private investigations within or outside of this State as he considers necessary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(i) Determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate any provision of this title or any rule or order under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(ii) Aid in the enforcement of this title or in the prescribing of rules and forms under this title[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">CA \u00a7 ll-701(b) goes on to provide that \u201c[f]or the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under [the Act], the Commissioner or any officer designated by him may ... subpoena witnesses ... and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the Commissioner considers relevant or material to the inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The Act requires an agent or a broker-dealer involved in effecting transactions in securities for the account of others or for his own account, <em>see </em>CA \u00a7 ll-101(b), (c), or an investment adviser or investment adviser representative engaged in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities, or as to the advisability of investing, purchasing, or selling securities, <em>see </em>CA \u00a7 ll-101(f), (g), to be registered with the Commissioner. CA \u00a7\u00a7 11-401,11-405. In seeking enforcement of the subpoena duces tecum, the Commissioner\u2019s complaint states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>appellant and WJS Group, Ltd. were under investigation \u201cin connection with their solicitations of investment and merchant banking services, including \u2018fiduciary trading\u2019, \u2018private placements\u2019, and the offer and sale of securities, to members of the business community\u201d and that neither appellant nor WJS Group, Ltd. were registered with the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Thus, investigation of appellant\u2019s activities is authorized by CA \u00a7 11\u2014701(a)(l)(i); CA \u00a7 ll-701(b) authorizes the Commissioner, in conjunction with that investigation, to subpoena appellant\u2019s records concerning, among other things, appellant\u2019s securities-related activities, his representations to the public regarding his business, and his financial records. The subpoena, on its face, is not unduly burdensome or oppressive, and, as appellant failed to appear at the show cause hearing, he has presented no evidence showing that compliance with it would place an undue burden upon him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Equitable Trust Co. v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>287 Md. 80, 93-100, 411 A.2d 86 (1980). As the information subpoenaed is relevant to the Commissioner\u2019s investigation and the Commissioner\u2019s demands are not indefinite, unduly burdensome, or overbroad, the Commissioner has not exceeded his investigatory power. <em>Id. </em>at 91-93, 411 A.2d 86. In short, the circuit court did not err in ordering enforcement of the Commissioner\u2019s Subpoenas Duces Tecum.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">APPEAL OF WJS GROUP, LTD. DISMISSED; OTHERWISE, JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\">. An order to comply with a subpoena duces tecum was also issued to WJS Group, Ltd., for which appellant is the resident agent. WJS Group, Ltd. joined in this appeal; however, as an attorney has not entered an appearance on its behalf, we shall dismiss its appeal. See Maryland Rule 8-402(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. The order was dated September 1, 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">. Appellant asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">1. What is the TRUE reason APPELLEE is violating APPELLANTS\u2019 \"Right to Privacy\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">2. Why are APPELLANTS being denied \"Due Process of Law\u201d both by the APPELLEE and The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">3. Why are APPELLANTS being subject to APPELLEE\u2019S efforts with others to \"Conspiring Against the Rights of Citizens\u201d and being allowed to do so by The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-11\">4. Why are APPELLANTS being forced to be subject to \u201cDeprivation of Rights Under the Color of Law by both APPELLEE and The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">5. Why did APPELLEE make no effort to protect APPELLANT SCHECK from an Assault by a State Official to wit Richard A. SIMMONS, an employee of APPELLEE who is employed as an investigator for' the Securities Division, Office of the Attorney General of State of Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">6. Why is APPELLEE attempting to use Section 11-701 [Investigations and Subpoenas] of Maryland Securities Act, Title 11, Corporation and Associations Articles, Annotated Code of Maryland [1993 Repl. Vol] [the \"Act\u201d] as their legal authority to violate constitution Rights of APPELLANTS to wit the violations stated in Questions 1 through 5 and the \u201cRight of Against Self-Incrimination and being permitted to do so by The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\">. Of course, nothing prohibits appellant from appearing and pleading the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>CA \u00a711-701(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
