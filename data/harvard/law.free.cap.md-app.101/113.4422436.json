Southerly, filed a claim for benefits (\u201cClaim 733\u201d) in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>allegedly suffering a disabling occupational disease on January 1, 1988, resulting from occupational exposure to lead. At a hearing held on November 29, 1989, Southerly requested that the claim be dismissed. The Commission dismissed the claim on December 8, 1989, and, on February 22,1990, after the two year statute of limitations had run, Southerly filed another claim for benefits (\u201cClaim 949\u201d). After hearings, the Commission disallowed Claim 949, finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations and that estoppel was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Southerly then filed a motion for rehearing under Claim 949, which the Commission granted. Thereafter, the Commission treated Claim 949 as a motion to reinstate Claim 733, and rescinded and annulled its order of December 8, 1989. The Commission then ordered that appellees, Perfect Auto Radiator Co., Inc. (\u201cRadiator\u201d) and the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund (the court later determined that Transamerica Premier Insurance Co. (\u201cTransamerica\u201d) was the correct insurer), pay Southerly\u2019s medical bills. Appellees appealed that order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which granted their motion for summary judgment. Consequently, Southerly noted a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Southerly raises a single question, which we rephrase as follows: Does the Commission have the discretion to annul an order and reinstate a claim for benefits that was dismissed voluntarily by the claimant and not refiled within the applicable statute of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Southerly, a radiator repairman for Radiator, timely filed Claim 733 with the Commission for injuries to his head, body, and limbs. On February 8, 1988, Radiator filed its First Report of Injury, and the two year statute of limitations began to run. Southerly asserted in his claim that he had \u201cworked for years around lead materials [and] OSHA told me on [February 22, 1988 that] I had a high lead count.\u201d On November 29,1989, Southerly presented his claim at a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>before the Commission, \u201cat which time it was requested, on behalf of the claimant, that the above entitled claim be dismissed.\u201d The Commission dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">On February 26, 1990, Southerly filed Claim 949, alleging exposure to lead and listing the date of his disablement as January 17, 1990. Hearings were held before the Commission with respect to Claim 949 and, in an order dated December 7, 1990, the Commission dismissed the claim as time-barred, finding that the actual date of Southerly\u2019s disablement was January 1, 1988. Southerly thereafter filed a motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">At the hearing, the Commission made the following pertinent statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Procedurally this case is one of the more difficult ones that Pve ever been presented with. I\u2019m well aware of the fact that Mr. Southerly was represented by Mr. Goodman or someone from Mr. Goodman\u2019s office at the time of the first hearing before Commissioner Jefferson. It was proffered to me that there was certain information that was lacking at that time and Commissioner Jefferson in effect gave Claimant\u2019s counsel the option of dismissing the case or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">* * * * * Hs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">My order\u2014let me preface that. What I\u2019m trying to do is do justice, which is very difficult at times when you have procedural constraints. The claim was initially filed, was filed timely, and I know it was dismissed, withdrawn, whatever you want to call it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">It is my position that the Claimant had a compensable occupational disease and through some procedural problems that were initiated by a lack of evidence that claim was dismissed and a new claim was filed. I don\u2019t think it fair, equitable, that the Claimant be deprived of his right to compensation when a timely claim was in fact filed and I do not deem that dismissal or withdrawal of the claim to be fatal to the Claimant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>First of all, ... you talk about a claim being dismissed. There\u2019s nothing in this statute about dismissing or withdrawing claims or what its effect can be. There have been a couple of appellate decisions on that, and I don\u2019t remember the name of the case, but I\u2019m familiar with the cases. But this is not a court and we are not bound by strict procedural rules. And if a claim was filed and then withdrawn, dismissed, whatever words you want to use, other than by order of the Commission, I mean a Commission finding, not simply writing down on paper what the parties say, I am not going to use that procedural escape clause because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">The Claimant had a valid claim which was filed in a valid manner within the correct timeframe [sic], and through something that occurred you would like to take that right away from him and I don\u2019t want to do that. And I can use my discretionary powers to find that the second, quote, claim was in fact a petition to reopen the first claim, which is what I did. That is why I found the date of disablement to be the original date that was alleged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">* <em>% </em>;\u00a1\u00ed <em>'&lt;$, </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">And I am not bound to find a date of disablement as alleged by a party. I\u2019m free to find that date depending on the evidence that\u2019s presented to me. And as long as all parties had a right to be represented and had notice of that claim, because it\u2019s very\u2014it\u2019s not unusual in occupational disease cases to start a hearing, find out that there\u2019s a date of disablement different than what was originally alleged, and then to discover either it\u2019s a different employer or a different insurer with that other date of disablement to postpone the proceedings, implead those parties and then proceed when everybody is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">It would seem to me that if you want to get into procedures now that if the Court finds that my order of March 16th, 1992, is in error, and that the second claim was not a motion to reinstate the first, then that in effect reopens, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>reinstitutes that second claim and you have the defense of statute of limitations. But I\u2019m not going to decide that issue, because as far as I\u2019m concerned that issue doesn\u2019t exist, because it\u2019s conceded that the first claim was timely filed, and if I\u2019m right that the second claim is a motion to reinstate which was granted then the first claim was timely filed and there is no statute of limitations issue. So if you get me reversed it will have to be on the procedural aspect that the claim was\u2014that the second claim was not a motion to reinstate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The Commission issued an order rescinding and annulling its order dated December 8, 1989 and ordered that Southerly\u2019s employer and its insurer pay his medical bills in accordance with the Commission\u2019s Medical Fee Guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Radiator and Transamerica filed a motion for summary judgment in the circuit court, alleging that the Commission\u2019s broad discretionary powers do not permit the Commission to disregard the statute of limitations in order to revive a defunct claim. The court granted the motion and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">There has to be a factual finding, as Mr. Blondell alluded to in the other cases, by the Court that there was some occurrence, some incident, or some ruling which was a technicality and was not substantial to toll the statute of limitations, and that hasn\u2019t happened here. This is a clear, pure statute of limitations case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">The claimant, for whatever reason\u2014and, obviously, it\u2019s not Mr. Blondell\u2019s fault\u2014didn\u2019t file, didn\u2019t do it. He let the two years go by and he didn\u2019t refile. He didn\u2019t request reconsideration, reopening or whatever and for that reason the statute of limitations expired, and my understanding is that there is no power in any court to reinstate a claim after a statute of limitations has expired, barring some either legal or factual basis for tolling, and we don\u2019t have that here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">\u201cThe Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim filed under [the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>sation Act].\u201d McLLab. &amp; EmpLCode Ann. \u00a7 9-736(b)(l) (1991) (\u201c\u00a7 9-736\u201d). In addition, the Commission \u201cmay modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9-736(b)(2), except that \u201cthe Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9\u2014736(b)(3). Southerly argues that \u00a7 9-736 empowers the Commission to reinstate a claim that has been voluntarily dismissed and for which the statute of limitations has run.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Reading Art. 101, \u00a7 40 (the predecessor to \u00a7 9-736), as a harmonious whole, we concluded in <em>Judge v. R &amp; T Constr. Co., </em>68 Md.App. 57, 61, 509 A.2d 1236, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 433, 514 A.2d 1211 (1986), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKh\">[t]he Commission\u2019s power to \u201cmake such modifications or changes\u201d is with respect to its <em>\u201cformer findings or orders with respect thereto\u201d. </em>The Maryland Commission ... made no <em>findings </em>in its December 16, 1981, withdrawal order. That order was not one \u201cwith respect\u201d to any findings, because there were none. The Commission simply granted [the claimant\u2019s] request to withdraw his claim. Such an order is not subject to reopening under \u00a7 40(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The revisor\u2019s note to \u00a7 9-736 indicates that it was \u201cderived without substantive change from former Art. 101, \u00a7 40(b) through (d).\u201d In light of <em>Judge, </em>therefore, the Commission is without authority under \u00a7 9-736 to modify or change an order unless a prior award or finding has been made. The Commission\u2019s blanket power to make changes pursuant to \u00a7 9-736 \u201cpresupposes the existence of a prior award or some earlier decision on the merits of a claim.\u201d <em>Judge, </em>68 Md.App. at 62, 509 A.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In <em>Suber v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>73 Md.App. 715, 536 A.2d 142 (1988), we indicated that, to exercise its revisory powers under \u00a7 9-736, the Commission must have made findings with respect to the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">Because, \u201c[i]n a real sense, \u00a7 40(c) gives the Commission a revisionary power akin to that available to courts under Md.Ann.Code Courts article \u00a7 6-408, and Maryland Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>625 a. [present Rule 2-535], but without the thirty day limitation,\u201d it is clear that the Commission is not <em>\u201cirrevocably bound by its earlier findings.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">73 Md.App. at 720-21, 536 A.2d 142 <em>(quoting Vinci v. Allied Research Assocs., Inc., </em>51 Md.App. 517, 522, 444 A.2d 462 (1982) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)). Further, we noted in <em>S\u00faber </em>that \u00a7 9-736 \u201cauthorizes the Commission to reopen a case for the purpose of reconsidering <em>an issue already decided, </em>even in the absence of a change of facts or newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>73 Md.App. at 720, 536 A.2d 142 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Commission reinstated the claim because the parties conceded that the first claim was timely filed, and \u201cif ... the second claim is a motion to reinstate ... then the first claim was timely filed and there is no statute of limitations issue.\u201d Despite the Commission\u2019s laudable efforts to determine \u201cwhat\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d our decision in <em>Judge </em>makes clear that a claimant who voluntarily dismisses his claim without prejudice must refile that claim within the two year statute of limitations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">The point is that [Southerly] voluntarily dismissed the claim. When a lawsuit is so dismissed under Rule 2-506(a), the plaintiff, if he wishes to sue again, ordinarily does not move to \u201creopen\u201d or \u201crevive\u201d the former action. He or she files a new suit. If the voluntary dismissal is without prejudice ..., there is nothing to prevent him or her from doing so, <em>provided the statute of limitations has not run.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>Judge, </em>68 Md.App. at 63, 509 A.2d 1236 (emphasis added). Nothing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act empowers the Commission to reinstate or \u201creopen\u201d a claim that was voluntarily dismissed and has since expired under the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The Commission, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>attempted to administer the \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation law according to its letter and its spirit;\u201d however, it ignored \u00a7 9-711(a), which provides that \u201c[i]f a covered employee suffers a disablement ... as a result of an occupational disease, the covered employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ee ... shall file a claim with the Commission within 2 years ... after the date ... of disablement ... or ... when the covered employee ... had actual knowledge that the disablement was caused by the employment.\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 9-711(b) provides that the \u201cfailure to file a claim in accordance with [\u00a7 9-711(a)] bars a claim under [the] title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cUndoubtedly the Act is to be construed liberally in favor of injured employees and to effectuate its remedial purposes, but a liberal rule of construction does not mean that courts [and the Commission] are free to disregard the provisions comprising the Act.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. McDonald, </em>317 Md. 466, 472, 564 A.2d 797 (1989). In <em>McDonald, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the following rule of construction with respect to the statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201c[T]he general purpose of the applicable workmen\u2019s compensation act to compensate injured workers should not be used to interpret the limitations provision, because the very existence of a limitations provision in the act indicates that the legislature has deliberately compromised the general compensation purpose in the interests of the purposes served by a limitations provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>Id. (quoting </em>Kelley, <em>Statutes of Limitations in the Era of Compensation Limitations Provisions for Accidental Injury Claims, </em>1974 Wash.U.L.Q. 541, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Southerly does not allege that, after Claim 733 was dismissed on December 8, 1989, he was prevented from filing Claim 949 within the statutory period, <em>ie. </em>before January 1, 1990. Moreover, there is no indication that Southerly\u2019s request to dismiss Claim 733 was other than voluntary. Southerly fails to cite any provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act that allows the Commission to disregard the statute of limitations in order to allow an unknowing claimant to present an otherwise time-barred claim. \u201c[C]ourts are required to enforce the Statute of Limitations as adopted by the Legislature and have no authority to create an unauthorized exception merely on the ground that such an exception would be within the spirit or reason of the statute.\u201d <em>Young v. Mayne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>Realty Co., </em>48 Md.App. 662, 666, 429 A.2d 296 (1981). Similarly, the Commission must enforce the statute of limitations provided in \u00a7 9-711, and has no power to create an unauthorized exception simply because such an exception purportedly conforms with the spirit and reason of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We, therefore, affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
