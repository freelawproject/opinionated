That such arbitrary rule fixing the measure of damages for conversion of personal property is applicable to the case seems to be well settled by the decisions of this state. (See <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>54 Cal. 145; <em>Fromm </em>v. <em>Sierra Nevada S. M. Co., </em>61 Cal. 629; <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Paxton, </em>171 Cal. 493 [153 Pac. 957].)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In support of the judgment the court found that at 12:30 o\u2019clock P. M. on August 7, 1919, plaintiff was the owner of fifty shares of Mexican Pretroleum stock of the value of $9,050, which said shares were then in the possession of defendants; that on said day and at said time defendants wrongfully converted said shares of stock to their own use. Appellants\u2019 chief contention is that such findings are not supported by the evidence, for the reason that there is no evidence that plaintiff was the owner of the stock in question, or that the same was at any time in the possession of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It appears from the undisputed evidence that plaintiff in writing stipulated that the purchase of the stock ordered should be subject to the rules, regulations, and customs of the stock exchange where the order was executed; that the purchase was made on the New York stock exchange, the rules, regulations, and customs of which provided that such contracts were not to be consummated until the day following that of the purchase, at which time the transaction was to be closed by the seller delivering the stock upon payment therefor by the purchaser. In accordance with these rules and customs, defendants as agents of plaintiff, on August 7th, entered into the contract with Carlisle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Mellick &amp; Company, whereby the latter agreed that on August 8th they would deliver to defendants fifty shares of stock upon payment in cash therefor. Defendants, however, never paid for the stock, without which no title or right to possession was acquired. <em>(Hilmer </em>v. <em>Hills, </em>138 Cal. 134 [70 Pac. 1080].) No stock was ever delivered to them, without which the doctrine announced in <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Jaudon, </em>41 N. Y. 235, as to the rights of a pledgor of stock bought on margin, is inapplicable. The contract, clearly executory in its nature, was never executed, for the reason that defendants, as plaintiff\u2019s agents, whether rightfully or wrongfully, is immaterial, refused to consummate the deal made for their principal with Carlisle, Mellick &amp; Company, but instead, on the day of the purchase, sold to them a like number of shares of stock at $171 per share, the effect of which was by mutual consent to rescind and cancel the contract, in consideration of which defendants paid to Carlisle, Mellick &amp; Company the difference in price of the stock as purchased and that at which it was sold. Obviously, if defendants acquired no title or right to possession of the stock, plaintiff could have, as against them, neither title nor right of possession, and hence he could not maintain an action for the conversion of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The agreement made by defendants with Carlisle, Mellick &amp; Company was an executory contract which, subject to the payment therefor, contemplated the delivery at a future time of the stock so agreed to be purchased. This payment was not made and the stock was never delivered, and hence, as defendants never acquired the stock or right thereto, they could not be guilty of its conversion. <em>(Cardinell </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>52 Cal. 476; <em>Yukon River etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Gratto, </em>136 Cal. 538 [69 Pac. 252]; <em>Clarkson </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>106 U. S. 505 [27 L. Ed. 139, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. 200, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes]; <em>Hilmer </em>v. <em>Hills, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Conrey, P. J., and James, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on February 20, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">All the Justices concurred, except Sloane, J., and Lennon, J., who were absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
