An action was commenced in the same trial court by the same plaintiff against the same defendant, judgment went for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed. The judgment was affirmed. <em>(Sime </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>50 Cal. App. 629 [195 Pac. 935].) The statute governing the allowance of costs on appeal is section 1027 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section, as amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>by Stats. 1919, page 73, provides as follows: \u201c The prevailing party on appeal shall be entitled to his costs excepting when judgment is modified, and in that event the matter of costs is within the discretion of the appellate court. The party entitled to costs, or to whom costs are awarded, may recover all amounts actually paid out by him in connection with said appeal, and the preparation of the record for the appeal, including the costs of printing briefs; provided, however, that no amount shall be allowed as costs of printing briefs in excess of one hundred dollars to any one party. The appellate court may reduce costs in case of the insertion of unnecessary matter in the record.\u201d Claiming to act under said section, the plaintiff did, after the <em>remittitur </em>had gone down, prepare, serve, and file a Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements for items as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">\u201cPaid Miss Sena Jensen for copy of transcript</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">on appeal, 189 folios @ lie...............$ 20.79</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">Paid Salinas Daily Index for printing brief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">on appeal, 81 pages @ $1.80 per page____ 145.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">Paid expressage on briefs...............45</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Paid expenses to San Francisco and return to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">argue case on appeal..................... 20.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">Paid King City Herald for printing reply to petition for hearing in the Supreme Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">after d\u00e9cision by District Court of Appeal. 23.40</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">Total............$210.44\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">The defendant moved the trial court to retax the costs . and the trial court made an order taxing the costs as follows, \u201cto-wit: Strike out all items set forth in plaintiff\u2019s memorandum of costs and disbursements, excepting $100 for printing brief on appeal,\u201d and from that order the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">As to when a transcript of the reporter\u2019s notes may be taxed as costs, the matter is' covered by section 274 of the Code of Civil Procedure: \u201c . . . The fees for transcripts and copies ordered by the parties must be paid by the party ordering the same.\u201d If that passage has been repealed, it has been repealed by implication.  But repeals by implication are not favored and the \u2018repugnancy between the statute claimed to be repealed and the repealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>statute must be clear and the two statutes must be so inconsistent that force and effect cannot be given to both. <em>(People ex rel. Wood </em>v. <em>Sands, </em>102 Cal. 12 [36 Pac. 404].)  But sections 274 and 1027 are not so inconsistent but what full force and effect can be given to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The trial court allowed the appellant $100 for printing briefs. That was the full amount to which he was entitled for that item. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1027, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The traveling expenses of an attorney are disbursements of his and not of his client. Such is certainly the rule as to trial work. Appellant has not called to our attention any statute which shows that such a rule obtains as to trial work and which shows that a different rule obtains as to appellate work. As to work on appeal, it is true that the statute refers to \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201call amounts actually paid out.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., see. 1027.) But as to trial work the language of the statute is equally broad when it uses the words, \u201cthe items of his costs and necessary disbursements.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1033.) However, throughout the sixty-seven years section 1033 of the Code of Civil Procedure (sec. 510, Practice Act) has been On the books, the settled practice has been not to include as costs the personal expenses of the attorney of the party prevailing. It must ever be borne in mind that costs were not recoverable at common law. He who would claim costs must put his finger on a statute which awards the same. The measure of the statute is the measure of the right. \u201cIn England it seems that statutes relating to costs were considered penal in their nature and were to be strictly construed and, with scarcely an exception, this is the rule generally adopted in this country where the question has been raised and considered by the courts.\u201d (15 Corpus Juris, p. 24, sec. 9.) And, in this case, if it be said that the traveling expenses were \u201cactually paid out by him in connection with said appeal,\u201d the answer is that the expenses were paid out by the attorney and not by \u201chim\u201d (the party to the appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We have thus considered every item which the trial court disallowed except \u201cExpressage on briefs, forty-five cents.\u201d As to that item affecting this appeal, it may be said, \u201cThe law disregards trifles,\u201d (Civ. Code, sec. 3533; <em>Connell </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Harron, Richard &amp; McCone, </em>7 Cal. App. 745, 747 [95 Pac. 916].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Nourse, J., and Langdon, P. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on January 9, 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
