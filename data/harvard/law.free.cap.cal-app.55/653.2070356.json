J.</author>\n<p id=\"APgM\">The only ground presented for reversal is that the findings \u201care insufficient to sustain the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-17\">The complaint contains three allegations: 1. That the defendant had received a certain sum of money \u201cto and for the use of the plaintiff.\u201d 2. That plaintiff had made demand for the same. 3. That the defendant had not paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the money to the plaintiff. The answer denied the first allegation and, by failure to deny, admitted the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The appellant quotes the finding attacked as follows: \u201cThat all the allegations set forth in plaintiff\u2019s complaint are not true,\u201d and argues that this is not a finding that <em>\u201cno one </em>of the allegations of the complaint is true, but the finding is as to all collectively; that <em>all </em>are not true.\u201d The respondent has failed to file a brief or argue the question raised .by the appeal. Appellant, however, has fallen into error in quoting the finding. The finding contained in the transcript is as follows: \u201cThat each and all the allegations set forth in plaintiff\u2019s complaint are not true\u201d; then follows the finding \u201cthat all the allegations contained in defendant\u2019s answer are true.\u201d In <em>McLennan </em>v. Wilcox, 126 Cal. 52 [58 Pac. 306], the finding claimed to be insufficient was as follows: \u201cThat each of the averments of the answer are not true.\u201d The court held the finding to be sufficient. While the use of the word \u201cuntrue\u201d would have been more appropriate than the words \u201cnot true,\u201d the' criticism of the finding of which complaint is made is somewhat hypercritical, and under the authority of the case cited the finding must be held sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Hart, J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
