It is sufficient to say that the testimony of the injured party shows that the appellant, while using and exhibiting a knife, and while threatening to kill him, robbed him of a purse containing $96.27. There was testimony corroborating the injured party. The defensive theory \u2014 shown primarily by the testimony of the appellant, with some corroborative circumstances \u2014 was that he and the injured party had engaged in shooting craps, as a result of which he lost something over $9.00 to the injured party. The appellant discovered that the dice were crooked. He asserted that what he did on the occasion was for the purpose of regaining his money which the injured party had obtained from him by the use of the crooked dice, which money was placed in the purse with the other money.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Upon cross-examination, appellant admitted that, in 1935, he was indicted for the offense of murder, and that said murder charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The issues arising under the facts were pertinently submitted by the trial court in his charge and in such a manner that no exceptions or objections thereto were reserved by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">It was within the province of the jury to determine the disputed issues of fact and to accept the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses. The verdict of the jury finds support in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The sole question here presented relates to the argument of State\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">By bill of exception, as qualified by the trial court, it is made to appear that, in his opening argument to the jury, State\u2019s counsel used the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">\u201cWhy, gentlemen, the man you are sitting in judgment upon ' has the blood of his fellowman upon his hands; You cannot believe what he says about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Counsel for appellant objected to this argument as being prejudicial and because there was nothing in the record showing that appellant had committed, or had been guilty of, murder, as inferred from the remarks of State\u2019s counsel. Upon said objection being made, State\u2019s counsel replied:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cThe defendant has been charged with, murder and you (meaning the jury) can consider this in passing upon his (meaning the defendant\u2019s) credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The objection to the argument was sustained and the jury instructed not to consider the phrase \u201cblood of his fellowman upon his hands\u201d for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Appellant insists that, in the light of the facts and the punishment assessed, the argument was of such a prejudicial character that the harmful effect was not overcome by the instruction given, and that reversible error was reflected thereby. It was within the province of the State to make proof of the fact that appellant had been charged with the offense of murder, for the purpose of affecting his credibility as a witness. In the court\u2019s charge, such testimony was expressly limited to the jury\u2019s consideration for that purpose only. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s unchallenged assertion that the murder charge was dismissed, it is his contention that the argument complained of not only called the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that he had been charged with the offense of murder but that the use of the phrase \u201cblood of his fellowman upon his hands\u201d had the effect of telling the jury that he was in fact guilty of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">State\u2019s counsel had the right to argue to the jury the effect of the testimony touching the charge of murder for the purpose for which it was introduced, and as limited before the jury in the court\u2019s charge, i. e. as affecting appellant\u2019s credibility as a witness in his own behalf. That the argument complained of was for that purpose and was applicable only thereto is made manifest by the phrase: \u201cYou cannot believe what he says about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">It is apparent, therefore, that what was said by State\u2019s counsel was within the realm of legitimate argument \u2014 especially in view of the fact that the only feature thereof that was even remotely objectionable was promptly withdrawn from the jury\u2019s consideration by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>To say that one \u201chas the blood of his fellowman upon his hands\u201d does not necessarily impute or charge that he is guilty of the crime of murder. One may take the life of his fellowman and be entirely justified therefor, or excused from criminal liability; in which event, he would, nevertheless, have \u201cthe blood of his fellowman upon his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In testing whether argument of State\u2019s counsel constitutes reversible error, the controlling rule, as stated in Vineyard v. State, 257 S. W. 548, 96 Tex. Cr. R. 401, is:</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cWe think the only safe rule to be that this court should not hold an argument to be reversible error unless it is in extreme cases where the language complained of is manifestly improper, and prejudicial, or where a mandatory provision of the statute is violated, or some new and harmful fact injected into the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">See also: Heidle v. State, 86 S. W. (2d) 641, 129 Tex. Cr. R. 201. Giving effect to such rule here, in the light of the record as a whole, and the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury, we are constrained to hold that reversible error is not reflected by the argument complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">In support of his contention, appellant cites the cases of Jarrott v. State, 257 S. W. 256, 96 Tex. Cr. R. 239, and McClure v. State, 272 S. W. 157, 100 Tex. Cr. R. 545. These authorities are deemed not controlling here, for, in each case, it appears that other errors were pointed out sufficient to require a reversal of the case. There was nothing to show that the reversal was predicated, alone, upon the objectionable argument. Moreover, the argument there made and complained of shows that State\u2019s counsel was making use of the prior convictions of the accused for the purpose of determining guilt or as affecting the punishment, which was a use thereof not authorized to be made. As we have endeavored to point out, such is not true of the argument here complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">From what has been said, it follows that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
