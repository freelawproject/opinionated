One ground specifically pointed out the failure of the County Attorney to sign his name to the jurat attached to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>plaint. We note in the record a motion properly presented to the court for permission to amend the complaint in this respect, and inasmuch as the complaint in the record carries the name of the County Attorney as the officer before whom the affidavit was made, it will be presumed that the motion was granted. At least, the record fails to indicate the error pointed out in Section 4 of the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The other grounds set out are in general terms and we are . not able to understand just what counsel had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The complaint and information appear to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
