We are at some loss to get appellant\u2019s viewpoint that the evidence is insufficient. It was admitted that Lubbock County was a dry area, and an inspector for the Liquor Control Board testified that he bought a pint of whisky from appellant and paid him three dollars for it.

B. Fowler v. State, No. 22,130, this day decided. (Page 382 of this volume.) For the reasons stated in the opinion overruling the motion for rehearing in that case, the appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing in the present instance is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
