The motion to quash should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The provisions of Art. 827a, Sec. 3, P. C., under which this prosecution was had, make it unlawful to operate, upon the public highways of this State, vehicles of size or weight exceeding certain limitations. The limitations appear in said Article and govern the width, length and height of the vehicles. The term \u201coversized,\u201d as used in the information, is not known to, and does not appear in, the statute. Whether such term has reference to width, length or height of the vehicle is not suscep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tibie of ascertainment. Such fact demonstrates the vague and indefinite allegations upon which the State relied and obtained this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">An accused is entitled to know, from the State\u2019s pleading, the nature of the accusation against him and wherein he is alleged to have violated the law. Parker v. State, 114 S. W. (2d) 906, 134 Tex. Cr. R. 138; Gutierrez v. State, 68 S. W. (2d) 198, 125 Tex. Cr. R. 283; Ex parte Vasquez, 56 S. W. (2d) 190, 122 Tex. Cr. R. 475; Monroe v. State, 157 S. W.
