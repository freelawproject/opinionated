Quite a number of Brown\u2019s hogs were missed and it is uncertain just the exact date the particular \u2022 hogs here in question were taken. They were recovered by the owner on July 22, 1941. Mr. Cone was under the impression that these particular four hogs were taken some time prior to said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Appellant\u2019s confession was introduced in evidence. He stated therein that Brown\u2019s hogs were running out and about 20 or 30 of them came over on the place where he lived and that he decided he would pen and sell some of them; that he closed four of them up in his corn crib and later sold them to Mose Hill. The hogs were recovered from Hill by Mr. Cone. He positively identified one of the hogs so recovered, and the others were sufficiently identified by the circumstances proven. The sale of the hogs to Hill by appellant was shown by the testimony of Hill and also by the testimony of an accomplice witness, Haywood Duffy, who hauled the hogs for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Appellant did not testify. By his wife\u2019s evidence he raised the issue that the hogs were taken up by appellant because they were depredating on his property, and that he had no intent to steal them when he took possession of them. This issue was submitted to the jury in a special charge requested by appellant. No such claim was made by appellant in his confession, and the issue'was decided by the jury in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Bill of exception number two recites that before the confession was introduced that appellant proved by a deputy sheriff who brought appellant to the county attorney\u2019s office where he made the confession that said, deputy told appellant if he would make a confession of the whole matter it would be easier on him. Appellant objected to the introduction of the confession on the ground that it was not free and voluntary because of the claimed statement of the deputy sheriff. The court approves the bill with the statement that he does not remember the officer testifying to any such statement as shown in the bill. No objection to this qualification was raised by ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>pellant. As the bill so appears there is no certificate that the statement complained of was made. The subject was pursued no further. There is no claim made by appellant that he was; induced to make the confession by reason of the alleged statement of the officer. We call attention to the following cases as bearing on the question, even if the bill had certified that the statement was made by the officer. Cannada v. State, 29 Tex. Cr. R. 537, 16 S. W. 341; Smith v. State, 91 Tex. Cr. R. 15, 237 S. W. 265 and cases therein cited; Stewart v. State, 124 Tex. Cr. R. 632, 64 S. W. (2d) 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Appellant\u2019s brief deals with the claimed insufficiency of the evidence. We are not in accord with such contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">A number of bills of exception are brought forward, none of which is briefed. However, we have examined all of them, and think none presents error, and do not call for discussion save the one already adverted, to.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b605-9\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Appellant, in his motion for. rehearing, for the first time, insists that the evidence fails to affirmatively show that the hogs were taken without the consent of the owner, and that, therefore, it is insufficient to support the conviction. The proof shows that the hogs belonged to Brown and that Archie Cone was the special owner, he having the care, control and custody thereof. Such allegation of ownership in Cone was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Cone testified.as a witness in behalf of the State. He repeatedly referred to his having \u201cmissed the hogs,\u201d and to the hogs that \u201cwe lost,\u201d but did not, directly or positively* say that the hogs were taken without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">We recognize the rule, as stated in Holmes v. State, 120 S. W. (2d) 595, 136 Tex. Cr. R. 26, and authorities there cited, to be: Where the owner of alleged stolen property testifies in the case, he must, by positive and direct testimony, state that the property was taken without his consent, and, unless he does so testify his lack of consent will not be inferred from other circumstances in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>But, the rule is not applicable or controlling here; for, in appellant\u2019s confession, offered in evidence by the State, he not only admitted the theft of the hogs, and the subsequent sale of them to Hill, but stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201cI knew that the hogs belonged, to Mr. Brown and that I didn\u2019t have any right to sell them and I didn\u2019t have permission to sell the hogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">it_ _ _ _ _____ _ _ _ _ _ _____ _ \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have permission from Mr. Brown or anyone else to take the hogs and sell ' them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Declarations in a confession constitute direct and positive, rather than circumstantial, evidence. Burk v. State, 95 S. W. 1064, 50 Tex. Cr. R. 185; 18 Tex. Jur., Sec. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Eliminating from consideration the testimony of Cone, we find that the State, by the confession of appellant, and by the testimony of the accomplice and the purchaser of the hogs from the appellant, showed, by direct and positive testimony, not only all of the constituent elements of the crime of hog theft, including the taking without the consent of the owner, but also appellant\u2019s guilty connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
