It is sufficient say that appellant killed deceased by cutting and stabbing him with a small knife, which, from the State\u2019s standpoint, was unprovoked and unjustified. According* to the appellant\u2019s version, it was a killing in self-defense from the actual attack of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The issues of fact arising were pertinently submitted to the jury and in such a manner that no exceptions or objections were reserved to the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">By bill of exception, complaint is made of the overruling of appellant\u2019s second application for a continuance. The trial court\u2019s qualification to the bill of exception calls attention to the fact that the application was defective in that two statutory requisites for a valid motion for a continuance are omitted therefrom, viz.: the application fails to state that the witness was not absent by the procurement or consent of the defendant, and that the application was not made for delay. A motion for a continuance, to be valid, must, among other things, so state. Art. 543, C. C. P.; Clarich v. State, 137 Tex. Cr. R. 282, 129 S. W. (2d) 291; Mayes v. State, 118 Tex. Cr. R. 612, 42 S. W. (2d) 65; Woods v. State, 115 Tex. Cr. R. 373, 28 S. W. (2d) 554; Allen v. State, 141 Tex. Cr. R. 94, 146 S. W. (2d) 384; White v. State, 131 Tex. Cr. R. 69, 95 S. W. (2d) 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The remaining bills of exception relate to argument of State\u2019s counsel. The argument complained of violated no statutory or mandatory rule; nor does it appear therefrom that it was manifestly improper or harmful to the appellant. In the light of such fact, reversible error is not shown. Vineyard v. State, 257 S. W. 548, 96 Tex. Cr. R. 401; Heidle v. State, 86 S. W. (2d) 641, 129 Tex. Cr. R. 201; Newchurch v. State, 121 S. W. (2d) 998, 135 Tex. Cr. R. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\">It was within the province of the jury to determine the disputed issues of fact. The State\u2019s testimony was sufficient to authorize its conclusion of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b333-7\">KRUEGER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Appellant has filed a motion for a rehearing in which he reasserts the same questions which were presented on the original submission of the case. These questions were fully discussed in the original opinion. However, we have again reviewed the record in the light of appellant\u2019s motion but remain of the opinion that the case was properly disposed of originally. Therefore, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
