App. Dec.-, it was recommitted to the trial justice so that he might set forth the specific facts found as the basis of the general finding for the defendant. In the original case, he ruled on requests for rulings of law with the qualification that these requests were \u201cinapplicable to the facts found\u201d but failed to state what were the facts found. Rule #30 requires that the facts be set forth when the trial justice qualifies his ruling with the statement \u201cinapplicable to the facts found\u201d in order that it may be determined whether or not the court found the basic facts to sustain the decision reached. The case was therefore recommitted to the trial justice to correct what was assumed to be an oversight.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">In compliance with the order of recommittal, the trial justice filed a \u201cSupplementary Report\u201d which upon examination indicates that he reached his decision for the defendant by misconstruing G.L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cIf hospital care is furnished to a person in need of public assistance by any person not liable by law for his support, the town wherein he resides at the time his hospitalization begins shall be liable for the expense of such care necessarily incurred under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In his \u201cSupplementary Report\u201d the trial justice states \u201cOne of the vital questions to be determined by the court in this case at bar is a question of domicile or settlement, in order for the plaintiff to recover or to prevail against the defendant.\u201d G.L. c. 117, \u00a7 24A specifically applies to residence and not to domicile or settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is manifest that the trial justice may have confused the question of <em>domicile </em>and <em>settlement </em>and since, moreover, he has not complied with the order of recommital to him of the original case, it would serve no purpose to recommit the cause again, but we feel that, in the interest of justice, there should be a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Finding for the defendant vacated. New trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Albert Tierney, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">of Boston for the plaintiff</p>\n<p id=\"AmR\">John W.

The patient was a resident of the municipality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">2. The hospital was not a person liable for the patient\u2019s support by law or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">3. The care and treatment was furnished by the hospital to the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">4. The care and treatment given was necessarily incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">5. The patient was a person in need or appeared reasonably to be in need of public assistance throughout his stay in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">6. The rate for such all inclusive care and treatment was duly established under G-.L. c. 7, #30K by the Commissioner of Administration and duly filed by him with the Secretary of State under G.L. c. 30A, #5 and c. 30. <em>Mass Gen.
