Since the adoption of the City School Law, defendant no longer is nor can it be treated as a department of the City of Binghamton within the intendment of the resolution of 1896, nor is it entitled to the benefits of said resolution. <em>(Matter of Hotel Assn. of N. Y. City </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>2 A D 2d 957, 3 N Y 2d 206.) II. Section 49 of chapter 762 of the Laws of 1950 does not give defendant the right to the benefits of the Common Council Resolution of 1896. <em>(Beveridge </em>v. <em>New York El. R. R.

Y. 140.) III. The decision of the Appellate Division constitutes an interpretation of the City School Law which not only creates confusion in the law but results in an impairment of the obligation of contract in violation of section 10 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. <em>(Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel.

Under the statute creating the city school district, defendant succeeds to all contracts entered into and undertaken by the city prior to July 1, 1951, including the contract with plaintiff. <em>(Gunnison </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City of N.

The practical interpretation by the parties during the life of the franchise from its inception in 1896 to January, 1953, confirms the rights of defendant to the continued benefits of it. <em>(Bohl </em>v. <em>City of Schenectady, </em>128 Misc. 863; <em>Dermott </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>99 N.

To deny defendant of its benefits under the franchise is an impairment of the obligations of contract in violation of section 10 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. V. No conflict exists with opinions of the Comptroller.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b343-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">The plaintiff telephone company seeks a judgment declaring that the defendants \u2014 the City School District of the City of Binghamton and the Board of Education of the City School District\u2014are no longer entitled to telephone service at the reduced rates which they had previously been charged. The Appellate Division, which heard the case in the first instance on submitted facts (see CPLR 3222 [formerly Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 546]), granted judgment for the defendants dismissing the complaint and the appeal is here by our permission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In 1896, one of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, the New York and Pennsylvania Telephone and Telegraph Company, agreed to provide \u201c Departments \u201d of the City of Binghamton with telephone service at half rates in return for the right to construct <em>\u201c </em>subways \u201d for communications equipment under the city\u2019s streets. Defendant Board of Education, as a city <em>\u201c </em>department \u201d, received such service without question until 1953, when the plaintiff gave notice of its intention to discontinue granting reduced rates to the school system. It is contended that the defendant is no longer a \u201c city department\u201d and, hence, can derive no benefits from the 1896 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Up to 1951, although the Board of Education was vested with the authority to expend public funds for educational purposes, the city actually levied the taxes and made the necessary appropriations. However, in 1951, pursuant to the new City School' Law (L. 1950, ch. 762, as amd.; L. 1950, chs. 763, 764), a fiscally autonomous school district was created for the City of Binghamton and the Board of Education, acting independently of the city, thereafter levied the taxes required to run the city\u2019s schools. Title to real and personal property used for educational purposes was vested in the City School District instead of in the city and the Legislature additionally provided that the school district was to \u2018 \u2018 succeed to and assume all contracts, condemnation proceedings or other proceedings * * * for educational purposes entered into or undertaken by the city prior to such date * * * it being the intention that the city school district be substituted in the place and stead of such city in all actions, contracts or other matters, growing out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>or relating to the possession, ownership, operation, extension and management of schools in such city school district \u201d (L. 1950, ch. 762, \u00a7 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Within the sense of the agreement under consideration, the defendant is certainly no more and no less a city department than it was before the new statute was enacted; this status did not change just because the city ceased collecting school taxes. Prior to 1951, the city was nothing more than a \" custodian and depository of school funds\u201d which were actually \u201cunder the care, control and administration of the board of education\u201d. <em>(Gunnison </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>176 N. Y. 11, 17.) Even at that time, the boards of education were \u201c not subject to or controlled by the city authorities * * * [but were] clothed with authority to act independently \u201d of them. <em>(Matter of Fuhrmann </em>v. Graves, 235 N. Y. 77, 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">It follows, therefore, that, if the Board of Education was previously a \u201c city department \u201d entitled to discounted telephone service, the defendant is likewise a \u201c city department \u201d entitled to the same privileges. And this conclusion is confirmed by the provisions of section 49 of chapter 762 of the Laws of 1950, pursuant to which the defendant succeeded to all the rights and obligations under the contracts which the city had previously entered into for educational purposes. Since telephone service <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at reduced rates for the school system was part of the city\u2019s contract with the plaintiff,, this contract is among those to which the defendant \u201c succeeded \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument that education is not a \u201c city purpose \u201d must likewise fail. If education was, in effect, a \u201c city purpose \u201d between the years 1896 and 1951, it did not cease to be so simply because of a change in fiscal arrangements between the city and the Board of Education. Indeed, in <em>New York Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. </em>(270 N. Y. 111, 116), we held that a grant of discounted telephone service- to \u201c city departments \u201d was \u201c equivalent to providing half rates for ' city purposes.\u2019 \u201d Not only was the Board of Education regarded as a \u201c city department,\u201d but \u201c city purposes,\u201d we noted, quoting from <em>Board of Educ. of City of Rochester </em>v. <em>Van Zandt </em>(119 Misc. 124, 126, affd. 204 App. Div. 856, affd. 234 <em>N. </em>Y. 644), included \u201c ' educational as well as other state [and municipal] functions \u2019 \u201d (270 N. Y., at pp. 116-117).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>We have considered the plaintiff\u2019s other contentions and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi and Keating concur; Judge Bergan taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. It having been stipulated that the two named defendants constitute a \u201c single body corporate \u201d, they are hereinafter referred to as a single <em>\u201c </em>defendant \u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
