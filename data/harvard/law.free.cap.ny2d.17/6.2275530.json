Appellant Tassa had complied with the provisions of section 10 of the Public Officers Law. <em>(Union Free School Dist. No. 3 </em>v. <em>Town of Rye, </em>280 N. Y. 469; <em>Matter of Perry </em>v. <em>Town of Cherry Val., </em>307 N. Y. 427; <em>Matter of Bradley, </em>141 N. Y. 527; <em>People ex rel. Walton </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>173 App. Div. 338, 221 N. Y. 503; <em>Matter of Foley, </em>8 Misc. 196.) II. If the provisions of section 25 of the Town Law supersede or are superior to the provisions of section 10 of the Public Officers Law and are mandatory, then they are unconstitutional. <em>(Duntley </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>42 Hun 229; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>12 Wend. 481; <em>People ex rel.

The apparent contradictions are resolved by a conclusion that the execution of an oath is mandatory, the time and place of filing directory. <em>(People ex rel. Lawton </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>216 N.

It was not, we think, the intention of the Legislature by the enactment and various amendments of the applicable statutes (Public Officers Law, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 30; Town Law, \u00a7 25) to set a trap for the unwary by confusing the proper office in which the qualifying oath of office of a town officer should be filed. Under the peculiar and unique statutory situation here presented, we consider that the filing within the time limited by section 30 (subd. 1, par. h) of the Public Officers Law of the oath of a town officer in either the County Clerk\u2019s office or the Town Clerk\u2019s office is sufficient. Appellants \u2019 oaths of office were taken on December 31, 1963 and January 2, 1964, before the Town Clerk who was authorized by law to take them and his signature to the jurat completed the necessary procedure in taking these oaths. They were in the possession of the Town Clerk at that time, and this, in law, was sufficient to constitute filing with him. That was enough in our judgment to qualify these elected officials of the Town of Frankfort. The subsequent delivery of possession of the oaths to the Supervisor, after their filing with the Town Clerk, was a mere irregularity which did not impair the title of appellants to their offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Keating concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
