Proposition 21 made significant changes in the law concerning gang-related crime. In this case, we decide whether Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(28) (section 1192.7(c)(28)), which adds to the list of serious felonies \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22,\u201d applies only to the substantive offense of active participation in a criminal street gang defined in section 186.22, subdivision (a) (section 186.22(a)), or whether it also applies to any felony offense committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, as defined in the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) (section 186.22(b)(1)) gang sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the definition of \u201cserious felony\u201d in section 1192.7(c)(28) also includes \u201cany felony offense\u201d that was committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22(b)(1). We reverse the judgment only insofar as the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had suffered a prior conviction for a serious felony and remanded the matter for resentencing. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">On Christmas Day, 2000, defendants Alberto Francisco Briceno and Evaristo Landin went on a crime spree in Orange County, robbing four people at gunpoint in four separate incidents. Defendant Briceno<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was convicted of four counts of robbery (\u00a7 211), and the jury found true the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>allegation that the robberies were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under section 186.22(b)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In a bifurcated trial held after the jury had reached its verdicts, the trial court found true allegations that defendant had suffered two prior convictions of serious felonies within the meaning of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and section 667, subdivision (a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One prior conviction\u2014for shooting at an occupied vehicle in violation of section 246\u2014was not challenged on appeal and is not at issue here. The other prior \u201cconviction\u201d was, in actuality, two convictions that occurred on the same day but were jointly alleged as one prior serious felony\u2014a conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon for the benefit of a criminal street gang (\u00a7\u00a7 12021, subd. (a), 186.22(b)(1)), and a conviction for carrying a concealed firearm while an active participant in, and for the benefit of, a criminal street gang (\u00a7\u00a7 12025, subd. (b)(3), 186.22(b)(1)). Defendant received an indeterminate sentence of 27 years to life, consecutive to a determinate term of 23 years and four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s prior convictions of section 12021, subdivision (a), and section 12025, subdivision (b)(3), constituted a prior conviction of a serious felony within the meaning of the Three Strikes law and section 667, subdivision (a)(1). Noting that section 12021, subdivision (a) and section 12025, subdivision (b)(3) are not listed as serious felonies in section 1192.7, subdivision (c), the Court of Appeal rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that the conviction was a serious felony because the sentence had been enhanced under section 186.22(b)(1), which applies to crimes committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The Attorney General had relied upon section 1192.7(c)(28), which adds to the list of serious felonies \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22.\u201d The Court of Appeal ruled that a conviction for a crime that is not listed as a serious felony that includes a gang enhancement under section 186.22(b)(1) is not a strike \u201c[b]ecause a criminal street gang enhancement . . . cannot be used to transform an . . . offense [not on the section 1192.7, subdivision (c) serious felony list] into a \u2018serious\u2019 felony.\u201d Equating the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d with \u201cfelony offense,\u201d the Court of Appeal reasoned that the section 1192.7(c)(28) phrase, \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony <em>violation </em>of Section 186.22\u201d (italics added), is limited to the one substantive felony <em>offense </em>contained in section 186.22, active participation in a criminal street gang in violation of section 186.22(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 186.22(b)(1), because it adds an additional term of imprisonment to the base term of the underlying felony, is a sentence enhancement and thus is not a \u201cfelony violation\u201d within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(28). We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Section 1192.7, subdivision (c) enumerates those felony violations that constitute serious felonies under California law. Where a defendant has been convicted of a serious felony, reoffending may result in severe consequences: certain prior serious felony convictions are strikes under the Three Strikes law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (d)(1), (h), 667.1, 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1170.125; Prop. 184, \u00a7 2), and all prior serious felony convictions subject a defendant to an additional five-year sentence enhancement if the current offense is a serious felony. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1) &amp; (4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The electorate, in passing Proposition 21, added several new felony violations to the list of serious felonies in section 1192.7, subdivision (c), including section 1192.7(c)(28), which makes \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22,\u201d a serious felony. As noted, the Court of Appeal held that this language limited the reach of section 1192.7(c)(28) to the substantive felony offense of active participation in a criminal street gang, in violation of section 186.22(a). The Attorney General maintains that section 1192.7(c)(28) includes any felony offense not enumerated in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) where the offense is committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>for the benefit of a criminal street gang, within the meaning of the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">This is the court\u2019s third opportunity to interpret gang-related provisions enacted by Proposition 21. In <em>Robert L. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 894 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 69 P.3d 951] <em>(Robert L), </em>we held that section 186.22, subdivision (d)\u2014an alternate penalty provision that applies to a person convicted of a gang-related \u201cpublic offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor\u201d\u2014applies to all misdemeanors and is not limited to so-called wobblers, which are offenses that are punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony.  In <em>Montes v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 350 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 621, 73 P.3d 489] <em>(Montes), </em>we held that section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5), an alternate penalty provision that applies to any gang-related \u201cfelony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life,\u201d applies only to those offenses in which the underlying felony itself, excluding enhancements, carries a life sentence.  Here, we interpret the phrase in section 1192.7(c)(28), \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22.\u201d For the reasons stated below, we conclude that section 1192.7(c)(28) includes within its ambit any felony offense committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u201cIn interpreting a voter initiative ... we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. [Citation.] Thus, \u2018we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent]. [Citation.] When the language is ambiguous, \u2018we refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].) In other words, \u201cour primary purpose is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the voters who passed the initiative measure.\u201d <em>(In re Littlefield </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 122, 130 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 248, 851 P.2d 42].)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Turning to the language of section 1192.7(c)(28) itself, our first task is to determine whether the phrase, \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22,\u201d has an ordinary meaning to the electorate. At first blush, this language appears susceptible of two interpretations, one narrow and one broader. The term \u201cfelony violation\u201d as used in section 1192.7(c)(28) could refer only to substantive felony offenses, as held by the Court of Appeal, in which case section 1192.7(c)(28) would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>necessarily limited to the one substantive offense contained in section 186.22\u2014the section 186.22(a) substantive felony offense of active participation in a criminal street gang.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">However, the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d could also be read to include sentence enhancements, as the Attorney General argues, in which case section 1192.7(c)(28) would apply to \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of section 186.22,\u201d namely, a felony violation of any felony offense that includes the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement. Because it is arguable that the ordinary language of section 1192.7(c)(28) is not clear on its face, the next step is to determine the meaning of the phrase, \u201cany felony offense, which would also constitute a felony violation of section 186.22,\u201d in light of Proposition 21 as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 16 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843], we stated: \u201cStatutory language should not be interpreted in isolation, but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts.\u201d Viewing Proposition 21 as a whole, we conclude that the term \u201cviolation\u201d in section 1192.7(c) (28) includes sentence enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The most compelling evidence that the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d as used in section 1192.7(c) (28) includes a sentence enhancement under section 186.22(b)(1) is that the list of serious felonies in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) itself contains a provision in which the term \u201cviolation\u201d specifically references a sentence enhancement. Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(40), enacted by Proposition 21, adds to the list of serious felonies \u201cany violation of Section 12022.53.\u201d Section 12022.53 is a sentence enhancement scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>that applies to persons who use firearms.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 12022.53 uses the term \u201cenhancement\u201d throughout. For example, section 12022.53, subdivision (e)(1) provides that the \u201c[t]he enhancements provided in this section shall apply to any person who is a principal in the commission of an offense,\u201d where certain facts are pled and proved. Section 12022.53, subdivision (Z) provides that \u201c[t]he enhancements specified in this section shall not apply to the lawful use or discharge of a firearm by a public officer ... or by any person in lawful self-defense . . . .\u201d This court has defined section 12022.53 as a sentence enhancement on several occasions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Oates </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1048, 1052 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 325, 88 P.3d 56]; <em>People v. Garcia </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1170 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 464, 52 P.3d 648].) \u201cWhen a word or phrase is repeated in a statute, it is normally presumed to have the same meaning throughout.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCart </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 344 [185 Cal.Rptr. 284, 649 P.2d 926].) The fact that section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(40) uses the term \u201cviolation\u201d to refer to a sentence enhancement that constitutes a serious felony strongly supports the conclusion that the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d as used in section 1192.7(c)(28) also includes a sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Not only does the list of serious felonies in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) itself contain a provision that refers to a violation as including an enhancement, another felony reenacted by Proposition 21, Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b)(21), specifically refers to the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d as encompassing the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement. Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b)(21) establishes a presumption that a 16-or 17-year-old minor is \u201cnot a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under juvenile court law\u201d where he or she is charged with \u201c[a]ny violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 of the Penal Code, <em>which would also constitute a felony violation of subdivision (b) of Section 186.22 of the Penal Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) \u201cWhere a voter initiative contains a provision that is identical to a provision previously enacted by the Legislature, in the absence of an indication of a contrary intent, we infer that the voters intended the provision to have the same meaning as the provision drafted by the Legislature.\u201d <em>(Montes, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at pp. 355-356.) The phrase in Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b)(21), \u201cwhich would also constitute a felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>violation,\u201d is <em>identical </em>to its counterpart in section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(28), and its meaning is clear: the Legislature, and now the voters, intended that the term \u201cfelony violation\u201d in Proposition 21 include the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In <em>Robert L, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th 894, we held that a <em>misdemeanor </em>offense committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang could be punished as a felony under section 186.22, subdivision (d). Thus, the section 1192.7(c)(28) phrase, \u201cfelony violation of Section 186.22,\u201d simply distinguishes crimes that are felonies <em>regardless </em>of section 186.22 from crimes that are initially misdemeanors, but become felonies <em>by virtue of </em>section 186.22. As stated in <em>People v. Arroyas </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 380] <em>(Arroyas), </em>a \u201cmisdemeanor, converted to a felony by [section 186.22,] subdivision (d) [is not also] subject to the felony enhancement provided in [section 186.22,] subdivision (b)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Our conclusion is consistent with the voters\u2019 intent to dramatically increase the penalties for all gang-related felony offenses. In the Findings and Declarations section of Proposition 21, \u201cThe people [found] and declare[d]\u201d that: \u201cCriminal street gangs and gang-related violence pose a significant threat to public safety and the health of many of our communities. Criminal street gangs have become more violent, bolder, and better organized in recent years.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (b), p. 119 (hereafter, Ballot Pamphlet).) <em>\u201cGang-related crimes </em>pose a unique threat to the public because of gang members\u2019 organization and solidarity. <em>Gang-related felonies </em>should result in severe penalties.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (h), p. 119, italics added.) \u201cDramatic changes are needed in the way we treat . . . criminal street gangs ... if we are to avoid the predicted, unprecedented surge in . . . gang violence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (k), p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Nothing in the above quoted language suggests that the voters intended to limit section 1192.7(c)(28) to the 186.22, subdivision (a) substantive felony offense of active participation in a criminal street gang. Instead, consistent with their intent to punish <em>all </em>gang-related felony offenses more severely, section 1192.7(c)(28) broadly covers <em>\u201cany </em>felony offense [that] violates] Section 186.22.\u201d (Italics added.) By referring to section 186.22 generally, section 1192.7(c)(28) demonstrates the voters\u2019 intent also to encompass subdivision (b) of section 186.22, which defines gang-enhanced felonies. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 143 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129] [\u201cthe electorate and the Legislature have both shown that they know how to use language expressly requiring a violation of [a specific Penal Code section] when that is their intent\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Defendant argues, however, that if section 1192.7(c)(28) defines a \u201cserious felony\u201d as any felony conviction that includes a gang enhancement under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>section 186.22(b)(1), there would be no need for Proposition 21 to have enacted section 667.5, subdivision (c)(19), which adds to the list of violent felonies \u201c[e]xtortion, as defined in Section 518, which would constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22 of the Penal Code,\u201d and section 667.5, subdivision (c)(20), \u201c[t]hreats to victims or witnesses, as defined in Section 136.1, which would constitute a felony violation of Section 186.22 of the Penal Code,\u201d because the two subdivisions would be surplusage. To the contrary, the enactment of these two subdivisions furthers the argument that any felony offense that includes a gang enhancement under section 186.22(b)(1) is a serious felony as defined by section 1192.7(c)(28).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Specifically, extortion (\u00a7518) is a felony offense that becomes a <em>violent </em>felony when it is committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under the section 186.22(b)(1) gang enhancement. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(19).) Making threats to victims or witnesses (\u00a7 136.1) is a <em>serious </em>felony (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(37)) that becomes a <em>violent </em>felony when it is committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under the section 186.22(b)(1) gang enhancement. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(20).) Section 1192.7(c)(28), on the other hand, turns <em>any </em>felony offense that includes a gang enhancement under section 186.22(b)(1) into a <em>serious </em>felony. Thus, contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, each of the above subdivisions has a different effect; there is no overlap among these provisions, which were all enacted by Proposition 21, suggesting that the voters thoughtfully enacted a comprehensive penalty and punishment scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Finally, turning any felony offense into a serious felony by virtue of conduct that would invoke a sentence enhancement is not uncommon in section 1192.7, subdivision (c). Section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> makes any felony not otherwise enumerated in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) a serious felony if the defendant personally uses a firearm or personally inflicts great bodily injury,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> makes any felony not otherwise enumerated in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) a serious felony if the defendant personally uses a dangerous or deadly weapon.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456, 464 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890] [under \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(23), \u201ca defendant who \u2018personally uses a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 in the commission of a felony [is] classified as a \u2018serious\u2019 felon and [is] subject to an additional five-year enhancement [under \u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)] if he has previously been convicted of a serious felony\u201d].) We conclude, therefore, that the voters intended section 1192.7(c)(28) to define \u201cserious felony\u201d as including any felony offense that is committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang under the section 186.22(b)(1) gang sentence enhancement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In so holding, we disagree with the Court of Appeal that this interpretation of subdivision (c)(28) is derailed by the language of section 186.22(b)(1)(B) and (C). The Court of Appeal was apparently concerned that if section 1192.7(c)(28) made <em>all </em>gang-related felonies serious felonies, a defendant convicted of a gang-related felony would never be punished under section 186.22(b)(1)(A), the sentence enhancement that applies where the defendant is convicted of a felony that is gang related, but would always be subject to the sentence enhancement for a serious felony that is gang related under section 186.22(b)(1)(B), rendering section 186.22(b)(1)(A) surplusage. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">When Proposition 21 added section 1192.7(c)(28), it also amended section 186.22(b)(1) by adding the substantive language contained in (b)(1)(A), (B), and (C). (Ballot Pamp., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 4, p. 119.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 186.22(b)(1)(A) provides that a person convicted of \u201ca felony\u201d that is gang related shall receive, at the court\u2019s discretion, an additional two-, three-, or four-year term at sentencing. Section 186.22(b)(1)(B) provides that a person convicted of \u201ca serious felony\u201d that is gang related shall receive an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>additional five-year term at sentencing. Section 186.22(b)(1)(C) provides that a person convicted of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d that is gang related shall receive an additional 10-year term at sentencing. Thus, section 186.22(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C) speaks to an event that occurs in the current proceeding. Section 1192.7, subdivision (c), on the other hand, comes into play only if the defendant reoffends, at which time any <em>prior </em>felony that is gang related is deemed a serious felony. Thus, any felony that is gang related is not treated as a serious felony in the current proceeding, giving effect to section 186.22(b)(1)(A). (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rizo, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 685, 687 [as with statutes, courts are to give meaning to every word of an initiative if possible, and should avoid a construction making any word surplusage].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Not only does this interpretation give meaning to section 186.22(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C), it also avoids the impermissible bootstrapping that would occur if any felony that is gang related is also deemed serious in the current proceeding. Specifically, while it is proper to define any felony committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang as a serious felony under section 1192.7(c)(28), it is improper to use the <em>same </em>gang-related conduct <em>again </em>to obtain an additional five-year sentence under section 186.22(b)(1)(B). As stated by the Court of Appeal in <em>Arroyas, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th 1439, in reference to whether a gang-related misdemeanor punished as a felony under section 186.22, subdivision (d) could further be enhanced under the section 186.22(b)(1) gang enhancement, \u201cAlthough [section 186.22,] subdivision (d) allows the court to impose felony punishment for a misdemeanor committed with a gang-related purpose, nothing in the statute or in its stated purposes suggests an intention of the people of this state to bootstrap [section 186.22,] subdivision (d) misdemeanors into [section 186.22,] subdivision (b)(1) felonies as a means of applying a double dose of harsher punishment.\u201d <em>(Arroyas, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 1445; see also <em>Robert L, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 907, fn. 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Similarly, although section 1192.7(c)(28) turns any prior gang-related felony offense into a strike if a defendant reoffends, nothing in Proposition 21 or in its stated purposes suggests an intention of the voters to bootstrap, in the same proceeding, any felony offense committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang into a section 186.22(b)(1)(B) offense \u201cas a means of applying a double dose of harsher punishment.\u201d <em>(Arroyas, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 1445.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be reversed only insofar as the Court of Appeal reversed the trial court\u2019s prior serious felony finding, vacated the sentence, and remanded for resentencing.
