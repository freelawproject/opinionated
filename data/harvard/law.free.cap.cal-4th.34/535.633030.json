Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 664, subd. (a) (section 664(a)) constituted a penalty provision to which double jeopardy protections do not apply. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 652, 656-657 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 732, 909 P.2d 1354] <em>(Bright).) </em>Several years later, in a case not involving double jeopardy, the United States Supreme Court concluded that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases punishment beyond the prescribed statutory maximum \u201cis the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d <em>(Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 494, fn. 19 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi).)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">In light of <em>Apprendi </em>and related cases, we must decide whether double jeopardy protections preclude a retrial of the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) after an appellate finding of evidentiary insufficiency. For reasons that follow, we conclude that the federal double jeopardy clause (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) bars retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">This background is largely drawn from the Court of Appeal\u2019s unpublished opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">On May 1, 1999, around 11:00 p.m., John Park and three friends, Nathan Yoshizaki, Leland Fong, and Eric Shing, went out for dinner. Yoshizaki drove the group to a restaurant and parked his car in the parking lot. Defendant William Harlow Seel and a female companion, Shanda Bustamante, left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>restaurant and got into defendant\u2019s car. As defendant drove out of the parking lot, Park, who was standing in front of the restaurant, heard gunfire, dropped to the ground, and took cover on the right side of Yoshizaki\u2019s car. Park and his friends had exchanged no words or gestures with defendant or Bustamante. However, Park had glanced over at defendant\u2019s car more than once because he \u201cheard the exhaust.\u201d Yoshizaki\u2019s car had a bullet hole near the left headlight and the bumper. That was \u201cessentially . . . exactly where [Park] walked past\u201d as he was going toward the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">At trial, defendant testified that when he parked his car in the restaurant\u2019s lot, Park and his friends drove up and parked one space away from him. One or two of the men got out of their car, and defendant entered the restaurant to pick up Bustamante. The men started yelling, and defendant believed there was going to be trouble. As defendant and Bustamante left the restaurant and walked toward defendant\u2019s car, defendant and the other males looked at each other. Defendant became \u201cincreasingly fearful\u201d because of the way the four men were looking at him. He \u201cjust felt like something bad was going to happen.\u201d As defendant drove out of the parking lot and onto the street, he fired his gun \u201ctoward the air like above their car, around that area.\u201d He fired three rounds. He \u201cfelt kind of paranoid and stuff.\u201d He did not plan to shoot or kill Park and did not even know him. Defendant said he kept the gun in his car for protection. He also testified that he had smoked methamphetamine earlier that day and was not \u201cthinking clearly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">A jury convicted defendant of the attempted premeditated murder of Park (\u00a7\u00a7 664(a), 187, subd. (a)) and found that he personally and intentionally discharged a firearm. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (c).) The trial court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, plus 20 years for the section 12022.53, subdivision (c), allegation. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Among other things, defendant argued that there was no substantial evidence of premeditation or deliberation. The Court of Appeal agreed. It concluded, \u201cThe finding of premeditation and deliberation, therefore, must be reversed and the matter remanded for retrial on the penalty allegation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bright </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 652, 671 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 732, 909 P.2d 1354].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for review, limited to the issue whether the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) may be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">As relevant here, section 664(a) provides that a defendant convicted of attempted murder is subject to a sentence of life with the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>parole if the jury finds that the attempted murder was \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, as defined in section 189.\u201d (\u00a7 664(a); see <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 665.) Unless the jury finds this premeditation allegation to be true, a defendant convicted of attempted murder is subject to a determinate sentence of five, seven, or nine years. (\u00a7 664(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Defendant here argues that the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that the evidence was insufficient to support the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) constituted an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, thus barring retrial. (See <em>Burks v. United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1 [57 L.Ed.2d 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141] <em>(Burks).) </em>However, in <em>Bright </em>we held that section 664(a) is a penalty provision to which double jeopardy protections do not apply. <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 671.) Also, the high court, in affirming our decision in <em>People v. Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] (lead opn. of Chin, J.) <em>(Monge I), </em>held that the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial of a prior conviction allegation after an appellate finding of evidentiary insufficiency. <em>(Monge </em>v. <em>California </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 721, 734 [141 L.Ed.2d 615, 118 S.Ct. 2246] <em>(Monge II).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Defendant seeks support in <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, a sentence enhancement case not involving double jeopardy. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the high court held: \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 490.) With respect to these constitutional protections at least, the high court made clear that \u201c[mjerely using the label \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019 \u201d does not preclude treating the enhancement as an element of an offense. <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The question here is, does <em>Apprendi </em>affect our holding in <em>BrightI </em>Does section 664(a), though designated a penalty provision <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 669), constitute an element of an offense for double jeopardy purposes? (See <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 19.) For reasons that follow, we conclude it does. Because the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) effectively placed defendant in jeopardy for an \u201coffense\u201d greater than attempted murder <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 19; see <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at pp. 728-729), the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding of evidentiary insufficiency bars retrial of the allegation under the federal double jeopardy clause. <em>(Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 16; U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">A. <em>Double jeopardy protections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>guarantee that a person may not be placed twice \u201cin jeopardy\u201d for the \u201csame offense.\u201d (See <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 660.) \u201cThe double jeopardy bar protects against a second prosecution for the same offense following an acquittal or conviction, and also protects against multiple punishment for the same offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In addition, because greater and lesser included offenses constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes <em>(ibid.), </em>\u201ca conviction of a lesser included offense bars subsequent prosecution of the greater offense. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">As noted above, the same protections generally do not extend to noncapital sentencing proceedings, or at least not to those involving prior conviction allegations. <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at pp. 728, 730; <em>Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 826; but see <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 835 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 968 P.2d 465] (Hernandez:) [hearing on an enhancement is not a court trial].) For purposes of double jeopardy, the high court recognized in <em>Monge II </em>that an appellate finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction was \u201ccomparable to an acquittal\u201d and thus barred a second trial. <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729, citing <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 16.) However, it also concluded that \u201c[w]here a similar failure of proof occurs in a sentencing proceeding ... the analogy is inapt.\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729; see also <em>People v. Barragan </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 236, 241 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 76, 83 P.3d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In reaching this conclusion, the high court emphasized that sentencing determinations \u201cdo not place a defendant in jeopardy for an \u2018offense,\u2019 [citation]. Nor have sentence enhancements been construed as additional punishment for the previous offense; rather, they act to increase a sentence \u2018because of the manner in which [the defendant] committed the crime of conviction.\u2019 [Citations.] An enhanced sentence imposed on a persistent offender thus \u2018is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes\u2019 but as \u2018a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 728; but see <em>id. </em>at pp. 737-741 (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.) [arguing recidivism enhancement constitutes an element of the offense].) \u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause \u2018does not provide the defendant with the right to know at any specific moment in time what the exact limit of his punishment will turn out to be.\u2019 [Citation.] Consequently, it is a \u2018well-established part of our constitutional jurisprudence\u2019 that the guarantee against double jeopardy neither prevents the prosecution from seeking review of a sentence nor restricts the length of a sentence imposed upon retrial after a defendant\u2019s successful appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">As discussed above, in 1996 we. held that the double jeopardy prohibition did not bar retrial of an allegation that an attempted murder was \u201cwillful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>deliberate, and premeditated\u201d under section 664(a). <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 671; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 671-683 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.); <em>id. </em>at pp. 683-693 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) In arguing that double jeopardy protections bar retrial on the section 664(a) allegation in his case, defendant here contends that <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 652, is distinguishable and that <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. 1, controls. He also maintains that <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, is relevant here, even though it did not involve double jeopardy principles, because the penalty of life imprisonment prescribed by section 664(a) increased his sentence beyond the statutory maximum. We discuss these cases below.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">B. <em>Bright</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Bright, </em>a jury convicted the defendant of attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 189, 664), but was unable to make a finding on the separate allegation of premeditation. <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 658.) The trial court declared a mistrial as to the premeditation allegation and set the matter for retrial on the allegation. After the court rejected his motion to dismiss the premeditation allegation based on evidentiary insufficiency, defendant Bright moved to dismiss on the ground that he already had been placed in jeopardy for the attempted premeditated murder charge. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 658-659.) He argued that the offense of attempted murder was divided into first and second degrees. By alleging that the defendant \u201c \u2018did willfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly attempt to murder,\u2019 \u201d the information charged him with first degree attempted murder. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 659.) Because the jury found Bright guilty of attempted murder without specifying the degree, he argued he was guilty of second degree attempted murder, a lesser offense included within the offense of attempted premeditated murder. Thus, he asserted, double jeopardy principles prohibited retrial of the greater offense of attempted premeditated murder. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We rejected defendant Bright\u2019s underlying premise that attempted murder was divided into degrees. <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at pp. 665-669.) After reviewing the statutory language and legislative history of section 664(a), we concluded that for double jeopardy purposes, the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) constituted a penalty provision and not an element of the crime. <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 669.) \u201cThe jury does not decide the truth of the penalty allegation until it first has reached a verdict on the substantive offense charged. [Citation.] Accordingly, a defendant\u2019s conviction of the underlying substantive offense does not (on double jeopardy grounds) bar further proceedings, such as retrial, on a penalty allegation. [Citation.] Thus, the circumstance that the jury has returned a verdict on the underlying offense, but is unable to make a finding on the penalty allegation, does not constitute an \u2018acquittal\u2019 of (or otherwise bar retrial of) the penalty allegation on the ground of double jeopardy. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 661-662.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Defendant here maintains that <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 652, is distinguishable because in that case, the trial court declared a mistrial after the jury deadlocked on the section 664(a) penalty allegation. <em>(Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 31, 42 [72 L.Ed.2d 652, 102 S.Ct. 2211] <em>(Tibbs) </em>[\u201cA deadlocked jury . . . does not result in an acquittal barring retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d].) Here, the Court of Appeal concluded there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of premeditation and deliberation (\u00a7 664(a)), reversed the jury\u2019s finding, and remanded the matter for retrial on the penalty allegation. Relying on <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. 1, and related cases, defendant asserts that a reversal based on insufficient evidence is equivalent to an acquittal and thus precludes retrial of the penalty allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In <em>Burks, </em>the high court held that the double jeopardy clause precludes a second trial after a conviction is reversed based solely on insufficient evidence. <em>(Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 18.) Unlike a reversal for trial error, which \u201cdoes not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 15), a reversal based on evidentiary insufficiency \u201cmeans that the government\u2019s case was so lacking that it should not have even been submitted to the jury. Since we necessarily afford absolute finality to a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal\u2014no matter how erroneous its decision\u2014it is difficult to conceive how society has any greater interest in retrying a defendant when, on review, it is decided as a matter of law that the jury could not properly have returned a verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 16, italics omitted.) \u201cA reversal based on the insufficiency of the evidence has the same effect [as a judgment of acquittal] because it means that no rational factfinder could have voted to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>(Tibbs, supra, </em>457 U.S. at p. 41.) Recognizing that the standard for determining legal insufficiency is the same under federal and California law, we have held that the \u201c \u2018rule of <em>Burks </em>applies to trials conducted in our courts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Attorney General, however, maintains that double jeopardy protections under <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. 1, apply only to <em>offenses </em>and not to penalty allegations, like section 664(a) here: \u201cThe decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this Court have consistently recognized the clear distinctions between substantive offenses and penalty allegations and the discrete protections extended to those two different areas by the double jeopardy clause.\u201d The Attorney General argues that although the high court has extended the rights to a jury trial and to proof beyond a reasonable doubt to any sentence enhancement that increases the penalty beyond the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>maximum <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 490), the protections of the double jeopardy clause do not similarly extend to such sentence enhancements. In other words, the Attorney General argues the rationale of <em>Monge II, </em>and not that of <em>Apprendi, </em>controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In <em>Monge II, </em>the high court stated, \u201cSentencing decisions favorable to the defendant . . . cannot generally be analogized to an acquittal. . . . The pronouncement of sentence simply does not \u2018have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729.) As the Attorney General notes, the high court has consistently recognized that reconsideration of certain noncapital sentencing issues does not violate double jeopardy protections. <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 730; <em>Caspari </em>v. <em>Bohlen </em>(1994) 510 U.S. 383, 391 [127 L.Ed.2d 236, 114 S.Ct. 948] [\u201cit [is] well established that there is no double jeopardy bar to the use of prior convictions in sentencing a persistent offender\u201d].) Based on the foregoing, we disagree with defendant\u2019s characterization that \u201cnothing\u201d in <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. 721, refutes his claim that retrial of the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) is barred under <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Nonetheless, for reasons that follow, we disagree with the Attorney General that the rationale of <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, is irrelevant here, and conclude that under <em>Apprendi, </em>the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) is subject to the federal double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">C. <em>Apprendi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">As noted above, <em>Apprendi </em>held that except for prior convictions, \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 490.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe high court\u2019s reasoning was this: The federal Constitution requires the elements of a crime to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt <em>because they expose the defendant to</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>punishment, </em>likewise, the elements of a sentence enhancement must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt if there is exposure to <em>increased </em>punishment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sengpadychith, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 325.) The high court\u2019s authority in <em>Apprendi </em>dated from <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068]: \u201cSince <em>Winship, </em>we have made clear beyond peradventure that <em>Winship\u2019s </em>due process and associated jury protections extend, to some degree, \u2018to determinations that [go] not to a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, but simply to the length of his sentence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 484.)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Examining the differences between a \u201csentencing factor\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and an element of an offense <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494 &amp; fn. 19), the high court recognized the \u201cconstitutionally novel and elusive distinction between\u201d the two. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494, citing <em>McMillan, supra, 477 </em>U.S. at p. 86.) However, it emphasized that \u201cthe relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect\u2014 does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494.) \u201cThe degree of criminal culpability the legislature chooses to associate with particular, factually distinct conduct has significant implications both for a defendant\u2019s very liberty, and for the heightened stigma associated with an offense the legislature has selected as worthy of greater punishment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 495.) \u201c[W]hen the term \u2018sentence enhancement\u2019 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 494, fn. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The Attorney General maintains that any argument based on <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, \u201cwould be logical only if the jury trial and the standard of proof guarantees of the Sixth Amendment were designed to provide the same protections as the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d However, the high court has indicated that the principles underlying the double jeopardy clause on the one hand, and the reasonable doubt burden of proof and right to jury trial on the other, are not wholly distinct. <em>(Almendarez-Torres v.

[\u201cWe can think of no principled reason to distinguish, in this context, between what constitutes an offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury-trial guarantee and what constitutes an \u2018offence\u2019 for purposes of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d]; <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 738 (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the high court held that a recidivism statute that increased the maximum penalty from two to 20 years was a penalty provision and not a separate crime. <em>(Almendarez-Torres, supra, </em>523 U.S. at pp. 226, 235.) The court rejected defendant Almendarez-Torres\u2019s argument that it should \u201cadopt a rule that any significant increase in a statutory maximum sentence would trigger a constitutional \u2018elements\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219.) In doing so, the high court stated that it would <em>\u201cfind it difficult to reconcile any such rule </em>with our precedent holding that the sentencing-related circumstances of recidivism are not part of the definition of the offense for double jeopardy purposes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) Indeed, the high court recognized that some of its decisions, taken together, may stand \u201cfor the broad proposition that <em>sometimes </em>the Constitution does require (though sometimes it does not require) the State to treat a sentencing factor as an element.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 242.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The Attorney General also emphasizes that the protections outlined in <em>Apprendi </em>are designed to reduce the risk of convicting a defendant erroneously. (See <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 484.) The Attorney General maintains that double jeopardy protections, in contrast, are primarily to preclude successive prosecutions to the embarrassment and expense of the defendant. (See <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 850 (dis. opn. of Brown, J.) [\u201cthe double jeopardy clause preserves and protects interests distinct from ... the presumption of innocence and the right to jury trial\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s suggestion, the double jeopardy clause is also intended to reduce the risk that a defendant will be convicted in error. <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 732 [\u201cneed for reliability accords with one of the central concerns animating the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy\u201d].) \u201c[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause prevents States from \u2018mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, <em>as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found </em>guilty.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that <em>Apprendi </em>is relevant to determining whether a finding of evidentiary insufficiency <em>(Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 16) bars retrial of a premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">D. <em>Analysis under the </em>Apprendi <em>rationale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">If a trier of fact finds the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) true, a defendant\u2019s sentence for attempted murder increases from a determinate term of five, seven, or nine years to an indeterminate life term with the possibility of parole. (\u00a7 664(a).) By \u201cexposing] the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494), section 664(a) is \u201cthe functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>at p. 494, fn. 19.) Indeed, in contrast to a doubled sentence <em>(id. </em>at pp. 468-469; <em>Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 831), or even an 18-year addition to a two-year sentence <em>(Almendarez-Torres, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 226), the potential increase here is quite substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Significantly, unlike the sentence enhancements at issue in <em>Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 826, and <em>Almendarez-Torres, supra, </em>523 U.S. 224, section 664(a) does not involve a defendant\u2019s recidivism, which is \u201ca traditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencing court\u2019s increasing an offender\u2019s sentence. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Almendarez-Torres, supra, </em>523 U.S. at p. 243; see also <em>Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 488.) The high court has made clear that recidivism is different for constitutional purposes. (See, e.g., <em>Apprendi, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>530 U.S. at pp. 488, 490, 496; <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 728.) We have also made this difference clear. <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 838.) In rejecting the argument that a failure of proof on a prior conviction allegation was like an acquittal at the guilt phase of a criminal trial, we noted in <em>Monge I </em>that \u201ca prior conviction trial is simple and straightforward as compared to the guilt phase of a criminal trial. Often it involves only the presentation of a certified copy of the prior conviction along with the defendant\u2019s photograph and fingerprints. In many cases, defendants offer no evidence at all, and the outcome is relatively predictable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In contrast to a prior conviction allegation, a section 664(a) allegation requires the trier of fact to determine whether \u201cthe attempted murder was willful, deliberate, and premeditated\u201d before imposing the term of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s intent in committing a crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense \u2018element.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 493.) Applying the rationale of <em>Apprendi </em>to this case, we conclude that \u201c[wjhereas recidivism \u2018does not relate to the commission of the offense\u2019 itself, [citation], [section 664(a) \u2019s] inquiry goes precisely to what happened in the \u2018commission of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 496.) <em>Apprendi </em>compels the conclusion that section 664(a) constitutes an element of the offense. <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In arguing that the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial here, the Attorney General seeks support in <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 835. In <em>Hernandez, </em>we rejected the argument that <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. 721, was distinguishable because it dealt with a prior conviction allegation, and not an allegation that turned on the characterization of the present offense. <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 840, 842.) \u201cThe high court spoke categorically in <em>Monge, </em>concluding that the federal double jeopardy clause does not apply to noncapital sentencing determinations and making no distinction between sentencing retrials that turn on the facts of the present offense and sentencing retrials that turn on the truth of the prior conviction allegation. <em>(Monge, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. [724].)\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 840.) We also stated that if, on remand, \u201cthe Court of Appeal concludes that proof of specific intent is necessary [as an element of a serious felony under sections 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8), and 667, former subdivision (a)], the state and federal double jeopardy protections do not preclude retrial of that issue.\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">But <em>Hernandez </em>predated <em>Apprendi, </em>and it must be read in light of that decision. In <em>Hernandez, </em>we recognized that federal constitutional law may dictate that a sentence enhancement be treated as an element of an offense. We ultimately concluded, however, that in that case the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>conviction enhancement should not be treated as such. <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 840-842.) <em>Apprendi </em>now compels the conclusion that the premeditation allegation (\u00a7 664(a)) constitutes an element of an offense. (See <em>ante, </em>pp. 545-549.) As we have explained above, section 664(a) is not a typical sentencing determination, like a prior conviction allegation, to which double jeopardy protections do not apply. (See <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 842.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">As noted above, defendant argues that <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 652, is distinguishable. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 544.) Unlike the situation here, where the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment based on its determination of evidentiary insufficiency, the jury in <em>Bright </em>was \u201cunable to make a finding on the premeditation allegation.\u201d <em>(Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 658.) Neither a court nor a jury made a determination that the prosecution failed to prove its case. Significantly, \u201c[a] mistrial does not constitute a termination of jeopardy, and accordingly double jeopardy does not arise from the legal necessity of a mistrial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 662.) This difference in procedural postures distinguishes <em>Bright </em>from the case here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 117, 130-131 [66 L.Ed.2d 328, 101 S.Ct. 426] [federal double jeopardy clause bars retrial for evidentiary insufficiency but not for mistrial due to \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The Court of Appeal here found there was \u201cno evidence\u201d of defendant\u2019s deliberation or premeditation in his attempt to commit murder. Because the section 664(a) allegation effectively placed defendant in jeopardy for an \u201coffense\u201d <em>(Apprendi, supra, </em>530 U.S. at p. 494, fn. 19), the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination of evidentiary insufficiency bars retrial of the allegation under the federal double jeopardy clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; <em>Burks, supra, </em>437 U.S. at p. 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">III.

Bright </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 652 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 732, 909 P.2d 1354], a majority of this court held that a finding that an attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly was merely a penalty provision, not an element of a crime greater than attempted murder. I dissented, suggesting that the federal Constitution may well guarantee the right to a jury trial even if premeditation was \u201cmerely a circumstance affecting the penalty for attempted murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 692 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) I noted that such a premeditation finding \u201cwill expose the defendant to a penalty of life imprisonment, as compared with a maximum term of nine years for attempted murder without premeditation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, I said, it might \u201cwell be unconstitutional to deprive the defendant of a right to jury trial on the issue of premeditation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The correctness of that view has now been confirmed by the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], which in turn compels the result in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b589-6\">BROWN, J., Concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"Ace\">On more than one occasion, I have expressed the view that double jeopardy principles most likely extend to certain fact-bound sentencing enhancements. (See <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 835, 848-850 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 754, 968 P.2d 465] (dis. opn. of Brown, J.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 845-847 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] (conc. opn. of Brown, J.).) Even without the impetus of <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], it was only a matter of time until we confronted a circumstance where the Legislature has effectively recharacterized an element of a substantive crime, ostensibly removing it from the purview of the double jeopardy clause by labeling it a sentencing factor. (See <em>Monge v. California </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 721, 737-741 [141 L.Ed.2d 615, 118 S.Ct. 2246] (dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Because that circumstance is plainly here, I fully agree with the conclusion the rule of <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1 [57 L.Ed.2d 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141] extends to the Court of Appeal\u2019s finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish defendant\u2019s attempted murder was \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated\u201d under Penal Code section 664, subdivision (a). A simple factual change demonstrates the correctness of that determination: Had the victim died and defendant been convicted of first degree murder pursuant to Penal Code section 189, <em>Burks </em>would clearly preclude retrial of that charge if an appellate court found the same evidentiary deficiency. The difference is that with respect to attempted murder, the Legislature has\u2014arbitrarily, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>might argue\u2014designated the \u201cwillful, deliberate, and premeditated\u201d finding as the ultimate sentencing determinant, rather than\u2014as with actual murder \u2014as the preliminary determinant of the degree of the crime, which in turn sets the defendant\u2019s sentence. While Penal Code section 664, subdivision (a), may not be as stark an example of legislative overreaching as that hypothesized by Justice Scalia in his dissent in <em>Monge v. California, supra, </em>524 U.S. at page 738, the constitutional implications, both federal and state, are no less self-evident.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
