(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 190.2, subd. (a)(17), 12022.5, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the guilt verdict, defendant waived his right to a jury trial as to further proceedings. The court then found trae that defendant had suffered three prior serious felony convictions. (\u00a7 667, subd. (a).) After a penalty trial, the court found that death was the appropriate penalty, and it imposed that sentence. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>I. The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The victim, Sammy McCullough, was a marijuana dealer and fish farmer who lived in a geodesic dome house on East Mariposa Road, near the end of Clark Drive, in a rural area of Stockton. He was known to keep large amounts of cash at his home. Between 1988 and 1990, he told others that he had sometimes been burglarized. Telephone records showed that McCullough tried to call his friend and business partner Kevin Crowley around 7:00 p.m. on September 19, 1990. He was not heard from after that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">During the evening of September 20, 1990, Mark Lawson was fishing in a portion of the San Joaquin River Delta near Highway 4 called Bums Cut. He found in the water a bag containing a man\u2019s leg. He \u201cgot out of there pretty quick\u201d and called the police. Over the course of the next day or so, authorities found other body parts in the water at Burns Cut, including a bag containing two arms that were tied together at the wrists with duct tape, a torso wrapped in a bed sheet, and a head floating freely, with tape wrapped around it covering the eyes. A serrated knife that could have been used to dismember the body was found with the torso. Fingerprint comparison revealed that the body was McCullough\u2019s. McCullough\u2019s wallet, containing no money, was found in the pants on the torso. A .22-caliber bullet was found in McCullough\u2019s brain. An autopsy revealed that McCullough had been killed by a single gunshot wound to the forehead fired from close range, within two inches. The body had been dismembered after death.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">James Casto was camping at Bums Cut the evening of September 19, 1990. He saw a \u201cwhite, square-backed vehicle\u201d drive back and forth a \u201ccouple of times\u201d going \u201ckind of fast.\u201d The vehicle stopped a short distance away, and Casto \u201cheard something thrown out into the bushes and into the water down there.\u201d He told the sheriff\u2019s department the vehicle might have been a Toyota or a station wagon type of car. When shown photographs of McCullough\u2019s white Jeep Cherokee, Casto said the vehicle he saw had the \u201csame shape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">McCullough\u2019s Jeep Cherokee was found in Stockton on September 21, 1990. The mats in the back were moist and the vehicle was very clean. The Jeep contained checks in McCullough\u2019s name and car ownership documents. An expert testified that an unknown person other than McCullough had signed McCullough\u2019s name to some of the checks and car ownership documents. It appeared the person had tried to trace McCullough\u2019s signature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>One of the documents contained the date September 21, 1990. Defendant\u2019s thumbprints and fingerprints were found on two of the car ownership documents. No other usable fingerprints were found inside the Jeep. Some usable prints were found on the Jeep\u2019s exterior, but they did not belong to defendant or any of several others with whom they were compared.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">A search of McCullough\u2019s home revealed human blood in the bathroom. A piece of human tissue was found on the bathroom mirror. A set of knives with one missing was found in the kitchen. Bags and tape like those used to wrap and bind the body parts were found in the house. A .22-caliber bullet casing was found just outside the front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">On September 21, 1990, Vicki Pease and Shirley Sanders, both girlfriends of McCullough, and Crowley gathered at McCullough\u2019s house before the police arrived. They removed some items from the house, including legal papers and a Rolex watch. Pease later told Deputy Sheriff Armando Mayoya, the lead investigator in the case, what they had done. Pease also testified that various items were missing from the house, including McCullough\u2019s nine-millimeter handgun. She said the handgun \u201cnever left [McCullough\u2019s] side.\u201d She had seen it at McCullough\u2019s house as recently as September 18, 1990, the last time she was there. Sanders testified that McCullough accumulated spare change in a planter box in the house. The planter was \u201cheaping\u201d in change, so much so that Sanders had \u201cstarted another one in a coffee can.\u201d After McCullough\u2019s death, the coins were no longer there.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Cynthia Ann Cuevas, defendant\u2019s sister, testified that defendant had been trying to find a job the summer of 1990. She saw defendant and their brother, Steven Homing, on September 19, 1990. Her brothers were supposed to fix her car. However, they could not do so at that time because a necessary part was unavailable. Cuevas arranged with her brothers to return to fix the car on September 21, 1990, but they never did. The parties stipulated that, if called as witnesses, defendant\u2019s parents would testify that in September 1990, defendant lived in a trailer on their property at 2606 Munford in Stockton. Defendant had told them he needed money. He and Steven Homing left unexpectedly after the two had gone to fix Cuevas\u2019s car. Steven returned a few days later, but defendant never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Defendant had been released on parole from prison on June 16, 1990. His parole agent testified that she had had her last monthly contact with him on September 16, 1990, in his trailer on Munford. As of that time, he had been abiding with the conditions of his parole, although he did not have a full-time job. On October 10, 1990, the parole agent tried to contact defendant. Steven Homing told her that defendant was gone. Because of this, the parole agent listed him as a \u201cparolee at large,\u201d meaning that he had \u201cabsconded supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>The parties stipulated that, if called as a witness, Ray Van Vleet would testify that he was the sheriff of Caribou County, Idaho. On September 23, 1990, he received a report of an abandoned vehicle on a mountainside near Olsen Creek. He checked the vehicle. It was a 1976 Monte Carlo that Cuevas testified Steven Homing and defendant had driven. Shortly after he checked it, the vehicle was moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">John Sharp testified that he had a ranch in Freedom, Idaho, where he raised hay and grain. On October 20, 1990, he saw defendant coming out of the mountains. Defendant told him he was going to Henry\u2014which was about four miles away\u2014but then he offered to help Sharp work on the hay. Defendant said he had walked over the mountains and was staying \u201cup there on the hill.\u201d He said that \u201che\u2019d had trouble with his family, and he liked to go out and camp,\u201d and that \u201chis brother brought him up.\u201d When asked whether he had a tent, he said he had \u201ca canvas.\u201d He said he planned to stay there all winter. Sharp told him he could not \u201cstay there all winter. You\u2019ll freeze to death.\u201d He offered to let defendant stay in a cabin he owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Wade Carney testified that he worked in a country store in Wayan, Idaho, about seven to eight miles from Freedom. During the winter months of 1990, defendant came to his store about three or four times to buy groceries. Defendant paid with \u201cchange most of the time.\u201d He had a lot of money in change. Defendant explained that he had been saving his change to go deer hunting. Carney once picked up defendant\u2019s bag of coins; he estimated it weighed about 50 to 75 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">On October 26, 1990, Sheriff Van Vleet contacted defendant at an abandoned cabin near Soda Springs, Idaho. Defendant told him he had received permission from the owner to use the cabin and gave his name and other identifying information. Sheriff Van Vleet later ran a check on defendant. He learned that the birth date defendant gave him did not match, and that defendant had an outstanding warrant for parole violation. Sheriff Van Vleet returned to the cabin the next day, only to discover that defendant had left, leaving behind a note and a calendar. Handwriting comparison established that defendant had written items on the calendar. The note contained defendant\u2019s signature and three messages telling \u201cJohn\u201d (presumably John Sharp) to let himself in.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Defendant was arrested in Winslow, Arizona, on March 22, 1991, while committing a bank robbery. A nine-millimeter SIG Sauer handgun with the serial number U126340 was in his possession. Sales documents containing that serial number and trial witnesses established that Joseph Cutrufelli had purchased that gun and later gave it to Nicholas Montano. Montano testified that in 1988 he gave McCullough the gun he had received from Cutrufelli. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Vicki Pease positively identified that gun as the gun that McCullough had continually possessed and that she had seen in McCullough\u2019s house on September 18, 1990. She specifically recognized some scratches on the gun, which she accidentally had made. Shirley Sanders testified that the gun looked \u201cexactly like\u201d McCullough\u2019s gun. She had occasionally fired the gun herself near McCullough\u2019s bam. Six nine-millimeter casings were found in that area. Ballistics examination established that the gun found in defendant\u2019s possession had fired those casings. That gun did not fire the bullet found in McCullough\u2019s brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">The parties stipulated that, if called as a witness, defendant\u2019s father would testify that about a week before September 20, 1990, he saw defendant firing a .22-caliber rifle behind the trailer in which defendant lived on the family property on Munford in Stockton. Sheriff\u2019s deputies found a .22-caliber bullet, a wooden piece of a rifle stock, and a sawed-off Westerfield .22-caliber rifle barrel on that property. The wooden stock and the barrel could have been parts of the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Michael Giusto, a criminalist with the California Department of Justice, compared the bullet found in McCullough\u2019s brain and the .22-caliber casing found near McCullough\u2019s front door with the gun barrel and the .22-caliber bullet found on defendant\u2019s property. Because of various consistencies among them, Giusto opined that both bullets and the casing could have been fired from the same gun, and that the barrel could have been part of that gun; because of their condition he could not say for sure. Giusto testified that if the two bullets had been fired from separate weapons, he would not expect to see the matching characteristics because \u201ceach gun barrel has its own unique markings. And the bullets fired through these barrels would be marked accordingly.\u201d But he could not quantify the probability that the bullets were or were not fired from the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">Timothy Homing, another of defendant\u2019s brothers, testified that he had lived in the trailer on the family property on Munford until the end of August 1990. When he moved out, he left some clothes behind, including some black Nike shorts and a tank top that defendant sometimes wore. The shorts \u201clook like\u201d some shorts that were found inside one of the plastic bags taken from Bums Cut, and the tank top was similar to a tank top found in a bedroom of McCullough\u2019s house. Timothy testified that defendant grew up hunting and fishing, and he sometimes went fishing with defendant at Bums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Cut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant had experience with dismembering deer in a fashion similar to the way McCullough\u2019s body was dismembered. Sometimes the deer meat would be kept in garbage bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Willie Eoff, defendant\u2019s cousin, testified that in the summer of 1990, he twice drove defendant and Steven Homing to the end of Clark Drive in Stockton (i.e., near McCullough\u2019s house). Both times defendant and Steven left on foot, were gone about half an hour, and returned with some marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Deputy Mayoya interviewed defendant in Arizona after his arrest. He tape-recorded the interview secretly. After Deputy Mayoya explained his constitutional rights, defendant agreed to talk with him. He denied having killed McCullough. Deputy Mayoya asked where defendant had obtained the nine-millimeter handgun in his possession. Defendant said he had bought it for $400 at a McDonald\u2019s in Salt Lake City, Utah, when he was on his way to Idaho from California. He said he had left California the day after his parole officer had visited his home. He also said that he and Steven had arranged to fix his sister\u2019s car, but a part was not available. He said \u201cwe\u201d left Stockton, went to Las Vegas, then through Utah to Idaho. When Deputy Mayoya asked who \u201cwe\u201d referred to, defendant refused to say. Deputy Mayoya told him he had learned that defendant and Steven Homing had gone to Idaho. Defendant responded, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s what you learned from Steven then I\u2019m not going to contradict him.\u201d He also said that he had used the nine-millimeter gun to shoot a moose, after which he had \u201cquartered the moose.\u201d Defendant said that after Sheriff Van Vleet contacted him at the cabin, he thought the sheriff would return. So he went to a ridge in the area the next day and watched two sheriff\u2019s cars approach the cabin. He \u201cfigured they were going to come get him,\u201d so he \u201ctook off and went up into the mountains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Deputy Mayoya asked defendant about a 1988 robbery of McCullough that his brother Steven had been charged with. Defendant said Steven had not done it. When Deputy Mayoya told defendant that Steven had said that defendant did it, defendant responded \u201cthat if Steven said I did it, then I won\u2019t contradict him,\u201d but he also denied having done it. Defendant said that he had not possessed or touched a .22-caliber rifle since November 1988. He admitted firing a .38-caliber gun, but not a .22. He also denied ever having been to McCullough\u2019s house. Deputy Mayoya told defendant he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>believe him about the gun, that it was \u201cBS.\u201d Defendant responded to the effect, \u201cI know it is, but that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get ... . If you ask me three times or 30 times, the stor[y\u2019s] going to be the same.\u201d When Deputy Mayoya mentioned that the gun had belonged to the murder victim, defendant replied with something like, \u201c[0]h, gee, that\u2019s a coincidence, what a coincidence.\u201d When asked whether anyone would believe the gun was \u201cfound 1100 miles away at a McDonald\u2019s,\u201d defendant said, \u201cGod, what a coincidence.\u201d Defendant said he thought the odds against that happening were something like \u201ca zillion to one.\u201d When Deputy Mayoya told him he found it hard to believe, defendant responded, \u201c[H]e didn\u2019t believe it himself, but that\u2019s what he was going to stick to.\u201d Later, when Deputy Mayoya told defendant he did not believe him about finding the gun at McDonald\u2019s and about not having fired a .22-caliber gun, defendant said something to the effect, \u201c[Y]eah, I know I\u2019m lying, but that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Jan Biaruta testified that he spoke with defendant when the two were incarcerated together in Arizona in April 1992. Defendant said he was wanted for a killing in California, \u201cand he got caught in Arizona for bank robbery and he was glad that he did because he didn\u2019t have to face extradition.\u201d Defendant said the person he killed \u201cwas a drug dealer, that it was no big loss,\u201d and that he \u201chad it coming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Defendant presented the stipulated testimony of two witnesses. The parties stipulated that if called as a witness, Larry Hastings would testify as follows. He lived near Salt Lake City, Utah. He sold marijuana that he received from Gabriel Aguirre, a major supplier, to McCullough for, as McCullough told him, resale at a profit of two to three times what McCullough paid. Hastings estimated that McCullough bought over 5,000 pounds of marijuana over a period of a little more than a year. McCullough always paid in cash, ranging from $250,000 to $400,000 or more, that he had in gym bags. McCullough came to Salt Lake City at least six or seven times during the time he dealt with Hastings, and Hastings never saw him with a gun during these trips. Hastings sold his marijuana business to Gregory Frischknecht in 1988 for $40,000 but continued to keep in contact with McCullough. McCullough spoke with him by telephone a few times the last week of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">In early September 1990, McCullough asked Hastings for help getting marijuana for resale. About a week before his death, McCullough sent Vince Lamicica to Utah to buy 26 pounds of marijuana for $70,000, which was to be delivered to McCullough in California. During this time McCullough told Hastings that two persons were following him, and when McCullough went to the vehicle in which the two were sitting, he saw a photograph of himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>in the vehicle. McCullough told Hastings he had brought in two \u201chit men\u201d from out of state to kill a person who had been stealing from him and who had been charged with robbing him at McCullough\u2019s home during the time that Hastings and McCullough were dealing marijuana. McCullough told Hastings he later decided not to have the person hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">In early September 1990, federal drug authorities seized Frischknecht\u2019s assets and later arrested him. Frischknecht was \u201cdoing time in federal prison\u201d for his role in the drug ring. Federal agents also arrested Hastings and charged him in connection with his role in the drug ring. Hastings agreed to cooperate as a witness against Gabriel Aguirre. When he testified, he was serving a 10-year sentence in federal prison, a reduced sentence in return for his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The parties also stipulated that if called as a witness, Frischknecht would testify as follows. He and McCullough became involved together in a marijuana sales operation in early 1989. Frischknecht delivered marijuana around the country on Aguirre\u2019s behalf. He made two marijuana deliveries, totaling about 700 pounds, to McCullough at his home on Mariposa in Stockton. On one trip, Frischknecht was introduced to McCullough\u2019s partner in the marijuana business. Frischknecht described this partner and, after viewing photographs, said it was not defendant, Steven Homing, or Kevin Crowley. McCullough flew to Reno, Nevada to pay Frischknecht for the marijuana. McCullough paid between $200,000 and $300,000. McCullough flew to Salt Lake City for one of the transactions and inspected the marijuana there before Frischknecht delivered it to Stockton. McCullough gave Frischknecht $140,000 at that time and paid the balance of the $300,000 purchase price a few weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Frischknecht had almost weekly telephone conversations with McCullough during the spring and summer of 1990 that Frischknecht later learned were intercepted by federal wiretaps. In early September 1990, an assets seizure case was begun against Frischknecht. He contacted McCullough to try to find out what the government was doing. He paid McCullough $7,500 to gain information that might help him fight the asset seizure action. McCullough told him that \u201che had friends in positions of authority who could help him . . . get information.\u201d McCullough also told Frischknecht that persons were \u201cdogging\u201d him at the time. The two of them concluded it had something to do with the ongoing investigation into their drag activities. Frischknecht testified in the Aguirre trial in February 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">After the guilt verdict, defendant waived his right to further jury trial. The prosecution first proved to the court that, before McCullough\u2019s murder, defendant had suffered three felony convictions: robbery convictions in 1982 and 1983 in Monterey County and a 1988 conviction in San Joaquin County for a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14. The prosecution also presented evidence of crimes defendant committed after McCullough\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">At some point after he left the cabin in Idaho, defendant robbed a bank in Pocatello, Idaho, in which he used a nine-millimeter SIG and stole $5,000. On December 27, 1990, he robbed a bank in Eugene, Oregon, in which he used a handgun. On March 22, 1991, he robbed a bank in Winslow, Arizona, at gunpoint, of $25,000. As he was leaving the bank with the money and a hostage, a police officer captured him. After his capture, he said that he \u201cwould have blown the cop away\u201d if he had had the opportunity. Sometime later, defendant escaped from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">On June 25, 1992, defendant entered the car of Adam Lakritz and Katherine Falk in Flagstaff, Arizona, and at gunpoint, forced them to drive to the Grand Canyon. Defendant placed his gun into Lakritz\u2019s ribs and threatened to shoot him and Falk; he continued to threaten them throughout these events. Defendant told Falk he wanted to kidnap a family with small children and hold them for a million-dollar ransom and the release from jail of one of his brothers. He forced Lakritz and Falk to spend the night with him at a hotel. The next day, defendant forced them to drive to Williams, Arizona, where he obtained $1,500 using Lakritz\u2019s credit card. They then returned to the Grand Canyon, where defendant, while still holding Lakritz and Falk hostage, attempted to kidnap a family of four in a motor home. Before he did so, while sitting with Falk and Lakritz in the car parked next to the targeted motor home, defendant dictated a ransom tape, using a microcassette in the car. As Falk described it, defendant demanded \u201cmoney in certain denominations, [his] brother\u2019s release, a red truck.\u201d Defendant threatened to kill the \u201csix hostages\u201d (Lakritz and Falk and the four persons in the motor home), saying \u201che would just blow away half the hostages and go on from there.\u201d After defendant finished dictating his demands, he \u201cpulled a gun\u201d on the family and said they were his \u201chostages.\u201d One family member escaped and informed Don Miller, a Grand Canyon park ranger, who arrived to foil the kidnapping. Defendant fled with Lakritz and Falk in their car, pursued by Ranger Miller, and a high-speed chase ensued. During the chase, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>shot at Ranger Miller and another patrol car several times through the rear window and out the side of the car. Eventually, defendant escaped on foot into the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">On June 29, 1992, defendant attempted to abduct at gunpoint two persons in a picnic area in the Grand Canyon. They escaped, but defendant drove away in their car, which he later abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On July 4, 1992, at the Grand Canyon, defendant entered the rented car of Sally Edmonds and Caroline Young, tourists from England, and at gunpoint, forced Edmonds to drive away, with defendant sitting in the back and Young in the front. He threatened to shoot through the gas tank if they \u201cdid anything silly.\u201d He forced Edmonds to stop in an isolated area near the town of Williams, where he ordered Edmonds and Young out of the car. He tied their hands together around a tree, took about $15 from them, and left with their car. Highway Patrol Officer Stephen Costello observed defendant driving the car. The car passed him going about 100 miles per hour. Defendant shot at him, hitting the officer\u2019s car. Officer Costello followed defendant, but defendant skidded to a stop, hitting a sign, and escaped on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Defendant presented two types of evidence at the penalty phase: evidence to try to create a lingering doubt as to his guilt of McCullough\u2019s murder and evidence in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">David Butler, an expert in firearms identification, testified that he could not determine whether the bullet found in McCullough\u2019s brain and the bullet found on defendant\u2019s property were fired from the same gun. He did \u201cnot disagree with Mr. Giusto\u2019s findings,\u201d but disagreed with the way he described them. He preferred to say the testing was \u201cinconclusive.\u201d The bullet from McCullough\u2019s brain \u201cshow[ed] no evidence having been fired from a sawed-off rifle,\u201d but he could not say for sure. Dr. Louis Daugherty, a pathologist, testified that he did not believe the serrated knife found with the victim\u2019s torso could have made some of the bone cuts found on the victim, although it could have made some of the other cuts.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">Cynthia Cuevas, defendant\u2019s sister, testified again. This time she said she believed that defendant and Steven last came to her house on September 20, 1990, not September 19. Defendant\u2019s brother Rodney confirmed some of her testimony but could not remember any of the dates. Rodney also said he had never been at Bums Cut with defendant or Steven Horning and never saw a sawed-off .22 at the Horning property in 1990. Defendant\u2019s brother Mark testified that he used to work for McCullough at the Mariposa property and</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>observed marijuana transactions. McCullough sometimes told him about burglaries. Jacques Colblack testified that some of the Homings\u2019 neighbors kept rifles \u201claying around.\u201d John McFeley testified that there had been a lot of garbage on a piece of property next to the Horning home. Officer James Smith testified that around 1990 to 1991, he confiscated a sawed-off shotgun from a house just east of the Homing home.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Shelley Ann Homing, defendant\u2019s wife, testified that they had three children and had lived as a normal family for a time in 1987 to 1988. Aside from an incident involving his daughter for which he was arrested and sent to prison, defendant was a \u201ccaring and loving\u201d father who was \u201creal close\u201d to one of his sons. It would be hard on their children if defendant were on death row. She believed \u201cwe all have a good inside of us, and I do know that [defendant] has good in him.\u201d She did not want him to be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Vicki Zachary testified that she used to be abused by her father. When she was about 14 or 15 years old, defendant helped her get away from her father. She met defendant through church, which they attended together. She believed that defendant is a \u201cgood guy with a good heart.\u201d According to her, defendant had a habit of saving and keeping coins.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He denied killing McCullough. He noted that he had consistently admitted his guilt of other crimes, including crimes he had not yet been charged with, but always denied killing McCullough. He denied ever seeing the sawed-off rifle barrel found on the Homing property. He said he did fire the .22-caliber bullet found on the property, but not from a sawed-off rifle. He denied ever meeting McCullough, being on McCullough\u2019s property, or fishing at Bums Cut. He admitted possessing the nine-millimeter handgun taken from him when he was arrested in Arizona and explained how he got it. He said he had left California on September 20, 1990, because he was afraid his parole officer would send him back to prison for not finding a job. Before he left California, he saw a vehicle parked in a parking lot. He entered the vehicle; thumbed through some papers, looking for money and took the gun from the car. He lied to Deputy Mayoya about getting the gun in Utah because he had heard that it was linked to a homicide in Stockton and he felt that Deputy Mayoya was also lying to him. When he left California, he took some coins with him that he had accumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Defendant believed that he was a \u201c[g]ood guy with a good heart who does bad things.\u201d The worst thing he ever did was molest his six-year-old daughter, for which he would never forgive himself. Defendant testified about the crimes he committed after leaving California. He said he always tried to make the others who were involved \u201cas comfortable as possible\u201d; he tried to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>treat them \u201clike a human being, instead of an animal.\u201d He said he attempted six bank robberies, five successful and one (presumably the one in Winslow, Arizona) unsuccessful. During his bank robberies, \u201cninety-nine percent of the time [his gun] was in [his] shoulder holster.\u201d He denied ever shooting at anyone with the intent to hit them. As a result of military training, he was an expert marksman; if he had intended to hit anyone, he would have done so. He noted that he had had many opportunities to kill his victims but had never done so. He admitted making a tape of demands in which he threatened to kill hostages, shoot police officers, and commit acts of arson and terrorism, but said he did not intend to actually do so. He was just \u201cbluffing\u201d and \u201cnever expected [he would] have to\u201d carry out the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Defendant described some of the good things he had done in his life. He helped his \u201c16-year-old sweetheart Vicki Zachary,\u201d helped John Sharp take in the hay, helped his sister in Washington State when her son had been in a car accident, and gave food and other things to a homeless shelter. He was always \u201cthere\u201d when a family member or friend needed anything. \u201c[W]hether I know the people or not, if I see a need and if I\u2019m capable of handling it, I offer my assistance.\u201d He loved his wife very much. He would like to continue to have a relationship with his three children and believed it would be more stressful for them if he received the death penalty than if he received life without parole. He said \u201cit would be very hard for me to cope with the fact that [the judge] could find me guilty enough to give me the death penalty for something I did not do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AMt\">A. <em>Delay in the Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">McCullough\u2019s murder occurred in September 1990. On December 4, 1990, while defendant was still at large, the district attorney filed a complaint charging defendant and his brother, Steven Homing, with the murder. (The charge against Steven Homing was later dismissed.) On March 22, 1991, defendant was arrested in Arizona on other charges. He was convicted of crimes in that state in May 1991 and received four consecutive life sentences. In a letter dated November 26, 1991, Detective Mayoya of the San Joaquin County Sheriff\u2019s Department informed the Arizona Department of Corrections that defendant was accused of McCullough\u2019s murder. Detective Mayoya stated that the district attorney had decided not to extradite him \u201cdue to the fact that Homing was sentenced to four consecutive life terms for the crimes relating to the bank robbery in Winslow. Homing to my understanding will have to serve 100 years before he is eligible for parole.\u201d Detective Mayoya asked to \u201cbe notified of any change of his sentence, due to appeal or retrial, as a reduction in sentence may warrant extradition to California.\u201d The letter attached a copy of the arrest warrant \u201cfor use as a detainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>In May 1992, defendant escaped from custody in Arizona and committed additional crimes. He was rearrested in Arizona in July 1992. On July 22, 1992, the district attorney filed an amended complaint that again charged defendant with McCullough\u2019s murder. As of August 1992, however, the district attorney had not yet decided to extradite him. On May 12, 1993, another amended complaint was filed against defendant, charging him with McCullough\u2019s murder and, for the first time, alleging special circumstances. Defendant appeared in court on this charge for the first time on May 20, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Defendant moved in the superior court to dismiss the charges due to the delay before he was arraigned on May 20, 1993. The court denied the motion. Defendant contends the court erred and that the two-and-a-half-year delay between the filing of the first complaint in December 1990 and Ms arraignment in May 1993 violated his rights under both the United States and California ConstiMtions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. (See <em>People v. Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 512 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521].) Defendant argues that the complaint filed on December 4, 1990 (while he was still at large) triggered Ms federal speedy trial rights. He is incorrect. \u201cUnder the <em>federal </em>Constitution, ... the filing of a felony complaint is by itself insufficient to trigger speedy trial protection. [Citation.] The United States Supreme Court has defined the point at which the federal speedy trial right begins to operate: \u2018[I]t is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engage the particular protections of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Marion </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 307, 320 [30 L.Ed.2d 468, 92 S.Ct. 455].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 750, 754-755 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 381, 996 P.2d 32].) Thus, the complaint filed in December 1990 did not trigger defendant\u2019s federal speedy trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Defendant also argues that at least the letter from Detective Mayoya to the Arizona authorities, dated November 26, 1991, wMch attached an arrest warrant \u201cfor use as a detainer,\u201d triggered Ms federal speedy trial protection. That letter was not a formal indictment or information. It also did not cause defendant\u2019s actual restraint on these charges. He was not extradited at that time, and he remained incarcerated in Arizona due to conviction of charges in that state. The letter did not cause the government to \u201carrest[] Mm and thereby commence[] its prosecution of Mm.\u201d <em>(Dillingham v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>(1975) 423 U.S. 64, 65 [46 L.Ed.2d 205, 96 S.Ct. 303].) Accordingly, the federal protection attached only when he was actually restrained on these charges in May 1993. Defendant does not complain of delay after that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Even assuming that, as the trial court found, defendant\u2019s federal speedy trial protection attached when Detective Mayoya sent the November 26, 1991, letter to the Arizona authorities, he would not be entitled to relief. The United States Supreme Court has noted that unreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens several harms, \u201cincluding \u2018oppressive pretrial incarceration,\u2019 \u2018anxiety and concern of the accused,\u2019 and \u2018the possibility that the [accused\u2019s] defense will be impaired\u2019 by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>(Doggett v. United States </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 647, 654 [120 L.Ed.2d 520, 112 S.Ct. 2686] (Doggett); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Roybal, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 512.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">In deciding whether to grant relief due to unreasonable delay in the prosecution, courts must consider what the high court refers to as the four \u201cBarker\u201d factors <em>(Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972) 407 U.S. 514 [33 L.Ed.2d 101, 92 S.Ct. 2182]): \u201cwhether delay before trial was uncommonly long, whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial, and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay\u2019s result.\u201d <em>(Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 651.) \u201cThe first of these is actually a double enquiry. Simply to trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege that the interval between accusation and trial has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from \u2018presumptively prejudicial\u2019 delay .... If the accused makes this showing, the court must then consider, as one factor among several, the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the claim. . . . [T]he presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 651-652.) The court indicated that postaccusation delay is considered presumptively prejudicial \u201cat least as it approaches one year.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 652, fn. 1; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The high court has explained that in this context, the term \u201cpresumptive prejudice\u201d \u201csimply marks the point at which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the <em>Barker </em>enquiry.\u201d <em>(Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 652, fn. 1.) \u201c[Ajffirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim,\u201d because \u201cexcessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify. While such presumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a Sixth Amendment claim without regard to the other <em>Barker </em>criteria [citation], it is part of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the length of delay.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 655-656.) The court also noted \u201cthat pretrial delay is often both inevitable and wholly justifiable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>government may need time to collect witnesses against the accused, oppose his pretrial motions, or, if he goes into hiding, track him down. We attach great weight to such considerations when balancing them against the costs of going forward with a trial whose probative accuracy the passage of time has begun by degrees to throw into question.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.) \u201c \u2018[Different weights [are to be] assigned to different reasons\u2019 for the delay.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 657.) \u201c[T]o warrant granting relief, negligence unaccompanied by particularized trial prejudice must have lasted longer than negligence demonstrably causing such prejudice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The <em>Doggett </em>court found the accused in that case entitled to relief due to an \u201cextraordinary 8 1/2 year\u201d delay, of which six years was attributable to the \u201cGovernment\u2019s inexcusable oversights.\u201d <em>(Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 652, 657.) \u201cWhen the Government\u2019s negligence thus causes delay six times as long as that generally sufficient to trigger judicial review . . . , and when the presumption of prejudice, albeit unspecified, is neither extenuated, as by the defendant\u2019s acquiescence, . . . nor persuasively rebutted, the defendant is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 658, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Applying these factors to this case, defendant is not entitled to relief even if we assume his federal speedy trial protection attached in November 1991. Some of the delay was fully justified. Defendant was in hiding for some of the time. The trial court also found that he was \u201cunavailable for prosecution in California after his arrest in Arizona until prosecution there was completed in May 1991.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Another part of the delay was at least understandable, even if we assume, without deciding, that it was not fully justified under high court precedent. Because defendant was sentenced to prison for life in Arizona, the district attorney originally made the practical decision that it was not worthwhile expending the necessary resources to extradite him to, and prosecute him in, California. But after defendant escaped from prison in Arizona and committed numerous other horrific crimes, ending with his rearrest in July 1992\u2014 which both showed that he remained a danger to society and made this a much stronger capital case\u2014the district attorney reasonably decided it was then appropriate to prosecute him. We think this delay is at least a \u201cmore neutral reason\u201d that \u201cshould be weighed less heavily\u201d in the balancing process. <em>(Barker v. Wingo, supra, </em>407 U.S. at p. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">The reasons for the additional delay between defendant\u2019s rearrest in Arizona in July 1992 and the formal bringing of charges in May 1993 are unclear. Presumably, defendant was prosecuted in Arizona for his new crimes, which may explain some of the delay. In any event, the delay after July 1992 was considerably shorter than the one-year period the high court has identified as triggering inquiry into the <em>Barker </em>factors. Even if we were to find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>delay after the district attorney originally decided not to extradite defendant not fully justified, neither was it totally inexcusable. And even if we include the time from November 1991 (or even May 1991 when it appears California could first have demanded his extradition) until his escape in May 1992 to the period of unjustified delay, the total delay is still not considerably greater than the minimum necessary to trigger the <em>Barker </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">In examining the <em>Barker </em>factors, we find that the delay, even viewed in its worst light, was not extraordinarily long. Defendant\u2019s actions contributing to the delay\u2014going into hiding, committing crimes in Arizona that caused authorities in that state to prosecute him after his arrest, escaping from custody and being at large again, then committing numerous new crimes in Arizona\u2014are far more blameworthy than any government-caused delay. Defendant does not claim he asserted his right to a speedy trial. But the record is unclear whether he had formal notice of the charges before May 1993 or any real way to demand he be prosecuted in California. So this factor carries little weight either way. (See <em>Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp. 653-654.) Regarding prejudice, defendant was either at large or incarcerated in Arizona for crimes committed there during the period of delay. Accordingly, he cannot complain of oppressive pretrial incarceration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roybal, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 513.) Defendant suggests he was prejudiced by his inability to gain concurrent sentencing. Because he faced four consecutive life sentences in Arizona and received the death penalty here, this was not significant prejudice. Defendant does not show that he suffered great anxiety and concern. If, as we do, we discount the significance of his failure to assert his right to a speedy trial, so too must we discount the possibility of anxiety and concern. <em>(Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">This brings us to possible prejudice to defendant\u2019s ability to defend against the charge, the most serious of the types of prejudice that delay can cause. <em>(Doggett, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 654.) As explained, under the federal Constitution, if the delay is extraordinary, prejudice is presumed. But such presumptive prejudice does not alone entitle a defendant to relief; it is only \u201cpart of the mix of relevant facts, and its importance increases with the length of delay.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 656.) The delay here pales in comparison to the government-induced delay in <em>Doggett. </em>It was not so egregious as to entitle defendant to relief solely due to presumptive prejudice. <em>(People v. Roybal, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 513.) Defendant has also failed to show any particularized prejudice. In the trial court, he asserted the delay prejudiced him because he was unable to locate certain alleged witnesses. But, as the trial court noted in finding no prejudice, he failed to show that any of these persons were relevant to the case or could help him in any way. Accordingly, we find no violation of defendant\u2019s federal constitutional speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has also indicated that delay in bringing charges might violate a defendant\u2019s federal <em>due process </em>rights \u201cif it were shown at trial that the pre-indictment delay in this case caused substantial prejudice to [his] rights to a fair trial and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Marion, supra, </em>404 U.S. at p. 324; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 765.) Defendant has not shown that the delay was intended to gain a tactical advantage. As explained above, he has also failed to show prejudice. Accordingly, we also see no violation of defendant\u2019s federal due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Defendant also claims the delay violated his state constitutional rights. \u201cUnder the <em>state </em>Constitution, the filing of a felony complaint is sufficient to trigger the protection of the speedy trial right.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 754.) Accordingly, defendant\u2019s state constitutional speedy trial rights attached as of the filing of the complaint on December 4, 1990.  However, \u201cwhen a defendant seeks dismissal based on delay after the filing of the complaint and before indictment or holding to answer on felony charges, a court must weigh \u2018the prejudicial effect of the delay on defendant against any justification for the delay.\u2019 [Citations.] No presumption of prejudice arises from delay after the filing of the complaint and before arrest or formal accusation by indictment or information [citation]; rather, the defendant seeking dismissal must affirmatively demonstrate prejudice [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 766-767.) As discussed above, defendant has shown no prejudice. Moreover, much of the delay, at least, was justified, especially the time when defendant was in hiding. Accordingly, we see no violation of defendant\u2019s state constitutional speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Defendant also argues that at least the special circumstance allegations, which were first added in May 1993, should have been dismissed. He asserts that if he had been brought to California earlier to answer the charges he could have pleaded guilty to murder without special circumstances. But a complaint or even information can generally be amended to add special circumstance charges. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 787, 827 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 819 P.2d 436]; <em>Talamantez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 629, 634-635 [176 Cal.Rptr. 800].) The district attorney added the special circumstance charges before defendant was first arraigned and could easily have done the same if he had prosecuted defendant earlier. We see no basis to assume that the district attorney would not have added the special circumstance allegations before the actual prosecution, whenever it might have begun. We find no more reason to dismiss the special circumstance allegations due to delay in the prosecution than to dismiss the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>B. <em>Guilt Phase Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">1. <em>Court\u2019s Refusal to Excuse Two Prospective Jurors for Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his challenges for cause against two prospective jurors because, he argues, they favored the death penalty and were biased against him. The issue is not cognizable on appeal. \u201cTo preserve a claim based on the trial court\u2019s overruling a defense challenge for cause, a defendant must show (1) he used an available peremptory challenge to remove the juror in question; (2) he exhausted all of his peremptory challenges or can justify the failure to do so; and (3) he expressed dissatisfaction with the jury ultimately selected.\u201d <em>(People v. Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 379 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046, 1087 [259 Cal.Rptr. 630, 774 P.2d 659].) Here, defendant challenged both prospective jurors peremptorily and exhausted his peremptory challenges. But he never expressed dissatisfaction with the jury ultimately selected. Defendant claims he was, in fact, dissatisfied with the jury and would have challenged other jurors had he been able to do so. He also claims it would have been futile to ask the trial court for additional peremptory challenges. But defendant did not express any of this at trial on the record.  A defendant must affirmatively <em>demonstrate </em>that the denial of his challenges for cause affected his right to a fair and impartial jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maury, supra, </em>at p. 380; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Bittaker, supra, </em>at p. 1087.) This he cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Moreover, we see no error. \u201c[T]he qualification of jurors challenged for cause [is a] matter[] within the wide discretion of the trial court, seldom disturbed on appeal. [Citation.] To find actual bias on the part of an individual juror, the court must find \u2018the existence of a state of mind\u2019 with reference to the case or the parties that would prevent the prospective juror \u2018from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Odie v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 932, 944 [187 Cal.Rptr. 455, 654 P.2d 225], quoting Pen. Code, former \u00a7 1073, now Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 225, subd. (b)(1)(C).) \u201cWhen ... a juror gives conflicting testimony as to her capacity for impartiality, the determination of the trial court on substantial evidence is binding on the appellate court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kaurish </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 648, 675 [276 Cal.Rptr. 788, 802 P.2d 278].)  When a challenge is based on the prospective juror\u2019s views on the death penalty, the trial court must determine whether those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of that person\u2019s duties. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 376.) The standard of review of the court\u2019s ruling regarding the prospective juror\u2019s views on the death penalty is essentially the same as the standard regarding other claims of bias. If the prospective juror\u2019s statements are conflicting or equivocal, the court\u2019s determination of the actual state of mind is binding. If the statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>consistent, the court\u2019s ruling will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 376-377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Under this standard, we see no abuse of discretion. The first juror defendant complains about stated on her questionnaire that she believed life without the possibility of parole as an alternative to the death penalty \u201cis a waste of money,\u201d and that she \u201cstrongly\u201d agreed that, after a fair trial and guilt finding, the state should execute everyone who kills another human being. But at voir dire, after the court explained the law to her, she assured the court she would not select the death penalty just to save the state money, and that she would \u201cdo the best\u201d she could in deciding the question of punishment fairly. Ultimately, when the court asked her whether she could make a choice between the death penalty and life without parole, she said, \u201cThat depends upon the case. I don\u2019t believe death is the only way, it just depends upon the circumstances and the case itself.\u201d She also stated on the questionnaire that if the defendant does not testify, he is probably guilty, and at voir dire she made some comments that the defendant would have the opportunity to prove his innocence. But she also explained that that had been her view at the time, and that she had \u201cnever been involved [in] anything like this.\u201d When the court explained to her the law regarding the burden of proof and told her she would have to find defendant not guilty if the prosecution had not met that burden, she said she understood and had no problem with it. On this record, we must defer to the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The second juror defendant complains about stated on the questionnaire that one of the most important problems in the criminal justice system is \u201cnot enforcing the death penalty.\u201d At voir dire, she also indicated a belief that defendants, including the defendant in this case, are probably guilty \u201cor they wouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d She also, however, assured the court that she could follow the law, specifically including the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof. At one point, she indicated that she would always impose the death penalty for an intentional killing. When she said that, the court initially stated it would grant defendant\u2019s challenge for cause, but it permitted the district attorney to question her further. When the district attorney further explained to her the law, she stated she could return a verdict of life if she believed it appropriate under the law. She said she did not consider herself \u201cas being unfair,\u201d although she also said she would be \u201cleaning\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s direction. After considering this additional voir dire, the court denied the challenge for cause. This juror\u2019s statements were contradictory and equivocal, and she certainly said some things that would have supported granting the challenge for cause. But this is precisely where an appellate court must defer to the determination of the trial court, which was present and could observe her during the questioning. Her statements that she was fair, would follow the law, and would consider both possible punishments, support the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>2. <em>Issues Regarding One of Defendant\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Over defendant\u2019s hearsay objection, the court admitted evidence of his statement to Deputy Mayoya that he would not contradict his brother Steven if Steven had said he had committed a 1988 robbery of McCullough. The prosecutor referred to this evidence in his opening statement. Defendant later moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the statement was prejudicial. The court denied the motion. In his rebuttal argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued without objection that this statement suggested that defendant had, in fact, committed that crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant contends the court erred in admitting the evidence and denying the mistrial motion, and that the prosecutor committed misconduct in his argument to the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Defendant argues that the statement does not come within the exception to the hearsay rule for statements against interest. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.) We need not decide the question, for the statement clearly comes within another exception to the hearsay rule: statements of a party. The hearsay rule does not bar statements when offered against the declarant in an action in which the declarant is a party. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220.) \u201cThe evidence was of statements, defendant was the declarant, the statements were offered against him, and he was a party to the action. Accordingly, the hearsay rule does not make the statements inadmissible.\u201d <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1049 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is not clear from the record whether the court admitted the evidence as a statement of a party or as a declaration against interest, but it does not matter. The ruling was correct on at least one legal theory. (See <em>People v. Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 976 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Defendant also argues the prosecution did not establish the corpus delicti of the 1988 robbery, and the statement was inadmissible evidence of other crimes. However, he objected solely on hearsay grounds, so he may not raise other objections on appeal. <em>(People v. Carpenter, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1049.) Absent an objection at trial, which would have given the prosecutor the opportunity to argue the matter, it is hard to evaluate defendant\u2019s contention, but the statement appears relevant at least to show defendant\u2019s previous knowledge about McCullough and his home, which was relevant to defendant\u2019s guilt of the charged offense. Moreover, \u201cIt is not clear that the corpus delicti rule applies to other crimes evidence offered solely to prove facts such as motive, opportunity, intent, or identity, or for impeachment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 124 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].) Assuming the rule does apply here, an objection on corpus delicti grounds would have permitted the prosecution to attempt to satisfy any evidentiary gap. In any event, evidence was presented without objection\u2014 partly by defense counsel\u2014that McCullough had told others that he had been the target of crimes, and had identified Steven Homing as having perpetrated a 1988 robbery, which would seem to satisfy the corpus delicti rale. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Towler </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 105, 115 [181 Cal.Rptr. 391, 641 P.2d 1253] [\u201c \u2018slight or prima facie proof\u2019 \u201d suffices to establish the corpus delicti].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Because the court properly overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the evidence, it acted within its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s mistrial motion following the prosecutor\u2019s reference to it in his opening statement. <em>(People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1038 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Defendant contends the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jury was misleading and contrary to facts the prosecutor knew. The issue is not cognizable on appeal because defendant did not object to the argument at trial, and an objection could have cured any harm. <em>(People v. Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1212 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969].) Defendant claims that because the court admitted the statement over his objection, any objection \u201cto the prosecutor\u2019s argument or to the (misleading) inference he sought to have the jury draw\u201d would have been futile. We disagree. A hearsay objection is different from an objection that an argument is misleading or contrary to the known facts. Defendant was obligated to object at trial to preserve the point for appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1212-1213.) This he failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Moreover, any objection would have lacked merit. The prosecutor merely argued the evidence and inferences to be drawn from it, as he was entitled to do. <em>(People v. Hill </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 800, 819 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 656, 952 P.2d 673].) Defendant points out that McCullough had previously identified Steven Homing as the perpetrator. Therefore, he argues, the prosecutor \u201cknew full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>well\u201d that defendant had not committed the crime. However, the prosecutor \u201cknew\u201d no such thing. The prosecutor was not present at the 1988 events. He knew\u2014as did the jury\u2014that evidence existed that McCullough had identified Steven Homing as the perpetrator. Indeed, he acknowledged this fact to the jury. But he did not <em>know </em>that McCullough was correct or that Steven was the sole perpetrator. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Riel, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 1181-1182; <em>People v. Gordon </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 460, 472-474 [110 Cal.Rptr. 906, 516 P.2d 298].) This whole point was minor in the context of the case as a whole, but the prosecutor was entitled to argue his view of the evidence\u2014and the significance of defendant\u2019s statement to Deputy Mayoya\u2014just as defendant was entitled to argue his view of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">3. <em>Admission of Ballistics Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court permitted Criminalist Michael Giusto to testify that he compared the bullets obtained in this case with the gun barrel found on defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 property, and that the testing showed both bullets could have been fired from the gun of which the barrel was a part but that, due to their condition, he could not say for sure and could not quantify the probabilities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant contends the court should have excluded the evidence as irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The trial court has broad discretion both in determining the relevance of evidence and in assessing whether its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. <em>(People v. Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1]; <em>People v. Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 19 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) We see no abuse of discretion. Obviously, if Giusto had been able to state positively that the fatal bullet either did or did not come from the gun barrel on the Horning property, the evidence would have had greater probative value.  But sometimes scientific examination of evidence is inconclusive. (E.g., <em>People v. Burgener </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 505, 515 [224 Cal.Rptr. 112, 714 P.2d 1251].) That circumstance does not make it irrelevant. It was relevant for the jury to learn that the evidence was tested, and that similarities among the items showed that both bullets might have been fired from the barrel, but that it was impossible to say for sure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d <em>771, </em>813 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865] [relevant for the jury to learn that two cigarette butts found in the victims\u2019 car were tested scientifically even though the results were inconclusive].) Defendant objects that Giusto\u2019s testimony was merely speculation. It was not. It was based on a scientific examination of evidence and the results of that examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The evidence was also not unduly prejudicial. The jury could easily understand that similarities among the objects indicated the bullets <em>might </em>have been fired from that particular gun, but that, due to their condition, Giusto could not be certain. Defendant was permitted to cross-examine Giusto extensively on the point. Indeed, <em>excluding </em>the evidence might have been unfairly prejudicial to the prosecution. The jury would naturally wonder if anyone had tested the bullets and barrel. If told nothing on the question, some jurors might have assumed no one had bothered to test the evidence, to the prosecution\u2019s substantial\u2014and unfair\u2014detriment. It would have been truly odd, and would only have puzzled the jury, to tell it that testing had been done, but withhold the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he killed McCullough and committed murder in the first degree, and its finding true the two special circumstance allegations and the allegation that he personally used a firearm. In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthe court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) The same standard of review applies when the evidence of guilt is circumstantial and to special circumstance allegations. <em>(People v. Valdez </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 73, 104\u2014105 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 271, 82 P.3d 296].) We find the evidence sufficient to support all parts of the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The evidence that defendant was the killer was ample. Defendant\u2019s thumbprints and fingerprints appeared on two car ownership documents found in the victim\u2019s car shortly after the killing. When arrested in Arizona, defendant possessed the victim\u2019s gun, which had been seen in the victim\u2019s house as recently as a day or so before the killing. Parts of a .22-caliber rifle that could have been the murder weapon and a .22-caliber bullet that could have been fired from the murder weapon were found on the Homing property. Shortly before the killing, defendant\u2019s father saw him firing a .22-caliber rifle. Evidence showed that defendant had worn shorts and a tank top similar to shorts found with the body parts and a tank top found inside the victim\u2019s house. Other evidence showed that twice during the summer before the killing, defendant had been driven to a spot near the victim\u2019s house. Defendant was familiar with the area where the body parts were found, and with dismembering animals the way the body was dismembered. Very close to the time of the killing, defendant abmptly left California without saying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>anything to his parents or sister even though, the day before the killing, he had arranged with his sister to fix her car a day or so after the killing. He then hid away in the mountains of Idaho as winter approached. He paid for groceries in Idaho with coins from a very heavy bag, an odd thing for a hiker to do. A large collection of coins was missing from the victim\u2019s house. The jury could reasonably infer that defendant lied in a number of respects to Detective Mayoya, including how he obtained the victim\u2019s gun and his denials of possessing or touching a .22-caliber gun and having been to the victim\u2019s house. A former fellow inmate testified that defendant had made statements indicating that he had killed a drug dealer in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Defendant stresses that the ballistics evidence connecting the fatal bullet with the rifle parts and bullet found on the Homing property was inconclusive. He is correct, but the circumstance that one piece of evidence was itself inconclusive does not negate the rest of the evidence that shows that defendant was the killer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The evidence also supported the first degree murder verdict. The court instmcted the jury both on premeditated and deliberated first degree murder and on first degree felony murder. The evidence supported both theories. \u201cEvidence concerning motive, planning, and the manner of killing [is] pertinent to the determination of premeditation and deliberation, but these factors are not exclusive nor are they invariably determinative.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 345, 368 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 21 P.3d 769].) The evidence showed that defendant tied the victim\u2019s hands with duct tape and blindfolded him before shooting him in the head a single time from within two inches. A jury could reasonably infer a motive\u2014the desire to prevent anybody from identifying him. The evidence also shows planning. Defendant points out that the tape and bags in which the body parts were placed were apparently obtained from the victim\u2019s house and argues that this shows the killing was not preplanned.  But premeditation can occur in a short time. <em>(People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 371 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].) The jury could reasonably infer that defendant brought the murder weapon with him, which, together with the evidence that he bound and blindfolded the victim at the scene of the crime, shows planning activity. The manner of killing, a single bullet from close range into the brain of a bound and blindfolded\u2014and hence, so the jury could reasonably infer, unresisting\u2014 victim, shows a calculated design to ensure death rather than an unconsidered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>explosion of violence. <em>(People v. Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 627 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126].) All this is sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The evidence also supported a finding of first degree felony murder. The jury could reasonably have found that defendant took at least the victim\u2019s gun and collection of coins from inside the house. Moreover, the evidence showed that the victim generally kept large sums of money in his house. Defendant had no job and needed money. This evidence suffices to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find that defendant entered the house with the intent to commit theft, i.e., that he committed burglary (\u00a7 459), and that he killed the victim during the course of a robbery. Defendant correctly argues that robbery or burglary felony murder requires that the intent to steal be formed <em>before </em>the fatal blow is struck, i.e., that he had to have intended to steal before he fatally shot the victim. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 577, 629-630 [276 Cal.Rptr. 874, 802 P.2d 376].) He argues there was no evidence he had that intent at that time.  However, \u201cwhen one kills another and takes substantial property from the victim, it is ordinarily reasonable to presume the killing was for purposes of robbery.\u201d <em>(People v. Turner </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 668, 688 [268 Cal.Rptr. 706, 789 P.2d 887]; accord, <em>People v. Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 357.) Murders are commonly committed to obtain money or other property. <em>(Hughes, supra, </em>at p. 357.) Here, the jury could reasonably find defendant went to the house to steal and killed while doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Defendant argues that the .22-caliber bullet casing at the murder scene was found just <em>outside </em>the house, suggesting he might have shot the victim outside before he first entered the house, i.e., before he actually committed the burglary. But for purposes of the felony-murder rule, it does not matter. \u201cA murder is of the first degree if \u2018committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate\u2019 any of certain enumerated felonies, one of which is burglary. (\u00a7 189.) Under this provision, a killing is committed in the perpetration of an enumerated felony if the killing and the felony \u2018are parts of one continuous transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hayes, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 631.) Accordingly, \u201cdefendant was guilty of murder in the perpetration of burglary ... if (1) defendant intended to commit the burglary when he killed [the victim], and (2) the killing and the burglary of [the victim\u2019s house] were part of one continuous transaction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 632.) Thus, even if the jury found defendant had approached the victim\u2019s house with intent to commit burglary but killed the victim outside before consummating that burglary, it could still find him guilty of burglary felony murder. Defendant also argues that the victim might have invited him into the house. If so, that also makes no difference.  \u201cOne who enters a room or building with the intent to commit a felony is guilty of burglary even though permission to enter has been extended to him personally or as a member of the public.\u201d <em>(People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>Sears </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 737, 746 [44 Cal.Rptr. 330, 401 P.2d 938].) A rational trier of fact could have found all the elements of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Defendant also argues the evidence was insufficient to support the burglary-murder and robbery-murder special-circumstance findings. To some extent, this argument duplicates his arguments regarding the first degree felony-murder rule. (See <em>People v. Hayes, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at pp. 631-632.) Additionally, for the felony-murder special circumstance to apply, the felony \u201cmust not have been merely incidental to the killing.\u201d <em>(People v. Valdez, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 105.) As in <em>Valdez, </em>\u201cdefendant argues there was insufficient evidence establishing that he killed the victim in order to advance the independent felonious purpose of robbery.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>He points out that, while correcting the record, the Attorney General argued that he and Steven Homing had \u201ckilled the victim in retaliation for the victim identifying the brother as the perpetrator of a burglary and robbery.\u201d However, even if we were to assume retaliation was one motive to kill (elsewhere in his brief defendant also argues that no evidence exists that he \u201chad any preexisting motive\u201d to kill), the evidence supporting a first degree felony-murder verdict identified above suffices to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find that the intent to steal was defendant\u2019s primary\u2014or at least concurrent\u2014motivation, and that he killed to facilitate the stealing. <em>(People v. Valdez, supra, </em>at pp. 105-106; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 557-558 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 58 P.3d 931].)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Defendant also argues the evidence was insufficient to support the personal-gun-use finding. In addition to arguing the evidence was insufficient to permit the jury to find he was the killer, he also suggests that he might have aided and abetted someone else who actually used the firearm. He notes that Detective Mayoya testified (on cross-examination) that he believed more than one person was involved in the crime. (Indeed, Steven Homing was originally charged in this case, but the case as to him was dismissed.) But Detective Mayoya\u2019s belief was not <em>evidence </em>that someone else was involved. No such evidence was presented in this trial. Moreover, defendant was seen firing what the jury could have reasonably found to have been the murder weapon shortly before the killing. He possessed a gun taken in the crime when arrested months later. Defendant\u2019s fellow inmate testified that defendant made statements that the jury could reasonably infer indicated he had killed the victim. Under all the circumstances, a rational trier of fact could find defendant personally used a handgun during the commission of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">5. <em>Failure to Instruct on Second Degree Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Defendant contends the court erred in not instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of second degree murder. A court must generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>instruct the jury on lesser included offenses whenever the evidence warrants the instructions, whether or not the parties want it to do so. (See <em>People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 196-198 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) We need not decide whether the evidence warranted an instruction on second degree murder in this case because we find any error both invited and harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">When the parties reviewed the instructions to be given, defense counsel stated he did not want the court to instruct on second degree murder. Later, after discussing the question with defendant, defense counsel reiterated that he did not want instructions on lesser included offenses. The court explained to defendant personally that he was entitled to have the court instruct the jury on second degree murder and manslaughter. Defendant personally stated that, on advice of counsel, he did not want those instructions. Accordingly, the court instructed the jury on first degree premeditated and felony murder and on the robbery-murder and burglary-murder special circumstances, but not on second degree murder or manslaughter. Originally, the court also instructed the jury that if it had a doubt about the degree of the murder, it must find the defendant guilty of second degree murder. During deliberations, the jury asked whether it was supposed to \u201cmake any decisions regarding degree.\u201d After discussing the question, and with the concurrence of both parties, the court told the jury that the original reference to second degree murder had been inadvertent and the jury should disregard it. Defense counsel also said that defendant had \u201casked that I state for the record\u201d that defendant opposed an instruction on second degree murder. The court explained to defendant that if evidence had supported a second degree murder finding, it would be obligated to give that instruction, but it understood \u201cthat your defense in this matter is that you did not do it. And if that\u2019s your defense and that\u2019s what you feel the evidence does show, then I\u2019m not obligated to give that instruction.\u201d Defendant stated personally that he understood and accepted what the court said.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\u201c[A] defendant may not invoke a trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on a lesser included offense as a basis on which to reverse a conviction when, for tactical reasons, the defendant persuades a trial court not to instruct on a lesser included offense supported by the evidence. [Citations.] In that situation, the doctrine of invited error bars the defendant from challenging on appeal the trial court\u2019s failure to give the instruction.\u201d <em>(People v. Barton, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 198.) The record here shows that defendant\u2019s \u201clack of objection to the proposed instruction was more than mere unconsidered acquiescence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Avalos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 229 [207 Cal.Rptr. 549, 689 P.2d 121].) Rather, defendant did not want the instructions because they were inconsistent with his defense that he did not commit the crime at all. <em>(People v. Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 184 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781].) Indeed, although it was not required, the court obtained defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>personal agreement that he did not want the instructions. (See <em>People v. Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 827-828.) Accordingly, he cannot complain on appeal of the court\u2019s failure to give the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Citing <em>Beck v. Alabama </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 625 [65 L.Ed.2d 392, 100 S.Ct. 2382], defendant argues the federal Constitution requires instruction on lesser included offenses in capital cases. However, <em>\u201cBeck </em>does not prohibit a criminal defendant from choosing to forgo such instructions for strategic reasons, as was the case here.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 185.) Moreover, <em>\u201cBeck\u2019s </em>principles were satisfied if the jury was provided some noncapital third option between the capital charge and acquittal. Here the jury was provided with the noncapital option of first degree murder without special circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 621, fn. 3 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Any error was also harmless. \u201cError in failing to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense is harmless when the jury necessarily decides the factual questions posed by the omitted instructions adversely to defendant under other properly given instructions.\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 646 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392].) Here, the jury was instructed on both premeditated first degree murder and first degree felony murder, as well as on both the burglary-murder and robbery-murder special circumstances. In addition to finding defendant guilty of first degree murder, the jury found both special circumstances true. If the jury had had any doubt that this was a felony murder, it did not have to acquit but could have simply convicted defendant of first degree murder without special circumstances. Instead, it found that defendant killed the victim in the perpetration of robbery and burglary, which means it necessarily found the killing was first degree felony murder. (Ibid.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 464 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Defendant notes that the jury asked several questions during deliberations, including whether it had to make any decision regarding degree, and argues this circumstance \u201creflected the jury\u2019s doubt regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support a first degree murder verdict and its consideration of a lesser included offense.\u201d Such questions cannot detract from the verdicts the jury ultimately rendered, which show that it found the killing to be felony murder. Moreover, the questions suggest that the jury was carefully considering whether defendant had committed the crime, but not that it doubted that the crime was first degree murder. The court\u2019s original (and inadvertent) instruction that the jury had to give the defendant the benefit of any doubt regarding the degree of the crime, together with the absence of any other instructions regarding degree, naturally caused it to wonder if it was to make any finding in this regard. It so asked. The question showed that the jury had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>doubt about what exactly it was supposed to do, not that it doubted that the killing was first degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">6. <em>Other Instructional Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Defendant contends the court committed several other instructional errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">(a) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, the defendant had taken the murder victim\u2019s clothing at gunpoint in order to attempt to conceal the murder. We held that, although the taking constituted a technical robbery, the robbery-murder special circumstance was not established because the crime was not a murder in the commission of robbery, but a robbery in the commission of murder. (See <em>People v. Kimble </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 480, 500 [244 Cal.Rptr. 148, 749 P.2d 803].) We said that the felony-based special circumstances reflected a legislative belief that it was appropriate to make those who killed \u201cto advance an independent felonious purpose\u201d death eligible, but that this goal was not achieved when the felony was \u201cmerely incidental to the murder . . . .\u201d <em>(Green, supra, </em>at p. 61.) As we have summarized the rule, \u201cto prove a felony-murder special-circumstance allegation, the prosecution must show that the defendant had an independent purpose for the commission of the felony, that is, the commission of the felony was not merely incidental to an intended murder.\u201d <em>(People v. Mendoza </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 182 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 6 P.3d 150].)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">The standard jury instructions were modified to reflect this holding. Today, as at the time of trial, CALJIC No. 8.81.17, paragraph 2, explains that, for a felony-based special circumstance to be found true, it must be proved: \u201cThe murder was committed in order to carry out or advance the commission of the crime .... In other words, the special circumstance referred to in these instructions is not established if the [crime] was merely incidental to the commission of the murder.\u201d At trial, for reasons not clear from the record, the court gave the second, but not first, sentence of this paragraph. Thus, the court told the jury: \u201cIn other words, the special circumstance referred to in these instructions is not established if the robbery or burglary were merely incidental to the commission of the murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Defendant contends the court erred in not also telling the jury the murder had to be committed in order to carry out or advance the robbery or burglary. We disagree. As the transitional words in the instruction, \u201cIn other words,\u201d suggest, <em>Green </em>established one requirement, not two. The point we made in <em>People v. Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, is that if the felony was merely incidental to the murder\u2014as the evidence showed it was in Green\u2014no separate felony-based special circumstance exists. We have used various phrasings in explaining this requirement, two of which are included in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>CALJIC No. 8.81.17, but we have never suggested that we had created two separate requirements, or that any precise language was required to explain the concept to the jury. There is nothing magical about the phrase \u201cto carry out or advance\u201d the felony. Indeed, we ourselves have stated the requirement without using that phrase. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mendoza, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 182; <em>People v. Clark </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 583, 608 [268 Cal.Rptr. 399, 789 P.2d 127].) Several ways exist to explain the requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even if it might have been better to give the entire second paragraph of CALJIC No. 8.81.17, the court\u2019s explanation that the burglary or robbery must not be \u201cmerely incidental to the commission of the murder,\u201d adequately conveyed the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Moreover, we have held it is not error to fail to give <em>any </em>such instruction if the evidence does not warrant it. \u201cThe second paragraph of CALJIC No. 8.81.17 is appropriate where the evidence suggests the. defendant may have intended to murder his victim without having an independent intent to commit the felony that forms the basis of the special circumstance allegation.  In other words, if the felony is merely incidental to achieving the murder\u2014the murder being the defendant\u2019s primary purpose\u2014 then the special circumstance is not present, but if the defendant has an \u2018independent felonious purpose\u2019 (such as burglary or robbery) and commits the murder to advance that independent purpose, the special circumstance is present.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Navarette </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 458, 505 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 89, 66 P.3d 1182]; see also <em>People v. Kimble, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 501-503.) Defendant again suggests he might have killed in retaliation for McCullough\u2019s having identified his brother Steven as the perpetrator of a crime. But no evidence was presented to the jury that this was his sole motivation, \u201cand defendant did nothing to develop this theory of the case at trial .... Under the circumstances of the case as presented to the jury, the second paragraph of CALJIC No. 8.81.17 was not required.\u201d <em>(Navarette, supra, </em>at p. 505.) And certainly, the first sentence of that paragraph was not required in addition to the second sentence, which the court did give.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">(b) As the court explained to the jury, robbery requires a taking from a person or the person\u2019s \u201cimmediate presence.\u201d (\u00a7 211.) Defendant argues the court had a sua sponte duty to define the term \u201cimmediate presence.\u201d We disagree.  \u201cIn the absence of a specific request, a court is not required to instruct the jury with respect to words or phrases that are commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>understood and not used in a technical or legal sense. [Citation.] We think the phrase \u2018immediate presence\u2019 was sufficiently clear in the context of this case that no further clarification of the phrase was necessary.\u201d <em>(People v. Navarette, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 503.) \u201cIf defendant thought the point needed additional clarification or explanation, defendant should have \u2018requested appropriate clarifying or amplifying language\u2019 [citation]; absent such a request, the point is not preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>(People v. Bolden, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 557.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">(c) Pointing out that prosecution witness Jan Biaruta was an in-custody informant, defendant next argues the court erred in failing to instruct the jury with CALJIC No. 3.20, which tells the jury to view such testimony \u201cwith caution and close scrutiny.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the instruction need be given only \u201cupon the request of a party.\u201d (\u00a7 1127a; see <em>People v. Turner </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 201-202 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 878 P.2d 521].) Neither party requested the instruction in this case, so the court had no duty to give it. Moreover, it is far from clear whether the instruction would have helped or harmed defendant. Although it tells the jury to view the testimony with caution and close scrutiny, it also specifically directs the jury\u2019s attention to the extent to which the witness might have received or expected any benefits from the party calling him, in this case, the prosecution. Other than a trip to California to testify\u2014where he remained in custody\u2014no evidence was presented of any benefits the witness received or expected from the prosecution. Defendant reasonably might not have wanted to focus the jury\u2019s attention on the absence of any evidence of real or expected benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">(d) Defendant next argues that his statement to Deputy Mayoya that he would not contradict his brother Steven if Steven had said he had committed the 1988 robbery of McCullough was evidence of another crime, and the court erred in not instructing the jury, sua sponte, on the limited purpose for which it could consider the evidence. However, the court has no sua sponte duty to give such a limiting instruction. (\u00a7 355; <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 63-64 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534].) Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, \u201c[t]his was not an \u2018extraordinary case\u2019 in which the unprotested evidence was <em>\u2018both </em>highly prejudicial <em>and </em>minimally relevant to any legitimate purpose,\u2019 <em>and </em>was \u2018a dominant part of the evidence against the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Farnam </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 163-164 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 47 P.3d 988].) Moreover, defendant might well <em>not </em>have wanted the court to give his statement the emphasis a limiting instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>would have provided. <em>(People v. Freeman </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 450, 495 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 558, 882 P.2d 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">(e) Defendant contends that the standard instructions on circumstantial evidence, which use the phrase \u201cappears to you to be reasonable,\u201d \u201cundermined the constitutional requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We have repeatedly rejected the argument and continue to do so. <em>(People v. Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 428.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">(f) Defendant contends that giving former CALJIC No. 2.90, with its use of the terms \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and \u201cmoral evidence,\u201d improperly diluted the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We have also repeatedly rejected the argument and continue to do so. <em>(People v. Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">(g) CALJIC No. 2.20 tells the jury it is the sole judge of the credibility of a witness and lists certain factors the jury may consider in determining credibility, one of which is a witness\u2019s felony conviction. CALJIC No. 2.23 tells the jury it may consider a felony conviction only to determine credibility, and such a conviction does not necessarily destroy or impair credibility but is a circumstance the jury may consider. The court deleted from CALJIC No. 2.20 the reference to a felony conviction and did not give CALJIC No. 2.23. Defendant contends the court erred because prosecution witness Jan Biaruta had a felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">When the parties discussed the instructions, the question arose whether any witness had suffered a felony conviction. The parties believed that, with one possible exception not relevant here, none had such a conviction. Thus, they agreed that, subject to confirming whether the one witness had a felony conviction (it was never so confirmed), the court would delete the reference to a felony conviction and would not give CALJIC No. 2.23. Later, after the court had finished instructing the jury, one of defendant\u2019s attorneys stated that \u201calthough we did withdraw that instruction on conviction of a felony,\u201d he had recently thought about it, and \u201cMr. Biaruta did testify and he was convicted of a felony.\u201d The court did not want to add that instruction at that time as it would have highlighted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">We have said that the court should give the substance of CALJIC No. 2.20 in every criminal case, although it may omit factors that are inapplicable under the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rincon-Pineda </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 864, 883-884 [123 Cal.Rptr. 119, 538 P.2d 247].) Here, the court, with the concurrence of the parties, mistakenly believed no witness had suffered a felony conviction and, accordingly, failed to mention it or give CALJIC No. 2.23. Defendant argues that because of this, \u201cthe jury evaluated Biaruta\u2019s damning testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>as if it had come from a thoroughly credible witness, without consideration of his felony conviction for burglary as a factor negatively affecting his credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">We need not decide whether the court erred, or whether defendant invited any error, for the failure to give these instructions was harmless under any standard. Except to the extent that it duplicated CALJIC No. 2.20, CALJIC No. 2.23 contained nothing favorable to the defense. Telling the jury it could consider Biaruta\u2019s felony conviction <em>only </em>on credibility, and that such a conviction did not necessarily destroy or impair credibility, would not help the defense. Defendants usually want such a limiting instruction when they themselves had testified and been impeached with a felony conviction, not when a <em>prosecution </em>witness had the conviction. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomeli </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 649, 654\u2014655 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 5], disapproved in <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1040, 1052, fn. 3 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 94 P.3d 1080]; <em>People v. Kendrick </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1273 [260 Cal.Rptr. 27].) The failure to give CALJIC No. 2.23 did not prejudice defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In the abstract, it might have benefited defendant for the court to include a felony conviction among the specific factors listed in CALJIC No. 2.20, but it was unnecessary to do so here. Biaruta testified on direct examination that he had a burglary conviction for which he was serving a 12-year prison sentence. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited that he also had convictions for resisting arrest and criminal trespass. The court did give most of CALJIC No. 2.20, including that, \u201cIn determining the believability of a witness, you may consider <em>anything </em>that has a tendency in reason to prove or disprove the truthfulness of the testimony of the witness including <em>but not limited to </em>any of the following . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, the jury was permitted to consider the felony conviction (and the witness\u2019s other convictions) on credibility. Defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined Biaruta and challenged his credibility. He argued that the jury should not \u201cbelieve the word of a convicted felon who was in the Arizona prison.\u201d The prosecutor cited Biaruta\u2019s testimony only briefly in his opening argument, and even he stated that Biaruta was \u201ccertainly no prize in his own right.\u201d The record thus refutes defendant\u2019s claim that the jury evaluated Biaruta\u2019s testimony as if it had come from a thoroughly credible witness and without considering his felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">C. <em>Penalty Phase Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Defendant waived a penalty phase jury trial. After a contested penalty trial before the court, the court rendered a verdict of death and gave a detailed statement of reasons for its verdict. Thereafter, the court heard and denied defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, again with a statement of reasons. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>sentencing, the court permitted defendant personally to argue again for a life sentence. When defendant finished speaking, the question arose whether the court should entertain a motion to modify the sentence. (See \u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).) Defense counsel said, \u201cI\u2019m told there\u2019s some modification or something else the Court is supposed to do prior to the time, although Your Honor outlined that on September the 7th [when it rendered its verdict]. You may just want to refer to that.\u201d Counsel also said he did not \u201cwant to waive anything.\u201d In response, the court noted our decision in <em>People v. Diaz </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 495 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 353, 834 P.2d 1171] and pointed out that it had already stated its reasons when it rendered its verdict. It said, \u201cSo I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s necessary at this point in time.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d After permitting counsel for both sides to argue again what the sentence should be, the court imposed the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Defendant contends the court erred when it did not rule on an automatic motion to modify the sentence. Because defendant did not object, and the hearing occurred after our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 959 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 475, 839 P.2d 984], the issue is not cognizable on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Riel, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1220.) Counsel might not have wanted to \u201cwaive anything,\u201d but he did so when he suggested the court might just refer to its earlier ruling and responded, \u201cOkay,\u201d after the court expressed the belief that it did not have to state its reasons again. Moreover, we see no error and no prejudice. A ruling on a modification motion would have been superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">\u201cWe have never decided whether a defendant who waives a jury trial on the issue of penalty is entitled to a modification hearing under section 190.4, subdivision (e).\u201d <em>(People v. Diaz, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 575.) We noted in <em>Diaz </em>that the statutory language is ambiguous, sometimes referring to a verdict of death by the \u201ctrier of fact\u201d and sometimes referring to the \u201cjury\u2019s\u201d findings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 575, fn. 35, quoting \u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).) We also noted that, \u201c[although at first glance a modification motion after a penalty phase court trial appears to be an exercise in futility, there is one aspect of the modification motion that is significant even when the penalty issue has been determined by a court rather than a jury: the requirement in section 190.4, subdivision (e) that the trial court \u2018state on the record the reasons for his [or her] findings.\u2019 . . . The statutory requirement that the reasons be stated on the record enables us to review the propriety of the penalty determination made by the trial court sitting without a jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Diaz, supra, </em>at p. 575, fn. 35.) In this case, the court gave detailed statements when it originally rendered its verdict even though, as it recognized, it was not required to do so at that time. (See <em>People v. Diaz, supra, </em>at pp. 571-572.) All the court failed to do was to repeat those reasons. Nothing in section 190.4 suggests the court must state its reasons <em>twice. </em>Moreover, defendant could have challenged the court\u2019s verdict as part of his new trial motion, which the court did entertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>D. <em>Constitutionality of California\u2019s Death Penalty Law and Other Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Defendant reiterates various arguments that we have already rejected. We see no reason to reconsider our previous decisions. The aggravating factors, including section 190.3, factor (a), are not unconstitutionally vague. The statute is not invalid for failing to specify which factors are mitigating and which are aggravating, to limit aggravation to the specified aggravating factors, or to define aggravation or mitigation. Use of the word \u201cextreme\u201d in section 190.3 does not impermissibly restrict the sentencer\u2019s consideration of mitigating factors. The statute need not require written findings, unanimity as to aggravating circumstances (even when trial is before a jury), or findings beyond a reasonable doubt (except for other crimes). The special circumstances, including the felony-based special circumstances, are not impermissibly broad.  Prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether to seek the death penalty is constitutional. <em>(People v. Jones </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1084, 1128-1129 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 70 P.3d 359]; <em>People v. Maury, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 439-440; <em>People v. Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 884 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1]; <em>People v.

Riel, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 1224-1225.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Neither intercase proportionality nor disparate sentence review is required. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 511 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754].) Defendant is entitled to <em>intracase </em>proportionality review. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cHe does not specifically request such review, but it would not aid him. Given the nature of the current crime and his previous criminal conduct [as well as his crime spree after he murdered McCullough], defendant\u2019s sentence is not disproportionate to his personal culpability.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">E. <em>Cumulative Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Defendant contends the cumulative effect of the alleged errors was prejudicial. We disagree. There was little, if any, error to accumulate. Defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>III.
