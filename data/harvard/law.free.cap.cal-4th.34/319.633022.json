We conclude it did not and accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Plaintiffs Robert Rocher and Connie Dahlin, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, brought this action against defendant Sav-on Drug Stores, Inc., a drugstore chain. The operative second amended complaint alleges violation of the overtime statutes (Lab. Code, \u00a7 1194 et seq.) and the unfair competition law (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), as well as conversion, for which plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive and declaratory relief. Underlying each cause of action are factual allegations that defendant misclassified as exempt from the overtime laws and failed to pay overtime compensation owed to plaintiffs and similarly situated employees who worked during the relevant period at defendant\u2019s retail stores in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The Legislature has commanded that \u201c[a]ny work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of 40 hours in any one workweek . . . shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for an employee.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 510, subd. (a).) The Industrial Welfare Commission (IWC), however, is statutorily authorized to \u201cestablish exemptions from the requirement that an overtime rate of compensation be paid ... for executive, administrative, and professional employees, provided [inter alia] that the employee is primarily engaged in duties that meet the test of the exemption, [and] customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment in performing those duties . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 515, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">During the period covered by the complaint, defendant compensated plaintiffs as salaried managers, exempt from the overtime wage laws. Wage orders relating to the mercantile industry promulgated by the IWC and codified at California Code of Regulations, title 8, section 11070 provided during that same period an exemption from the overtime requirements for \u201cpersons employed in administrative, executive, or professional capacities.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The original IWC Wage Order No. 7-98 defined this as one \u201cengaged in work which is primarily intellectual, managerial, or creative, and which requires exercise of discretion and independent judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The underlying merits of this litigation concern whether or not plaintiffs and those similarly situated properly were classified and paid under this exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Our present inquiry concerns the trial court\u2019s granting of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. In support of their motion, plaintiffs argued that class members (i.e., defendant\u2019s operating managers, hereafter sometimes OM\u2019s, and assistant managers, hereafter sometimes AM\u2019s) had, on the basis of their title and job descriptions and without reference to their actual work, uniformly been misclassified by defendant as exempt employees. In fact, defendant\u2019s OM\u2019s and AM\u2019s were norananagerial, nonexempt employees under relevant law. Moreover, defendant\u2019s store operations were \u201cstandardized.\u201d Accordingly, the duties and responsibilities of defendant\u2019s OM\u2019s and AM\u2019s were similar in critical respects from region to region, area to area, and store to store. Class members generally performed nonexempt work in excess of 50 percent of the time in their workday, and their workday routinely included work in excess of eight hours per day and/or 40 hours per week. Notwithstanding these facts, plaintiffs contended, class members were not paid statutorily mandated overtime compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In opposing certification, defendant argued that whether any individual member of the class is exempt or nonexempt from the overtime requirements depends on which tasks that person actually performed and the amount of time he or she actually spent on which tasks. The actual activities performed by its OM\u2019s and AM\u2019s, and the amount of time spent by each OM and AM on exempt activities, defendant contended, varied significantly from store to store and individual to individual, based on multiple factors, including store location and size, physical layout, sales volume, hours of operation, management structure and style, experience level of managers, and number of hourly employees requiring supervision. For this reason, defendant argued, no meaningful generalizations about the employment circumstances of its managers could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The trial court granted the certification motion, appointing plaintiffs to represent a class defined as \u201call current and former salaried [OM\u2019s] and current and former salaried [AM\u2019s] employed by defendant... in California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>at any time between April 3, 1996 and June 22, 2001, inclusive.\u201d The parties have estimated that the class has between 600 and 1,400 members.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Defendant petitioned for writ relief. The Court of Appeal issued a writ of mandate commanding the trial court to vacate its order granting class certification and to enter a new and different order denying class certification. We granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We quite recently reviewed the established standards for class certification generally. <em>(Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, 1106 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 63 P.3d 913] <em>(Lockheed).) </em>Code of Civil Procedure section 382 authorizes class actions \u201cwhen the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court. . ..\u201d The party seeking certification has the burden to establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a well-defined community of interest among class members. <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>at p. 1104, citing <em>Washington Mutual Bank v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 906, 913 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 320, 15 P.3d 1071] <em>(Washington Mutual).) </em>The \u201ccommunity of interest\u201d requirement embodies three factors: (1) predominant common questions of law or fact; (2) class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class; and (3) class representatives who can adequately represent the class. <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>at p. 1104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The certification question is \u201cessentially a procedural one that does not ask whether an action is legally or factually meritorious.\u201d <em>(Linder v. Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 439-440 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27] <em>(Linder).) </em>A trial court ruling on a certification motion determines \u201cwhether ... the issues which may be jointly tried, when compared with those requiring separate adjudication, are so numerous or substantial that the maintenance of a class action would be advantageous to the judicial process and to the litigants.\u201d <em>(Collins v. Rocha </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 232, 238 [102 Cal.Rptr. 1, 497 P.2d 225]; accord, <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 1104-1105.) The trial court in this case determined that plaintiffs had established by a preponderance of the evidence that common issues predominate and ruled that a class action is \u201csuperior to alternate means for a fair and efficient adjudication of the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. \u201cBecause trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action, they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification. . . . [Accordingly,] a trial court ruling supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed \u2018unless (1) improper criteria were used [citation]; or (2) erroneous legal assumptions were made [citation]\u2019 [citation], . . . \u2018Any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Linder, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 435-436; see also <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Defendant does not contend the trial court erred in concluding the named plaintiffs have claims typical of the class and are adequate representatives thereof. The issue in dispute is whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that common issues predominate. For the following reasons, we conclude it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As the focus in a certification dispute is on what type of questions\u2014 common or individual\u2014are likely to arise in the action, rather than on the merits of the case <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at pp. 1106-1107; <em>Linder, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 439-440), in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court\u2019s certification order, we consider whether the theory of recovery advanced by the proponents of certification is, as an analytical matter, likely to prove amenable to class treatment. (See <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>at p. 1108; <em>Anthony v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 699, 707 [109 Cal.Rptr. 254].) \u201cReviewing courts consistently look to the allegations of the complaint and the declarations of attorneys representing the plaintiff class to resolve this question.\u201d <em>(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 478 [174 Cal.Rptr. 515, 629 P.2d 23]; see <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>at p. 1106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">As noted, plaintiffs allege that defendant during the class period classified its AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s as exempt from the overtime laws and failed to pay them overtime compensation even though, pursuant to defendant\u2019s uniform company policies and practices, they consistently worked overtime hours and, at least partly as a consequence of operational standardization imposed by defendant among its various stores, in fact spent insufficient time on exempt tasks to justify their being so classified. In moving for class certification, plaintiffs argued to the trial court that, if permitted to proceed on this theory, they could with common proof demonstrate, inter alia, that: (1) defendant required all class members to work more than 40 hours per week; (2) defendant deemed each class member exempt based on his or her job description rather than on any consideration of actual work performed; (3) defendant paid no overtime wages to any class member; (4) defendant categorically reclassified all of its AM\u2019s from exempt to nonexempt in December 1999, without changing their job descriptions or their duties; (5) defendant kept no records of class members\u2019 actual work activities; (6) defendant conducted no studies of how class members spent their work time; (7) defendant did not train class members on the difference between exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>and nonexempt work; (8) defendant\u2019s AM and OM job descriptions were uniform throughout defendant\u2019s operations; and (9) most of the tasks that both plaintiffs\u2019 and defendant\u2019s evidence indicates AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s actually undertook were, as a matter of law, nonexempt. Plaintiffs contend the materials indicating defendant treated its AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s uniformly and assigned them to standardized store operations constitute substantial evidence that common issues will predominate even if individual damage computations ultimately are required.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">In opposing certification, defendant argued that determining its liability, if any, for unpaid overtime compensation necessarily requires making individual computations of how much time each class member actually spent working on specific tasks. Accordingly, defendant argued, plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of policy uniformity and operational standardization is irrelevant and cannot amount to substantial evidence that common issues of law and fact will predominate in the action. In its briefing here, defendant emphasizes that any \u201c[ejvidence, to be \u2018substantial\u2019 must be \u2018of ponderable legal significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738]) and that an appellate court considering whether there is substantial evidence to support a trial court ruling must consider the entire record <em>(id. </em>at p. 577).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Both parties are correct about the general principles guiding our inquiry. Indeed, \u201cwe must consider whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s predominance finding, as a certification ruling not supported by substantial evidence cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1106.) But, \u201c[w]here a certification order turns on inferences to be drawn from the facts, \u2018 \u201cthe reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1287 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 190]; accord, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 272 [279 Cal.Rptr. 576, 807 P.2d 418].) We turn, therefore, to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In moving for certification, plaintiffs presented, inter alia, defendant\u2019s \u201cAssistant Manager\u201d and \u201cOperating Manager\u201d job descriptions (pursuant to which defendant treated all AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s as exempt from the overtime laws for some or all of the class period),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant\u2019s form for conducting performance reviews of \u201cmanagement associates,\u201d and defendant\u2019s memoranda detailing scheduling, compensation and training programs for AM\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>and OM\u2019s. Plaintiffs also presented the deposition of defendant\u2019s designated \u201cperson most knowledgeable,\u201d district manager Frank Paul DeGaetano, defendant\u2019s responses to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories, the interrogatory responses of named plaintiffs Rocher (an OM) and Dahlin (an AM), and the declarations of Mario Gardner (an AM), Richard Featherstone (an OM), and Benissa Clifford and Stephen Aldag (both general managers) describing their work and defendant\u2019s policies and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Defendant presented the declaration of Brad Adams, a human resources manager for defendant\u2019s Southern California Northern Area Drug Division, describing defendant\u2019s stores, policies, and procedures, and declarations from 51 current employees of defendant, each an AM or OM, describing their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Presuming in favor of the certification order, as we must, the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the record <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 576), we cannot say it would be irrational for a court to conclude that, tried on plaintiffs\u2019 theory, \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the individual members\u201d <em>(Washington Mutual, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 913). Rather, as the trial court concluded, the documents, depositions, declarations, and interrogatory responses presented by the parties comprise substantial evidence that common issues of law and fact will predominate over individual issues if the AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s overtime claims are tried as a class action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They are evidence thereof because they comprise \u201ctestimony [and] writings . . . offered to prove\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 140), and having a \u201ctendency in reason to prove\u201d (id., \u00a7 210), that fact. The evidence is substantial because it is not \u201cqualified, tentative and conclusionary\u201d <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1111) but, rather, \u201c \u2018of ponderable legal significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 576).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The record contains substantial, if disputed, evidence that deliberate misclassification was defendant\u2019s policy and practice. The record also contains substantial evidence that, owing in part to operational standardization and perhaps contrary to what defendant expected, classification based on job descriptions alone resulted in widespread de facto misclassification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Either theory is amenable to class treatment. Unquestionably, as the Court of Appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>observed, defendant is entitled to defend against plaintiffs\u2019 complaint by attempting to demonstrate wide variations in the types of stores and, consequently, in the types of activities and amounts of time per workweek the OM\u2019s and AM\u2019s in those stores spent on different types of activities. Nevertheless, a reasonable court crediting plaintiffs\u2019 evidence could conclude it raises substantial issues as to both whether a misclassification policy existed and whether, in any event, a uniform classification policy was put into practice under the standardized conditions alleged. A reasonable court, even allowing for individualized damage determinations, could conclude that, to the extent plaintiffs are able to demonstrate pursuant to either scenario that misclassification was the rule rather than the exception, a class action would be the most efficient means of resolving class members\u2019 overtime claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The record contains substantial evidence suggesting that the predominant issue in dispute is how the various tasks in which AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s actually engaged should be classified\u2014as exempt or nonexempt. We previously have recognized in an overtime exemption case that task classification is a mixed question of law and fact appropriate for a court to address separately from calculating the amount of time specific employees actually spend on specific tasks. <em>(Ramirez v. Yosemite Water, Inc. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 785, 803, fn. 5 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d 2] (Ramirez) [instructing trial court in salesperson overtime exemption case to \u201citemize the types of activities that it considers to be sales related\u201d to \u201cenable an appellate court to review whether the trial court\u2019s legal classifications are correct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On the one hand, each of the 51 declarations by the AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s describing their actual work (including specific tasks) that defendant submitted in opposing certification states that the declarant spends a majority of his or her time on <em>managerial </em>tasks. Plaintiffs characterize most of that same work as nonmanagerial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regardless of who is correct, the fact is the tasks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>discussed in both defendant\u2019s and plaintiffs\u2019 submissions comprise a reasonably definite and finite list. As plaintiffs argued to the trial court, \u201c[t]he only difference between Defendant\u2019s declarations and Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is that the parties disagree on whether certain identical work tasks are \u2018managerial\u2019 or \u2018non-managerial. \u2019 . . . This is an issue that can easily be resolved on a class-wide basis by assigning each task to one side of the \u2018ledger\u2019 and makes the manageability of the case not the daunting task Defendant has sought to portray.\u201d The trial court, in reaching its certification decision, expressly agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Defendant, of course, does not concede the viability of plaintiffs\u2019 misclassification theories. Defendant denies it engaged in deliberate misclassification, claiming it \u201ctreated its OM\u2019s and AM\u2019s as exempt based on its reasonable expectation that managers in those positions would be performing primarily managerial duties.\u201d And defendant challenges plaintiffs\u2019 allegations respecting the effect of standardization in defendant\u2019s operations, pointing out, as the Court of Appeal observed, that its responses to plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories state that the actual tasks performed by class members and the amount of time spent on those tasks vary significantly from manager to manager and cannot be adjudicated on a class-wide basis. But the trial court was within its discretion to credit plaintiffs\u2019 evidence on these points over defendant\u2019s, and we have no authority to substitute our own judgment for the trial court\u2019s respecting this or any other conflict in the evidence. <em>(Walker v. Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 272.) A reasonable court could conclude that issues respecting the proper legal classification of AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s actual activities, along with issues respecting defendant\u2019s policies and practices and issues respecting operational standardization, are likely to predominate in a class proceeding over any individualized calculations of actual overtime hours that might ultimately prove necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The trial court was not deciding\u2014nor are we\u2014the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 case. We previously have recognized, in the certification context, that common issues may be present when a defendant\u2019s tortious acts, as here, \u201callegedly are the same with regard to each plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1107 [noting defendant\u2019s concession]; see <em>Occidental Land, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 355, 362 [134 Cal.Rptr. 388, 556 P.2d 750] <em>(Occidental Land, Inc.) </em>[concerning defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations].) We need not conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is compelling, or even that the trial court would have abused its discretion if it had credited defendant\u2019s evidence instead. \u201c[I]t is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence, or drawing other reasonable inferences, might have reached a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>(Bowers v. Bernards </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 874 [197 Cal.Rptr. 925], italics omitted, citing <em>People v. Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at pp. 576-577.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Defendant asserts that the trial court failed to explain the basis for its finding that common questions predominate, but the record is to the contrary. At the certification hearing, the trial court examined the parties\u2019 contentions in detail. The court specifically noted plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that defendant classified its AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s \u201cexempt without any exception, and rel[ied] exclusively on these titles alone in redefining who is exempt and who is not exempt. The predominance of the defendant\u2019s class-wide exemption is evidenced by the fact that there is no compliance program that\u2019s ever existed, and no single class member has ever received overtime compensation. The class-wide policy does not vary from store to store, or employee to employee.\u201d The court also noted defendant\u2019s \u201crepresentative evidence, the declarations of 51 persons\u201d describing the work of each, which \u201call say that the declarants spend more than 50 percent of their time on managerial activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The trial court also specified the evidence it was relying upon in certifying this action, referencing \u201call the moving papers,\u201d including the parties\u2019 statements respecting common issues, plaintiffs\u2019 multiple exhibits in support of the motion, and \u201cthe testimony of one Frank Paul, last name is D-E-G-AE-T-A-N-O. He\u2019s . . . defendant\u2019s corporate representative, and the person most knowledgeable. And also the defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories that have been involved.\u201d The relevant minute order states that \u201c[t]he motion for class-certification is granted based upon the grounds recited into the record by the court.\u201d And the trial court\u2019s signed order expressly notes the order is based on \u201call admissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Finally, the trial court applied the proper legal criterion for deciding whether to certify a class, stating that plaintiffs had established \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the class action proceeding is superior to alternate means for a fair and efficient adjudication of the litigation.\u201d (Cf. <em>Washington Mutual, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 914 [class treatment must \u201cprovide substantial benefits both to the courts and the litigants\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Defendant does not dispute that class certification may be appropriate in an overtime exemption case, only whether it is appropriate in this case. Defendant suggests this class action is likely to \u201cdegenerate into a multitude of mini-trials,\u201d but, as noted, the evidence to the contrary is substantial. As alleged, each class member\u2019s claim to unpaid overtime depends on whether he or she worked for defendant during the relevant period in a position that was misclassified either deliberately (on a class basis) or circumstantially (again, as a consequence of defendant\u2019s class-wide policies and practices). That calculation of individual damages may at some point be required does not foreclose the possibility of taking common evidence on the misclassification questions. <em>(Collins v. Rocha, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 238 [\u201conly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>issue of damages will require separate proof for each class member\u201d if plaintiffs prove employer misrepresented job terms and conditions]; see, e.g., <em>Hypolite v. Carleson </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 566, 579-581 [125 Cal.Rptr. 221] [need to calculate wrongfully denied benefits individually does not defeat community of interest where class members allege claims based on the same invalid regulation].) In any event, \u201ca class action is not inappropriate simply because each member of the class may at some point be required to make an individual showing as to his or her eligibility for recovery or as to the amount of his or her damages.\u201d <em>(Employment Development Dept. v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 256, 266 [178 Cal.Rptr. 612, 636 P.2d 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Defendant sweepingly asserts, without support, that the portion of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that focused on defendant\u2019s class-wide policies and practices, rather than on \u201cwhether each class member is meeting the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations,\u201d is irrelevant to the predominance issue. But defendant does not suggest any per se bar exists to certification based partly on pattern and practice evidence or similar evidence of a defendant\u2019s class-wide behavior. California courts and others have in a wide variety of contexts considered pattern and practice evidence, statistical evidence, sampling evidence, expert testimony, and other indicators of a defendant\u2019s centralized practices in order to evaluate whether common behavior towards similarly situated plaintiffs makes class certification appropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, as the Court of Appeal recently recognized, the use of statistical sampling in an overtime class action \u201cdoes not dispense with proof of damages but rather offers a different method of proof\u2019 <em>(Bell v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 715, 750 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 544]).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Defendant characterizes plaintiffs\u2019 declarations generally as conclusory and containing \u201cboilerplate,\u201d contrasting what it calls \u201cSav-on\u2019s 52 detailed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>fact-specific declarations.\u201d Such observations, however, go to the weight of the evidence, a matter generally entrusted to the trial court\u2019s discretion. And, as noted, defendant as well as plaintiffs presented evidence respecting defendant\u2019s personnel policies and management structure along with evidence respecting individual managers\u2019 actual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Defendant concedes that Mario Gardner\u2019s declaration described his duties as an AM in a manner that might permit certification had plaintiffs marshaled more such declarations, but argues this single declaration does not support class treatment. Defendant is mistaken. Evidence of even one credible witness \u201cis sufficient for proof of any fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 411.)  And \u201cquestions as to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the construction to be put upon it, the inferences to be drawn therefrom, the credibility of witnesses . . . and the determination of [any] conflicts and inconsistencies in their testimony are matters for the trial court to resolve.\u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 235, 246 [259 P.2d 649].) Moreover, as noted above, Mario Gardner\u2019s was not the only declaration plaintiffs presented to indicate AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s engaged primarily in nonexempt activities. Indeed, on plaintiffs\u2019 theory, even defendant\u2019s declarations may prove relevant on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Nevertheless, defendant insists that because exempt employees are those engaged \u201cin work which is primarily intellectual, managerial or creative, and which requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment\u201d (IWC Wage Order No. 7-98 (eff. Jan. 1, 1998), \u201cthe central factual issues in this dispute [are] the actual tasks performed by class members and the amount of time spent on each of those tasks.\u201d But even if some individualized proof of such facts ultimately is required to parse class members\u2019 claims, that such will predominate in the action does not necessarily follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">We long ago recognized \u201cthat each class member might be required ultimately to justify an individual claim does not necessarily preclude maintenance of a class action.\u201d <em>(Collins v. Rocha, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 238.) Predominance is a comparative concept, and \u201cthe necessity for class members to individually establish eligibility and damages does not mean individual fact questions predominate.\u201d <em>(Reyes v. Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1278; see <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1105; <em>Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 707-710 [63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732].) Individual issues do not render class certification inappropriate so long as such issues may effectively be managed. <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 473; see also <em>Occidental Land, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 363-364; <em>Washington Mutual, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 922.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Nor is it a bar to certification that individual class members may ultimately need to itemize their damages. We have recognized that the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>individualized proof of damages is not per se an obstacle to class treatment <em>(Occidental Land, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 363 [134 Cal.Rptr. 388, 556 P.2d 750] [home buyers\u2019 class action against developer]) and \u201cthat each member of the class must prove his separate claim to a portion of any recovery by the class is only one factor to be considered in determining whether a class action is proper\u201d <em>(Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 809 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964] (Vasquez) [consumers\u2019 class action against finance companies]).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Accordingly, neither variation in the mix of actual work activities undertaken during the class period by individual AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s, nor differences in the total unpaid overtime compensation owed each class member, bar class certification as a matter of law. <em>(Vasquez, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 815 [\u201calthough ultimately each class member will be required in some manner to establish his individual damages this circumstance does not preclude the maintenance of the suit as a class action\u201d]; see <em>Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 707 [\u201cNor is a common recovery necessary in order to establish a community of interest\u201d]; <em>Los Angeles Fire &amp; Protective League v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 67, 74 [99 Cal.Rptr. 908] [\u201cdifferences in sub-groups as to assignments and ranks\u201d among firefighters \u201cin no way detract from\u201d common issues in overtime class action].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u201cIt may be, of course, that the trial court will determine in subsequent proceedings that some of the matters bearing on the right to recovery require separate proof by each class member. If this should occur, the applicable rule ... is that the maintenance of the suit as a class action is not precluded so long as the issues which may be jointly tried, when compared to those requiring separate adjudication, justify the maintenance of the suit as a class action.\u201d <em>(Vasquez, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 815; see <em>Lockheed, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1105.) And if unanticipated or unmanageable individual issues do arise, the trial court retains the option of decertification. <em>(Lazar v. Hertz Corp. </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 128, 144 [191 Cal.Rptr. 849]; see, e.g., <em>O\u2019Connor v. Boeing North American, Inc. </em>(C.D.Cal. 2000) 197 F.R.D. 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Defendant mistakenly suggests that our decision in <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 785, bars class certification in this matter. Defendant argues that when plaintiffs in an overtime case seek class certification, \u201cthe trial court must determine whether the evidence shows that application of the <em>Ramirez </em>factors\u2014the actual tasks performed by each class member, the amount of time each class member spent on those tasks, and how the class member\u2019s practices compare to the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations\u2014raises common questions that predominate over individual issues.\u201d Defendant both misstates and overstates the significance of <em>Ramirez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\"><em>Ramirez </em>was an action for unpaid overtime brought by a bottled-water-route sales representative against his former employer. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 790.) We reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff was exempt under an IWC wage order defining \u201coutside salesperson,\u201d largely because the court had inappropriately relied on certain federal regulations, which varied from California law, in making that determination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 804.) In so doing, we explained that a court deciding whether an employee is an outside salesperson under the applicable state rule should inquire \u201cinto the realistic requirements of the job.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802, italics omitted.) Specifically, we indicated, \u201cthe court should consider . . . how the employee actually spends his or her time\u201d and \u201cwhether the employee\u2019s practice diverges from the employer\u2019s realistic expectations . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><em>Ramirez </em>was not a class action and, to that extent, is not apposite. In <em>Ramirez, </em>we did not even discuss certification standards, let alone change them. Accordingly, <em>Ramirez </em>is no authority for constraining trial courts\u2019 \u201cgreat discretion in granting or denying certification\u201d <em>(Linder, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 435) or, more particularly as defendant asserts, for applying a particular set of \u201cfactors\u201d whenever plaintiffs in an overtime case seek class certification. The certification of a class is a discretionary decision that demands the weighing of many relevant considerations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 435-436.) And even as an overtime exemption case, <em>Ramirez </em>is not particularly apposite. Our analysis was tied to the \u201clogic inherent in the IWC\u2019s quantitative definition of outside salesperson\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 802) and would not necessarily apply, or apply with the same force, in every exemption context. We expressed in <em>Ramirez, </em>for example, a concern that under a pure \u201cactual activity\u201d test, an employee assigned to sell might \u201cevade a valid [outside salesperson] exemption\u201d by his own \u201csubstandard performance\u201d in selling. <em>(Ibid.) </em>No one suggests a similar concern applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">While we recognized that a trial court may have to resolve significant factual discrepancies when applying the salesperson exemption in a particular case <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 803), we did not in <em>Ramirez </em>purport to limit the types of evidence or methods of proof that parties to overtime disputes may bring to bear. Listing considerations relevant to the state test for \u201coutside salesperson,\u201d we simply counseled trial courts to avoid sole reliance either on \u201can employer\u2019s job description\u201d or on \u201cthe actual average hours the employee spent on sales activity\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 802).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Presence in a particular overtime class action of the considerations reviewed in <em>Ramirez </em>does not necessarily preclude class certification. Any dispute over \u201chow the employee actually spends his or her time\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 802), of course, has the potential to generate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>individual issues. But considerations such as \u201cthe employer\u2019s realistic expectations\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>and \u201cthe actual overall requirements of the job\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>are likely to prove susceptible of common proof. Defendant\u2019s \u201crealistic expectations,\u201d in particular, may become relevant in this case, and a reasonable court could conclude these are susceptible of common proof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defendant would have us extend <em>Ramirez </em>to shield employers from an action challenging a type of illegality that our decision in that case was actually designed to prevent. One of our core concerns in <em>Ramirez </em>was that \u201cif hours worked on sales were determined through the employer\u2019s job description, ... the employer could make an employee exempt from the overtime laws solely by fashioning an idealized job description that had little basis in reality.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 802.) Here, defendant allegedly promulgated exempt job descriptions, but implemented policies and practices that failed to afford its AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s true managerial discretion, and standardized store operations so that managers were obliged to spend over 50 percent of their time doing the same tasks as their subordinates.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant suggests we bar class certification of an action based on such allegations, on the somewhat ironic (and only half-stated) surmise that some individual AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s may, in fact, have labored below the 50 percent mark on nonexempt tasks notwithstanding defendant\u2019s alleged class-wide policies and practices either designed or destined to assure the contrary. We decline the invitation. Contrary to defendant\u2019s implication, our observation in <em>Ramirez </em>that whether the employee is an outside salesperson depends \u201cfirst and foremost, [on] how the employee actually spends his or her time\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>at p. 802) did not create or imply a requirement that courts assess an employer\u2019s affirmative exemption defense against every class member\u2019s claim before certifying an overtime class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Moreover, defendant\u2019s proposed reading of <em>Ramirez </em>would require, essentially, that a certification proponent in an overtime class action prove the entire class was nonexempt whenever a defendant raises the affirmative defense of exemption. But in <em>Ramirez </em>itself we recognized that \u201cthe assertion of an exemption from the overtime laws is considered to be an affirmative defense, and therefore the employer bears the burden of proving the employee\u2019s exemption.\u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 794-795; accord, <em>Nordquist v. McGraw-Hill Broadcasting Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 555, 562 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 221] [an \u201cemployer bears the burden of proving an employee is exempt\u201d].) Were we to require as a prerequisite to certification that plaintiffs demonstrate defendant\u2019s classification policy was, as the Court of Appeal put it, either \u201cright as to all members of the class or wrong as to all members of the class,\u201d we effectively would reverse that burden. <em>Ramirez </em>is no authority for such a requirement, nor does the logic of predominance require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In sum, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Ramirez </em>is misplaced. Perhaps realizing this, the Court of Appeal did not rely on that case or even cite it. But the Court of Appeal went astray in other ways. Although its summary of the evidence submitted on certification was generally accurate, the Court of Appeal erred to the extent it engaged in any reweighing of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">After reviewing defendant\u2019s evidence respecting store variations, the Court of Appeal noted plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of defendant\u2019s uniform policies and standardization, plaintiffs\u2019 declarations from AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s relating their experience of what defendant\u2019s employees in those positions actually did, and the interrogatory evidence submitted both by defendant and plaintiffs also respecting actual tasks performed by class members. Thereafter, the court opined that plaintiffs\u2019 declarations were \u201cnot determinative\u201d and \u201cnot conclusive\u201d because defendant\u2019s evidence, in particular the declaration of defendant\u2019s human resources manager Brad Adams, \u201cshowed the work of all the AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s is not uniform or identical.\u201d But a reviewing court is not authorized to overturn a certification order merely because it finds the record evidence of predominance less than determinative or conclusive. The relevant question on review is whether such evidence is <em>substantial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Court of Appeal also erred to the extent it stated or implied that the community of interest requirement for certification mandates that class members\u2019 claims be uniform or identical. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory does not depend on class members having identical claims, nor does the law of class certification require such. <em>(Vasquez, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 809 [\u201ca community of interest does not depend upon an identical recovery\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Finally, the Court of Appeal erroneously cited <em>City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701] <em>(San </em>Jose) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>suggesting trial courts must \u201cdeny class certification when each member\u2019s right to recover depends on facts individual to the member\u2019s case.\u201d In <em>San Jose, </em>the trial court had certified a class of property owners pressing claims against a municipal airport. We reversed, remarking at one point that the general rule \u201cthat a class action cannot be maintained where each member\u2019s right to recover depends on facts peculiar to his case . . . remains viable in this state.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 459.) But reading this categorical extract out of context would misstate the established legal standard for commonality, which, as previously noted, is comparative.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our holding in <em>San Jose </em>was, in fact, expressly comparative (see <em>San Jose, supra, </em>at p. 460 [comparing \u201cthe issues which may be jointly tried\u201d with \u201cthose requiring separate adjudication\u201d]), and we consistently have adhered to that approach (see, e.g., <em>Washington Mutual, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at pp. 913-914, quoting <em>San Jose, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 460).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Courts seeking to preserve efficiency and other benefits of class actions routinely fashion methods to manage individual questions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For decades \u201c[t]his court has urged trial courts to be procedurally innovative\u201d <em>(San Jose, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 453) in managing class actions, and \u201cthe trial court has an obligation to consider the use of . . . innovative procedural tools proposed by a party to certify a manageable class\u201d <em>(Osborne </em>v. <em>Subaru of America, Inc. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 646, 653 [243 Cal.Rptr. 815], citing <em>Occidental Land, Inc., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 360, fn. 3; <em>Linder, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 440 [in class actions, \u201ctrial courts must be accorded the flexibility \u2018to adopt innovative procedures\u2019 \u201d]).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such devices permit defendants to \u201cpresent their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>opposition, and to raise certain affirmative defenses.\u201d <em>(Day v. NLO, supra, </em>851 F.Supp. at p. 876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Considerations of sound public policy buttress our conclusion. Labor Code section 1194 confirms \u201ca clear public policy . . . that is specifically directed at the enforcement of California\u2019s minimum wage and overtime laws for the benefit of workers.\u201d <em>(Earley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1420, 1429-1430 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 57].) As defendant\u2019s own authority reminds us, California\u2019s overtime laws are remedial and are to be construed so as to promote employee protection. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 794.) And, as we have recognized, \u201cthis state has a public policy which encourages the use of the class action device.\u201d <em>(Richmond v. Dart Industries, Inc., supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 473.) \u201c \u2018By establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time, the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress for claims which would otherwise be too small to warrant individual litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Many of the issues likely to be most vigorously contested in this dispute, as noted, are common ones. Absent class treatment, each individual plaintiff would present in separate, duplicative proceedings the same or essentially the same arguments and evidence, including expert testimony. The result would be a multiplicity of trials conducted at enormous expense to both the judicial system and the litigants. \u201cIt would be neither efficient nor fair to anyone, including defendants, to force multiple trials to hear the same evidence and decide the same issues.\u201d <em>(Boggs v.

A well-defined community of interest exists if common questions of law and fact predominate. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Common issues may predominate even if \u201ceach member of the class must prove his separate claim to a portion of any recovery by the class . . . .\u201d <em>(Vasquez v.

I therefore begin my analysis by determining the issues and reviewing the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">In their complaint, plaintiffs Robert Rocher and Connie Dahlin alleged that defendant Sav-on Drug Stores, Inc., misclassified its assistant managers (AM\u2019s) and operating managers (OM\u2019s) as exempt from the overtime wage laws. As a result, defendant improperly compensated plaintiffs and other similarly situated AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s as salaried managers and failed to pay them overtime compensation. Plaintiffs sought to certify as a class \u201call current and former salaried [OM\u2019s] and current and former salaried [AM\u2019s] employed by defendant ... in California at any time between April 3, 1996 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and June 22, 2001, inclusive.\u201d Thus, the primary issue framed by the pleadings is whether defendant\u2019s AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s are exempt from the statutory overtime provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The question of whether defendant\u2019s AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s are exempt employees \u201cis, like other questions involving the application of legal categories, a mixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>(Ramirez </em>v. <em>Yosemite Water Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 785, 794 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 978 P.2d 2] <em>(Ramirez).) </em>In determining whether an employee is exempt, the trial court must inquire \u201cinto the <em>realistic </em>requirements of the job. In so doing, the court should consider, first and foremost, how the employee actually spends his or her time. But the trial court should also consider whether the employee\u2019s practice diverges from the employer\u2019s realistic expectations, whether there was any concrete expression of employer displeasure over an employee\u2019s substandard performance, and whether these expressions were themselves realistic given the actual overall requirements of the job.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 802.) \u201c[Ejxemptions from statutory mandatory overtime provisions are narrowly construed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 794.) \u201cMoreover, the assertion of an exemption from the overtime laws is considered to be an affirmative defense, and therefore the employer bears the burden of proving the employee\u2019s exemption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 794-795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">With this framework in mind, I now turn to the question presented on appeal; whether there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the common issues of law and fact predominate. After carefully reviewing the evidence in the record in light of the relevant law, I conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">As an initial matter, the issue of whether defendant intentionally misclassified its managers as exempt employees is an issue common to both the AM and OM classes. This issue is not, by itself, sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the common issues predominate, because plaintiffs would still have to prove both liability and damages subsequent to the class judgment. (See <em>City of San Jose v. Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 463 [\u201cOnly in an extraordinary situation would a class action be justified where, subsequent to the class judgment, the members would be required to individually prove not only damages but also liability\u201d].) But the existence of this common issue certainly supports the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">A review of the record then provides the additional evidence needed to substantiate the trial court\u2019s finding. With respect to the AM class, the declarations from individual AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s submitted by plaintiffs constitute substantial evidence that the common issues predominate. According to these declarants, defendant consistently required AM\u2019s to work over 40 hours a week. A former general manager and OM further averred that, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>their years of experience at different stores owned and operated by defendant, \u201c[t]he type of work performed by [AM\u2019s] does not vary by store. Each Sav-on store was and is operated in the same manner, and require[s] the same essential work, as one might expect in a chain of retail stores. Therefore, the actual work performed by [AM\u2019s] on a daily basis was virtually identical in Sav-on stores, and remains so.\u201d These declarations provide substantial evidence that the realistic requirements of the AM job are identical for all AM\u2019s and that AM\u2019s, on average, spend the same amount of time on the same types of tasks. Defendant\u2019s subsequent and independent decision to reclassify <em>all </em>AM\u2019s as nonexempt employees entitled to overtime compensation bolsters this conclusion. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the common issues predominate with respect to the AM class.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The same reasoning does not, however, apply to the OM class. While plaintiffs submitted multiple declarations attesting to the work and duties of AM\u2019s, they submitted <em>no </em>declarations attesting to the work and duties of OM\u2019s. Indeed, the only evidence in the record demonstrating that all OM\u2019s spend the same amount of time performing the same types of tasks comes from the special interrogatory responses of Rocher. But these statements are not sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s findings as to the OM class. Rocher merely states that he\u2014and no other OM\u2014spent over 50 percent of his time on nonexempt activities. And although Rocher asserts that \u201c[defendant has an expressed policy and practice of requiring [OM\u2019s] to . . . spend a majority of their time performing nonexempt tasks,\u201d he provides no foundation or evidentiary support for this assertion. As such, his interrogatory responses are too qualified and conclusory to support the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs will be able to establish defendant\u2019s liability for overtime compensation to the OM\u2019s by common evidence. (See <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1096, 1111 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 63 P.3d 913] (plur. opn. of Werdegar, J.) [holding that the evidence is \u201ctoo qualified, tentative and conclusionary to constitute substantial evidence\u201d in support of class certification]; see also <em>Lockheed Martin, </em>at p. 1114 (conc. opn. of Brown, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Nonetheless, a careful review of the record reveals substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding with respect to the OM class. In <em>Ramirez, </em>we suggested that the classification of tasks as exempt or nonexempt may be susceptible to common proof. (See <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 803, fn. 5.) This appears to be especially true in this case where, as demonstrated by defendant\u2019s own evidence, the OM\u2019s perform a finite number of tasks on a regular basis. The record further indicates that plaintiffs and defendant disagree over the classification of many of the tasks regularly performed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>OM\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given the number and significance of the tasks in dispute, the trial court could reasonably conclude that the proper classification of these tasks, when combined with the classifications agreed upon by the parties, will largely resolve the issue of whether all OM\u2019s should be classified as exempt or nonexempt employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, many of the variables that, according to defendant, render the OM\u2019s inappropriate for class treatment\u2014like store type, store size, and the number of store employees\u2014may form the basis for appropriate subclasses. The trial court could reasonably conclude that the creation of these subclasses would sufficiently reduce the need for individual litigation as to each member of the class. (See <em>Vasquez, </em>supra, 4 Cal.3d at p. 821 [noting that the creation of subclasses may promote the efficiency of a class action].) Accordingly, I find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in certifying the class of AM\u2019s and OM\u2019s and join the majority in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-4\"> Defining the precise contours of their disagreement is somewhat difficult due to the vagueness of the parties\u2019 descriptions of the tasks regularly performed by OM\u2019s. But, at a minimum, the parties appear to disagree over whether the following tasks should be classified as exempt or nonexempt: merchandising, the unloading/movement of inventory, customer service, cash handling, finance-related activities, and the opening/closing of the store.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-5\"> The same reasoning applies to the AM class as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
