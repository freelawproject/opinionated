Predatory lending is most likely to occur in the rapidly growing \u201csubprime\u201d mortgage market, which is a market generally providing access to borrowers with impaired credit, limited income, or high debt relative to their income. Mortgages in this market tend to be in smaller amounts, and with faster prepayments and significantly higher interest rates and fees, than \u201cprime\u201d mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">In 2001, California enacted legislation to combat predatory lending practices that typically occur in the subprime home mortgage market. (Fin. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 4970-4979.8 (Division 1.6).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Eight days before Division 1.6 was signed into law by the Governor, the City of Oakland adopted an ordinance regulating predatory lending practices in the Oakland home mortgage market.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>We consider whether the Ordinance is preempted by Division 1.6, and if not, whether the Ordinance is nevertheless preempted by Civil Code section 1916.12. We conclude that the Ordinance is preempted by Division 1.6, and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-4\">I. Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">On October 15, 2001, American Financial Services Association (AFSA) filed this action against the City of Oakland and the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Oakland (City) seeking a declaration that the Ordinance was preempted by state law, and an injunction against its enforcement. On October 25, 2001, by stipulated order, the Ordinance was stayed pending, as relevant here, final resolution of this action. In December 2001, the trial court denied AFSA\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Ordinance, and AFSA appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On June 21, 2002, the trial court entered an order finding that the Ordinance was preempted to the extent that it exempted federally chartered lending institutions from its restrictions. The court held that the sentence exempting such institutions should be severed from the Ordinance. Subject to elimination of the federal exemption, the court denied AFSA\u2019s summary judgment motion and granted the City\u2019s. Judgment was entered severing the sentence exempting federal lenders, dismissing AFSA\u2019s complaint, and deeming the Ordinance valid as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">AFSA appealed from the judgment, and the City cross-appealed. The Court of Appeal ordered the appeals and cross-appeal consolidated. The court held the Ordinance was not preempted by either Division 1.6 or Civil Code section 1916.12. It reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment insofar as it ordered severance of the portion of the Ordinance exempting federally chartered lenders from its coverage. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. AFSA\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction was dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">We granted AFSA\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1284-5\">According to its legislative history, the purpose of Division 1.6 was to regulate and thereby curtail predatory lending practices that typically occur in the subprime mortgage market.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Division 1.6 applies to any \u201ccovered loan,\u201d which is a \u201cconsumer loan in which the original principal balance of the loan does not exceed\u201d $250,000 \u201cin the case of a mortgage or deed of trust,\u201d and either of two conditions are met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 4970, subd. (b)(1)(A), (B).) A \u201cconsumer loan\u201d is defined as \u201ca consumer credit transaction that is secured by real property located in this state used, or intended to be used or occupied, as the principal dwelling of the consumer that is improved by a one-to-four residential unit.\u201d (\u00a7 4970, subd. (d).) A consumer loan does not include a bridge loan, a reverse mortgage, an open line of credit as defined by federal regulation, or a \u201cconsumer credit transaction that is secured by rental property or second homes.\u201d (\u00a7 4970, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-6\">Division 1.6 contains numerous prohibitions and limitations with respect to covered loans. For example, a person who originates covered loans shall not (1) \u201cmake a covered loan that finances points and fees in excess of\u2019 the higher of $1,000 or 6 percent of the original principal balance, exclusive of points and fees (\u00a7 4979.6); (2) \u201cmake or arrange a covered loan unless at the time the loan is consummated, the person reasonably believes the consumer . . . will be able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation based\u201d on specified factors (\u00a7 4973, subd. (f)(1)); (3) \u201cpay a contractor under a home-improvement contract from the proceeds of a covered loan other than by an instrument payable to the consumer,\u201d both the consumer and the contractor, or under certain circumstances to a third party escrow agent (id., subd. (g)); (4) \u201crecommend or encourage a consumer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>default on an existing consumer loan or other debt in connection with the solicitation or making of a covered loan that refinances all or any portion of the existing consumer loan or debt\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (h)); (5) \u201crefinance or arrange for the refinancing of a consumer loan such that the new loan is a covered loan that is made for the purpose of refinancing, debt consolidation or cash out, that does not result in an identifiable benefit to the consumer\u201d after considering various factors (id., subd. (j)); (6) \u201csteer, counsel, or direct any prospective consumer to accept a loan product with a risk grade less favorable than the risk grade that the consumer would qualify for\u201d based on certain information <em>(id., </em>subd. (/)(!)); (7) \u201cfinance, directly or indirectly, into a consumer loan or finance to the same borrower within 30 days of a consumer loan any credit life, credit disability, credit property, or credit unemployment insurance premiums, or any debt cancellation or suspension agreement fees, provided that credit insurance premiums, debt cancellation, or suspension fees calculated and paid on a monthly basis shall not be considered financed by the person originating the loan\u201d (\u00a7 4979.7); (8) structure a loan transaction as an open-end credit plan for the purpose of evading Division 1.6 if the \u201cloan would have been a covered loan if the loan had been structured as a closed end loan\u201d (\u00a7 4973, subd. (m)(l)); (9) divide any loan transaction into separate parts for the purpose of evading Division 1.6 (\u00a7 4973, subd. (m)(2)); or (10) \u201cact in any manner, whether specifically prohibited by this section or of a different character <em>[sic], </em>that constitutes fraud\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (n)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">Moreover, a covered loan shall not (1) include a \u201cprepayment fee or penalty after the first 36 months after the date of\u2019 loan consummation, but \u201cmay include a prepayment fee or penalty up to the first 36 months after the date of\u2019 loan consummation under certain conditions (\u00a7 4973, subd. (a)(1), (2)); (2) \u201ccontain a provision for negative amortization such that the payment schedule for regular monthly payments causes the principal balance to increase, unless the covered loan is a first mortgage\u201d and appropriate disclosure made <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)); (3) \u201cinclude terms under which periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)); (4) \u201ccontain a provision that increases the interest rate as a result of a default\u201d except under certain circumstances <em>(id., </em>subd. (e)); (5) generally \u201ccontain a call provision that permits the lender, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (i)); or (6) be made unless a seven-paragraph disclosure form set forth in section 4973, subdivision (k)(l), which includes encouragement to the borrower to consider financial counseling, is provided to the consumer no later than three business days before signing of the loan documents. A \u201ccovered loan with a term of 5 years or less may not provide at origination for a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that when aggregated do not fully amortize the principal balance as of the maturity date of the loan.\u201d (\u00a7 4973, subd. (b)(1).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>\u201cFor a payment schedule that is adjusted to account for the seasonal or irregular income of the consumer, the total installments in any year shall not exceed the amount of one year\u2019s worth of payments on the loan.\u201d (\u00a7 4973, subd. (b)(2).) In addition, a \u201cperson who provides brokerage services to a borrower in a covered loan transaction by soliciting lenders or otherwise negotiating a consumer loan secured by real property, is the fiduciary of the consumer, and any violation of the person\u2019s fiduciary duties shall be a violation of\u2019 section 4979.5. (\u00a7 4979.5, subd. (a).) \u201cExcept for a broker or a person who provides brokerage services,\u201d however, \u201cno licensed person or subsequent assignee shall have administrative, civil, or criminal liability for a violation of\u2019 section 4979.5. (\u00a7 4979.5, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">Similarly, the Ordinance regulates predatory lending practices in home loans in Oakland. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5.33.010, 5.33.030.) A \u201chome loan\u201d does not include a reverse mortgage, and is defined as a \u201cloan of money, including without limitation a line of credit or an open-end credit plan,\u201d if certain criteria apply. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 5.33.030.) One criteria is that the \u201cprincipal amount of the loan does not exceed the current conforming first mortgage loan size limit for a single-family dwelling as established by the Federal National Mortgage Association.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Since January 1, 2005, that amount has been $359,6507 In addition, the borrower must incur the loan primarily for personal, family, or household uses, and the loan must be secured in whole or in part by a deed of trust, mortgage, or similar security device on real property located within Oakland. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.030.) The real property must (or will) contain either one to four residential units or \u201cindividual residential units of condominiums or cooperatives,\u201d one of which is or will be the borrower\u2019s principal dwelling. <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\"><em>A </em>\u201chigh-cost\u201d home loan is a home loan that meets one of two specified thresholds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.030.) The Court of Appeal observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>that the \u201c \u2018high-cost home loan\u2019 interest rate and fee thresholds are both lower than the threshold levels for \u2018covered loans\u2019 set by [Division 1.6]. . . .\u201d \u201c[I]t is undisputed that the high-cost loan provisions of the Ordinance would apply to all home loans falling under the \u2018covered loan\u2019 provisions of the state statute, and also reach some loans that do not come under the state law provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-4\">Like Division 1.6, the Ordinance contains numerous prohibitions and limitations with respect to home loans and \u201chigh-cost\u201d home loans. The Ordinance prohibits prepayment penalties for high-cost and certain refinanced home loans, and limits prepayment penalties for other home loans. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.040(A).) For home loans generally, no lender may (1) \u201cfinance any credit life, credit disability, credit property, or credit unemployment insurance, or any other life or health insurance premiums when making a home loan\u201d; (2) \u201crecommend or encourage a borrower to default or not to make a payment on a home loan or any other debt, when such lender action is in connection with the closing or planned closing of a home loan that refinances all or part of the borrower\u2019s debt\u201d; or (3) \u201cmake a home loan that violates any applicable provision\u201d of certain federal laws regulating lending. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.040(B), (C), (D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">In addition, the following practices are prohibited for high-cost home loans: (1) making the loan without obtaining written certification from an independent and approved housing or credit counselor that the borrower has contacted the counselor and either received counseling about the advisability of the loan transaction or waived in writing the counseling option; (2) making a loan unless the lender reasonably believes the borrower will be able to make the scheduled payments based on certain detailed criteria; (3) financing points and fees exceeding $800 or 5 percent of the loan amount, whichever is greater; (4) making a loan \u201cthat includes terms under which more than two periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the borrower\u201d; (5) charging a fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a loan or defer any payment, except under certain conditions; (6) including terms that allow the lender to accelerate the indebtedness in its discretion except for certain circumstances; (7) including a provision increasing the interest rate if the borrower defaults or is delinquent, except in certain circumstances; (8) making a loan that \u201cpays off all or part of an existing home loan or other debt of the borrower, and the borrower does not receive a reasonable and tangible net benefit from the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>high-cost home loan considering all the circumstances,\u201d as delineated; and (9) making a loan that \u201cpays off all or part of an existing home loan, and such existing loan\u201d is a specified government or nonprofit loan unless an independent housing or credit counselor has determined that the refinance is in the borrower\u2019s best interests. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.050.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">Thus, Division 1.6 and the Ordinance are similar in that they regulate the same subject matter, i.e., predatory lending practices in home mortgages. However, Division 1.6 and the Ordinance differ in significant respects with regard to how they regulate these predatory practices. For example, Division 1.6 does \u201cnot impose liability on an assignee that is a holder in due course\u201d and the provisions of the division do not apply to \u201cpersons chartered by Congress to engage in secondary mortgage market transactions.\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4979.8.) The Ordinance expressly applies to a holder in due course. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.070 [\u201cAny person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a home loan is subject to all claims, actions and defenses related to that home loan that the borrower, the City Attorney, or others could assert against the original lender\u201d].) Moreover, Division 1.6 permits prepayment penalties under certain conditions during the first 36 months of the loan; the Ordinance prohibits them for all high-cost and certain refinanced home loans, and limits them for other home loans. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4973, subd. (a); Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.040(A).) In addition, Division 1.6 requires that borrowers be encouraged in writing to seek loan counseling; the Ordinance prohibits a high-cost home loan being made without either the borrower receiving loan counseling or giving the credit counselor a written waiver of counseling. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4973, subd. (k)(l); Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.050(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">In addition to other enforcement mechanisms, Division 1.6 and the Ordinance both allow for civil and criminal penalties and for civil enforcement by borrowers, including punitive damages. (Fin. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4975, subd. (c), 4977, subds. (b), (c), 4978, subds. (a), (b)(2); Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5.33.080, 5.33.100.) However, Division 1.6 imposes civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation; the Ordinance imposes such penalties up to the amount of $50,000. (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4977, subd. (b); Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.080(D).) Under Division 1.6, the amounts collected from such civil penalties are to be used by the \u201clicensing agency, subject to appropriation by the Legislature, for the purposes of education and enforcement in connection with abusive lending practices.\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4977, subd. (g).) The amounts collected by the Ordinance presumably simply go into the city coffers. Punitive damages are available under Division 1.6 \u201cupon a finding that such damages are warranted pursuant to Section 3294 of the Civil Code\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4978, subd. (b) (2), which requires \u201cclear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294, subd. (a)); the Ordinance allows punitive damages \u201cif the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the lender has shown reckless disregard for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>rights of the borrower.\u201d (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.080(A)(5).) Division 1.6 provides that nothing in section 4978, which addresses civil liability, \u201cis intended, nor shall be construed, to abrogate existing common law provisions prohibiting double recovery of damages.\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4978, subd. (c).) The Ordinance, however, expressly notes its remedies \u201care cumulative. The protections and remedies provided under this chapter are in addition to other protections and remedies that may be otherwise available under law. Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the rights of any injured person to recover damages or pursue any other legal or equitable action under any other applicable law or legal theory.\u201d (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.080(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">We now turn to the question of whether these similarities and differences may coexist or, if instead, the Ordinance is preempted by Division 1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">\u201cUnder article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution, \u2018[a] county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sherwin-Williams Co. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 893, 897 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 844 P.2d 534] (,Sherwin-Williams).) In addition, charter cities such as Oakland may adopt and enforce ordinances that conflict with general state laws, provided the subject of the regulation is a \u201cmunicipal affair\u201d rather than one of \u201cstatewide concern.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Oak. City Charter, \u00a7 106; see <em>Johnson v. Bradley </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 389, 399 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 470, 841 P.2d 990].) Here, however, the City reasonably concedes regulation of predatory practices in mortgage lending is one of statewide concern. Under these circumstances, the parties agree that if the Ordinance conflicts with state law, it is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">A conflict between state law and an ordinance exists if the ordinance duplicates or is coextensive therewith, is contradictory or inimical thereto, or enters an area either expressly or impliedly fully occupied by general law. <em>(Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 897-898.) Relying solely on the Legislature\u2019s failure to include express preemption language and the unique local interests of Oakland, the City contends that Division 1.6 sets only \u201cstatewide minimum standards, not statewide uniform standards, for subprime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>home mortgage lending.\u201d We conclude that in enacting Division 1.6 the Legislature has impliedly fully occupied the field of regulation of predatory practices in home mortgage lending, and hence the Ordinance is preempted on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">\u201c[I]t is well settled that local regulation is invalid if it attempts to impose additional requirements in a field which is fully occupied by statute.\u201d <em>(Tolman </em>v. <em>Underhill </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 708, 712 [249 P.2d 280] <em>(Tolman).) </em>\u201c[L]ocal legislation enters an area that is \u2018fully occupied\u2019 by general law when the Legislature has expressly manifested its intent to \u2018fully occupy\u2019 the area [citation], or when it has impliedly done so in light of one of the following indicia of intent: \u2018(1) the subject matter has been so fully and completely covered by general law as to clearly indicate that it has become exclusively a matter of state concern; (2) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law couched in such terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state concern will not tolerate further or additional local action; or (3) the subject matter has been partially covered by general law, and the subject is of such a nature that the adverse effect of a local ordinance on the transient citizens of the state outweighs the possible benefit to the\u2019 locality [citations].\u201d <em>(Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">Here, of course, there is no express preemption language in Division 1.6. However, there are clear indications of the Legislature\u2019s implicit intent to fully occupy the field of regulation of predatory lending tactics in home mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">\u201cWhere the Legislature has adopted statutes governing a particular subject matter, its intent with regard to occupying the field to the exclusion of all local regulation is not to be measured alone by the language used but by the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>(Tolman, supra, 39 </em>Cal.2d at p. 712; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Beville </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 852, 859 [306 P.2d 789] <em>(Wilson) </em>[same]; see <em>In re Lane </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 99, 102-103 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897] <em>(Lane).) </em>\u201cState regulation of a subject may be so complete and detailed as to indicate an intent to preclude local regulation. [Citations.] In this connection it may be significant that the subject is one which . . . requires uniform treatment throughout the state.\u201d <em>(Chavez v.

We observed the \u201cexercise of the power of eminent domain is a matter of statewide concern.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 859.) \u201cThe Legislature has provided a complete and detailed system for exercising the right of eminent domain and assessing compensation,\u201d such that charter provisions making more onerous the recovery of compensation were invalid. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 859-861; <em>id. </em>at p. 860 <em>[\u201cThe Legislature has fully occupied the field of eminent </em>domain\u201d].) \u201cIf the city may enact such legislation or charter provisions the land owner is denied equal protection of the laws for the state statute would fix the limitation where the condemnor was a public utility but a different one would prevail where the condemnor was a municipal corporation. There is no distinction between such condemnors. The city along with public utilities are made equally liable by the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">Similarly, in <em>Eastlick </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 661, 665 [177 P.2d 558] <em>(Eastlick), </em>the plaintiff\u2019s claim in a personal injury action based on state law \u201cconcededly was complete as measured by the requirements of the state law.\u201d However, the city argued judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor should be reversed because of her failure to itemize the damages in her claim as required by the city charter. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 664-665.)

It delineates at length what mortgages are covered, what lending acts are prohibited, who can be held liable for violations of Division 1.6, the various enforcement mechanisms available, who may invoke such enforcement mechanisms, and defenses to such violations. The provisions of Division 1.6 \u201care so extensive in their scope that they clearly show an intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>by the Legislature to adopt a general scheme for the regulation of\u2019 predatory lending tactics in home mortgages. <em>(Lane, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">Moreover, in regulating such lending tactics in home mortgages, the Legislature was not suddenly entering an area previously governed by municipalities and unexplored at a statewide level. To the contrary, as the City acknowledges, regulation of mortgage lenders has historically occurred at the state, not the municipal, level. (See, e.g., Fin. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5000 et seq. [Savings Association Law], 50000 et seq. [California Residential Mortgage Lending Act]; Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2947-2955.5 [mortgage of real property provisions].) In determining whether the Legislature intended to occupy the field of regulation of predatory home mortgage lending, we consider this historical role, and view Division 1.6 not in isolation, but as part of an overall legislative scheme addressing mortgage lending. As the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest to Division 1.6 notes, \u201cExisting law provides for regulation of banks and savings associations by the Department of Financial Institutions. Existing law provides for regulation of real estate brokers by the Department of Real Estate. Existing law provides for regulation of finance lenders and residential mortgage lenders by the Department of Corporations. Existing law provides that willful violations of provisions governing savings associations, real estate brokers, and residential mortgage lenders are crimes. [][] This bill would impose various requirements on consumer loans secured by specified real property, defined as \u2018covered loans.\u2019 \u201d (Stats. 2001, ch. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">Indeed, when asked at oral argument, the City could point to no other instance in over 150 years of state history where a municipality had attempted to regulate mortgage lending. Thus, state activity in the area of regulation of mortgage lending was not only historically dominant, it was exclusive. (Cf. <em>United States v. Locke </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 89, 108 [146 L.Ed.2d 69, 120 S.Ct. 1135] [finding no presumption against federal preemption regarding regulation of maritime commerce]; compare <em>Bronco Wine Co. v. Jolly </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 943, 974 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 180, 95 P.3d 422] [strong presumption against federal preemption of state wine label regulation given that state activity in this area historically extensive and dominant].) Thus, mortgage lending is unlike the area of gun control law, on which the City and the dissent rely, in which courts have concluded that the Legislature has chosen to legislate narrowly, and \u201crather than intending to deprive municipalities of their police power to regulate handgun sales, . . . has been cautious about depriving local municipalities of aspects of their constitutional police power to deal with local conditions.\u201d <em>(California Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of West Hollywood </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1318 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 591]; see <em>Great Western Shows, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 853, 865, 866 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 746, 44 P.3d 120] <em>(Great </em>Western) [noting state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>laws regulating gun shows expressly refer to applicable local laws]; dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1267, 1272.) As one amicus curiae notes, the City does not demonstrate that in the area of regulating residential mortgages, the Legislature has attempted \u201cto tread lightly on a narrow path.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">Moreover, it is beyond peradventure that effective regulation of mortgage lending, and in particular here abusive practices in such lending, \u201crequires uniform treatment throughout the state.\u201d <em>(Chavez, supra, 52 </em>Cal.2d at p. 177; see <em>Northern Cal. Psychiatric Society v. City of Berkeley </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 90, 101 [223 Cal.Rptr. 609] [\u201c \u2018Certain areas of human behavior command statewide uniformity, especially the regulation of statewide commercial activities\u2019 \u201d].) California\u2019s housing market is one of its most critical, and securities based on home loans in this market are sold not only on a statewide, but on a national level. (Eggert, <em>Held Up in Due Course: Predatory Lending, Securitization, and the Holder in Due Course Doctrine </em>(2002) 35 Creighton L. Rev. 503, 536 [\u201cThrough securitization, the source of capital for mortgage funding has been transferred from the savings industry, which used deposits to fund loans, to the capital markets and the portfolios of institutional investors\u201d].) Commercial reality today would confound any effective regulation of mortgage lending based on potentially hundreds of competing and inconsistent measures at the local level. Rather, centralized command over such mortgage lending practices provides an essential \u201cregulatory lever.\u201d <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1, 23 [283 Cal.Rptr. 569, 812 P.2d 916] <em>(Calif. Fed.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">We therefore conclude that through the enactment of Division 1.6, the Legislature has fully occupied the field of regulation of predatory tactics in home mortgages. While in other cases the determination of whether the state and local laws occupy the same \u201cfield\u201d may be somewhat nuanced, little is left to the imagination of even the most casual reader here. Both Division 1.6 and the Ordinance regulate predatory lending tactics in home mortgages, and do so in parallel fashion. The Ordinance, like Division 1.6, addresses at length what mortgages are covered, what lending acts are prohibited, who can be held liable for violations of the Ordinance, the various enforcement mechanisms available, who may invoke such enforcement mechanisms, and defenses to such violations. As previously observed, it is undisputed the Ordinance applies to at least all home loans covered by Division 1.6. Moreover, the Ordinance regulates many of the same predatory practices addressed by Division 1.6, and prevalent in subprime lending, such as excessive prepayment fees, making loans without any reasonable expectation they can be repaid, refinancing with no benefit to the borrower, encouraging default on an existing loan in connection with refinancing that loan, financing unnecessary products such as credit insurance, unfairly accelerating indebtedness, and financing excessive points and fees. Thus, the Ordinance is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>supplementary legislation that in other contexts might be allowed, but a line-item veto of those policy decisions by the Legislature with which the City disagrees. In revisiting this area fully occupied by state law, the Ordinance undermines the considered judgments and choices of the Legislature, and is therefore preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">In drafting Division 1.6, the Legislature balanced two compelling and competing considerations, i.e., the need to protect particularly vulnerable consumers from predatory lending practices and the concern that homeowners not be unduly hindered in accessing the equity in their own homes. (See, e.g., Sen. Judiciary Com., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 489 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 21, 2001, p. 2 [\u201cAlthough many subprime lenders offer a vital service to some low-income borrowers who would not otherwise qualify for credit, many other low-income borrowers have been victimized by improper practices . . . referred to ... as \u2018predatory practices\u2019 \u201d]; Assem. Republican Bill Analysis, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 489 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 6, 2001, p. 3 [noting federal regulators \u201cbelieve that responsible sub-prime lending can expand credit access for consumers,\u201d and that \u201c \u2018a practice that can be abusive in some contexts can also-in [the] absence of fraud or deception-be highly beneficial to consumers .... Well meaning but haphazard reactions on the part of the regulators . . . may have the unintended consequence of hurting those whom we intend to help\u2019 \u201d]; Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 489 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 1, 2001, p. 2 [\u201cThe cycle of high-cost loan refinancing can ultimately deplete the homeowner\u2019s equity and result in foreclosure\u201d].) While destructive lending practices occur most often in connection with subprime lending, such lending is not inherently abusive, and has enabled an entire class of individuals with impaired credit to enter the housing market or access the equity in their homes. (See U.S. Gov. Accounting Off., Rep. on Federal and State Agencies Face Challenges in Combating Predatory Lending, testimony of David G. Wood before Sen. Special Com. on Aging (Feb. 24, 2004) p. 4.) Severe regulation of subprime lending might cause lenders to cease making such loans in California, or preclude borrowers from obtaining a loan based on equity in their home even though such loans can serve a legitimate need. (Cal. Dept. of Real Estate, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 489 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) Sept. 27, 2001, p. 7.) Moreover, increased regulation generally entails additional cost, decreasing further the availability of loan funds to subprime borrowers. Thus, the Legislature was aware regulation of certain predatory practices in mortgage lending, practices which occur most often in the subprime market, could have the unintended consequence of hurting those the legislation was intended to help, and sought to balance these competing concerns. The Ordinance, and the possibility of other divergent and competing local measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>throughout California, upsets that balance. By analogy to federal preemption law, the Ordinance \u201c \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\u2019 \u201d of the Legislature. <em>(Volt Info. Sciences </em>v. <em>Leland Stanford Jr. U. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 468, 477 [103 L.Ed.2d 488, 109 S.Ct. 1248].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Taking just one example, Division 1.6 expressly does \u201cnot impose liability on an assignee that is a holder in due course\u201d and the provisions of the division do not apply to \u201cpersons chartered by Congress to engage in secondary mortgage market transactions.\u201d (Fin. Code, \u00a7 4979.8.) The Ordinance expressly imposes such liability. (Oak. Mun. Code, \u00a7 5.33.070.) Such an extension of liability to \u201c[a]ny person who purchases or is otherwise assigned a home loan\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>may result in secondary purchasers being hesitant or unwilling to purchase mortgages originating in Oakland. Should other cities adopt a similar extension of liability,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> subprime lending could conceivably be sharply curtailed in the state, despite the Legislature\u2019s efforts to avoid such an event. As AFSA observes, the Ordinance \u201cnot only contradicts a careful legislative choice, [it] threatens to disrupt secondary market transactions, interrupting the flow of loan capital to this state,\u201d and \u201cdivide the state\u2019s economy into tiny geographic markets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Thus, contrary to the City\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s assertion, Division 1.6 does not set \u201cstatewide minimum\u201d standards beyond which municipalities are free to regulate. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1271; <em>id. </em>at p. 1275.) Rather, the Legislature\u2019s full occupation of this field preempts the Ordinance\u2019s regulation even of those mortgages not addressed by Division 1.6, such as loans between $250,000 and $359,650. For the reasons cited above, it is difficult to imagine how the state could maintain a centralized and uniform command in regulating predatory tactics in home mortgages if municipalities were free to regulate the area with respect to loans in amounts in excess of the state statutory ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Thus, in <em>Lane </em>we held that a city ordinance, making criminal sexual conduct the state Penal Code did not, was preempted because the state had fully occupied the field of regulation of sexual conduct by enacting a detailed legislative scheme. <em>(Lane, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at pp. 103-105; see <em>Issac, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 601 [\u201cabsence of any specific statewide legislation . . . does not create a statutory loophole inviting local legislation, because of the pervasive statutory scheme already in place governing lien priority\u201d].) Similarly here, the Legislature\u2019s decision that certain mortgages, such as loans in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>excess of $250,000, are not subject to regulation under Division 1.6 must be respected, and is not an invitation for municipal regulation. The Legislature may reasonably have concluded that mortgages in excess of the statutory ceiling were less likely to be attended by the predatory practices that it sought to curtail, and hence borrowers should have greater freedom to contract in this area. (See U.S. Dept, of the Treasury &amp; U.S. Dept, of Housing and Urban Development, Joint Rep., Curbing Predatory Home Mortgage Lending, <em>supra, </em>p. 28 [noting on average subprime loans are smaller than prime loans].) As one amicus curiae notes, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s housing market is one of the most vital sectors of its economy. The balances struck by the Legislature in this critical area therefore must be seen as a reflection of the Legislature\u2019s reasoned assessment of the competing needs to provide mortgage capital to the broadest possible segment of the populace while, at the same time, discouraging unfair lending practices throughout the state. Local governments should not be free to undermine the Legislature\u2019s efforts in this area ... by striking different policy balances of their own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">The City and the dissent essentially assert, however, that Oakland has a higher incidence of subprime lending and the predatory tactics associated with such lending than other areas of the state, and hence may suffer more than other parts of California the resulting blight and poverty such tactics can foster. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1268-1271, 1275.) Assuming this is correct, and while these would be important local concerns, they do not give the City a license to regulate a highly complex financial area comprehensively addressed by state law. Such an approach would mean that any city which claimed to experience a disproportionate number of foreclosures, or instances of securities fraud, could simply write its own measures regardless of any confusion these competing measures may foster. Rather, the state\u2019s interest in uniformity in the area of mortgage lending law demonstrably transcends the concerns of a particular municipality, and is a \u201cconvincing basis for legislative action . . . based on sensible, pragmatic considerations.\u201d <em>(Calif. Fed., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 18.) In this situation, the City must \u201cdefer to legislative estimates regarding the significance of a given problem and the responsive measures that should be taken toward its resolution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">The City relies on certain language in <em>Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at page 904, taken out of context, to support its argument that the failure on the part of the Legislature to include express preemption language means that it had no implied intent to preempt. In <em>Sherwin-Williams, </em>there existed at all relevant times a statute that provided, \u201c \u2018Nothing in this code shall invalidate an ordinance of, nor be construed to prohibit the adoption of an ordinance by, a city, city and county, or county, if such ordinance regulates the sale of aerosol containers of paint or other liquid substances capable of defacing property.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sherwin-Williams, </em>at p. 899, quoting former Pen. Code, \u00a7 594.5.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>We observed that former Penal Code section 594.1, the statute at issue, as originally enacted in 1981, had regulated aerosol paint containers larger than six ounces in section 1, an express preemption provision regarding sales and possession of such aerosol containers in section 2, and a no reimbursement provision in section 3. (Sherwin-Williams, at p. 900.) In 1988, former Penal Code section 594.1 was amended such that it generally applied to all aerosol paint containers in section 1, and had a no reimbursement provision in section 2. No express preemption provision was included in the 1988 amendment. <em>(Sherwin-Williams, </em>at pp. 900-901.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">We found that the amended section 594.1 of the Penal Code did not preempt a local ordinance governing the display of aerosol paint containers and marker pens. <em>(Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 895-896, 906.) In so doing, we made the following statement, on which the City relies: \u201cIn both 1981 and 1988, the Legislature was acting, and presumably knew that it was acting, in the context of Penal Code section 594.5, which by its very terms would render any aerosol paint legislation \u2018non-preemptive,\u2019 at least as to sales. Hence, in both years, it was obligated, and presumably knew that it was obligated, to take affirmative steps if it intended to preempt. In 1981, it took such steps: it included the preemption declaration. In 1988, it did nothing. It certainly knew how to copy: in the earlier year, it inserted a \u2018no reimbursement\u2019 clause; in the later, it inserted a similar clause. To our mind, the conclusion is clear. In 1981, it expressly intended to preempt. In 1988, it impliedly intended not to.\u201d <em>(Sherwin-Williams, </em>at p. 904.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-5\">As can be seen, <em>Sherwin-Williams </em>was decided based on a significantly different statutory landscape than we encounter here. Unlike <em>Sherwin-Williams, </em>the City points to no language in Division 1.6 which states that nothing in its provisions shall invalidate a local ordinance if such ordinance regulates predatory mortgage lending practices. Hence, the Legislature\u2019s failure to include an express preemption provision in Division 1.6 does not ineluctably mean there is no implied preemption. Significantly, aside from the Savings Association Law (Fin. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.), at least two other state laws governing mortgage lenders, the California Residential Mortgage Lending Act (Fin. Code, \u00a7 50000 et seq.), and the mortgage of real property provisions in the Civil Code (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2947-2955.5), do not have an express preemption provision. Indeed, the City does not point out for us any state mortgage lending law that has an express preemption provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">The City and the dissent rely on testimony at a Senate subcommittee hearing held shortly before the passage of Division 1.6, urging inclusion of an express preemption provision, and the fact that several members of the Legislature had a brief conversation regarding preemption at that subcommittee hearing, in asserting Division 1.6 does not impliedly preempt the Ordinance. (Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1266-1267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>Of course, by definition, the Legislature\u2019s implicit full occupation of a field occurs only when there is no express intent in the state law. We disagree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s statement that \u201cwhen the Legislature is silent on preemption, courts presume there is <em>no </em>intent to preempt.\u201d Adopting this approach would be a notable departure from our implied preemption precedents.  Instead, in such circumstances we consider factors including the language and scope of the adopted measure, the history behind the adopted measure, and the history of regulation in the area, as we have done in this and other field preemption cases. (E.g., <em>Great Western, </em>supra, 27 Cal.4th at pp. 860-867; <em>Tolman, supra, </em>39 Cal.2d at p. 712 [Legislature\u2019s \u201cintent with regard to occupying the field to the exclusion of all local regulation is not to be measured alone by the language used but by the whole purpose and scope of the legislative scheme\u201d].) Neither the City nor the dissent offers a reason why we would not consider such language, scope, and purpose merely because at some point during the bill enactment process the issue of express preemption may have arisen. Nor do they demonstrate that these traditional indicators of legislative intent point toward allowing hundreds of cities in California to enact their own mortgage lending laws, an area historically regulated by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">Taken to its logical extreme, the City\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s approach would eliminate the doctrine of implied preemption at least to the extent someone somewhere ever suggested to the Legislature an express preemption clause would be useful, and the Legislature declined to adopt that suggestion. Such a standard would be easily manipulable, and would punish constituents who attempt to educate the Legislature about their concerns to the extent their concerns were not addressed in the precise manner proposed to the Legislature. Moreover, for well over a century, mortgage lending has occurred at the state, not municipal level, and the effects of such regulation are no longer simply statewide, but national. While we cannot know the reasons for the absence of express preemption language, the Legislature is deemed to be aware of existing law, and may have comfortably assumed that given such state dominance in mortgage lending regulation, and having omitted express preemption provisions in other mortgage lending laws without such an omission being read as a license for local regulation, that an express preemption provision was unnecessary. Indeed, unlike the dissent, we are reluctant to reward the opponents of preemption when nothing in the statutory language or history suggests they persuaded the Legislature to consider relinquishing its historical control of this particular regulatory field and to tolerate municipal, and possibly conflicting, regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">In addition, our prior cases establish that even when the Legislature amends a bill to add a provision, and then deletes that provision in a subsequent version of the bill, this failure to enact the provision is of little</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>assistance in determining the intent of the Legislature. <em>(Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 573, fn. 5 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 31, 21 Cal.Rptr.3d 331] [\u201c \u2018Unpassed bills, as evidence of legislative intent, have little value\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sparks </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 71, 87, fn. 20 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 508, 47 P.3d 289] [same]; <em>Sherwin-Williams, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 904, fn. 6 [same].) How much less value is there in determining legislative intent when no version of a bill was ever amended to include a provision, here express preemption, suggested by a member of the public? Similarly, we have repeatedly observed that \u201cstatements of an individual legislator, including the author of a bill, are generally not considered in construing a statute, as the court\u2019s task is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature as a whole in adopting a piece of legislation.\u201d <em>(Quintano v.

Rather, in that history, the Legislature was instead focused on what the terms of the antipredatory lending law should be, which, as we have concluded, is its role in this area. Thus, in various bill analyses recounting bases for opposition to Assembly Bill No. 489 and in letters from Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox and Senate Republican Whip Raymond Haynes to Governor Davis urging a veto of that bill, there is no mention of the absence of an express preemption provision. (See, e.g., Assem. Republican Caucus, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 489 as amended Sept. 6, 2001, p. 2; Assem. Republican Caucus, Analysis of Assem.

Thus, the Department of Real Estate enrolled bill report states, \u201c[s]ome lenders may leave the California market limiting access to capital for those who need it most. In addition, this bill would effectively preclude equity based lending for covered loans even though it has been demonstrated such loans have served a legitimate need.\u201d (Dept, of Real Estate, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 489, Sept. 27, 2001, p. 7.) Under \u201c[v]otes,\u201d the enrolled bill report notes, \u201c[m]any [m]embers who voted \u2018no\u2019 expressed concerns that the passage of the bill would cause lenders to cease making subprime loans in California. In addition, many [m]embers who voted \u2018no\u2019 expressed concern that this bill would preclude a borrower from obtaining a loan solely based on the equity in the property, even though such loans may serve a legitimate need.\u201d (Ibid.; State and Consumer Services Agency, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem.

The Department of Corporations enrolled bill report did note among other arguments in opposition to Assembly Bill No. 489 that \u201c[i]ndustry groups argue that AB 489 should expressly preempt local ordinances which exceed the protections afforded by this bill. Without preempting city or county ordinances, lenders will continue to be exposed to nonuniform restrictions imposed by various municipalities throughout California.\u201d (Dept, of Corporations, Enrolled Bill Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 489, Sep. 27, 2001, p. 8.) However, this restatement of an argument made by certain industry groups does not purport to reflect debate within the Legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">The Court of Appeal also noted that the Governor in signing Assembly Bill No. 489 expressly lamented the fact it did not contain express preemption language, and the Legislative Counsel opined a local ordinance would be valid to the extent it did not conflict with state law. We may not consider such postenactment events as a Governor\u2019s signing statement, and not even the City relies on this circumstance. Moreover, the Legislative Counsel\u2019s generalized and routine discussion of preemption law is not evidence the Legislature believed an ordinance such as the one challenged here would survive a preemption challenge. The Legislative Counsel expressly observed, \u201cBecause we have not been provided with a specific local government ordinance regulating high-cost mortgage lending, we . . . discuss generally the grounds for preemption of a local government ordinance by state law.\u201d (Deputy Legis. Counsel L. Erik Lange, letter to Sen.

(Dis. opn., <em>post, </em>at p. 1266; <em>id. </em>at p. 1267.) The dissent points to no evidence AFSA was involved in the legislative process of Division 1.6 even as an interested constituent. More critically, we have repeatedly concluded, as noted above, that even the statements of individual legislators are not generally considered in construing a statute. Of how much less worth is a third party\u2019s opinion regarding that legislative process? Indeed, discerning legislative intent from an outside party\u2019s \u201cconcession\u201d appears not only a novel but a problematic approach. Had AFSA not made such a \u201cconcession,\u201d would the dissent then find there was preemption? As in the case of comments from constituents to the Legislature, on which the dissent also relies, our preemption principles simply cannot be so arbitrary and malleable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">Even if there was competent evidence the Legislature had debated and rejected the notion of including an express preemption clause, and deliberately decided to remain silent, such history would merely show that lawmakers left the preemption issue exactly where it would have been if nothing had been said during the bill enactment process. Under such circumstances, and contrary to what the dissent claims, there would still be no basis for straying from our traditional examination of the language, scope, and purpose of the enacted statutory scheme in determining whether the Legislature manifested an implicit intent to occupy the field and preempt all local regulation. Considering that language, scope, and purpose here, as delineated at length above, we find clear indications of such an intent, and conclude the Ordinance is preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1300-8\"> It is noteworthy that one such letter writer, FannieMae, expressly <em>withdrew </em>its opposition to Assembly Bill No. 489, and <em>then </em>urged the bill authors to consider adding an express preemption provision.

City of Los Angeles, </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 893, 898 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 844 P.2d 534].) Here, the Legislature consciously considered including express preemption language in the statewide statute (division 1.6 of the Financial Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4970-4979.8),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but ultimately omitted any such language from the statute as one of the essential elements of a compromise that led to the enactment of the legislation. In view of this legislative background\u2014 which demonstrates that the statute does not \u201cclearly indicate\u201d a legislative intent to preempt all local legislation\u2014and the distinctive local interest that the City of Oakland has in adopting stringent and effective measures to protect its residents from the predatory lending practices at issue, I cannot agree with the majority that Division 1.6 properly may be found to preempt the Ordinance in its entirety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">Unlike our previous implied preemption cases, this is not simply a case in which the Legislature was silent about preemption. Here, there is considerable extrinsic evidence, and a concession from the party arguing in favor of preemption, that the Legislature specifically considered and purposefully rejected an express preemption clause despite extensive lobbying for the inclusion of express preemption language in the state statute. As plaintiff American Financial Services Association (AFSA) itself acknowledges, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>were strongly held disagreements over preemption between industry representatives and consumer proponents of the bill. Indeed, the record reveals that the subprime lending industry vigorously lobbied for express preemption language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">Under normal circumstances, the mere absence of express preemption language would not be dispositive. But here the party arguing in support of preemption explicitly has admitted that there were insufficient votes in the Legislature to enact the bill with an express preemption provision. Specifically, AFSA\u2019s brief acknowledges that \u201cthe Legislature could say nothing for or against preemption <em>without risking defeat </em>of [Assembly Bill No.] 489. So it elected to remain silent.\u201d (Italics added.) The majority fails to acknowledge or afford appropriate consideration to this admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-5\">Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s reading of the relevant legislative history, I believe this history supports AFSA\u2019s concession. This is not a situation where the preemption issue was abstract or peripheral. Indeed, the issue of preemption was arguably at the forefront of the debate over Assembly Bill No. 489 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) (Assembly Bill No. 489). For instance, the members of the Senate Banking Committee that forged the legislative compromise that led to passage of the bill heard testimony from Oakland City Councilman Ignacio de la Fuente regarding the imminent passage of the Ordinance. In response to this testimony, a committee member expressed concern that without express preemption language, there would be a host of different lending policies from community to community. In response, the bill\u2019s co-author, Assemblywoman Migden, stated at the August 27, 2001, hearing on Assembly Bill No. 489 by the Senate Banking, Commerce and International Trade Committee: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure that everyone can live with the bill, industry and consumers alike and . . . we\u2019ve decided ... to be silent on [preemption], which does lend different interpretations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">At the same hearing, the committee also heard from numerous financial industry representatives who urged the committee to include preemption language. (Adam Bass of Ameriquest Mortgage Company: \u201cpreemption is a major issue\u201d; John Ross, Mortgage Bankers Assn.: \u201cpreemption is a big issue for our members\u201d; Brian Kennealy of the Responsible Mortgage Lenders Coalition: \u201cpreemption is a very, very important issue to us and our members\u201d; Eleanda Delgado of Irwin Home Equity Corp., agreeing with the others; Bernard Nevins, Cal. Assn, of Industrial Bankers: preemption \u201ccan\u2019t hurt and it would be very bad if you didn\u2019t do it\u201d; Phil Eisenberg, American Intemat. Group: \u201cthe preemption issue is fundamental. It\u2019s not cursory. It\u2019s not a medium-sized issue. It\u2019s fundamental\u201d; Tom McMorrow, Countrywide Mortgage and First Union: \u201cPreemption remains fundamental.\u201d) This effort by the financial industry to include express preemption language in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>further establishes that silence on the preemption issue was not inadvertent but deliberate, part of a legislative compromise \u201cto make sure that everyone can live with this bill, industry and consumers alike . . . .\u201d The majority\u2019s assertion that the Legislature\u2019s silence on preemption was inadvertent, or that the Legislature believed that express preemption language was unnecessary, is simply untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\">The majority minimizes the foregoing history by arguing that although an express preemption issue \u201cmay have arisen\u201d at some point during the bill enactment process, the issue was peripheral. As noted, this ignores AFSA\u2019s concession that the issue of express preemption not only \u201carose,\u201d but threatened to derail passage of the bill. Thus, this is not simply a case where \u201csomeone somewhere . . . suggested to the Legislature an express preemption clause would be useful, and the Legislature declined to adopt that suggestion.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1261.) This is a case where passage of the bill hinged on the inclusion or exclusion of express preemption language. Thus, this is not a case where the city relies on the mere absence of express preemption to argue against implied preemption. There is significantly more evidence of deliberate exclusion of a preemption provision here, and the majority\u2019s concern about the demise of the doctrine of implied preemption is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">Nonetheless, it can be argued, as AFSA does, that the stalemate on the preemption issue neither supports nor undermines a conclusion as to preemption, and that the court should resort to certain default rules about preemption that it has developed over the years. But one of those rules, indeed the principal rule, is that legislative intent be clearly indicated. As the Court of Appeal noted in <em>California Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn. v. City of West Hollywood </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1317 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 591], the Legislature\u2019s failure to include express preemption language may be critical. \u201cClaims of implied preemption must be approached carefully, because they by definition involve situations in which there is no express preemption. Since preemption depends upon <em>legislative intent, </em>such a situation necessarily begs the question of why, if preemption was legislatively <em>intended, </em>the Legislature did not simply say so, as the Legislature has done many times in many circumstances.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hence, the rule has developed that implied preemption properly can be found only when the circumstances \u201cclearly indicate\u201d a legislative intent to preempt. <em>(Sherwin-Wlliams Co. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 893, 898.) The need for such a \u201cclear indication\u201d is especially acute when the extrinsic evidence and the concession of the parties demonstrate that the Legislature declined to adopt an express preemption provision because such a provision would not command a majority of the Legislature. A legislative stalemate on preemption is not an indication of a clear intent to preempt local legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">The majority\u2019s emphasis on state uniformity and historical regulation patterns also fails to acknowledge properly the respect this court traditionally has accorded to localities regarding issues that have a unique local impact. As we stated in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 707 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261], \u201c[w]e will be reluctant to infer legislative intent to preempt a field covered by municipal regulation where there is a significant local interest to be served that may differ from one locality to another.\u201d I am particularly troubled by the majority\u2019s express disapproval of the Court of Appeal\u2019s contention that \u201c \u2018when the Legislature is silent on preemption, courts presume there is <em>no </em>intent to preempt.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1261.) To the contrary, as the Court of Appeal aptly observed in <em>Gluck v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 121, 133 [155 Cal.Rptr. 435], the common thread of our preemption cases is that \u201cif there is a significant local interest to be served from one locality to another then the presumption favors the validity of the local ordinance against an attack of state preemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">The regulation of predatory lending undoubtedly is an area of statewide concern. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the field is <em>exclusively </em>so, thus leaving no room for local regulation. \u201cThe significant issue in determining whether local regulation should be permitted depends upon a \u2018balancing of two conflicting interests: (1) the needs of local governments to meet the special needs of their communities; and (2) the need for uniform state regulation.\u2019 ... [1] That basic issue, in turn, may in a specific instance be fragmented into the component issues which combine to effect its resolution such as whether local legislators are more aware of and better able to regulate appropriately the problems of their areas, whether substantial geographic, economic, ecological or other distinctions are persuasive of the need for local control, and whether local needs have been adequately recognized and comprehensively dealt with at the state level. Certain areas of human behavior command statewide uniformity, especially the regulation of statewide commercial activities and the conduct of transient individuals, so that mobility may not be burdened unreasonably.\u201d <em>(Robins v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1966) 248 Cal.App.2d 1, 9 [56 Cal.Rptr. 853].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-6\">As the court made clear in <em>Robins, </em>although the need for state uniformity is an important consideration in resolving preemption questions, the interests of the locality also are entitled to considerable weight. \u201cThe pervasive question to be answered is: Does the demand for uniformity throughout the state outweigh the needs of local governments to handle problems peculiar to their communities.\u201d <em>(Tri County Apartment Assn. v. City of Mountain View </em>(1988) 196 Cal.App.3d 1283, 1294 [242 Cal.Rptr. 438].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>The record in this case establishes that Oakland\u2019s Ordinance was adopted because many low-income homeowners in the City of Oakland were targeted by unethical mortgage lenders using predatory lending practices. Many low- and moderate-income homeowners in Oakland were unable to obtain conventional legitimate financing. Local conditions allowed predatory lenders to thrive, and their practices unfairly stripped homes of equity value and resulted in a number of unjust home foreclosures. Often, through fraudulent means, homeowners were charged exorbitant fees and interest rates and unfairly were persuaded to incur mortgage debt in excess of their needs or ability to pay. The record reflects that the Oakland City Council, in passing the ordinance in question, found that the predatory lending problem in Oakland was particularly aggravated \u201cbecause of the high number of minority and low income homeowners in Oakland, and the pressures of gentrification in certain neighborhoods that increase property values and home equity,\u201d which have led to a situation in which \u201cOakland residents in low income areas have been perceived to be \u2018the house rich and the cash poor\u2019 and thus are prime targets for predatory lending practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-4\">Oakland\u2019s findings mirror the conclusions of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in an analysis of almost one million mortgages reported nationwide in calendar year 1998 under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. (See HUD Rep., Unequal Burden: Income and Racial Disparities in Subprime Lending in America (Apr. 2000), http://www.hud.gov/library/bookshelfl8/pressrel/subprime.html [as of Jan. 31, 2005] (HUD Report).) HUD\u2019s detailed analysis reached four critical conclusions: (1) from 1993 to 1998, the number of subprime refinance loans increased tenfold;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) subprime loans are three times more likely in low-income neighborhoods than in high-income neighborhoods; (3) subprime loans are five times more likely in African-American neighborhoods than in White neighborhoods; and (4) homeowners in high-income African-American neighborhoods are twice as likely as homeowners in low-income White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>neighborhoods to have subprime loans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> HUD concluded that its analysis \u201cclearly demonstrates the exponential growth in subprime lending and its disproportionate impact on low-income and particularly, minority homeowners and communities throughout the nation.\u201d (See HUD Rep., <em>supra, </em>http://www.hud.gov/library/bookshelfl8/pressreFsubprime.html.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-4\">As HUD\u2019s conclusions illustrate, Oakland\u2019s particular interest in regulating subprime loans goes beyond merely protecting its particularly vulnerable citizens. As one amicus curiae points out, \u201cpredatory lending is not just a consumer protection issue; it is a <em>community development </em>issue, because it threatens the stability of lower income homeowning neighborhoods ....[][] Predatory home mortgage lending has enormous impacts on targeted neighborhoods. Predatory lending practices, particularly the phenomenon of \u2018asset based lending,\u2019 contribute to an increase in the number of foreclosures. This can result in abandoned houses and blighted neighborhoods and contribute to the physical and economic deterioration of lower-income, minority, and inner city communities. \u2018Foreclosures, especially in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods turn what might be typically viewed as a consumer protection problem . . . into a community development problem, in which increased foreclosures lead to property abandonment and blight.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting HUD Rep., Recommendations to Curb Predatory Home Mortgage Lending (June 2000) pp. 24-25, available online at http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/treasrpt.pdf [as of Jan. 31, 2005].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-5\">In view of the community degradation caused by predatory lending, Oakland reasonably could have concluded that it was important to include holders in due course within the Ordinance\u2019s purview. The bulk sale of mortgage loans on the secondary market is the primary profit incentive for subprime mortgage lenders. (See Eggert, <em>Held up in Due Course: Predatory Lending, Securitization, and the Holder in Due Course Doctrine </em>(2002) 35 Creighton L.Rev. 503, 577 [noting that a primary reason for the rapid growth of the industry \u201cis that the existence of ready capital available to lenders through the securitization of subprime loans has dramatically increased their ability to make those loans\u201d].) The innovation of selling mortgage loans in bulk is, in fact, what fueled the enormous growth of the subprime mortgage industry. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 578) As the City of Oakland points out, \u201csales of subprime loans by predatory lenders is the inducement and profit-basis for their business practice of encouraging ever higher and larger loans to subprime borrowers, i.e. larger \u2018inventory\u2019 of loans for sale to others\u2014all to the detriment of the consumer public.\u201d Thus, Oakland reasonably could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>concluded that because the bulk of subprime loans are sold on the secondary market, the Ordinance would have significantly greater deterrence effect if borrowers were able to invoke the defense of predatory lending in a foreclosure or other enforcement action against the secondary buyers who otherwise might be immune from liability. Otherwise, as one amicus curiae points out, \u201c[s]ince most subprime loans are sold on the secondary market, the lack of assignee liability provides little incentive to the industry to clean up its practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">The Legislature was free to conclude that treatment of predatory lending requires statewide uniformity. Alternatively, however, it could conclude that only a statewide minimum standard of conduct is necessary, and that local jurisdictions have some freedom to additionally regulate predatory lenders pursuant to the municipal police power to prevent urban decay and neighborhood blight. Because of the local, varying nature of the problem, this is not a case in which having differing local standards is wholly illogical. (Cf. <em>Tolman </em>v. <em>Underhill </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 708, 713 [249 P.2d 280] [loyalty oaths for state employees requires uniform treatment]; <em>Northern Cal. Psychiatric Society v. City of Berkeley </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 90, 102 [223 Cal.Rptr. 609] [no special local interest with regard to regulation of electroshock therapy].) All we can be certain of is that Division 1.6 was the product of a legislative compromise, and that the compromise included deliberate silence on the matter of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">As discussed above, predatory lending is characterized by loans that are aggressively marketed to borrowers who often cannot afford the payments and eventually default on the loans. The city argues that the high rate of default and foreclosure has led to the degradation of entire neighborhoods and has contributed to the already substantial problem of urban blight in Oakland. The field of predatory lending regulation is one in which conditions peculiar to the locality are likely to differ from place to place and where supplemental regulation may well fall within the realm of local government. <em>(Gluck </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 121, 133 [upholding a Los Angeles ordinance regulating the placement and display of news racks on public rights-of-way].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">This court has acknowledged that the balance of power between state and local municipalities recognizes that a one-size-fits-all solution is not always in the best interest of the residents of a particular community. (See, e.g., <em>California Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn. v. City of West Hollywood, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th 1302, 1318 [recognizing the need for caution in \u201cdepriving local municipalities of aspects of their constitutional police power to deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>local conditions\u201d].) Keeping this in mind, courts have taken care to harmonize the general law and the localized need for municipal regulation even where the record reveals a pronounced statewide interest and a comprehensive statewide scheme relating to the field. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 584 [60 Cal.Rptr. 659] [upholding ordinance prohibiting consumption of alcoholic beverages on public streets despite a comprehensive statewide scheme relating to such beverages]; <em>Gleason v. Municipal Court </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 584 [38 Cal.Rptr. 226] [upholding local ordinance proscribing loitering despite the then broad sweep of Penal Code section 647].) The case before us falls squarely within this line of precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">The cases cited by the majority do not compel a contrary conclusion. Although our numerous preemption cases resist easy harmonization, one theme that emerges is that those municipal ordinances that have been found to be preempted have been seen as subverting, in some tangible way, the purpose and intent of the state statute. This is true of each of the cases relied upon by the majority. In <em>Wilson v. Beville </em>(1957) 47 Cal.2d 852 [306 P.2d 789], we invalidated a local ordinance that attempted to impose conditions more stringent than those imposed by the state on the exercise of the power of eminent domain by specifying a shorter statute of limitations for the filing of a claim. There, we observed that a \u201ccity charter cannot give a shorter time, make more onerous the recovery of compensation, than the legislation has.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 861). We also observed that \u201ca municipality may not curtail or abridge the rights so granted [right to recover for tort] by specifying, through charter provision, a shorter time limitation . . . than the period fixed by the statute.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted, citing <em>Eastlick v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 661, 666 [177 P.2d 558].) The local legislation thus undermined the statute by making the recovery of compensation more onerous. As such, the local ordinance was invalid because the Legislature had \u201cprovided a complete and detailed system for exercising the right of eminent domain and assessing compensation.\u201d <em>(Wilson v. Beville, supra, </em>47 Cal.2d at p. 860.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">Similarly, in <em>Eastlick, </em>we struck down a requirement in the Los Angeles City Charter that required a personal injury claimant to itemize the damages in her claim. The requirements for a personal injury claim under state law did not require such specificity. <em>(Eastlick v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 29 </em>Cal.2d 661, 666.) Again, as in <em>Wilson, </em>the locality had attempted to abridge and circumscribe a state law right, thereby undermining the purpose of the state regulation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Likewise, in <em>Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 129, 152 [130 Cal.Rptr. 465, 550 P.2d 1001], we invalidated a provision in the Berkeley City Charter that attempted to impose additional restrictions on a landlord\u2019s right to evict a tenant. There, we observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>requiring \u201clandlords to fulfill the elaborate prerequisites for the issuance of a certificate of eviction by the rent control board before they commence the [state] statutory proceeding would nullify the intended summary nature of the [statutory] remedy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 151.) In <em>Isaac v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 586, 600 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 752], the Court of Appeal held that an ordinance that gave utility liens priority over other recorded liens was preempted \u201cbecause it disrupts California\u2019s statewide statutory scheme of lien priority\u201d by giving the utility lien a priority over other liens that the state has determined should have priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">The common theme running through these cases is that a locality may not impose additional burdensome requirements upon the exercise of state statutory remedies that undermine the very purpose of the state statute. Here, we are presented with a fundamentally different relationship between the state statute and local regulations. The Ordinance does not appear to undermine any of the stated goals of Division 1.6. To the contrary, the ordinance grants borrowers additional rights not afforded under state law, such as restrictions on prepayment penalties, mandatory credit counseling, and the opportunity to present defenses to secondary buyers of their mortgages if the borrowers have been victimized by predatory lending practices. Far from subverting Division 1.6, the Ordinance furthers the stated goal of the state legislation by providing additional protections to the low-income borrowers in Oakland who are especially vulnerable to predatory lending practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">The majority argues, however, that the Ordinance <em>does </em>disrupt the balance struck by the Legislature in enacting Division 1.6. The majority asserts that Division 1.6 balanced \u201cthe need to protect particularly vulnerable consumers from predatory lending practices and the concern homeowners not be unduly hindered in accessing the equity in their own homes.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1257.) The majority observes that \u201c[s]evere regulation of subprime lending might cause lenders to cease making such loans in California, or preclude borrowers from obtaining a loan based on equity in their home even though such loans can serve a legitimate need. . . . Thus, the Legislature was aware regulation of certain predatory practices in mortgage lending, practices which occur most often in the subprime market, could have the unintended consequence of hurting those the legislation was intended to help, and sought to balance these competing concerns. The Ordinance, and the possibility of other divergent and competing local measures throughout California, upsets that balance.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1257-1258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>Although it undoubtedly is true that the Legislature struck a balance to ensure passage of the bill, the balance was the product of compromise between consumer protection interests and finance industry interests. In order to glean the intent of the Legislature regarding preemption, we must examine the entirety of that compromise, and not selective parts of it. As discussed above, that compromise included the omission of any provision relating to preemption of local legislation. Yet, the majority concludes that preemption nonetheless was intended, emphasizing the Legislature\u2019s supposedly overriding concern regarding the threat that patchwork regulation might pose to low-income borrowers\u2019 access to capital. This emphasis on the need to prevent undue regulation ignores the principal purpose of Division 1.6, which is to improve consumer protection against predatory lending practices, <em>not </em>to protect lenders from unduly restrictive regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">The majority\u2019s implicit assumption is that Oakland\u2019s Ordinance, by providing for stricter regulation of certain areas of subprime lending, necessarily will cause lenders to cease making loans in Oakland and in California as a whole. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1257-1258.) Had a majority of the Legislature agreed with that proposition, however, it could be expected that the legislation would have included a provision expressly preempting local legislation. The conscious omission of an explicit preemption provision demonstrates that\" the Legislature could not agree that local legislation would undermine or impair the objectives of the state legislation. Furthermore, should the undesirable consequences forecast by the majority come to pass, the Legislature, of course, would be free to step in and add an express preemption provision to Division 1.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">The majority also places great emphasis on the City\u2019s admission that in more than 150 years of California history, no municipality has attempted to regulate mortgage lending. (Maj. opn, <em>ante, </em>at p. 1255.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But we never have required a locality to prove a historical practice of regulation to establish the validity of a local regulation. Rather, as outlined above, the proper inquiry requires a clear indication of legislative intent and a studied balance between the need for state uniformity and the particular interest of the locality. Although historical regulatory patterns may be significant in assessing legislative intent, we must assess that history in context. The subprime mortgage industry has undergone tremendous growth in recent years. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 3.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During that period, predatory lending has had a grossly disproportionate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>impact on low-income and minority homeowners and communities. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable that the communities most affected would see a need to take action to protect their residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">Thus, despite the circumstance that mortgage regulation historically has occurred at the state rather than the local level, we must recognize the concerns implicated by the recent rapid escalation of predatory lending. In view of the documented evidence that predatory lending is especially pervasive in low-income and minority neighborhoods, it is beyond dispute that Oakland and other similarly situated localities have a more significant interest in regulating subprime lending than localities that, because of demographics and composition, are not targeted in similar ways. Local regulation thus is not only constitutionally valid, but practically vital to the affected communities. Although predatory lending certainly is a matter of statewide concern, the specific interests of the communities most affected by the banned practices make the regulation of this field particularly amenable to local variations. Oakland\u2019s own interest in preventing predatory lending provides ample justification for that locality\u2019s enactment of stricter and more protective regulations designed to ensure that its residents receive adequate information before saddling themselves with financial obligations that could prove devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">In sum, I agree with the city and the decision of the Court of Appeal below that Division 1.6 establishes a floor, not a ceiling, for the regulation of predatory lending practices. As the majority recognizes, the rule of implied preemption is a \u201c \u2018rule of necessity, based upon the need to prevent dual regulations which could result in uncertainty and confusion.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1252.) As discussed above, the Ordinance provides added protections for its citizens that will not result in uncertainty or confusion, and absent a clearly evident legislative intent I believe the Ordinance is not preempted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, upholding the validity of Oakland\u2019s antipredatory lending ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Kennard, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1303-11\"> For convenience, like the majority opinion, I shall refer to the relevant state statute as \u201cDivision 1.6,\u201d and the relevant local legislation as the \u201cOrdinance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1303-12\"> Because the majority concludes that the Ordinance is invalid in its entirety, I do not reach the question whether some individual provisions of the local enactment may be inconsistent with Division 1.6 and for that reason preempted by that legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1307-5\"> The subprime mortgage market is a market providing credit access to borrowers who might not qualify for traditional financing, such as those with impaired credit, limited income, or high debt-to-income ratios.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-6\">HUD reports that in 1993, there were 80,000 subprime refinance loans reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. By 1998, this number had increased by more than 900 percent to 790,000. \u201cThe magnitude and speed of the increase in subprime lending alone\u2014 almost 1000% in just five years\u2014creates a critical need for greater scrutiny and concern. While the rapid growth of subprime lending may, on the surface, appear to be good news for higher-risk borrowers, behind the numbers there is some evidence that some portion of subprime lending is occurring with borrowers whose credit would qualify them for conventional loans. Subprime lending may expose borrowers to higher up-front fees and interest rates than they would bear if they had obtained prime loans.\u201d (HUD Rep., <em>supra, </em>http://www.hud.gov/library/bookshelfl8/pressrel/subprime.html.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1308-6\"><em> HUD </em>also analyzed the prevalence of subprime loans in five urban areas (Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, and Baltimore), concluding that a study of the five cities \u201cgives a good sense that the trends identified above are consistent at the metropolitan level.\u201d (HUD Rep., <em>supra, </em>http://www.hud.gov/libraryAookshelfl8/pressrel/subprime.html.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1312-6\"> Of course, as the majority acknowledges, Oakland is not the only municipality seeking to regulate in this field. Los Angeles also recently enacted an Ordinance regulating predatory lending practices. (L.A. Mun. Code, ch. XVIII, art. 1, \u00a7 181.07, subd. (B).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1312-7\"> Moreover, the Legislature was aware that historically, the subject of subprime lending has not been addressed by existing regulation. A bill analysis stating the purposes of Assembly Bill No. 489 states that \u201c[t]he licensing laws under which subprime lenders operate predate the development of the subprime market and therefore did not envision the types of problems that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>have arisen in this market. In fact many real estate loans are specifically exempted from consumer protections in these laws.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Appropriations, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 489 as amended May 1, 2001, p. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1313-9\"> Although the majority does not reach the point, I note that AFSA also argues that because the Ordinance does not apply to federally chartered lenders, it is preempted by Civil Code section 1916.12, which creates a mechanism for the state to respond to changes in federal lending laws by adopting conforming changes in the regulation of state lenders. I agree with the Court of Appeal that Civil Code section 1916.12 does not preempt the Ordinance. Section 1916.12 does not evidence a legislative intent to preempt and does not mandate absolute parity in the treatment of federal and state lenders at either the state or municipal level, and thus does not preempt the Ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
