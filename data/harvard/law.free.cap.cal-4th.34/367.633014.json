The answer is \u201cno.\u201d Those causes of action, however, may be the subject of a separate settlement and release.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">From February 1995 until her resignation in September 1997, Carolyn Claxton worked as an office assistant for defendant Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). Claxton\u2019s supervisor was Ray Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">On December 16, 1997, Claxton filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) against PMA for an injury to her \u201cleft lower extremity and psyche\u201d from a slip and fall on May 7, 1997. On January 16, 1998, Claxton filed a second and separate workers\u2019 compensation claim against PMA for injury to \u201cpsyche due to sexual harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">On September 15, 1998, Claxton filed this civil action against PMA and Waters alleging, as relevant here, sexual harassment in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.). On November 6, 1998, defendants filed their answer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">On February 25, 1999, Claxton and PMA settled the workers\u2019 compensation claims for $25,000. As part of the settlement, Claxton executed a preprinted compromise and release form (WCAB form 15). The use of this form is mandatory. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 10874.) The form had only the case numbers for Claxton\u2019s two claims for workers\u2019 compensation; it made no reference to the pending civil action against PMA and Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">In preprinted paragraph 3, WCAB form 15 states: \u201cUpon approval of this compromise agreement by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board or a workers\u2019 compensation judge and payment in accordance with the provisions hereof, said employee releases and forever discharges said employer and insurance carrier from all claims and causes of action, whether now known or ascertained, or which may hereafter arise or develop as a result of said injury, including any and all liability of said employer and said insurance carrier and each of them to the dependents, heirs, executors, representatives, administrators or assigns of said employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">On March 16, 1999, a workers\u2019 compensation judge approved the compromise and release. The order approving the settlement contained the case numbers for both of Claxton\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims, but not the case number for the civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">Thereafter, in the civil lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, defendants PMA and Waters moved in the superior court for leave to file an amended answer adding, among other things, an affirmative defense that the execution of the workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release also extinguished Claxton\u2019s claims in her civil action against PMA and Waters. The court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>motion. Claxton then moved for summary adjudication of, among other things, the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In support of that motion, Claxton submitted declarations by herself and by the attorney who had represented her in the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. Claxton\u2019s declaration stated that she thought the workers\u2019 compensation release related only to her knee injury \u201cand did not include\u201d her claim for damages in the civil action alleging sexual harassment by her \u201cemployer,\u201d that the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form said nothing about the settlement of her civil action alleging sexual harassment, and that she had not authorized her workers\u2019 compensation attorney to settle her civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The declaration of Claxton\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation attorney stated that the workers\u2019 compensation settlement was intended to cover only plaintiff\u2019s knee injury claim \u201cand did not include the applicant\u2019s claim for civil damages for injuries as a result of the sexual harassment which is the subject of her civil action against her employer . . . .\u201d The declaration pointed out that the preprinted release form had no reference to the pending civil action for sexual harassment, and said Claxton had not authorized settlement of the civil lawsuit by means of the workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">While Claxton\u2019s motion was pending in the superior court, defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting that in executing the workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release form Claxton extinguished any recovery for emotional distress damages in her civil lawsuit against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, took plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary adjudication off calendar as moot, and awarded defendants $92,459.75 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">After a reversal by the Court of Appeal, we granted defendants\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation scheme was developed early in the 20th century as a result of the inadequacy of the common law that often denied injured workers any recovery for work-related injuries. <em>(Western Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Pillsbury </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 686, 693 [151 P. 398]; see generally <em>Mathews v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 719, 728-734 [100 Cal.Rptr. 301, 493 P.2d 1165] [describing the history and development of California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">The workers\u2019 compensation law applies to employee injuries \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d when tire statutorily specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cconditions of compensation concur.\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600.) Generally, it is the exclusive remedy for such injuries. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3600, subd. (a), 3601.)  But some claims, including those based on sexual or racial discrimination or other conduct contrary to fundamental public policy, are not subject to the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>(City of Moorpark </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1143, 1155 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 959 P.2d 752].) Thus, such claims may be the subject of both workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and civil actions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1161.) For convenience, we will here refer to claims \u201coutside\u201d the workers\u2019 compensation system as meaning claims that are either not within the scope of workers\u2019 compensation law or not subject to the exclusivity provisions of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Liability under the workers\u2019 compensation law is founded in neither tort nor contract law. (2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Workers\u2019 Compensation, \u00a7 7, p. 565.) Instead, it is liability without fault (Cal. Const., art. XIV, \u00a7 4; Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600; <em>Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. v. State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 811 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 562, 14 P.3d 234]), to ensure that injured workers are quickly provided benefits to reheve the effects of the industrial injury (Cal. Const, art. XIV, \u00a7 4). Thus, informal rules of pleading apply to such proceedings <em>(Rivera v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1452, 1456 [236 Cal.Rptr. 28]), and workers may be represented by individuals other than attorneys (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5501). Also, all workers\u2019 compensation statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 3202; <em>Department of Rehabilitation v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1281, 1290 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 70 P.3d 1076].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">To safeguard the injured worker from entering into unfortunate or improvident releases as a result of, for instance, economic pressure or bad advice, the worker\u2019s knowledge of and intent to release particular benefits must be established separately from the standard release language of the form. <em>(Sumner v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 965, 972-973 [191 Cal.Rptr. 811, 663 P.2d 534] <em>(Sumner).) </em>Even with respect to claims <em>within </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system, execution of the form does not release certain claims unless specific findings are made. (See former Lab. Code, \u00a7 4646, subd. (a) [vocational rehabilitation services cannot be settled without specific findings]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Sports Chalet, Inc. </em>(1977) 42 Cal.Comp.Cases 625 [same]; <em>Rodgers v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 567 [214 Cal.Rptr. 303] [potential claim for later injury in rehabilitation program cannot be released without specific language].)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The concerns just discussed are even stronger when the employer seeks to apply the standard preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release language to claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation scheme. Of note here is the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Sikkema </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 31 [280 Cal.Rptr. 7] <em>(Lopez). </em>There, the surviving family members of a worker shot and killed by strikebreakers hired by the employer brought a civil lawsuit against the employer and the individuals that killed the worker, alleging personal injury, wrongful death, conspiracy to violate civil rights, and violation of civil rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 33-34.) The employer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the standard workers\u2019 compensation release executed by the family members barred the civil claims arising out of the worker\u2019s death. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It noted that there was no evidence that civil claims were discussed in connection with the workers\u2019 compensation settlement, and that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the workers\u2019 compensation judge was aware of the civil action or had sufficient information to determine the desirability of releasing the civil claims or the adequacy of the compensation for approving such a release. <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 36-38.) In the words of the <em>Lopez </em>court: \u201cIf the mandatory compromise and release form executed by appellants was intended to cover claims which are not compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation act, it should have contained express language to that effect.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 38-39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In <em>Asare v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 856 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 452] <em>(Asare), </em>the Court of Appeal took a similar view. There, the worker brought a civil action against his employer alleging racial discrimination. While that lawsuit was pending, the plaintiff executed a workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release form. The trial court granted a defense motion for summary judgment, ruling that the compromise and release barred the civil action. The Court of Appeal reversed. The court considered it significant that the parties had separate counsel in the two proceedings; that the release was negotiated by the workers\u2019 compensation attorneys; and, \u201cperhaps most importantly,\u201d that although the parties\u2019 attorneys knew of the discrimination cause of action, there was no reference to it in the workers\u2019 compensation release. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In yet another decision, <em>Delaney v. Superior Fast Freight </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 590 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] <em>(Delaney), </em>the Court of Appeal rejected an attempt to extend the workers\u2019 compensation release to bar causes of action outside the workers\u2019 compensation system. There, an employee brought a civil lawsuit against his employer alleging employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. While the civil action was pending on appeal, the plaintiff worker and the employer settled his workers\u2019 compensation claim. Thereafter, the employer contended in the Court of Appeal that the workers\u2019 compensation settlement barred the plaintiff worker\u2019s civil claim for emotional distress. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It pointed out that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>mandatory compromise and release form used in settling workers\u2019 compensation claims was \u201cpreprinted\u201d and made \u201cno specific reference to potentially independent civil rights or remedies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 599.) Therefore, the court concluded, \u201cit may reasonably be understood as releasing only those claims which traditionally fall within the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">While this case was pending before us, yet another Court of Appeal decision addressed the issue of an employer\u2019s attempt to extend a workers\u2019 compensation release form to bar a civil lawsuit. In that case, <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Union Central Life Insurance Company </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1331 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 732] <em>(Mitchell), </em>the employee sued her employer alleging sexual and racial discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act. She then filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim alleging work-related injury based on the same conduct as in her civil lawsuit. While an offer by the employer to settle the civil lawsuit for $1,010,000 was outstanding, the parties settled the workers\u2019 compensation claim for $57,500. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1334.) After execution of the workers\u2019 compensation release, the employer increased to $1,100,000 its offer to settle the civil lawsuit. The plaintiff rejected the offer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1335.) The employer then moved for summary judgment in the civil action, arguing that the release in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding barred the civil action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1337.) The trial court granted the motion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1338.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It relied on the decisions of the Courts of Appeal in <em>Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 31, <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 856, and <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 590. And it quoted this court\u2019s observation in <em>Jefferson v. Department of Youth Authority </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 299, 309 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 391, 48 P.3d 423] <em>(Jefferson) </em>that \u201c \u2018the Court of Appeal decisions that have considered the issue have been consistent in their view that the preprinted language in a workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release form should be narrowly construed to apply only to workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 1341.) In concluding that the evidence left no doubt that the workers\u2019 compensation settlement was not intended to include the civil claims, the <em>Mitchell </em>court noted that the plaintiff had different attorneys representing her in the different proceedings (as here), and that there was no mention in the workers\u2019 compensation release form of the pending civil lawsuit (as here). <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1341-1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Defendants insist, however, that in <em>Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 299, this court effectively disapproved the Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 590, and in <em>Lopez, supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d 31. They construe <em>Jefferson </em>as holding that, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, an employee\u2019s execution of the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>compromise and release form, with its standard language releasing \u201call claims and causes of action,\u201d also releases claims that fall outside the workers\u2019 compensation system. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In <em>Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 299, the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release form had <em>an attachment </em>expressing the parties\u2019 intent to have the release also apply to the employee\u2019s civil action alleging sex discrimination. We held that the release did encompass the civil claims. Our reasons were: (1) the attachment to the workers\u2019 compensation release form clearly stated the parties\u2019 intent to also settle claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation law, and (2) the plaintiff had not offered extrinsic evidence establishing the parties\u2019 contrary intent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 304.) That is not the situation here. There is no attachment to the workers\u2019 compensation release form here. And, contrary to defendants\u2019 contention, <em>Jefferson </em>did not disapprove the Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 590, and in <em>Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 31: \u201c[W]e need not consider whether <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Delaney </em>were correctly decided, and we neither approve nor disapprove their holdings.\u201d <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">To summarize, we hold that the standard language of the preprinted form used in settling workers\u2019 compensation claims releases only those claims that are within the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation system, and does not apply to claims asserted in separate civil actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We turn now to the question of whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to show that the parties intended the release to also apply to claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As discussed below, case law has allowed the use of evidence extrinsic to the language of the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release form to show whether the parties intended to also release claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In a 1983 decision, <em>Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at page 973, this court stated that a claim for death benefits, which fell within the workers\u2019 compensation system, might be barred by the executed workers\u2019 compensation release form if the employer could show that the parties did intend the release to include, as part of their settlement, a claim for death benefits. Thereafter, however, the Courts of Appeal extended the use of extrinsic evidence to show whether the parties intended the release to include claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>(Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 599-600; <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 863; <em>Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">We are now convinced that extrinsic evidence should not be admissible to show that the standard preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form also applies to claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system. To allow such evidence would unduly burden our courts. Illustrative of this point are the Court of Appeal decisions discussed earlier: <em>Lopez, supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d 31; <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 856; <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 590; and <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 1331. In those cases, as here, the employer relied on standard language in the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form as an affirmative defense in the worker\u2019s civil lawsuit and later as the basis for a motion for summary judgment in that action. In each case, the appellate court determined that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the parties intended the workers\u2019 compensation settlement to also apply to claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system, thus requiring further proceedings. This necessitated the presentation of evidence on that issue, and ultimately required resolution of disputed issues of fact as to what occurred in negotiations at the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. Thus, allowing such extrinsic evidence would require our trial courts, which currently are under severe budgetary restraints, to expend their already scarce resources to divine and reconcile the parties\u2019 intentions in signing a standard preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form. And parties too would have to spend time and money in presenting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Moreover, allowing such extrinsic evidence would create a trap for the unwary worker. It is highly unlikely that an injured employee\u2019s settlement of a workers\u2019 compensation claim, by signing the mandatory standard preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form, would alert the worker that the release also applies to claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>hold that the standard language of the release would also apply to the injured worker\u2019s civil claims outside of the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, regardless of whether a civil action has been filed at the time of the execution of the workers\u2019 compensation release, would run counter to the public policy of protecting the injured worker against the unintentional loss of workers\u2019 rights. <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 304; <em>Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 972; <em>Johnson v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 964, 974 [88 Cal.Rptr. 202, 471 P.2d 1002].)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">To disallow such extrinsic evidence would not be unfair to the parties. It would be a simple matter for parties who have agreed to settle not only workers\u2019 compensation claims but also claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system to execute another document expressing that agreement. Thus, execution of the mandatory standard preprinted compromise and release form would only establish settlement of the workers\u2019 compensation claims; the intended settlement of claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system would have to be reflected in a separate document. (See <em>Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 299 [attachment to workers\u2019 compensation form documented release of claims outside of workers\u2019 compensation]; <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 600 [parties should augment workers\u2019 compensation form to expressly refer to release of claims outside of workers\u2019 compensation].) As is true with settlements in civil actions generally, the separate document need not identify precise claims; it would be sufficient to refer generally to causes of action outside the workers\u2019 compensation law \u201cin clear and non-technical language.\u201d <em>(Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 972.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Our holding changes existing law on the admissibility of evidence extrinsic to the workers\u2019 compensation release to try to show that the release included causes of action outside the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 39; <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 863-864; see <em>Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 973.) We therefore must determine whether our holding should be applied retroactively or only prospectively. We now consider that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u201cAlthough as a general rule judicial decisions are to be given retroactive effect [citation], there is a recognized exception when a judicial decision changes a settled rule on which the parties below have relied. [Citations.] \u2018[Considerations of fairness and public policy may require that a decision be given only prospective application. [Citations.] Particular considerations relevant to the retroactivity determination include the reasonableness of the parties\u2019 reliance on the former rule, the nature of the change as substantive or procedural, retroactivity\u2019s effect on the administration of justice, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>purposes to be served by the new rule. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 345, 372 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 58 P.3d 367]; accord, <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 330 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We conclude that our holding should apply only prospectively. The rule we are changing is one that parties in this and other cases may have relied on in settling claims. In particular, employers may have refrained from proposing and executing separate documents expressly releasing claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system because they were confident they could prove by extrinsic evidence a mutual intent to release such claims. Our holding barring the admission of extrinsic evidence for this purpose has a substantive effect because it may, in individual cases, effectively alter the legal consequences of executing the standard compromise and release form. Although barring the use of extrinsic evidence will preserve judicial resources, denying retroactive application will not unduly impact the administration of justice because it will merely permit a gradual and orderly transition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that considerations of fairness and public policy require prospective application, and that for any preprinted workers\u2019 compensation settlement form executed before the finality of this decision (see <em>Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 974), extrinsic evidence may be admitted to prove the parties intended to release claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">George, C. J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Chin, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> The compromise and release here, in addition to the preprinted release language in paragraph 3 quoted at page 371, <em>ante, </em>contains a paragraph 10 that says: \u201cThe nature, duration, extent and cause of the employee\u2019s disability are in dispute. Applicant desires to control his/her future medical expenses. Defendants desire to buy their peace. The parties desire to settle the hazards, risks, and delays of litigation for a lump sum certain. All parties agree that the Compromise and Release is a fair and equitable settlement. The parties require that the consideration for this Compromise and Release includes full compensation for all injuries sustained by the applicant while employed by defendants, including all specific injuries and continuous trauma. The medical record is herein incorporated by reference. The parties waive Labor Code \u00a7 5313 [the statute requiring the workers\u2019 compensation judge to make factual findings and a decision determining the rights of the parties].\u201d The form\u2019s references to disability, medical expenses, injuries sustained during employment, and a waiver of findings and decisions to be made by a workers\u2019 compensation judge, suggest that the release does not apply to claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system. (See <em>Sumner, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 973, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">It would be helpful to all concerned, of course, if this suggestion could be made more explicit. We urge those responsible for drafting the standard worker\u2019s compensation compromise and release form to revise that form to include a statement, in the clearest possible terms, that execution of the form has no effect on claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> In cases involving the execution of the preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form after the finality of this decision, the Court of Appeal decisions in <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 1331, <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 590, <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th 856, and <em>Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 31, are not to be followed to the extent that they allow the admission of extrinsic evidence to try to show that the release extends to claims outside the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> We reject defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiff, by filing her workers\u2019 compensation claim for sexual harassment, necessarily took the position that her claim was within the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, and thus she is estopped from asserting in her civil lawsuit that the sexual harassment is outside of that scheme. The doctrine of judicial estoppel precludes a party from taking inconsistent positions in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 183 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 96].) Here, however, plaintiff has taken <em>the same </em>position\u2014that she was sexually harassed in the course of employment\u2014in two different forums, the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding and the civil action against defendants. Therefore, estoppel does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Our holding that this decision applies prospectively only means that there may be further proceedings in this case addressed to the issue of the intent of the parties in entering into the workers\u2019 compensation compromise and release. In the event that such proceedings in this case do occur, we note that the interpretation of the compromise and release requires consideration of \u201c \u2018all credible evidence offered to prove the intention of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 1342, fn. 3; accord, <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at pp. 862-863.) <em>Kohler v. Interstate Brands Corp. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1096 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 366], is disapproved to the extent it is inconsistent with this view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b418-5\">BROWN, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Au3\">I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal. But that is the only portion of the majority opinion with which I am in accord. In reaching the correct result, the majority\u2014unable to resist the bureaucratic propensity for intermeddling\u2014improperly and unnecessarily creates an exception to our long-standing rules of contract interpretation for a preprinted compromise and release form used in workers\u2019 compensation cases. Because I believe that generally applicable rules should govern here, I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Under Civil Code section 1635, \u201c[a]ll contracts, whether public or private, are to be interpreted by the same rules, except as otherwise provided by this Code.\u201d Our courts have consistently applied this maxim to releases and determined the scope of a release using our long-standing rules of contract interpretation. (See, e.g., <em>Hess v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 516, 524 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 220, 41 P.3d 46] <em>(Hess); Solis v. Kirkwood Resort Co. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 354, 360 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 265] <em>(Solis).) </em>Indeed, we purportedly applied these rules to preprinted release forms used in workers\u2019 compensation cases just two years ago in <em>Jefferson v. Department of Youth Authority </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 299, 304-307 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 391, 48 P.3d 423] <em>(Jefferson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">These rules provide that a \u201ccontract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) \u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone, if possible . . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1639.) But \u201c[w]hen, through fraud, mistake, or accident, a written contract fails to express the real intention of the parties, such intention is to be regarded, and the erroneous parts of the writing disregarded.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u201cThe words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal meaning; unless used by the parties in a technical sense, or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644.) \u201cIf the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain, it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1649.) Moreover, a \u201ccontract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>was made, and the matter to which it relates.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1647.) Thus, \u201c[a]n ambiguity can be patent, arising from the face of the writing, or latent, based on extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>(Solis, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 360.) And, if an ambiguity exists, extrinsic evidence may be admitted in \u201cinterpreting the contract.\u201d <em>(Winet v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554] <em>(Winet).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Although these rules govern all contracts absent a statutory provision to the contrary (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635), the majority refuses to apply them. First, the majority ignores the language of the release (see Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1639, 1644) and holds that \u201cthe standard language of the preprinted form used in settling workers\u2019 compensation claims releases only those claims that are within the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation system, and does not apply to claims asserted in separate civil actions.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 376.) Second, it bars consideration of extrinsic evidence \u201cto show that the standard preprinted workers\u2019 compensation release form also applies to claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The majority, however, identifies no Civil Code or workers\u2019 compensation statute that creates an exception to our long-standing rules of contract interpretation for preprinted release forms used in workers\u2019 compensation cases. Indeed, it provides <em>no </em>statutory basis for its holding, and my review of California law reveals no statutory support for this exception. As such, I see no legitimate ground for creating it. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The majority\u2019s stated grounds for creating such an exception are not compelling. Labor Code former section 4646, subdivision (a), does not support the majority\u2019s proposed exception to our long-standing rules of contract interpretation because there is no statutory basis for the majority\u2019s holding. <em>Rodgers v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 567, 575-576 [214 Cal.Rptr. 303], is also inapposite. In <em>Rodgers, </em>the Court of Appeal applied our rules of contract interpretation and found that the language of the preprinted release form, by its terms, did not encompass a workers\u2019 compensation claim predicated on a <em>new </em>injury suffered during rehabilitation services <em>after </em>the claimant signed the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Likewise, the Court of Appeal cases cited by the <em>majority\u2014Lopez v. Sikkema </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 31 [280 Cal.Rptr. 7] <em>(Lopez), Asare v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 856 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 452] <em>(Asare), Delaney v. Superior Fast Freight </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 590 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] <em>(Delaney), </em>and <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Union Central Life Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1331 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 732] (Mitchell)\u2014are not persuasive. To the extent these cases exempt preprinted release forms used in workers\u2019 compensation cases from our rules of contract interpretation, they provide no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>statutory basis for doing so. Absent such a basis, these cases do not and cannot support the majority\u2019s holding. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Moreover, these cases misread our decision in <em>Sumner v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 965 [191 Cal.Rptr. 811, 663 P.2d 534] <em>(Sumner). </em>In <em>Sumner, </em>an employee executed a preprinted release form containing virtually the same language at issue here. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 967-969.) Based on this language, the employer contended the employee released his claim for death benefits\u2014a claim that he did not know of at the time he signed the release. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 969.) Because the employee was unsophisticated and executed the release without the benefit of counsel <em>(id. </em>at p. 972), we concluded that the release did not cover the plaintiff\u2019s unknown claim for death benefits. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 972-973.) We reached this conclusion even though the release included an addendum waiving all unknown claims and eschewing the benefits of Civil Code section 1542. <em>(Sumner, </em>at pp. 972-973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In reaching this conclusion, however, we did not create an exception to our long-standing rules of contract interpretation. Specifically, <em>Sumner </em>did not, as suggested by <em>Lopez, Asare, Delaney </em>and <em>Mitchell, </em>place the burden on employers to enumerate the causes of action covered by the preprinted release form even though the form expressly covered all \u201cclaims and causes of action.\u201d (See <em>Lopez, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 38-39; <em>Asare, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 864; <em>Delaney, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at pp. 599-600; <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1341-1342.) Instead, <em>Sumner </em>simply applied our rules of contract interpretation and the case law construing these rules. These rules provide that \u201c[a] general release does not extend to claims which the creditor <em>does not know or suspect to exist </em>in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1542, italics added.) Although a releasor may waive all unknown claims despite the protections of Civil Code section 1542, an \u201coblique reference to \u2018all known and unknown\u2019 claims\u201d is not enough. <em>(Winet, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1170.) Moreover, any waiver of the benefits of Civil Code section 1542 is invalid if the releasor is unsophisticated and lacks the advice of independent counsel. (See <em>Winet, </em>at p. 1170.) Because the plaintiff in <em>Sumner </em>was unsophisticated and lacked independent counsel, we applied these rules to hold that the preprinted release form and addendum did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s unknown claim for death benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (See <em>Casey v. Proctor </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 97, 109 [28 Cal.Rptr. 307, 378 P.2d 579].) Thus, <em>Sumner </em>followed our rules of contract interpretation and did not create an exception to these rules for preprinted release forms used in workers\u2019 compensation settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>In any event, as the majority observes, our Courts of Appeal have uniformly \u201cextended the use of extrinsic evidence to show whether the parties intended the release to include claims <em>outside </em>the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 377.) As such, the cited cases do not support the majority\u2019s decision to prohibit the consideration of extrinsic evidence, in direct contravention of our rules of contract interpretation. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, \u00a7 1647; <em>Hess, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, the special nature of the workers\u2019 compensation system does not dictate a contrary result. As the majority correctly notes, we must construe the preprinted release form in light of \u201cthe public policy of protecting the injured worker against the unintentional loss of workers\u2019 rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 378.) But the majority conveniently forgets that \u201c[w]e have been particularly rigorous about strictly enforcing broad release language in workers\u2019 compensation settlements, because, in that context, [Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB)] oversight helps to ensure fairness.\u201d <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 303-304.) Indeed, workers and their attorneys\u2014and not employers\u2014are in the best position to know what claims they plan to pursue as a result of a work-related injury. I therefore see no statutory or policy grounds for giving workers settling a workers\u2019 compensation claim greater protection than litigants settling any other claim. Accordingly, our long-standing rules of contract interpretation should govern our interpretation of preprinted release forms used in workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">As described above, our rules of contract interpretation provide, in relevant part, that a \u201crelease of \u2018 \u201c[a]ll claims\u201d \u2019 [citations] covers claims that are not expressly enumerated in the release\u201d absent \u201cfraud, deception or similar abuse.\u201d <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 305.) Extrinsic evidence may, however, establish \u201cthat the release refers only to all claims <em>of a particular type, </em>and consideration of extrinsic evidence would be appropriate where . . . the parties know of a particular claim but do not refer to it expressly in their release. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If no extrinsic evidence of a narrower construction exists, however, the release of \u201call claims and causes of action\u201d must be given comprehensive scope. Otherwise, \u201cit [would be] virtually impossible to create a general release that . . . actually achieve[d] its literal purpose.\u201d <em>(Winet, supra, </em>4 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1172-1173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In this case, plaintiff Carolyn Claxton did not claim fraud, deception, or similar abuse. Thus, under our rules of contract interpretation, the ordinary and popular meaning of the language of the preprinted release form governs absent an ambiguity. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1639, 1644, 1649.) This language, by its terms, bars claims that are not expressly enumerated in the release\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>including claims that fall outside the workers\u2019 compensation system. Indeed, by expressly barring <em>both </em>\u201cclaims and causes of action,\u201d the release necessarily encompasses more than just \u201cclaims\u201d within the scope of the workers\u2019 compensation system. Otherwise, the release could have just barred \u201cclaims\u201d\u2014and not \u201ccauses of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Nonetheless, the extrinsic evidence establishes an ambiguity as to the scope of the release in this particular context. At the time plaintiff signed the release, both plaintiff and defendants knew of plaintiff\u2019s claim of sexual harassment in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.). Thus, the failure of the release to mention the FEHA claim creates a latent ambiguity (see <em>Solis, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th at p. 360), and leaves unresolved the issue of whether the parties intended to release plaintiff\u2019s FEHA claim (see <em>Hess, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 527 [holding that the failure of a release to mention an outstanding claim known to the parties establishes an ambiguity as to the scope of that release]). Absent extrinsic evidence establishing that the parties did not intend for the release to cover the FEHA claim, however, the ordinary and popular meaning of the language of the release controls and bars the claim. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1639, 1644.) Thus, to avoid summary judgment, plaintiff had to introduce extrinsic evidence demonstrating that the parties did not intend for the release to cover the FEHA claim. (See <em>Hess, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 527; see also Civ. Code, \u00a7 1647.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">And plaintiff did so. First, the release describes plaintiff\u2019s injuries as \u201cPsyche, left Lower Extremity.\u201d In doing so, the release apparently refers only to plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim predicated on her knee injury and the injury to her psyche caused by that injury, and implicitly excludes the injury to her psyche caused by the alleged sexual harassment. Second, the release contains a waiver of prospective rehabilitation services with the requisite finding by the workers\u2019 compensation judge. (See Lab. Code, former \u00a7 4646.) The presence of this waiver suggests that the parties contemplated the possibility of additional damages not covered by the workers\u2019 compensation scheme and specifically chose to exclude plaintiff\u2019s FEHA claim from the scope of the release. Third, the release only covers claims against defendant Pacific Maritime Association, plaintiff\u2019s employer, and does not include claims against the alleged harasser Ray Waters\u2014a named defendant in the FEHA action. The release\u2019s failure to mention one of the named defendants in the FEHA action suggests that the parties did not intend for the release to cover the FEHA claim. Finally, the WCAB order approving the settlement states that it was only \u201csettling this case.\u201d By expressly limiting the settlement to <em>\u201cthis </em>case,\u201d the order suggests that the release covered only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation cases and no other cases in existence at that time\u2014such as plaintiff\u2019s FEHA action already filed in state court. Viewed in its totality, this evidence establishes a triable issue as to whether the parties intended for the release to encompass plaintiff\u2019s FEHA cause of action. Accordingly, I join the majority in affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, reversing summary judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On September 15, 2004, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> <em>Sumner </em>does not control here because plaintiff knew about the statutory cause of action at issue here and had the benefit of independent counsel at the time she signed the release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
