Code, \u00a7 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found true the special circumstance allegations that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(G)), robbery <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(17)(A)), rape <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(17)(C)), and sodomy <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(17)(D)). It also convicted defendant of the robbery (\u00a7 211), rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)), and sodomy (286, subd. (c)) of Clement, as well as the burglary of her residence (\u00a7 459), but it failed to reach a verdict on charges concerning two other victims. The same jury subsequently set the penalty at death. The trial court denied the automatic motion to modify the penalty (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)) and sentenced defendant to death. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862] <em>(Carlos), </em>we held that even when the defendant is the actual killer, intent to kill is an element of the felony-murder special circumstance. While this aspect of <em>Carlos </em>was overruled in <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306] <em>(Anderson), </em>we subsequently held that \u201c[c]ases involving the felony-murder special circumstance committed after <em>Carlos </em>but before <em>Anderson . . . </em>must apply the intent-to-kill requirement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wharton </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 522, 586, fn. 16 [280 Cal.Rptr. 631, 809 P.2d 290].) The murder in the present case occurred in the <em>Carlos/Anderson </em>\u201cwindow period.\u201d Because the trial court\u2019s failure <em>to </em>instruct the jury on the intent-to-kill requirement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we affirm the conviction for first degree felony murder and the underlying felonies, but reverse the special circumstance findings and resulting death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">A. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Following the guilt phase of the jury trial, defendant was convicted of the murder of Delores Clement (\u00a7 187) with the special circumstances that the murder was committed during the commission of burglary, robbery, sodomy, and rape (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)). Defendant also was convicted of the burglary of the Clement residence (\u00a7 459) and the robbery (\u00a7 211), sodomy (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)), and rape (\u00a7261, subd. (a)(2)) of Clement. The jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>unable to reach verdicts on the additional charges that defendant had murdered and sexually assaulted Laverne Stolzy and had sexually assaulted Olga B. The multiple-murder special circumstance (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)), which was based on the Clement and Stolzy murders, was therefore not proven. Following the penalty phase, the jury set the penalty at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">After the trial court denied the automatic motion to modify the penalty (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)), it sentenced defendant to death. In addition, the trial court imposed a total determinate term of 11 years based on defendant\u2019s convictions for robbery, sodomy, and rape, and ordered that the determinate term run consecutive to defendant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">B. <em>Guilt Phase Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">1. <em>Delores Clement Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Delores Clement, 55 years old, lived in an apartment building on South Dunsmuir Avenue in Los Angeles. In the late night or early morning hours of September 26 and September 27, 1984, her upstairs neighbor was awakened by a scream. On the morning of September 27, 1984, a second neighbor noticed that the screen was missing from Clement\u2019s bedroom window, looked inside, and saw Clement\u2019s body. Police officers found Clement\u2019s body on top of the bed, facedown. Her nightgown had been pulled up above her chest near her shoulders. There was blood around her head and anal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Forensic print specialist William Leo obtained a latent fingerprint and palm print from the inside edge of the doorframe of Clement\u2019s closet. Leo testified at trial that he compared those prints to an ink fingerprint card that he had obtained from defendant. Leo stated that the latent prints obtained from the crime scene were defendant\u2019s. Criminalist Doreen Music recovered hair samples from the victim\u2019s body and right index finger. On October 10, 1984, she compared those hair samples to hair samples obtained from defendant. Music determined that the hair fragment recovered from Clement\u2019s right index finger was \u201csimilar in microscopic characteristics to the pubic hair samples\u201d obtained from defendant \u201c[a]nd therefore, these items could have a common origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">On September 29, 1984, defendant was interviewed by Los Angeles Police Department Robbery-Homicide Detective Woodrow Parks at the Wilshire Jail. Defendant denied any involvement in the Clement murder. Detective Parks testified that he was informed on October 9, 1984, that defendant\u2019s fingerprints matched the prints recovered at the Clement residence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>He obtained a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. At approximately 6:30 p.m. on the same date, defendant was arrested at his house on South Brunson Street in Los Angeles. Detective Parks stated that defendant did not appear to be under the influence and was \u201cvery cooperative and very talkative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Defendant was advised that he was under arrest for the murder of Delores Clement. Detective Parks and his partner, Los Angeles Police Department Robbery-Homicide Detective James McCann, told defendant that they knew he had committed the murder because his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene. Defendant replied, \u201cWell, I figured I\u2019d see you again, and you know I did that murder.\u201d During the ride to the police station, defendant volunteered that he killed Delores Clement. He added that he was sorry about what had happened because he had just wanted to commit a burglary. He also stated that had not intended to rape Clement, but that he had just gotten excited when he was struggling with her and trying to keep her from screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Once at the police station, defendant made a full confession, which police officers secretly tape-recorded. A portion of this recording was played to the jury. The jury was also provided with a written transcript of this portion of the interview. On the tape recording, defendant stated that he \u201cwas just going [into the Clement residence] to get the money.\u201d When he heard Clement coming into her bedroom, \u201c[he] couldn\u2019t jump out in time so he jumped into the closet.\u201d While in the closet, he saw her purse next to her bed and went to retrieve it. Clement started screaming. Defendant stated that he put his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. They struggled \u201call over the bed,\u201d and \u201c[he] was trying to keep her mouth closed with one hand while [he] looked through the purse with the other.\u201d He admitted to raping and sodomizing her after he had gone through her purse and retrieved some money.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Defendant admitted that, after he had sex with Clement, he strangled her with his hands while she was lying on her back. When asked whether he strangled her so she would not tell the police, defendant replied, \u201cNo\u2014 nothing like that. I just wanted ... to get out.\u201d He stated that Clement was \u201cnever dead when I was there.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen I left there, she was . . . down and breathing.\u201d Defendant stated that he stopped having sex with her when he started \u201c[t]hinking about what I was doing.\u201d He added: \u201cI ran ... I didn\u2019t want her to catch her breath and start screaming.\u201d Defendant stated that on the day of the murder he had ingested a quarter-gram or less of cocaine a \u201clong time\u201d before the murder occurred. He added that he drank four beers afterwards, which made the effects of the cocaine \u201clinger.\u201d He stated that he was \u201cnever incoherent\u201d while under the influence of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Dr. Susan Selser, a deputy medical examiner in the Los Angeles County Coroner\u2019s Office, testified as to the cause of death of Delores Clement, based on an autopsy report prepared by Dr. Terry Allen, formerly of the same office. Dr. Selser stated that she also reviewed Dr. Allen\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony in this matter. She testified that the cause of Clement\u2019s death was asphyxia due to manual strangulation, to wit, a lack of oxygen due to pressure applied to the neck. She added that the victim had extensive bruises in the neck muscles, a fracture to the hyoid bone, which is a small U-shaped bone at the base of the tongue, a fracture to the thyroid cartilage, which lies just below the hyoid, and petechial hemorrhages along the mucosal surfaces of the larynx. But the victim\u2019s thyroid cartilage was fractured in a manner that left it intact, and Dr. Selser stated that she was unable to determine which of the two fractures had impeded the victim\u2019s breathing. She testified that there was \u201cprobably a partial obstruction\u201d to the victim\u2019s breathing passageway and acknowledged that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that manual pressure was removed from the neck, and the obstruction caused insufficient oxygen to reach the brain. She added that there were also extensive lacerations to Clement\u2019s anus and vagina caused by blunt force trauma. While the injuries were possibly caused by a penis, she stated that \u201canother type of foreign object would be more likely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">2. <em>L\u00e1veme Stolzy Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On the morning of June 26, 1984, L\u00e1veme Stolzy\u2019s body was found at her home by a coworker. She was 56 years old. Her blouse was pushed up over her breasts and she was naked from the neck down. Police observed a \u201cconsiderable amount of blood to the top of her hair.\u201d There was a piece of wood in the room (commonly referred to as a \u201ctwo-by-four\u201d) that appeared to have blood and hair on it at one end, and a piece of corncob lying on the floor between her feet. Semen was present on the narrow end of the corncob. The pathologist testified that there were extensive fractures to the top, middle, front, and base of Stolzy\u2019s skull and the cause of death was multiple cerebral injuries due to blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Ollie Coleman, a neighbor of Stolzy\u2019s, was the prosecution\u2019s only eyewitness. On the night of the murder, he was standing outside of his house when he saw defendant walk behind the Stolzy residence. Defendant was back there for \u201cmaybe ten minutes or so,\u201d so Coleman walked over to \u201csee what was happening with this guy.\u201d Coleman passed by defendant and they exchanged greetings. This encounter lasted five seconds. They were \u201cface to face, one or two feet\u201d away from each other. Defendant walked away, but returned shortly thereafter and walked down Stolzy\u2019s driveway. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Approximately 30 minutes later, he saw defendant get into Stolzy\u2019s car, start it, and attempt to drive off. Coleman testified that he had \u201cno doubt in [his] mind\u201d that defendant was the person he saw the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Detective Parks testified that the day after defendant\u2019s arrest, October 10, 1984, he asked defendant to remove his shoes in order to get a footprint. He stated that defendant asked him, \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Parks stated that \u201cDetective McCann told him that we had his footprints at the murder scene of the woman that was killed on 23rd Street in June\u201d (the Stolzy murder) and defendant responded, \u201cWell, you better check your evidence on that case because when I did her, I never took my clothes off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">3. <em>Olga B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Olga B., 58 years old, was deemed unavailable to testify at trial due to her poor health; her preliminary hearing testimony was thus read to the jury. On August 22, 1984, she was alone in the kitchen of her home on South Spaulding Street in Los Angeles. Her \u201cwhole house was lit up.\u201d She saw defendant against the wall in her living room and tried to run. Defendant grabbed her from behind, choked her, and put her on a chair in the dining room. Defendant removed her shorts and orally copulated her by placing his tongue into her vagina. He then removed his trousers and tried to rape her. Defendant eventually ejaculated into a towel. He took the money in her purse and fled. The victim identified defendant in a photographic lineup on October 18, 1984, and in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Lee Mann, a criminalist with the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that he located a seminal stain on Olga B.\u2019s towel and checked the stain to determine its blood type, which can be classified into three basic blood grouping systems. Mann determined that the person depositing the seminal stain was a type B secretor, and that the seminal fluid was PGM type 1, and PEP-A type 1. Mann concluded that \u201c6 or 7 percent\u201d of the population would exhibit all of the above characteristics, and defendant was in that group.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">C. <em>Penalty Phase Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2W\">1. <em>Prosecution Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">At the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecution introduced evidence of four additional crimes allegedly committed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">a. <em>Barbara A. and Peter Klevecz</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">On April 13, 1984, at 12:30 a.m., Barbara A. and Peter Klevecz were at Dockweiler Beach in El Segundo. They were on a date and drinking beer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>She was a virgin. As they were leaving, defendant and his brother, Reginald Haley, asked them for a beer. After Klevecz gave defendant and his brother the beer, one of them pulled out a gun and demanded money. After Klevecz gave them his money, he and Barbara A. were taken to a lifeguard tower and put on separate sides so they could not see each other. Defendant attempted to rape Barbara A. but was unsuccessful. Reginald Haley then tried to rape her, but also was unsuccessful. He then sodomized her. Defendant returned and vaginally penetrated Barbara A. while she was facing downward. Klevecz was held at gunpoint during the sexual attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">On October 24, 1985, Barbara A. identified defendant at a live lineup. She also identified him at the preliminary hearing and at trial. Klevecz remembered hearing the name \u201cRegg\u201d spoken by one of the assailants. Barbara A. distinctly remembered that Reginald Haley called defendant \u201cKev\u201d during her ordeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">b. <em>Elizabeth Burns</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">On May 21, 1982, police officers discovered the badly beaten body of Elizabeth Bums, age 87. Her robe was pulled up to her midthigh area and wrapped around her. Her false teeth were lying on the floor next to her, and she appeared to have been sexually assaulted. An autopsy revealed that she died from multiple traumatic injuries and suffered severe injuries to the head, as well as injuries to the anus and vagina, consistent with having been raped and sodomized.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">David Gerhardt stated that he was a burglar and had known defendant and his brother Regg for seven years. He stated that one time he and the Haley brothers were \u201criding around in a car\u201d and defendant, pointing out the Bums residence, told Gerhardt that he and his brother had been \u201ccasing the place.\u201d On a different occasion, he and Reginald Haley went to the residence on foot with the intention of committing a burglary, but Gerhardt withdrew when they discovered an elderly lady was at home. About two weeks later, defendant told Gerhardt that he and his brother had successfully committed that burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">Gerhardt was subsequently put in jail, where he saw defendant. Defendant told Gerhardt that he was being charged with \u201cthis particular Beverly Hills murder,\u201d and Gerhardt said, \u201cYou mean the one that you and Reginald did?\u201d Haley replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d Gerhardt responded, \u201cYou mean the old lady was there and you did the burglary?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cYeah,\u201d and indicated that he and his brother killed the lady. It was stipulated, however, that defendant had not been charged with the Burns murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>c. <em>Willa Gerber</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">On May 17, 1984, at 5:30 a.m., as part of her usual routine, Willa Gerber went jogging from her house on Whitworth Avenue in Los Angeles toward Beverly Hills. While she was jogging, a dirty maroon 1965 Mustang with a blackish top drove slowly past her. She watched as the car turned around and came back toward her, halting in the middle of the street. Defendant got out of the car holding a gun and told her to \u201cget in the car.\u201d He grabbed her and they struggled. Gerber stated that, \u201cHe was pulling me and I was battling, and he pushed me down so that my head hit the street, . . . and I mean it cracked my head.\u201d While she was lying on the pavement, defendant pointed a gun at her face. She heard a click. She then got up and ran. Defendant followed in the car. Gerber jumped over the picket fence of a house on Steams Avenue. While she was standing in the yard area, defendant leaned out of the car and fired the gun. She was hit twice. One bullet went into her thigh, through her stomach and out her waist. The second bullet went through her buttocks and lodged in her waist.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">d. <em>Jodie Samuels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">At 6:45 a.m. on May 17, 1984, approximately one hour after Willa Gerber was shot, Harold Ray was in his house on 23rd Street and Longwood in Los Angeles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when he heard someone screaming and realized it was Jodie Samuels, a 15-year-old girl who lived in his neighborhood. Mr. Ray heard her say, \u201cGet away from me, somebody call the cops.\u201d He heard a male voice say, \u201cCome back here.\u201d As he opened the door to see what was happening, he heard two shots. He saw a Ford Mustang in the street, vintage 1965 or 1964, black or dark gray in color with primer spots. The car, he said, was not maroon. He saw a male getting into the vehicle and described him as a light-complexioned Black man with a longer than average neck, approximately five-foot eight or nine inches tall. He did not identify defendant at a live lineup on October 18, 1984. Looking at defendant in court, he said the man he saw that day \u201clooked a lot lighter than [defendant] in my opinion, lighter in complexion.\u201d Jodie Samuels\u2019s mother, Dorothy Samuels, stated that she heard gunshots and saw her daughter lying in the street. Her daughter\u2019s white purse was missing. Jodie died three days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Los Angeles Police Department Robbery-Homicide Detective Fred Miller responded to the location of the Willa Gerber shooting incident and observed the recovery of \u201ca slug, [a] spent round on the ground in the driveway.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>An expended bullet was also recovered from Jodie Samuels\u2019s body during her autopsy. Lawrence Baggett, assigned to the firearms identification unit of the City of Los Angeles, microscopically compared the two expended bullets and concluded that they had been fired from the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">2. <em>Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The sole witness called for the defense at the penalty phase was Kathy Pedzek, an eyewitness identification expert, who explained several factors that can affect the accuracy of eyewitness identifications. Defense counsel did not present any mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">A. <em>Claims Related to Defendant\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Defendant makes three claims related to his statements to police: (1) the initial statements he made to the police following his arrest were involuntary because the police threatened to kill him and his intoxication made him susceptible to that threat; (2) these initial statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602]; and (3) because his initial statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>his subsequent statements, obtained after a valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver, were tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">For the reasons stated below, we hold that defendant\u2019s initial statements to police were voluntary and were not the product of an interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>As such, defendant\u2019s <em>post-Mirandized </em>statements, most significantly the statements contained in the subsequent, tape-recorded confession, are admissible. Even assuming arguendo that defendant\u2019s initial, voluntary statements to police were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>his tape-recorded confession is still admissible because the subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who has given voluntary but unwarned statements suffices to remove the conditions that would preclude admission of the earlier statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements to the police was litigated prior to trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court considered the motion based on the preliminary hearing testimony of Detective McCann, defendant\u2019s tape-recorded confession, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>transcript of the tape recording, and defendant\u2019s testimony at the hearing. The basis for the motion was that the change in defendant\u2019s tone of voice during the recorded interview suggested a \u201csobering up,\u201d which indicated a lack of voluntariness. Defendant never specifically moved to exclude the initial statements he made in the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Detective McCann stated in his preliminary hearing testimony that he contacted defendant in jail after defendant was arrested on September 28, 1984, on an unrelated burglary charge. After waiving his constitutional rights, defendant denied any involvement in the Clement murder. He was subsequently released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">On October 9, 1984, a latent print technician informed Detective McCann that defendant\u2019s fingerprints matched latent prints that had been located inside Clement\u2019s apartment. After securing a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest, McCann, accompanied by his partner, Detective Parks, and a uniformed officer, arrested defendant inside his house and placed him in the rear seat of the detectives\u2019 police vehicle. Defendant stated, \u201cI knew I\u2019d see you again,\u201d and in response, Detective McCann stated, \u201cYeah, now we know that you did kill Delores Clement.\u201d Defendant paused for a moment and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I did it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Detective McCann then obtained defendant\u2019s consent to search his room. He also informed defendant that he and his partner would interview defendant further at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">While en route to the police station, defendant continued to talk about the Clement murder. When it appeared that defendant was beginning an \u201congoing narrative,\u201d Detective McCann advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which defendant waived. Detective McCann stated that defendant \u201ckept stressing the fact he went over to the Clement residence to commit a burglary, that it had not been his intent to commit a murder.\u201d Defendant added that he had not intended to commit a rape. Instead, defendant stated that he had concealed himself in the victim\u2019s bedroom closet, the victim entered and they struggled; defendant became excited during the struggle and raped Clement. Detective McCann informed defendant that the detectives would conduct a detailed interview at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Once at the station, the detectives secretly recorded their interview with defendant. On the tape recording, he was again advised of his constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rights and he agreed to talk to the detectives.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After receiving this waiver, Detective McCann asked, \u201cDo you wish to give up the right to speak with an attorney and to have him present during questioning? Can you sit and talk to me right now and answer my questions without having an attorney present?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cYes, I could. But\u2014you know how I feel, but I\u2019m gonna do it *** \u2019cause *** I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want to get jumped on ***.\u201d Detective McCann responded, \u201cWell, Kevin, nobody\u2019s gonna jump on you. I want to ask you these questions . . . [a]nd if you want to talk to me about it, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not gonna jump on you. I\u2019m not gonna let anyone else jump on you.\u201d Defendant replied: \u201c*** gonna tell you everything, whether *** want it there or not, I just ***.\u201d The detective replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d Defendant then provided a detailed account of his involvement in the Clement murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Defendant testified during the hearing to show, according to defense counsel, defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind at the time just before the [first] statement was made and during the [tape-recorded] statement that he was under the influence of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Defendant stated that he was smoking cocaine with his girlfriend in his room shortly before he was arrested and it made him \u201cparanoid and light in the head.\u201d He explained that he \u201ccame down\u201d during the interview and \u201cwasn\u2019t at all in [his] best mind at the time.\u201d He stated that Detective McCann had threatened him at his house, slammed him down on his bed and said \u201che was going to shoot [him] on the way to the police station.\u201d On cross-examination, defendant stated that he received his constitutional rights in the police car because he reminded the officers to do so. He agreed that he waived his constitutional rights at the police station. He agreed that no cocaine paraphernalia was found in his room. He told the court that only after he confessed to the Clement murder did he state that he wanted to talk to an attorney. On redirect examination, he stated that he was not as under the influence at the police station as he had been in the house. But then he agreed that he was still under the influence when he admitted killing Clement.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The trial court denied the motion to exclude defendant\u2019s statements, ruling that the bulk of the tape-recorded statement was admissible. The court, however, did suppress statements made by defendant later in the tape-recorded statement, after he confessed to the Clement murder. Specifically, the court ruled that the detectives persisted in questioning defendant about the Stolzy murder after he had invoked his right to remain silent. The court also ruled that defendant\u2019s reference to being \u201cjumped on\u201d was not \u201cindicative of a threat [but that defendant did not] want the [officers\u2019] criticism,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s change in demeanor, which it noticed from listening to the tape recording, was not the result of \u201ccoming down off of the cocaine use.\u201d Instead, the court found that it is \u201cequally and perhaps more persuasive he is upset about having given the details of a very gory murder to the police, and that seems to cause his reluctance to talk further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">2. <em>Voluntariness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Defendant argues that his tape-recorded confession at the police station was involuntary \u201cbecause McCann had threatened to kill him and because he was under the influence of cocaine.\u201d This claim is based solely on defendant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, in which he alleged that Detective McCann threatened to kill him on the way to the police station and that he had smoked cocaine shortly before his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u201c[T]he state\u2019s burden is to prove the voluntariness of a confession by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Weaver </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 920 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 29 P.3d 103].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cUnder both state and federal law, courts apply a \u2018totality of circumstances\u2019 test to determine the voluntariness of a confession. [Citations.] Among the factors to be considered are \u2018 \u201cthe crucial element of police coercion [citation]; the length of the interrogation [citation]; its location [citation]; its continuity\u201d as well as \u201cthe defendant\u2019s maturity [citation]; education [citation]; physical condition [citation]; and mental health.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] On appeal, the trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the confession are. upheld if supported by substantial evidence, but the trial court\u2019s finding as to the voluntariness of the confession is subject to independent review.\u201d <em>(People v. Massie </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 550, 576 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 967 P.2d 29].)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The trial court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s tape-recorded confession was voluntary is supported by substantial evidence. The trial court had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>opportunity to observe defendant testify and judge his credibility. Despite defendant\u2019s claim that he smoked cocaine shortly before his arrest, no cocaine paraphernalia was found in his room. In addition, the tape recording reveals that defendant was responsive to the officer\u2019s questioning, recalled the incident in great detail, and never mentioned during the interview that he was under the influence or otherwise mentally impaired. These factors support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was not \u201cunder the influence of any narcotic or dangerous drug,\u201d and that his change in demeanor was \u201cattributable solely to the fact\u201d that he had just provided the police with details of \u201ca very gory murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Nor did the trial court credit defendant\u2019s testimony that Detective McCann threatened to kill him when he was arrested. Certainly, defendant\u2019s credibility was in question given that his testimony about smoking cocaine in his room shortly before his arrest was impeached by the fact no cocaine paraphernalia was found there. Instead, the court credited the preliminary hearing transcript testimony of Detective McCann, who described defendant as very eager to talk on the way to the police station. Detective McCann\u2019s testimony is corroborated by the fact that defendant was cooperative during the portion of the tape-recorded interview in which the Clement murder was discussed. These factors support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s statement in the tape-recorded confession that he did not want to be \u201cjumped on\u201d indicated only that he did not want to be criticized by the officers. Under the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the trial court that defendant\u2019s tape-recorded confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">3. <em>Miranda Waivers Were Knowing, Voluntary, and Intelligent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Defendant makes the related claim that the <em>Miranda </em>waivers he gave both in the patrol car and prior to his taped-recorded confession at the police station were not made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. This claim, too, is based on defendant\u2019s insistence that his statements to police were a product of Detective McCann\u2019s threat to kill him. \u201cIn considering a claim that a statement or confession is inadmissible because it was obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s rights under <em>[Miranda], </em>we accept the trial court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts and inferences, and its evaluation of credibility, if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Wash </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 215, 235 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 421, 861 P.2d 1107].) As discussed above, the trial court chose not to credit defendant\u2019s testimony that the officers threatened to kill him upon his arrest, and thus found that defendant\u2019s initial statements in the patrol car, and those contained in the <em>Mirandized </em>tape-recorded confession, were voluntary. The trial court\u2019s ruling is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>4. <em>No Interrogation Occurred</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Defendant next claims that the detectives violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights when they \u201cinterrogated\u201d him (1) at the police car immediately after his arrest, and (2) while en route to the police station. But defendant never made this specific claim at the trial court level. As such, he has failed to preserve it for review. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 833 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305].) Even assuming that these claims were properly preserved, we reject them.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">a. <em>Statements at the patrol car</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Defendant argues that Detective McCann\u2019s statement to him at the patrol car just after his arrest, that the detectives \u201cknew\u201d he committed the Clement murder because they found his fingerprints at the scene of the crime, constituted an interrogation because it was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">A defendant who is in custody, as here, must be given <em>Miranda </em>warnings before police officers may interrogate him. <em>(Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 291, 297 [64 L.Ed.2d 297, 100 S.Ct. 1682] <em>(Innis).) </em>In <em>Innis, </em>the high court defined the term \u201cinterrogation,\u201d stating that \u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>(Innis, </em>446 U.S. at pp. 300-302, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>In <em>Innis, </em>while the defendant was being transported to the police station, one police officer said to another that he hoped police would continue searching for the missing gun because a student from the school for the handicapped could pick it up and get hurt. <em>(Innis, supra, </em>446 U.S. at pp. 294-295.) The defendant then volunteered the weapon\u2019s location. The court ruled that this brief conversation was not an interrogation because it was \u201cnothing more than a dialogue between the two officers to which no response from respondent was invited.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099], the defendant was being transported to the hospital by the police to obtain a blood sample. He had previously invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He asked the officers what the penalty was for the murder for which he was under arrest, stating: \u201c \u2018What can someone get for something like this, thirty years?\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 982.) The officer responded that he had never seen anyone serve more than seven and a half years unless the person was a \u201c \u2018mass murderer.\u2019 \u201d Following this exchange, the defendant confessed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>We held that this conversation did not constitute an interrogation: \u201cClearly, not all conversation between an officer and a suspect constitutes interrogation. The police may speak to a suspect in custody as long as the speech would not reasonably be construed as calling for an incriminating response.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.) We concluded: \u201cThe record does not establish that defendant was subject to \u2018compelling influences, psychological ploys, or direct questioning.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 986.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>People v. Dominick </em>(1982) 182 Cal.App.3d 1174 [227 Cal.Rptr. 849] <em>(Dominick), </em>defendant Shedelbower invoked his right to an attorney. As the investigators began picking up their notebooks and other materials in preparation to leave the interview room and take the defendant to the booking area, a detective falsely stated to the defendant that the stabbing victim had identified the defendant\u2019s picture as one of the persons who had raped her and murdered her friend. The detective truthfully added that a codefendant was in custody. Five minutes later, the defendant confessed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1189.) The Court of Appeal held that these statements were not an interrogation within the meaning of <em>Innis, </em>stating, \u201cthe officers did not attempt to engage defendant in a conversation but merely offered him justification for retaining him in custody. Their words do not appear to us to be \u2018reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dominick, </em>at p. 1192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>U.S. v. Shedelbower </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 885 F.2d 570, the Court of Appeals upheld the state court\u2019s ruling in <em>Dominick, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d 1174. Relying on <em>Innis, </em>the court ruled that the detective\u2019s statements that the victim identified the defendant\u2019s picture and that a codefendant was in custody \u201cwere not the functional equivalent of questioning. They did not call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>for nor elicit an incriminating response. They were not the type of comments that would encourage [the defendant] to make some spontaneous incriminating remark.\u201d <em>(Shedelbower, supra, </em>885 F.2d at p. 573.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In <em>United States v. Moreno-Flores </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 33 F.3d 1164, upon the defendant\u2019s arrest, the officer told him that they \u201chad seized about 600 pounds of cocaine,\u201d that he \u201cwas in serious trouble,\u201d and \u201cwas facing a lengthy prison sentence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1168.) The defendant did not respond. The following morning, after the officer asked him \u201chow his night was,\u201d the defendant confessed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court of appeals, relying on <em>Innis, </em>held that the officer\u2019s statements on the previous night were not express questions, \u201c[n]or did they constitute the functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d <em>(Moreno-Flores, </em>at p. 1169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">These cases are fatal to defendant\u2019s argument. Detective McCann told defendant, in effect, that \u201che knew he did it because his fingerprint was found at the scene.\u201d The detective did not phrase this statement as a question, and this statement did not call for an incriminating response. A brief statement informing an in-custody defendant about the evidence that is against him is not the functional equivalent of interrogation because it is not the type of statement likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>People v. Sims </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 405 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 853 P.2d 992], relied upon by defendant, is inapposite. There, the defendant was in custody in Las Vegas, Nevada, for murders committed in South Carolina and Glendale, California. Two Glendale officers asked the defendant if he wanted to talk about the case, and the defendant invoked his right to counsel. As the officers were leaving, the defendant asked what was going to happen to him, referring to whether he would be extradited to South Carolina or California. One officer then told the defendant that he was wanted for murder in both California and South Carolina and launched into a detailed explanation about the defendant\u2019s involvement in the Glendale crime, providing the defendant with a detailed account of the evidence against him. We stated that the officer\u2019s detailed, nonresponsive answer to the defendant\u2019s extradition question was the \u201c \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 \u201d of questioning because he \u201cpursued a line of conversation far exceeding the scope of any answer legitimately responsive to a question concerning extradition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 442.) Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 247, 274 [256 Cal.Rptr. 96, 768 P.2d 610], we found an <em>Innis </em>violation where the officer, after the defendant invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights to silence and counsel, asked the defendant to reenter an interrogation room and \u201claunched into a monologue on the status of the investigation,\u201d which prompted an incriminating response from the defendant. Such is decidedly not the situation here. Detective McCann made a brief statement to defendant that did not call for an incriminating response, and the record here, unlike in <em>Sims </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and <em>Boyer, </em>does not establish that defendant was subject to compelling influences, psychological ploys, or direct questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">b. <em>Statements en route to the police station</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">While en route to the police station, defendant was \u201cvery eager\u201d to talk about the Clement murder and made incriminating statements. When it appeared that defendant was beginning an \u201congoing narrative,\u201d Detective McCann advised defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, which defendant waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 337 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846], we stated that \u201cnot all statements obtained by the police from a suspect who is incarcerated or otherwise confined are the product of interrogation. Nothing in <em>Miranda </em>is intended to prevent, impede, or discourage a guilty person, even one already confined, from freely admitting his crimes, whether the confession relates to matters for which he is already in police custody or to some other offense. As <em>Miranda </em>itself recognized, \u2018[confessions [are] a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police, station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment\u2019 or subject to the prophylactic requirements of <em>Miranda. </em>[Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Defendant\u2019s statements en route to the police station were volunteered. As noted, the court credited the preliminary hearing transcript testimony of Detective McCann, who described defendant as very eager to talk on the way to the police station. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, there was no interrogation and no <em>Miranda </em>violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">5. <em>The Subsequent Advisement Was Valid</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Defendant also claims that his initial statements when he was arrested and while en route to the police station, because they were obtained illegally, tainted his tape-recorded statement at the police station that was obtained after he was advised of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We disagree. As noted, defendant\u2019s initial statements were not the product of an interrogation within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>Even assuming his initial statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>we conclude that because they were voluntarily given, they did not taint defendant\u2019s subsequent tape-recorded confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 298 [84 L.Ed.2d 222, 105 S.Ct. 1285], the high court rejected the notion that a subsequent confession must necessarily be excluded because it followed an otherwise voluntary statement that was given without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The court stated: \u201cIt is an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda </em>to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspect\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period. Though <em>Miranda </em>requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether is it knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d (470 U.S. at p. 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In <em>Elstad, </em>an officer had come to the defendant\u2019s home to arrest him. Without providing the required <em>Miranda </em>advisement, the officer asked the defendant if he knew why the officer was there and if he knew the burglary victims. The defendant\u2019s response was incriminating. The defendant later gave a full statement at the police station after having been advised of and having waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The high court held that despite the officer\u2019s initial failure to administer warnings to the defendant, the defendant\u2019s statement at the station need not be suppressed: \u201c[Ajbsent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion. A subsequent administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but unwarned statement ordinarily should suffice to remove the conditions that precluded admission of the earlier statement.\u201d <em>(Oregon v. Elstad, supra, </em>470 U.S. at p. 314.) <em>Elstad </em>compels the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">B. <em>Excusal of Four Prospective Jurors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Defendant claims that the trial judge improperly granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to excuse four prospective jurors for cause because there was no showing that their views concerning capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair their performance as jurors. In addition, on October 16, 1993, it was established that the questionnaires completed by these four jurors could not be located. Defendant claims that the absence of these juror questionnaires denies him a meaningful level of appellate review because it cannot be determined from reviewing only the record transcript whether the jurors\u2019 ability to serve was substantially impaired. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>missing juror questionnaires do not impede meaningful appellate review, and that the trial judge properly excused the four prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">1. <em>Lost Juror Questionnaires</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Both the United States Constitution and the California Constitution entitle a criminal defendant to a record on appeal sufficiently complete to permit meaningful appellate review. <em>(People v. Howard </em>(1996) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1165 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315].) In <em>People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 270 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 532, 6 P.3d 193] <em>(Ayala), </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 196, footnote 8 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365] <em>(Alvarez), </em>we held that lost juror questionnaires did not impede meaningful appellate review: \u201cThe record on appeal is inadequate . . . only if the complained-of deficiency is prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s ability to prosecute his appeal. [Citation.] It is the defendant\u2019s burden to show prejudice of this sort. [Citation.] Defendant attempts to carry this burden, but does not succeed. He simply does not show that the absence of the questionnaires is prejudicial to his ability to urge his <em>Wheeler/Batson </em>claim\u2014or any other. Indeed, material from the now lost items survives in the reporter\u2019s and clerk\u2019s transcripts through quotation and paraphrase.\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 196, fn. 8.) In <em>Ayala, </em>we explained that despite the absence of the juror questionnaires the record was sufficiently complete to decide defendant\u2019s <em>Wheeler </em>claims. <em>(Ayala, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 270; see <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79; <em>People v. Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We reach the same conclusion here. The complete transcript of the voir dire process is available for appellate review. The record reveals that during voir dire, the trial judge permitted both attorneys considerable latitude in exploring each juror\u2019s views on the death penalty. The attorneys were free to read questions on a prospective juror\u2019s questionnaire and the prospective juror\u2019s written response, and then ask the prospective juror to further explain his or her written response. Thus, portions of the juror questionnaires have been preserved for appellate review through quotation and paraphrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The voir dire transcript in the present case reveals that each of the challenged jurors gave equivocal or conflicting statements as to whether they could impose the death penalty. This alone is a sufficient basis to uphold the determination of the trial court as to these jurors\u2019 actual state of mind. <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 357 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708] <em>(Carpenter) </em>[\u201cif the juror\u2019s statements [regarding the death penalty] are equivocal or conflicting, the trial court\u2019s determination of the juror\u2019s state of mind is binding\u201d].) Defendant fails to show prejudice because he does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>explain <em>how </em>the missing juror questionnaires undermine this fact. We therefore conclude that the absence of the juror questionnaires does not impede meaningful appellate review in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">2. <em>The Prospective Jurors Were Properly Excused</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A trial judge may properly exclude a prospective juror in a capital case if the juror\u2019s views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his or her duties as a juror in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>(Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 412, 424 [83 L.Ed.2d 841, 105 S.Ct. 844]; <em>People v.

But she acknowledged her opposition to the death penalty in this manner: \u201cIt seems like murder, that man shouldn\u2019t take life, only the Lord.\u201d She agreed that it was \u201creally God\u2019s function to take lives, not ours.\u201d When asked by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>prosecutor what she thought about the death penalty, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it (sic] should be a death penalty.

The prosecutor then asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in the death penalty; that\u2019s clear?\u201d Marvela P. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor stated, \u201cAnd that\u2019s just something you don\u2019t want to deal with; is that right?\u201d Marvela P. replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Based on her inconsistent answers and the fact that she stated \u201cthat man shouldn\u2019t take a life,\u201d the trial judge found that Marvela P. \u201cwould be substantially impaired in terms of her ability to vote for the death penalty.\u201d The trial judge properly excused Prospective Juror Marvela P.

Delores T. also agreed with the defense attorney that she would listen to the evidence, and based on the evidence and the law, would \u201cfollow [her] convictions.\u201d The prosecutor began his questioning of Delores T. by referring her to the following question on her juror questionnaire: \u201cDo you have such an opinion concerning the death penalty that regardless of the evidence that might be revealed during the penalty phase of the trial, should we get there, you would automatically and absolutely refuse to vote for the death penalty in any case?\u201d Delores T. stated that her written response was \u201cyes,\u201d and that \u201cthose were my feelings at the time and basically that remains my feelings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">At a sidebar conference after this questioning, the trial judge stated that Delores T.\u2019s ability to serve as a juror was \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d and therefore granted the prosecutor\u2019s challenge for cause.

But when the prosecutor asked, \u201cBut under the right circumstances, do you think you could [impose the death penalty],\u201d Betty L. responded, \u201cI really don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t.\u201d The prosecutor then stated: \u201cThen you should not be on this jury because you, yourself, could not impose the death penalty?\u201d Betty L. responded, \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">During a sidebar conference, the defense attorney appropriately characterized Betty L.\u2019s testimony when he said, \u201cthe state of the record is somewhat ambiguous as to whether she is substantially impaired.\u201d Based on this ambiguity, the judge properly excused Prospective Juror Betty L.

Margaret S. interrupted, \u201cNo, it\u2019s against my nature.\u201d Later, however, Margaret S. stated that she might be able to impose the death penalty in certain situations, but she could not articulate such situations. Answering questions from the prosecutor, Margaret S. characterized the death penalty and the notion of \u201can eye for an eye,\u201d as \u201ca barbaric cultural practice.\u201d Margaret S. also reiterated her opposition to the \u201cconcept\u201d of the death penalty. Based on her conflicting statements, the trial judge properly excused Prospective Juror Margaret S.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>C. <em>Carlos Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Defendant claims that the felony-murder special-circumstances findings and resulting death sentence must be reversed because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it must find that defendant intended to kill the victim as required by our decision in <em>Carlos, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In <em>Carlos, </em>we held that intent to kill was a required element of the felony-murder special circumstance, whether the defendant was the actual killer or an aider and abettor. <em>(Carlos, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 153-154.) In <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104, we partially overruled <em>Carlos </em>and held that intent to kill is not an element of the felony-murder special circumstance when the defendant is the actual killer; \u201cbut when the defendant is an aider and abetter rather than the actual killer, intent must be proved before the trier of fact can find the special circumstance to be true.\u201d <em>(Anderson, </em>at p. 1139.) <em>Anderson </em>was silent on whether its holding applied retroactively. <em>(In re Baert </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 514 [252 Cal.Rptr. 418].) Defendant committed the Clement murder in September 1984, during the \u201cwindow period\u201d between the decisions in <em>Carlos </em>and <em>Anderson. </em>Moreover, the trial took place in the spring of 1988, after the <em>Anderson </em>decision but before an appellate court had ruled on whether the decision in <em>Anderson </em>applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Against this backdrop, the issue of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>retroactivity was fiercely litigated by the parties. During voir dire, defense counsel requested that the trial court pose questions to the prospective jurors on the intent-to-kill issue, but the court refused. After the jury was sworn, the parties submitted briefs on the <em>Carlos </em>issue. Defense counsel argued that if <em>Carlos </em>did not apply, \u201cthe real legal effect is to prevent the defendant from putting before the jury a defense that he did not have the intent to kill.\u201d The trial judge \u201creluctantly\u201d applied <em>Anderson </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">However, prior to the beginning of the defense case, the trial judge revisited the <em>Carlos </em>issue. Stating that she had not \u201cchanged [her] mind\u201d that <em>Anderson </em>applied retroactively, she nonetheless asked the prosecutor whether he still objected to a <em>Carlos </em>intent-to-kill instruction, given that several judges had informed her \u201cthat other district attorneys have taken the position [that] they don\u2019t want to risk anything, and so they\u2019re willing to accede to a defense request on [the Carlos] instruction.\u201d The prosecutor replied that while \u201cit is possible that maybe we can do it by the way of a special finding . . . I\u2019ll just rely on my understanding of the law that it is retroactive, and let the appellate courts decide the issue . . . .\u201d The court warned that doing so was \u201ca big risk,\u201d but the prosecutor did not waver. As he stated, \u201cthe only thing that is at risk is the special circumstance rather than the case, so I am prepared to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>forward.\u201d The trial court therefore left intact its ruling that defendant would not be permitted to present evidence on the issue of intent to kill because it was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defense counsel immediately sought review of the trial court\u2019s <em>Carlos </em>ruling by filing a petition for writ of prohibition in the Court of Appeal, which was summarily denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court denied review. Accordingly, the jury was not instructed that defendant must have intended to kill Delores Clement in order to be convicted of the felony-murder special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This was error. While <em>\u201cAnderson </em>has since been applied to appellants convicted of <em>pre-Carlos </em>felony murder\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Whitt </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 620, 638 [274 Cal.Rptr. 252, 798 P.2d 849]), \u201c[c]ases involving the felony-murder special circumstance committed after <em>Carlos </em>but before <em>Anderson </em>. . . must apply the intent-to-kill requirement. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Wharton, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 586, fn. 16.) As noted, this murder occurred in the <em>Carlos/Anderson </em>window period. Both parties concede that <em>Carlos </em>error occurred. They differ as to whether the failure to instruct the jury on the intent-to-kill requirement mandates reversal of the special circumstance findings and the judgment of death in this case. It does.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The determination of whether <em>Carlos </em>error is harmless \u201cdepends on application of the harmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osband </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 622, 681 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640] <em>(Osband)) </em>In other words, \u201cerror in failing to instruct that a special circumstance contains a requirement of the intent to kill is harmless when \u2018the evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to kill.. . was overwhelming, and the jury could have had no reasonable doubt on that matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Certainly, if the jury had considered whether defendant intended to kill Clement and returned a finding of guilt, that verdict would have been supported by substantial evidence. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 315, 349 [253 Cal.Rptr. 199, 763 P.2d 1289] [strangulation \u201cis indicative of at least a deliberate intent to kill\u201d].) But the evidence that defendant intended to kill Clement was not overwhelming. Rather, the jury might have believed defendant\u2019s claim that he did not intend to kill the victim and that she was alive when he fled the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Defendant admitted strangling Clement, but asserted that she had interrupted him while he was committing a burglary and he strangled her only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>prevent her from screaming. He denied having strangled her so she would not report his crimes to the police, adding he just wanted \u201cto get out.\u201d He told the police he used a pillow \u201cnot to suffocate her, just to wipe off her face.\u201d Defendant claimed the victim was alive when he left her, stating: \u201c[S]he was just trying to\u2014like, catching her breath away. . . . [S]he was down and breathing.\u201d Defendant added, \u201cI ran\u2014I had to run back out before she\u2014you know-\u2014I didn\u2019t want her to catch her breath and start screaming. I just took off right after that \u2019cause she was just\u2014when I went in there, she was just gasping for air.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Defendant\u2019s initial statements to detectives after his arrest are consistent with his recorded statements. On cross-examination, Detective Parks agreed that, in the police vehicle, defendant stated he just went in to commit a burglary, that he had no intention to hurt anyone, and he just wanted to sneak in, take some money and sneak out again. Detective Parks added that defendant told detectives that \u201che was sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The autopsy report is also consistent with defendant\u2019s version of events. The report listed the cause of death as asphyxia due to manual strangulation, to wit, a lack of oxygen due to pressure applied to the neck. The report supported its conclusion as to the cause of death by pointing to fractures to the victim\u2019s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage. But the victim\u2019s thyroid cartilage was fractured in a manner that left it intact, and the medical examiner was unable to determine which of the two fractures impeded the victim\u2019s breathing. Rather, the medical examiner testified that there was \u201cprobably a partial obstruction\u201d to the victim\u2019s breathing passageway, and acknowledged that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that manual pressure was removed from the neck, and the obstruction caused insufficient oxygen to reach the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262] <em>(Marshall), </em>we reversed a felony-murder special-circumstance finding based upon <em>Carlos </em>error on similar facts, holding that the evidence presented did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill the victim. We stated: \u201cThe pathologist . . . testified (based on the report of another physician who had actually done the autopsy and on photographs taken by others at the crime scene and the autopsy) that the cause of [the victim\u2019s] death was asphyxia caused by a combination of a ligature gag and compression of the neck. On cross-examination, [the pathologist] stated that it was possible for a person to die from a ligature gag alone and that small bones in the neck that are often broken during manual strangulation were not fractured in [the victim\u2019s] neck. From this evidence the jury could reasonably have found that defendant gagged [the victim] to quiet her screams for help, without an intent to kill her, and that [the victim] choked to death on her gag.\u201d <em>(Marshall, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The evidence in the present case could support a finding that defendant intended to kill the victim, but it also is consistent with defendant\u2019s claim that he was merely attempting to silence the victim\u2019s screams. Accordingly, the evidence of intent to kill is not overwhelming and the trial court\u2019s error in failing to instruct the jury that it must find intent to kill in order to find true the felony-murder special circumstance was prejudicial. The cases in which we have concluded that <em>Carlos </em>error was harmless are far different from the present case. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 560-561 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 58 P.3d 931] [single five-to-six-inch-deep stab wound to back of apparently sleeping and helpless victim]; <em>Osband, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 681-682 [severe beating and deep stab wound in the neck of elderly victim that severed carotid artery]; <em>People v.

We further conclude that even if the judge should have given such an instruction, the failure to do so constitutes harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\u201c[A] defendant has a constitutional right to have the jury determine every material issue presented by the evidence [and] ... an erroneous failure to instruct on a lesser included offense constitutes a denial of that right. . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 645 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 629, 22 P.3d 392].) However, a trial judge need not instruct the jury as to all lesser included offenses, just those that find substantial support in the evidence. <em>(People v. Ochoa </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 353, 422 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 408, 966 P.2d 442].) \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 in this context is \u2018 \u201cevidence from which a jury composed of reasonable [persons] could . . . conclude^\u201d \u2019 that the lesser offense, but not the greater, was committed.\u201d <em>(People v. Breverman </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 142, 162 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 870, 960 P.2d 1094].)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>With these principles in mind, we turn to involuntary manslaughter. \u201cWhen a person renders himself or herself unconscious through voluntary intoxication and kills in that state, the killing is attributed to his or her negligence in self-intoxicating to that point, and is treated as involuntary manslaughter.\u201d <em>(People v. Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 423.) Unconsciousness does not mean that the actor lies still and unresponsive. Instead, a person is deemed \u201cunconscious\u201d if he or she committed the act without being conscious thereof. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 423-424.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the present case, defendant argues that the trial judge should have instructed the jury as to the elements of involuntary manslaughter, because defendant presented \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that he was \u201cunconscious\u201d when he murdered the victim. Specifically, defendant claimed in the tape-recorded interview that he ingested cocaine and drank alcohol the night he murdered the victim. Defendant also claimed in the interview that while he was raping the victim, he started thinking about what he was doing and stopped before he ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">No rational jury could have found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter based on this evidence. First, during the tape-recorded confession, defendant never claimed that his cocaine use rendered him \u201cunconscious,\u201d or otherwise made him unaware of what he was doing. To the contrary, defendant admitted that when he smokes cocaine, he is \u201cnever incoherent.\u201d Moreover, defendant was able to recount in great detail his actions on the night of the murder; these details reveal that defendant was not only conscious, but calculating, alert and methodical. For example, defendant described how he entered the victim\u2019s house by removing a screen, then climbing through the open window. After entering, defendant searched for the victim\u2019s purse without being detected by the victim, who was in the house. When the victim entered the bedroom, defendant hid in the closet because he calculated that he could not exit through the window in time. Once the victim noticed defendant and began screaming, he had the presence of mind to keep one hand over her mouth to silence her while he looked through her purse with his other hand. He removed money from the victim\u2019s purse, and was able to recall the approximate amount of money as well as the denominations. Defendant was able to draw a diagram of the location of the victim\u2019s house, and explain his movements once inside the house. Defendant even described the victim in detail, down to the \u201cpink,\u201d \u201clight color\u201d of her \u201cpajamas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The fact that defendant was able to describe the crimes in such detail, as well as act in a cold, calculating manner during the crimes, clearly shows that no reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 353, 424.) The trial judge properly declined to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Even assuming that the trial court should have given the involuntary manslaughter instruction, any such error was harmless because the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts as to burglary and robbery compel the conclusion that the jury rejected defendant\u2019s argument that he was intoxicated to the point that he was unaware of his acts. Specifically, the jury had been instructed that voluntary intoxication could negate the specific intent required for robbery and burglary. In returning its burglary and robbery verdicts, therefore, the jury necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s argument that his alleged intoxication affected his ability to commit the crimes. \u201c[I]n view of the actual verdict returned by the jury . . . there is no reasonable or plausible basis for finding that the instructional error affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>(People v. Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470, 505 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">E. <em>Rape and Sodomy Instructional Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Defendant was charged with first degree felony murder, based on the theory that he murdered Delores Clement during the commission of four different felonies: robbery, burglary, rape, and sodomy. In explaining the elements of these four underlying felonies to the jury, the trial court stated that the crimes of rape and sodomy were general intent crimes. But to be convicted of felony murder, a defendant must have the specific intent to commit one of the enumerated felonies, even if the enumerated felony is a general intent crime, such as rape or sodomy. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hernandez, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 346.) In such situations, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant harbored the specific intent to commit rape or sodomy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 346, fn. 20.) However, the jury was not so instructed. The Attorney General concedes that this was error. Defendant argues the instructional error was prejudicial because there was insufficient evidence of his specific intent to commit rape and sodomy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 470, 504, we held that a \u201ctrial court\u2019s instructional error is amenable to harmless error analysis [when] it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to this jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d We are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error here did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict. Defendant admitted raping and sodomizing Delores Clement after he had gone through her purse and retrieved some money. The coroner added that Clement had extensive lacerations to her anus and vagina caused by blunt force trauma. Defendant\u2019s statement that he had not intended to rape Clement, but \u201cjust got excited when he was holding onto her trying to keep her from screaming\u201d suggests he had not planned to rape Clement, not that the rape was unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In addition, we have found felony-murder instructional error to be harmless where we could \u201cdetermine from the record that the jury necessarily found defendant guilty on a proper theory.\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 38.) In <em>Marshall, </em>defendant contended that his felony-murder conviction had to be reversed because it may have been based on an improper felony-murder theory (robbery rather than rape). We disagreed and stated: \u201cThe jury found true the special circumstance allegation that defendant killed [the victim] during the attempted commission of a rape. Because a jury must unanimously agree that a special circumstance finding is true (\u00a7 190.4), and the jury in this case was so instructed, the jury\u2019s finding that defendant killed [the victim] in the course of committing an attempted rape indicates that the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of first degree murder on the valid theory that the killing occurred during the attempted commission of a rape.\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In the present case, the jury necessarily and unanimously found defendant guilty of first degree murder on a proper felony-murder theory. Specifically, the jury was correctly instructed that defendant must have had the specific intent to commit robbery or burglary in order to be found guilty of first degree felony murder,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and it found true the felony-murder special circumstance that defendant killed the victim during the course of a robbery and burglary. The jury was also instructed that it must decide each special circumstance separately, which \u201cindicates that the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of first degree murder on the valid theory that the killing occurred during the . . . commission of a [robbery or burglary].\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">F. <em>First Degree Felony Murder Based on Sodomy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Defendant correctly contends, and the Attorney General concedes, that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty of first degree felony murder based on the predicate felony of sodomy. In September 1984, when defendant murdered Delores Clement, \u201csection 189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>limited the types of sex offenses that would support a conviction of <em>first degree felony murder </em>to rape (\u00a7 261) and lewd or lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14 years (\u00a7 288). Although murder committed in the course of a sodomy was a special circumstance which, if found true, would support imposition of the death penalty, a jury at the time could consider the sodomy special circumstance only after finding defendant guilty of having committed first degree murder.\u201d <em>(People v. Hart </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 546, 580, fn. 2 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 132, 976 P.2d 683].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This error was harmless. As noted above, <em>Marshall </em>teaches that if the trial court erroneously instructs on felony murder, reversal is not required if there is a basis in the record to conclude that the verdict was based on a valid theory of guilt. <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal. 4th at p. 38.) In the present case, the jury was correctly instructed that defendant must have had the specific intent to commit robbery or burglary in order to be found guilty of first degree felony murder, and it found true the felony-murder special circumstance that defendant killed the victim during the course of a robbery and burglary. The jury was instructed that it must decide each special circumstance separately, which indicates that the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of first degree murder on the valid theory that the killing occurred during the commission of a robbery or burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">G. <em>Inconsistent and Confusing Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by giving confusing, conflicting and erroneous instructions to the jury with respect to the specific intent requirements of robbery and burglary felony murder. The trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury in this regard were the following: \u201cIn the crimes of murder, burglary and robbery ... a necessary element is the existence in the mind of the defendant of the specific intent as included in the definitions of the crimes.\u201d After a brief sidebar conference, the judge said to the jury, \u201cNow, the specific intent, there is a specific intent required with respect to burglary or robbery. The reason the murder count is included in this instruction, is that what the instruction means is basically that in order for you to find the felony murder based upon either\u2014on the burglary or the robbery, you must find the specific intent that is required for the burglary or the robbery. Unless you find those specific intents for the burglary or the robbery, you cannot find the defendant guilty of felony murder based on that burglary or robbery.\u201d The judge then proceeded to read the standard jury instructions for first degree felony murder, robbery and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Defendant asserts that these instructions were erroneous and confusing because the felony-murder rule requires that a defendant must have the specific intent to commit one of the enumerated <em>felonies </em>(e.g., <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Hernandez, <em>supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 346), which means that the defendant must harbor specific intent to commit every element of burglary or robbery, not just the specific intent to steal. The trial judge should have stated, defendant asserts, that the prosecutor needed to prove defendant specifically intended to commit every element of the burglary and robbery, as opposed to stating generally that the specific intent requirement for felony murder is \u201cthe specific intent as included in the definitions of the crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Not so. We rejected this precise argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pollock </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1153, 1175 [13 Cal.Rptr.3d 34, 89 P.3d 353], stating: \u201cDefendant argues that a specific intent to commit the underlying felony means a specific intent to commit the crime as a whole or ... to commit each element of the underlying felony, and not merely the specific intent, if any, that is required for the commission of the underlying felony. [][] Defendant is mistaken, at least as to underlying felonies that are specific intent crimes. For felony murder in the commission of a robbery or of a burglary in which entry is made for the purpose of theft, the only specific intent that the prosecution must prove is the specific intent to steal the victim\u2019s property, which includes a specific intent to permanently deprive the victim of the property. [Citation.] A defendant who has this specific intent has the only specific intent required for liability under the felony-murder rule.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Visciotti </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1, 56 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 495, 825 P.2d 388] [stating that intent to steal is the only mental state relevant to felony murder in the commission of robbery].)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The trial judge\u2019s instructions, therefore, were neither erroneous nor confusing in this regard. Further, the clarification after the sidebar conference appropriately reminded the jury that in order to convict defendant of felony murder, it must find that he had the requisite specific intent required for either robbery or burglary. The judge then properly listed the specific intent requirements for those crimes. Thus, the jury deliberated and reached a verdict with the proper understanding of the specific intent requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">H. <em>Reversal Due to Cumulative Instructional Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Defendant next contends that his convictions should be reversed because even assuming that no single error was prejudicial, the errors considered in total add up to a degree of prejudice requiring reversal. However, because none of the instructional errors in fact prejudiced defendant, his argument for cumulative prejudice must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>HI. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We affirm defendant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder, robbery, burglary, rape, and sodomy. The felony-murder special-circumstance findings are set aside, and the judgment of death is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">George, C.
