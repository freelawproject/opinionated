(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 187, 207, 211, 263.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant admitted special circumstance allegations that the murder had been committed during the course of robbery, burglary and rape, and that he was armed with a firearm in the commission of the offenses; following his waiver of a jury trial, in a separate proceeding the trial court found he had suffered two prior serious felony convictions. (\u00a7\u00a7 190.2, former subd. (a)(17)(i), (ii), (iii), (vii), 12022, subd. (a), 12022.5, 667, subd. (a).) The jury returned a verdict of death. The superior court denied defendant\u2019s application to modify the verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)) and sentenced him accordingly. This appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">L FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">A. <em>Guilt Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Because defendant pleaded guilty to all charges and admitted all special circumstance allegations at the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, and now raises no claims of error relating to the guilt phase evidence, we need only summarize briefly the evidence of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">On November 12, 1986, Lynell Murray was working at Prime Cleaners in Huntington Beach in Orange County. Murray, a college student, had planned to meet her boyfriend, Robert Whitecotton, after she finished work at 6:30 p.m. At 6:00 p.m., a customer saw defendant and Cynthia Coffman, embracing passionately, in an alley behind Prime Cleaners. When Murray failed to show up for their date, Whitecotton went to Prime Cleaners and saw that the store was closed and Murray was gone, although her car remained in the parking lot. At 8:30 that evening, Mooshang Movafaghi, the proprietor, discovered the store had been ransacked and the day\u2019s receipts, along with the cash that should have been in the register for the start of the next day\u2019s business, and some clothing were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">That same evening, Coffman, using Murray\u2019s credit card, checked into room 307 at the Huntington Beach Inn, signing the register in Murray\u2019s name. A few minutes later, a balance inquiry and a withdrawal of $80 were made on Murray\u2019s checking account at a Versateller at the Corona del Mar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>branch of the Bank of America. One minute later, an additional $60 was withdrawn, leaving a balance of less than $10. The next day, November 13, a hotel employee found Murray\u2019s body in the bathroom of room 307. She had been beaten and strangled with a strip of towel; her head, bound with towels, was submerged in shallow water in the bathtub. Postmortem examination revealed sperm in her vaginal area; her maroon bra, pantyhose and one earring were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Later, Coffman checked into the Compri Hotel in the City of Ontario, again using Murray\u2019s credit card. Around midnight on November 13, in a nearby Denny\u2019s restaurant, a waiter serving Coffman and Marlow saw them kissing and cuddling.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Defendant and Coffman were arrested the following day as they walked along a road in the Big Bear area in San Bernardino County, where law enforcement officials had learned a man and a woman were attempting to use Murray\u2019s credit card to purchase clothing in two different sporting goods stores. In Coffman\u2019s purse were identification cards belonging to Lynell Murray, credit card receipts bearing Murray\u2019s forged signature, an earring matching the lone earring found in Murray\u2019s ear when her body was discovered, a loaded revolver and ammunition, and a brown bag with money taken from Prime Cleaners. A search of a room defendant and Coffman had rented at the Bavarian Lodge in the Big Bear area yielded clothing stolen from Prime Cleaners, including a gray suit jacket defendant had been seen wearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">After defendant\u2019s and Coffman\u2019s arrest, police found a white Honda belonging to Corinna Novis, a resident of Redlands in San Bernardino County who had been missing since November 7. The car was parked off a highway near Santa\u2019s Village, an amusement park in San Bernardino County. In a trash can on the park premises, a maintenance worker found a pillowcase containing the bra and pantyhose worn by Lynell Murray on November 12, personal checks made payable to Prime Cleaners, laundry receipts from the same establishment, and a matchbook from the Compri Hotel. Defendant\u2019s fingerprints and palm prints were found on the Honda.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">On November 15, the body of Corinna Novis was found buried in a shallow grave in a vineyard in San Bernardino County. The cause of death was ligature strangulation; sperm was found in her rectum. The prosecution presented evidence that defendant and Coffman had abducted Novis from a shopping center in Redlands on November 7 and taken her to the home of Richard Drinkhouse, where they held her in a bedroom and tried to obtain her personal identification number (PIN) in order to access her bank account. After defendant\u2019s sister, Veronica Koppers, arrived at the Drinkhouse residence, Drinkhouse overheard Marlow tell her of his plan to go to Novis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>apartment to see if he could find anything there. Marlow apparently then took Novis into the shower; later, with wet hair and wearing only trousers, he entered the living room and told Drinkhouse he had gotten the PIN. Soon thereafter, defendant and Coffman took Novis, her wrists in handcuffs and duct tape over her mouth, from the residence. The following evening, November 8, defendant and Coffman visited the home of Paul Koppers, Veronica\u2019s husband. Defendant told Koppers he had acquired a car and needed to get license plates that were not easily traceable. On November 11, the manager of a Taco Bell restaurant in Laguna Beach recovered various items, including a checkbook and bank card in the name of Corinna Novis and identification cards belonging to defendant and Coffman, from a bag near a trash receptacle behind the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">1. <em>Prosecution case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In addition to the evidence of the murders of Lynell Murray and Corinna Novis presented during the guilt phase, the prosecution introduced further evidence of defendant\u2019s crimes against Corinna Novis, as well as other violent criminal conduct and a 1978 conviction for escape in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Regarding the offenses against Novis, the prosecution introduced defendant\u2019s testimony in his February 1989 capital trial in San Bernardino County, in which he had admitted kidnapping and robbing Novis before strangling her.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">The prosecution also introduced evidence that on approximately July 7, 1986, in Whitley County, Kentucky, defendant and Coffman murdered Gregory Hill for financial gain. Hill\u2019s body was found on Upper Mulberry Cemetery Road, about a tenth of a mile from his residence. The cause of death was a single gunshot wound to Hill\u2019s lower right forehead, with powder stippling around the entry wound. In his February 1989 trial in San Bernardino County, defendant admitted he and Coffman had been paid a little more than $5,000 to kill Gregory Hill. Marlow contended he had initially changed his mind about killing Hill and that Coffman had indicated she would kill Hill by herself. Defendant ultimately acknowledged, however, that\u2014as they had planned\u2014Coffman, feigning car trouble, lured Hill to a truck parked on the roadway near his house, whereupon defendant emerged from a nearby hiding place and demanded to know what Hill was doing with his sister. Hill drew a gun and pointed it at defendant; in the ensuing struggle over the gun, Hill was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The prosecution also presented evidence that defendant had committed three robberies in 1979. In the first incident, early in the morning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>November 5 of that year, defendant and a confederate, Allen Smallwood, came to the door of Jeffrey Johnson\u2019s apartment in the City of Upland and asked Johnson whether he worked in construction. When Johnson answered in the affirmative, defendant hit him in the face with a motorcycle chain and knocked him to the ground. Defendant and Smallwood then entered the apartment and began to look for drugs. Finding none, they took $180 from Johnson\u2019s dresser, along with a kitchen knife and a sword they found hanging on the wall. Defendant and Smallwood, taking Johnson, then went downstairs and entered the apartment of sisters Lori and Kathy Liesch. Defendant and Smallwood ordered Lori to get out of bed. When she told them she had no clothes on, defendant tried to pull the covers off her until Smallwood told him to leave her alone. Defendant then began to search the apartment and surprised Kathy Liesch as she was returning home. Defendant took Kathy into the bedroom, where he and Smallwood tied the two women and Johnson up with electrical cord and warned them not to contact the police because they had taken their identification and would \u201ccome after\u201d them. When Lori continued to cry after defendant demanded that she stop, he grabbed his crotch and told her he would take her in the other room and \u201cshut her up.\u201d Smallwood urged him to leave her alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In the second incident, on November 6, 1979, defendant entered a leather goods store owned by Joanne Gilligan in the City of Upland. Gilligan was assisting a customer when defendant went to the counter. When Gilligan asked if she could help him, defendant replied that he had a gun pointed at her and she should lie down on the floor. Although Gilligan did not actually see a gun, defendant had his hand in the pocket of his sweatshirt, and it appeared he could have a gun there. Both Gilligan and the customer got down on the floor; defendant took money from the register, grabbed one or two coats and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In the third incident, on November 20, 1979, defendant and Smallwood entered a methadone clinic in the City of Ontario. Defendant was armed with a sawed-off shotgun, and Smallwood carried a pistol. After loading and racking the shotgun, defendant ordered clinic employee Gertrude Smith not to move. Fie pointed the shotgun at her as Smallwood went to another part of the clinic, confronted a physician and a nurse, and demanded they open the safe where the methadone was kept. At one point during the robbery, believing an alarm had been activated, defendant shouted to Smallwood to \u201cshoot him in the head,\u201d referring to the physician. When the safe was at last opened, defendant and Smallwood fled with $10,000 worth of methadone.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">2. <em>Defense case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Various witnesses testified to defendant\u2019s family background and upbringing. Defendant\u2019s sister Veronica Koppers, who admitted a prior felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>conviction of being an accessory to the kidnapping of Corinna Novis, described their mother Doris Hill\u2019s open abuse of and addiction to drugs and alcohol and her practice of bringing \u201chundreds\u201d of different men to her house for sex. From 1965 until her death in a trailer fire in 1975, Doris had been frequently arrested and confined for various offenses, serving a prison term that began in 1968. During Doris\u2019s incarcerations, defendant would be sent to foster homes. Doris also would leave defendant and Veronica with friends or relatives for indefinite periods until, \u201cwhen it was convenient, [she] would come back.\u201d Doris supported her drug habit by stealing, sometimes asking her children to serve as lookouts. Once when Veronica was 12, Doris brought her to a house in Los Angeles and told her to wait while she went out and that she would be back. Instead, Doris went drinking and Veronica was raped by a man who lived there. While Veronica perceived Doris\u2019s shortcomings as a mother, defendant idealized her and was devastated each time she would leave them. When defendant was about 15, Veronica saw Doris inject him with heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendant\u2019s half sister, Tina, the daughter of defendant\u2019s father, Arnold Marlow, testified that defendant came to stay with her family on two occasions. Arnold Marlow was an alcoholic who frequently beat his children and, according to Tina, had no interest in defendant. Sue Warman, Tina\u2019s mother, testified by videotape and confirmed Tina\u2019s testimony concerning Arnold Marlow\u2019s abusiveness. She further testified that defendant, who was a quiet, withdrawn child, appeared badly neglected when he first came to stay with her family. The second time defendant came to stay, he \u201cwasn\u2019t in . . . very good emotional health at all.\u201d Defendant protected Tina against her older brother Mike by \u201cgetting] very violent,\u201d to the point that Ms. Warman had to take Mike to the hospital for stitches. When Ms. Warman and Arnold Marlow concluded that defendant needed help, they contacted child welfare authorities, who placed him in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Other witnesses corroborated Veronica\u2019s account of Doris Hill\u2019s neglect of her children and her open drug use in the home. Ray Saldivar, a former drug addict, testified that in 1965 he lived in Doris\u2019s house along with other persons who were openly using drugs and drinking. Doris paid so little attention to defendant and Veronica that Saldivar did not realize there were children in the house until he had lived there for some time. She was \u201ckind of a rough person,\u201d who bought Saldivar a gun for his birthday. Defendant, who was quiet and withdrawn, and his sister spent a lot of time in their bedroom. Lillian Zamorano testified that she met Doris Hill in a bar in the Pico Rivera area in 1966. At that time, Zamorano, who had five children, had never used drugs; Doris introduced her to Seconal and amphetamines, which she used along with heroin. Zamorano moved in with Doris, and the two spent most of their time in bars and nightclubs, bringing people to the house to drink and use drugs. During.most of this period, Doris\u2019s children lived with her mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Lena Walls; Doris visited infrequently and Zamorano first learned of the children\u2019s existence when, after living with Doris for two years, Doris invited her to visit her mother. At one point, defendant and Veronica stayed with Doris for about a month until Doris tired of their presence and took them back to her mother. Doris allowed defendant, who was about 13 years old at the time, to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana in the home, reasoning it was better that he do so around her than in the street.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rosemary Casillas, Zamorano\u2019s daughter, confirmed her mother\u2019s description of the chaotic conditions prevailing in the household when they lived with Doris. One Christmas day, as Zamorano and Doris prepared to go out drinking, defendant pleaded with his mother to stay with him. She ignored him and left; he cried and threw the radio she had given him to the floor, smashing it. Defendant, Veronica and Casillas would go to various bars looking for their mothers. When located, the women would tell the children to wait for them or walk back home; they would not go with the children. Once, when Casillas was 13 or 14 and Doris was no longer living with Zamorano, Casillas ran away from home to the place where Doris was staying. She saw Doris inject defendant with heroin and Doris offered some to Casillas. Doris injected Casillas with the drug; it made her ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Terry Sydnes testified that in 1971 he and his wife and children lived across the street from the house where defendant, Veronica and their grandmother were living. Doris told him the children were a mistake and she did not really want them. Defendant spent quite a bit of time at the Sydneses\u2019 house and eventually moved in with them for about six months while they attempted to become his foster parents through the juvenile probation department. Sydnes believed defendant had become unruly because he was never loved and was looking for attention. Sydnes and his wife believed defendant needed psychological treatment, but they could not afford to provide it and the county refused to help them. Sydnes concluded he could no longer care for defendant when his wife discovered drugs in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The defense also presented expert psychological testimony. Peter Chambers, Ph.D., a clinical and forensic psychologist and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California at Irvine, testified about the psychological aspects of early development, specifically the child\u2019s development of attachment to the parents and the effects of abuse during the first years of life. Dr. Chambers, who had neither interviewed defendant nor read any materials associated with the case, opined that the impact on the emotional development of a child growing up in a household where he observes large-scale drug abuse and his mother engaging in promiscuous sexual activity would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>severe. Dr. Chambers concluded that abuse and neglect similar to that suffered by defendant as a child and an adolescent could produce a borderline personality disorder with elements of psychotic, neurotic and psychophrenetic<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neurotic behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Clinical psychologist Michael Kania, Ph.D., spent about 70 hours interviewing defendant and reviewed documentary material generated by law enforcement, along with reports by persons who had known defendant when he was growing up. Dr. Kania testified defendant tended to minimize the mistreatment he had endured, compared with the accounts offered by his friends and relatives. Defendant\u2019s natural father, Arnold Marlow, had a drinking problem and was inordinately strict with him; his mother\u2019s second husband was \u201ceven more pathological and even more severe.\u201d Defendant had been so desperate to gain his mother\u2019s affection and attention that he would do anything she asked or that he thought would please her, and he never stopped hoping she would come back and act toward him as a mother should. His mother had introduced defendant to marijuana at age eight and to heroin at age 11, had sexual intercourse with numerous men in his presence, and encouraged him to steal from them. She became sexually involved with defendant, taking showers with him at age 12 to 13, and although defendant was reluctant to talk about it in any great detail, there was some indication he had engaged in sexual relations with his mother at her urging.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Dr. Kania characterized the level of emotional abuse and mistreatment defendant had suffered during his childhood as \u201cextremely severe and perhaps the most severe of anyone\u201d in the thousands of evaluations he had completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">As an adult, defendant tended to develop relationships with women like his mother. They used drugs and often were sexually promiscuous, living the same sort of unstable life he had been exposed to as a child. From 1980 to 1983, defendant was incarcerated in prison for his robbery convictions. From the time of his release until he met Coffman, he had no arrests, successfully completed parole and held jobs. He married a woman named Kathy Duitsman; the marriage ended when she shot another woman in a bar after Kathy and defendant had a misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Soon after, he met Coffman, with whom he fell in love because she immediately reminded him of his mother. He was willing to do anything to make her happy. After the killing in Kentucky, Coffman threatened to call the police if defendant did not do her bidding. As a result, defendant felt trapped. Coffman wanted to acquire funds to get her son back from her former in-laws, and the Orange County and San Bernardino County homicides were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the product of Coffman\u2019s desire for money and defendant\u2019s attempt, by doing what she wanted, to please her and avoid abandonment. Dr. Kania opined that the crimes would not have happened had defendant not met Coffman. After Murray\u2019s murder, defendant\u2014tired of the situation\u2014essentially gave up, purposefully discarding evidence in a way likely to lead the police to Coffman and himself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">A. <em>Failure to Prosecute Orange County and San Bernardino County Homicides in Single Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Defendant asserts the prosecutors in his Orange County and San Bernardino County cases each proceeded on the theory that the two murders had formed part of a single course of conduct, namely a \u201cunified plan\u201d devised by Marlow and Coffman to obtain money to finance a trip to Arizona. Thus, defendant contends, his trials in separate proceedings on the Orange County and San Bernardino County murder charges violated section 954, the prohibition against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and his right to due process of law. He further contends his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to seek consolidation of the offenses in a single proceeding. These errors, he asserts, violated his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution and article I, section 15 of the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Defendant forfeited this claim of error by failing to object to the separate prosecutions or to move for joinder below. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 392 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1] [failure to move for severance forfeits claim of error].) Were we to address it on the merits, we would reject defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Section 954 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn accusatory pleading may charge two or more different offenses connected together in their commission, ... or two or more different offenses of the same class of crimes or offenses, under separate counts, and if two or more accusatory pleadings are filed in such cases in the same court, the court may order them to be consolidated.\u201d The statute thus permits but does not require joinder under some circumstances. Section 654 provides that when an \u201cact or omission ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>punishable in different ways by different provisions of law,\u201d an \u201cacquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant relies on <em>Kellett v. Superior Court </em>(1966) 63 Cal.2d 822 [48 Cal.Rptr. 366, 409 P.2d 206], in which this court, interpreting section 654, stated: \u201c[S]ome acts that are divisible for the purpose of punishment must be regarded as being too interrelated to permit their being prosecuted successively. . . . When ... the prosecution is or should be aware of more than one offense in which the same act or course of conduct plays a significant part, all such offenses must be prosecuted in a single proceeding unless joinder is prohibited or severance permitted for good cause. Failure to unite all such offenses will result in a bar to subsequent prosecution of any offenses omitted if the initial proceedings culminate in either acquittal or conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>(Kellett, supra, </em>at p. 827.) Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, <em>Kellett </em>is not controlling.  As we noted in <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1038 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531], \u201cthe murder of separate victims on separate days in separate counties is not a single act or even a \u2018course of conduct\u2019 [citation] requiring a single prosecution.\u201d  Examining section 790, governing venue in murder prosecutions, <em>Carpenter </em>concluded that no authority compels murders committed in different counties to be tried together. <em>(Carpenter, supra, </em>at p. 1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Defendant therefore was not denied due process or the constitutional protection against double jeopardy by successive prosecutions for the San Bernardino County and Orange County offenses. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance in failing to object on this basis because to omit making a nonmeritorious objection does not amount to deficient performance. (See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-688 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052]; <em>In re Avena </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 694, 721 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 909 P.2d 1017] [claim of ineffective assistance requires a showing that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different].)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">B. <em>Alleged Faretta Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Throughout the proceedings in San Bernardino County and initially in the present case, defendant was represented by Attorney Ray Craig. In February 1990, however, a few months after defendant\u2019s sentencing in the San Bernardino County case and before any motions had been heard in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the superior court granted defendant\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion (see <em>People v. Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]) and relieved Craig and his associate, William Byhawer. The superior court then appointed Attorney C. Thomas McDonald, but McDonald withdrew from representing defendant because he could not come to an agreement with the county regarding his fees. The superior court then appointed Attorney Ron Brower, but on April 6, 1990, defendant wrote a letter to the court, objecting to Brower as his attorney. At the next hearing, on April 25, 1990, Brower informed the court that based on allegations in defendant\u2019s letter, he could not represent defendant; the court then relieved him.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">After discussing somewhat the procedure for obtaining replacement counsel for Marlow, the court said: \u201cMr. Marlow, we haven\u2019t asked you. You are without an attorney right now, but I will assume by relieving Mr. Brower that\u2019s your desire, is that correct?\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cYes, it is. Sir, may I address the court?\u201d The court answered: \u201cSurely.\u201d Defendant continued: \u201cMr. Brower, as I understand, wasn\u2019t on the court list.\u201d Defendant explained he wished to pick another attorney who was not on the court list and whom he could trust and work with. The court spoke further of the process for appointing counsel and invited defendant to continue. Defendant talked about the trusting relationship he had had with McDonald. The court elaborated on its understanding of the fee-related reasons why McDonald had withdrawn from representing defendant and on the county\u2019s procedures for appointing counsel, noting: \u201cAs far as you looking at the list and selecting someone off the list and so forth, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s proper. It hasn\u2019t been done before, and I don\u2019t think we can make an exception. H] All the gentlemen on the list and so forth have been screened and are outstanding attorneys. In other words, [if] you had five million dollars to go out and select an attorney, you\u2019d end up selecting one of the attorneys on the list, I am sure. That\u2019s neither here nor there, [f] The only thing I can tell you is we will go through the procedures and select the next attorney.\u201d Further discussion ensued on the appointment process and a motion filed by Marlow in propria persona, the denial of which he had been trying to appeal. As to the latter, the court stated it would take the matter off calendar so that the attorney eventually appointed to represent defendant could determine whether to pursue writ relief. The court and counsel then turned to trial setting, and the court indicated it would direct Mike Horan, an attorney who was on the court list for appointed counsel in capital cases and who happened to be present in the courtroom, to \u201cfill in and sit with Mr. Marlow, take the necessary waivers, see where we are going.\u201d The court further indicated it anticipated putting the matter over for a couple of weeks to allow defendant\u2019s new attorney time to familiarize himself with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">After an interruption in the proceedings, defendant spoke up: \u201cYour honor, excuse me. Is it possible that I just go pro per in my own defense and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>someone appointed as co-counsel?\u201d- The court answered: \u201cNo. That\u2019s an absolute disaster. There\u2019s no authority for that. That doesn\u2019t work out. There\u2019s no authority\u2014some judges have done that, much to my chagrin. I am trying to think [of] the case I ended up with that happening.\u201d The prosecutor said: \u201cIt is possible in an unusual case, however.\u201d The court stated: \u201cI will decline to do that at this particular time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">After another interruption in the proceedings, defendant again spoke: \u201cSeems to be\u2014your honor, excuse me. I be allowed to have one lawyer, only allowed a certain amount of time to do the trial, a certain amount of manpower and hours while the district attorney and the public defender\u2019s office have unlimited resources and manpower on a salary type of thing. It seems kind of unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">After still another interruption, the court stated it would be necessary to allow a couple of weeks to obtain counsel from the court\u2019s list of attorneys and to allow that attorney to determine whether appropriate arrangements could be reached. The court then proceeded to call Attorney Horan to discuss with defendant the need to waive time in order to obtain new counsel. Horan asked defendant: \u201cThat make sense to you?\u201d Defendant answered: \u201cYeah, it makes sense to me, but I think I am going to have the same problem whatever attorney is appointed to me isn\u2019t allowed the proper time for a death penalty defense and the manpower and resources like my opposition has.\u201d After further colloquy, Horan asked defendant: \u201cYou willing to do that, willing to waive time?\u201d Defendant said: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The matter accordingly was put over for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for self-representation under <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]. As defendant asserts, we have held that if a defendant in a criminal case wishes to represent himself or herself and makes an unequivocal assertion of that right within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of trial, the request must be granted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 20-21 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 127-128 [137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187].) Respondent contends this contention was forfeited by defendant\u2019s plea of guilty on the advice of subsequently appointed counsel. Although not relying on the absence of a certificate of probable cause (see \u00a7\u00a7 1237.5, 1239, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 30(b)), respondent argues the claim of erroneous denial of a <em>Faretta </em>motion is not one going to the \u201clegality of the proceedings\u201d and thus is not cognizable on appeal. (\u00a7 1237.5; <em>People v. Hobbs </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 948, 955 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 651, 873 P.2d 1246].) We disagree.  Just as a claim of denial of the right to counsel is cognizable on appeal after a guilty plea <em>(People v. Holland </em>(1978) 23 Cal.3d 77, 85 [151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 625, 588 P.2d 765]), so too is a claim of <em>Faretta </em>error <em>(People v. Robinson </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 363, 370 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 406]).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We conclude, however, that defendant did not make an unequivocal request for self-representation. Reading the pertinent exchange in the context of defendant\u2019s frustration with his inability to obtain the counsel of his choice, we find it clear that defendant\u2019s inquiry\u2014\u201cIs it possible that I just go pro per in my own defense and have someone appointed as co-counsel?\u201d\u2014 was a request for information, not a <em>Faretta </em>motion. That the trial court went on to \u201cdecline to do that at this particular time\u201d did not convert defendant\u2019s inquiry into a motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This conclusion is strengthened by consideration of the ensuing discussion, in the course of which defendant, far from adverting to any desire for self-representation, reiterated his concern that any counsel eventually appointed to represent him would be disadvantaged by a limited fee arrangement rather than what he evidently viewed as the unlimited budgets available to the prosecutor and to defendants represented by the public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">C. <em>Validity of Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Defendant contends his guilty plea to murder with special circumstances must be set aside for lack of an express waiver of his rights to a jury trial and against self-incrimination, as required by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution and article I, section 16 of the state Constitution. \u201c[A] valid guilty plea presuppose[s] a voluntary and intelligent waiver of the defendant\u2019s constitutional trial rights, which include the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront one\u2019s accusers.\u201d <em>(People v. Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1175 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315].) The reviewing court must determine whether the record affirmatively demonstrates that the plea was voluntary and intelligent under the totality of the circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Here, during the proceedings on the change of plea at the conclusion of the People\u2019s guilt phase case-in-chief, the prosecutor advised defendant as follows: \u201cNow, when you plead guilty, you are going to be giving up certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>rights. And you have the right to be tried by a jury in a public and speedy trial. And so far in the guilt phase of this case, you have actually had a trial up to this point by a jury picked by your lawyers and yourself. PH] When you plead guilty, you are giving up the right to have that same jury decide whether or not you are guilty and you are giving up that right to have the jury decide whether or not those special circumstances are true. [|] Do you understand that you are giving up that right when you plead guilty?\u201d Defendant responded: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The prosecutor continued: \u201cIn the course of that trial, the trial we\u2019ve had so far, you\u2019ve had the opportunity through your lawyers or yourself, if you want, to confront the witnesses that are brought into the courtroom and to cross-examine those witnesses. And that\u2019s been done so far. [j[] When you plead guilty at this point, you are giving up the right to confront and cross-examine any other witnesses that the prosecution might want to bring in in the guilt phase. Do you understand that?\u201d Defendant answered: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The prosecutor inquired: \u201c[Is that] what you want to do?\u201d Defendant responded: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The prosecutor continued: \u201cThere is the right at a guilt phase of the trial to testify in your own behalf if you want. You can get on the witness stand and testify under oath, or you can sit in the courtroom with your lawyers and remain silent and not say anything at all. When you plead guilty, in effect you are giving up your right to remain silent because you are making a statement about these crimes. Do you understand that?\u201d Defendant answered: \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The prosecutor asked: \u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d Defendant responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Defendant contends the record reflects merely that he was informed of his rights and expressed a desire to give them up, not that he actually did so. In the totality of the circumstances, however\u2014in particular, defendant\u2019s having been represented by counsel and having participated in the trial to that point pursuant to his former plea of not guilty\u2014we have no doubt his words signified actual waiver of his rights preparatory to his change of plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Defendant further contends article I, section 16 of the state Constitution requires express waiver of the jury right in this context. He acknowledges we held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ernst </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 441, 446 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 881 P.2d 298], that this provision does not apply when a defendant waives the right to trial by pleading guilty, but applies only when a defendant exercises his right to trial but waives the right to a jury. Defendant urges that \u201cby creating a higher standard for the acceptance of a jury trial waiver when the accused chooses a court trial, where all that is waived is not the right to have the facts tried, but just the right to have a <em>jury </em>as the trier of fact, than the standard for the acceptance of a jury trial waiver when a defendant pleads guilty, thereby waiving his right to have any trier of fact adjudicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>charges, is a denial of equal protection of the laws, guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d He contends a defendant pleading guilty is situated similarly to a defendant forgoing a jury and electing a court trial, and that the constitutional provision differentially affecting the exercise of such fundamental rights can be justified only by a compelling state interest. To the contrary, a case involving a guilty plea, in which no issues are to be tried, is indeed different from one in which issues remain for trial before the court. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 448.) We therefore conclude article I, section 16 of the state Constitution, as we have interpreted it, is consistent with federal equal protection principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">D. <em>Admission of Defendant\u2019s Testimony in San Bernardino County Trial; Claimed Ineffective Assistance of Counsel in Failing to Object</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">During the penalty phase of this case, pursuant to Evidence Code section 1291,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the prosecution introduced excerpts of defendant\u2019s testimony under cross-examination in his San Bernardino County trial, in which he admitted he had kidnapped and robbed Corinna Novis in order to obtain money to go to Arizona and had strangled her, and described the circumstances of the killing for hire of Gregory Hill in Kentucky. Defendant contends his conviction must be reversed because it was the result of the improper denial, in the San Bernardino County prosecution, of his motion to sever his trial from that of his codefendant, Coffman, which denial in turn \u201cimpelled\u201d his testimony in that case in order to rebut highly prejudicial evidence that Coffman presented in her defense. Defendant observes that his counsel in the San Bernardino County trial stated, in the course of an in limine hearing held just prior to defendant\u2019s testimony in that case, that defendant\u2019s decision to testify was necessitated by the accusations that Coffman and her witnesses had made against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Respondent would have this court dismiss the present claim at the threshold, arguing that the propriety of the San Bernardino Superior Court\u2019s ruling and the evidence presented in that trial stand outside the record on this appeal. We may, however, take judicial notice of the proceedings and our decision in the San Bernardino County case and hereby do so. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subds. (a), (d), 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Respondent further contends Marlow forfeited the issue by failing to object to the admission of his former testimony. He is correct. <em>(People v. Carter </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1166, 1204 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 553, 70 P.3d 981].) Because Marlow asserts his counsel thereby rendered ineffective assistance, however, we turn to the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">While not asserting he was literally compelled to take the stand in the San Bernardino County case, Marlow relies on state and federal authorities recognizing that when a defendant was <em>impelled </em>to testify at a prior hearing or trial, either because of the nature of the proceeding in which he testified or because he was provoked into testifying by the improper introduction of evidence, that testimony may not be used against him in a subsequent hearing or trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In the first category of decisions Marlow cites, pertaining to particular types of proceedings, <em>Simmons v. United States </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 377 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 88 S.Ct. 967], for example, held that when a defendant testifies in a pretrial suppression hearing in order to assert his Fourth Amendment right to be free from illegal search or seizure of evidence, the prosecution may not introduce his testimony on the question of guilt. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.) <em>Simmons </em>reasoned that a defendant should not have to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 393-394.) Similarly, <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 867 [120 Cal.Rptr. 384, 533 P.2d 1024] held that the testimony of a probationer at a revocation hearing is inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief in a subsequent trial on charges based on the same conduct that prompted the revocation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 872.) We said: \u201cWhen a pending or potential criminal charge forms the basis of an alleged violation of a condition of probation, a probationer who can explain his actions only by jeopardizing his chances of acquittal at a subsequent criminal trial may understandably feel that his opportunity to be heard is more illusory than real and that he is being deprived of his liberty without one of the essential elements of rudimentary fairness\u2014a meaningful chance to speak on his own behalf.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In the latter category, those in which a defendant\u2019s testimony is impelled by the improper introduction of evidence, Marlow cites <em>Harrison v. United States </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 219 [20 L.Ed.2d 1047, 88 S.Ct. 2008], in which the high court reversed a conviction predicated on the admission of a defendant\u2019s former testimony, which the court concluded had been impelled in the prior proceeding by the erroneous admission into evidence of his three confessions later determined, on appeal, to be involuntary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 222-223.) The court stated; \u201c[W]e need not and do not question the general evidentiary rule that a defendant\u2019s testimony at a former trial is admissible in evidence against him in later proceedings. ...[][] Here, however, the [defendant] testified only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>after the Government had illegally introduced into evidence three confessions, all wrongfully obtained, and the same principle that prohibits the use of confessions so procured also prohibits the use of any testimony impelled thereby . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 222, fns. omitted.) Cited in <em>Harrison (id. </em>at p. 224, fn. 10) is this court\u2019s decision in <em>People v. Spencer </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 158 [57 Cal.Rptr. 163, 424 P.2d 715], in which we held that the erroneous introduction into evidence of an illegally obtained confession that arguably induced the defendant to admit his guilt in open court compelled reversal because \u201cthe record in th[e] case fail[ed] to dispel beyond a reasonable doubt the possibility that the defendant took the stand in an attempt to mitigate the explosive impact of a confession which had left his case in ruin.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169; see also <em>Fahy v. Connecticut </em>(1963) 375 U.S. 85, 86-87 [11 L.Ed.2d 171, 84 S.Ct. 229] [reversing conviction upon finding a reasonable possibility that the introduction of illegally seized evidence prompted the defendant\u2019s testimonial admissions].) More recently, in <em>People v. Louis </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 969 [232 Cal.Rptr. 110, 728 P.2d 180], we reversed a conviction after the trial court improperly admitted the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who absconded before trial, when the prosecution had failed to use due diligence to secure the witness\u2019s attendance at trial. Relying on <em>Spencer, supra, </em>at page 169, we rejected the state\u2019s contention that the defendant\u2019s testimony sufficiently supported the conviction, because the record failed to dispel the possibility that the defendant\u2019s testimony had been impelled by the erroneous introduction of the witness\u2019s prior testimony. <em>(Louis, supra, </em>at p. 995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">These authorities do not compel reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction in this case because we have concluded in <em>People v. Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 1, that the San Bernardino Superior Court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance of Marlow\u2019s trial from that of Coffman. Coffman\u2019s evidence regarding Marlow\u2019s other bad acts, moreover, <em>was not admitted against Marlow, </em>and the jury in that case was instructed to consider it only insofar as it bore on Coffman\u2019s state of mind at the time of the offenses. That Marlow made the tactical decision to address Coffman\u2019s assertions in his testimony in the San Bernardino County case cannot be attributed to legal compulsion rendering that testimony inadmissible in this proceeding. (Cf. <em>Ohler </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 753, 759-760 [146 L.Ed.2d 826, 120 S.Ct. 1851].) His trial counsel, therefore, did not render ineffective assistance in failing to object to its introduction into evidence. (See <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 687-688; <em>In re Avena, supra, 12 </em>Cal.4th at p. 721 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 413, 909 P.2d 1017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">E. <em>Exclusion of Mitigating Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in excluding evidence that Lena Walls, his grandmother and childhood caregiver, hated all men; in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>excluding evidence of a neighbor\u2019s description of Ms. Walls; and by preventing defendant\u2019s expert from testifying as to \u201cthe mitigating psychological factors associated with strangulation as a method of homicide.\u201d The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution require that the sentencer in a capital case not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any relevant aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death. <em>(McCleskey v. Kemp </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 279, 304 [95 L.Ed.2d 262, 107 S.Ct. 1756]; <em>Skipper v. South Carolina </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 1, 4 [90 L.Ed.2d 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669].) The trial court, however, retains discretion to exclude evidence on grounds of irrelevancy. <em>(People v. Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 1015 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We find no abuse of discretion in this case and, it follows, no constitutional error. Testimony that Ms. Walls hated men would have evidenced <em>her </em>character and state of mind, but\u2014without more\u2014would not have illuminated any circumstances of <em>defendant\u2019s </em>upbringing and character, because to assume her attitudes toward men in general would have negatively affected her treatment of her young grandson would be speculative. The jury, moreover, heard evidence suggestive of a less than optimal\u2014indeed, chaotic\u2014upbringing, including that Ms. Walls had been institutionalized in Kentucky and cared for defendant and his sister on minimal income from government assistance. In a related vein, the trial court\u2019s exclusion, as speculative and lacking foundation, of a neighbor\u2019s opinion of Ms. Walls\u2019s personality did not constitute an abuse of discretion and in any event carried no prejudice in view of the other evidence of Ms. Walls\u2019s limitations as a caregiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Finally, on this record we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s sustaining an objection, on grounds of speculation and lack of foundation, to defense counsel\u2019s questioning of defense psychologist Michael Kania concerning whether, from a psychological point of view, strangling as a form of murder differs from any other form. Moreover, even assuming an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling, the error was harmless in light of defendant\u2019s admission that he intended to kill Murray, and the weight of the aggravating evidence. Defendant, moreover, was free to argue any \u201cself-explanatory\u201d inferences he wished, such as that strangulation presupposes lack of planning or acting out of rage, from the method of killing he employed. We reject defendant\u2019s related contention that the prosecutor improperly exploited the court\u2019s ruling with his closing argument that defendant, in strangling Murray, used \u201cthe most personal way someone can kill\u201d and, in so doing, \u201ccrossed the line\u201d \u201cwhere we as a society say enough.\u201d The argument did no more than draw reasonable inferences from defendant\u2019s method of killing and urge a death verdict based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>F. <em>Alleged Caldwell Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendant contends the prosecutor, in closing argument, violated the rule in <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 105 S.Ct. 2633], and the trial court subsequently erred in refusing a defense-requested curative instruction. The combination of these errors, defendant argues, deprived him of a reliable penalty determination as guaranteed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. The issue arose in the following context: During his summation, the prosecutor argued to the jury: \u201cWe discussed during the jury selection about the unique aspect of this kind of a case and that it is the only type of case in California where the judge does not make the sentencing decision initially, the jury does.\u201d Defense counsel interjected: \u201cExcuse me, your honor, I am going to object to the term \u2018initially.\u2019 It is the jury\u2019s decision. It carries.\u201d The prosecutor said: \u201cI will rephrase it.\u201d The prosecutor went on to say: \u201cIt\u2019s the only type of case where in California the jury makes the decision what the appropriate penalty is to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">At the conclusion of argument, defense counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that, in rendering its decision, each juror was to assume the penalty selected would be carried out. The trial court declined, noting: \u201cI think I covered that so often in voir dire that death means death and life without parole means life without parole. I think I hammered that during voir dire. I don\u2019t think they would ever pick up on initial determination. We\u2019ve got to give the jury some credit for having some amount of common sense. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I will deny the request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\"><em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>held it \u201cconstitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d <em>(Caldwell v. Mississippi, supra, 472 </em>U.S. at pp. 328-329.) Given the brevity of the prosecutor\u2019s remark, the immediate speaking objection from defense counsel, and the prosecutor\u2019s equally prompt rephrasing to eliminate any conceivably incorrect inference, we see no reasonable likelihood the jury understood the remark as diminishing its responsibility for the sentencing determination. <em>(People v. Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 663 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Nor did the trial court err in refusing the requested curative instruction. In <em>People v. Thompson </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 86, 130 [246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37], we found the identical instruction to be inaccurate, in that it ignored both the power of the superior court to reduce a death sentence under section 190.4, subdivision (e), and the Governor\u2019s power of commutation. Defendant contends the rule in <em>Thompson </em>was effectively overruled in <em>Simmons v. South </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Carolina </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 154 [129 L.Ed.2d 133, 114 S.Ct. 2187], in which the high court ruled that when the prosecution urges a capital jury to sentence a defendant to death because of a potential for future dangerousness, due process dictates that the trial court cannot prevent the jury from learning the defendant is ineligible for parole under a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169.) But in <em>People v. Musselwhite </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1216 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 212, 954 P.2d 475], involving a refused instruction that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole meant the defendant would never be paroled, we distinguished <em>Simmons v. South Carolina </em>on the basis that the trial court in <em>Musselwhite </em>did not prevent the jury from learning the defendant would be ineligible for parole. <em>(Musselwhite, supra, </em>at p. 1271.) As the instructions given in this case properly advised the jury of its sentencing responsibilities, the trial court was not obliged, sua sponte, to correct the defects in the requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">G. <em>Asserted Denial of Due Process and Fair Trial by Virtue of Preceding Claims of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant contends the asserted errors discussed in the preceding sections constituted either direct violations of his federal constitutional rights or arbitrary deprivations of his liberty interest created by state law, thus derivatively denying him due process. (See <em>Hicks v. Oklahoma </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 343, 346 [65 L.Ed.2d 175, 100 S.Ct. 2227].) We conclude defendant has not demonstrated that any error infected his trial; thus, this contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">H. <em>Constitutionality of Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Defendant challenges the constitutionality of the 1978 death penalty law on the following grounds, all of which have been rejected in the cited cases: the statute\u2019s failure to require (1) written findings as to the aggravating factors the jury employed <em>(People v. Kraft </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 978, 1078 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 5 P.3d 68]); (2) proof beyond a reasonable doubt of any aggravating factors, that aggravating factors outweigh mitigating, or that death is the appropriate punishment <em>(ibid.), </em>(3) jury unanimity regarding aggravating factors <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 510 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754]); (4) a procedure to enable a reviewing court to evaluate meaningfully the sentencer\u2019s decision <em>(People v. Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1077 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388]); and (5) a presumption that life without parole is the appropriate penalty <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 190 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980]). Defendant also complains that the statute invites arbitrariness and capriciousness by failing to designate which sentencing factors are aggravating and which are mitigating, by failing to require that the jury not consider inapplicable mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>circumstances, and by permitting allegations of unadjudicated criminal activity to be used as a basis for imposing death; as he acknowledges, we have rejected these contentions as well. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1084, 1128-1129 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 70 P.3d 359]; <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 404 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, 1, Chin, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-12\"> Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\"> Zamorano later became involved in religion and abandoned the lifestyle she had adopted when living with Doris.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> Dr. Chambers defined this term to mean \u201cangry and mad.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\"> In a separate trial, Coffman was convicted of Murray\u2019s murder with special circumstances and received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.

This court affirmed that judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 1 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 96 P.3d 30].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> The version of section 654 that was operative at the time of defendant\u2019s offenses and trials was substantially similar to the current version, quoted in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\"> Because defendant did not make an unequivocal request for self-representation, this case does not present the question we addressed in <em>People v. Dent </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 213 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 527, 65 P.3d 1286], where the defendant made an unequivocal, albeit conditional, request for self-representation that the trial court denied on the erroneous basis that self-representation was unavailable in a capital case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 217, 219.) Here, the trial court correctly told defendant, in essence, that a defendant in a criminal case who elects self-representation is not entitled to the appointment of cocounsel. In other words, as the court made clear, a defendant does not have a right both to be represented by counsel and to participate in the presentation of his own case; indeed, as the court indicated, such an arrangement is generally undesirable. <em>(People v. Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 97 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> Evidence Code section 1291 provides in relevant part that evidence of former testimony (including testimony given under oath in another action; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1290, subd.
