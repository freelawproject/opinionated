Code, \u00a7 4500 et seq.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), care for the developmentally disabled is provided by private contractors operating, among other services, residential care facilities. The coordination of the delivery of such direct services is the responsibility of \u201cprivate nonprofit community agencies\u201d called \u201cregional centers.\u201d (\u00a7 4620, subd. (b).) This case involves the tragic death of a developmentally disabled individual resulting from the negligence of the staff of the residential care facility in which he had been placed by a regional center. Two questions are presented. (1) May the regional center be held vicariously liable for the negligence of the residential care facility? The Court of Appeal, in the second of its two opinions in this case, answered this question in the affirmative; we disagree. (2) Did the Court of Appeal\u2019s previous decision resolve the vicarious liability question, and is that decision controlling in this appeal under the law of the case doctrine? We conclude the Court of Appeal\u2019s previous decision did <em>not </em>resolve the vicarious liability question and, thus, is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Bobby Morohoshi, plaintiffs\u2019 adult son, was developmentally disabled; he was also an insulin-dependent diabetic. In 1995, Harbor Regional Center (Harbor) placed Bobby in Pacific Home, a residential care facility; Bobby resided there until his death in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Harbor arranged for nurses to visit Bobby twice a day to test his blood sugar and administer his insulin. Pacific Home\u2019s owner and her sister, who were registered nurses, originally performed this function. Later, this function was performed by home health nurses and other members of Pacific Home\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In 1998, Pacific Home hired new staff, including Esther Sis\u00f3n. Sis\u00f3n was responsible for testing Bobby\u2019s blood-sugar level the night before he died. She failed to do so. The next morning Bobby lay dead in his bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Prior to trial, the Morohoshis moved in limine for an order preventing Harbor from contending the fault for Bobby\u2019s death \u201cmay or should be apportioned\u201d between Harbor and Pacific Home. They based their motion on their contention Harbor was vicariously liable for any negligence by Pacific Home in providing care to Bobby. The trial court denied the motion. Harbor moved in limine for an order prohibiting the Morohoshis from presenting any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>evidence or arguing Harbor could be held vicariously liable for Pacific Home\u2019s tortious conduct; Harbor contended it could only be held liable for failure to discharge \u201cits own nondelegable statutory duties.\u201d The trial court granted this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Later, in a discussion of the special verdict form, the trial court repeated its view Harbor could not be held vicariously liable for Pacific Home\u2019s negligence and required the parties to draft a verdict form that would allow the jury to apportion negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The jury found Pacific Home liable for Bobby\u2019s death on the basis of negligence and found it guilty of abuse of a dependent adult. The verdict awarded the Morohoshis economic damages of $5,644.36 and noneconomic damages in the amount of $600,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury found Harbor not negligent and awarded no damages against it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On appeal by the Morohoshis, the Court of Appeal ordered the judgment modified \u201cto provide Harbor[] and Pacific Home are jointly and severally liable to the Morohoshis for the economic and noneconomic damages sustained as a result of Pacific Home\u2019s negligence in the sum of $505,644.36 plus costs as provided by law.\u201d In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed. The Morohoshis were awarded their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The Court of Appeal held \u201cHarbor is vicariously liable to the Morohoshis for Pacific Home\u2019s negligence pursuant to its nondelegable duty of care to Bobby.\u201d In its view, the Court of Appeal had rendered the same holding in its previous decision in this case. Therefore, the Court of Appeal concluded, this appeal is governed by the law of the c\u00e1se doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">We disagree; accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Under the Lanterman Act, the state contracts with a network of regional centers\u2014\u201cprivate nonprofit community agencies\u201d (\u00a7 4620, subd. (b))\u2014in order \u201cto provide fixed points of contact in the community for persons with developmental disabilities and their families, to the end that these persons may have access to the services and supports best suited to them throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>their lifetime\u201d (\u00a7 4620, subd. (a)). Regional centers are responsible for determining through testing and evaluation whether an individual has a developmental disability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7\u00a7 4642, 4643.) If a regional center determines that an individual has a developmental disability and is eligible for services, a \u201cplanning team,\u201d comprised of the individual with the disability, his or her parents or guardian, one or more regional center representatives, and any other person or entity invited to participate, draws up an individual program plan (IPP). (\u00a7\u00a7 4512, subd. (j), 4646, subds. (c), (d).) The IPP must identify the developmentally disabled person\u2019s \u201cgoals, objectives, and [needed] services and supports,\u201d taking into account the individual needs and preferences of the person and his or her family. (\u00a7 4646, subds. (a), (d).) The IPP must include a schedule of the \u201ctype and amount of services and supports to be purchased by the regional center or obtained from generic agencies or other resources\u201d in order to achieve the DPP\u2019s goals and objectives. (\u00a7 4646.5, subd. (a)(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The most important role of the regional centers is this \u201cdirect service coordination.\u201d (\u00a7 4640.6, subd. (a).) \u201cIn approving regional center contracts, the [Department of Developmental Services] shall ensure that regional center staffing patterns demonstrate that direct service coordination [is] the highest priority.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The regional centers play this coordinating role by \u201cassisting] persons with developmental disabilities and their families in securing those services and supports which maximize opportunities and choices for living, working, learning, and recreating in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 4640.7, subd. (a); see \u00a7 4648, subd. (a)(1).) The regional centers secure the needed services by \u201cpurchasing or by obtaining\u201d them from direct service providers like Pacific Home. (\u00a7 4647, subd. (a).) The process of identifying and qualifying the vendors or contractors from which services are purchased is known as \u201cvendorization.\u201d (\u00a7 4648, subd. (a)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The role played by regional centers in coordinating the delivery of the direct services indicated by a developmentally disabled person\u2019s IPP is clearly a vital one; indeed, the Legislature declared this coordinating role \u201cis of such a special and unique nature that it cannot be satisfactorily provided by state agencies\u201d (\u00a7 4620, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">However, the Court of Appeal inflated Harbor\u2019s role in coordinating Bobby\u2019s care beyond all recognition by holding Harbor had a nondelegable duty to provide Bobby\u2019s care itself, or to closely monitor Pacific Home\u2019s provision of Bobby\u2019s care. A review of the applicable statutes and regulations reveals that (1) direct provision of care is not a responsibility of regional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>centers; and (2) regional centers are not intended to monitor the care provided by their contractors on the day-by-day\u2014indeed, hour-by-hour\u2014basis that would have been required to prevent Bobby\u2019s tragic death.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">A. <em>Direct Provision of Care Is Not a Responsibility of Regional Centers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Court of Appeal mistakenly concluded that Harbor had authority to provide Bobby\u2019s care itself in lieu of contracting with a provider such as Pacific Home: \u201cOn its face, the Lanterman Act clearly imposes mandatory duties on Harbor to ensure the consumer receives proper care and services, whether or not Harbor chooses to \u2018vendorize\u2019 the actual placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">To the contrary, the responsibility of a regional center is to \u201csecure,\u201d not provide, care. (\u00a7 4648, subd. (a)(1).) To read the list of services a regional center may be required to secure for a developmentally disabled individual is to understand that a regional center could not possibly be expected to provide those services itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cexcept in emergency situations, a regional center shall not provide direct treatment and therapeutic services, but shall utilize appropriate public and private community agencies and service providers to obtain those services for its consumers.\u201d (\u00a7 4648, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">As Harbor suggests, the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that regional centers have the option of providing care themselves appears to have resulted from its having overlooked, through an unfortunate resort to ellipses, key language in section 4648, subdivision (a)(3). The Court of Appeal quoted the subdivision as follows: \u201cA regional center <em>may, </em>pursuant to vendorization or a contract, purchase services or supports for a consumer . . . which the regional center . . . determines will best accomplish all or any part of that consumer\u2019s program plan.\u201d (Italics added.) When the language deleted in the first ellipsis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>is restored, it becomes clear the only choice facing regional centers, except in emergencies, is which vendor to hire, not whether to hire a vendor at all. \u201cA regional center may, pursuant to vendorization or a contract, purchase services or supports for a consumer <em>from any individual or agency </em>which the regional center and consumer or, where appropriate, his or her parents, legal guardian, or conservator, or authorized representatives, determines will best accomplish all or any part of the consumer\u2019s program plan.\u201d (\u00a7 4648, subd. (a)(3), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">B. <em>Regional Centers Are Responsible for Only Periodic Monitoring</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Regional centers have important but limited monitoring responsibilities. A regional center representative is required to monitor the provision of care and services supplied by a provider to ensure they are provided in accordance with the developmentally disabled person\u2019s IPP. (\u00a7\u00a7 4742, 4743.) During monitoring visits to a provider, the regional center liaison is required to, among other things, review staff schedules for compliance with the approved service level requirements, review staff personnel files to ensure compliance with the regulations pertaining to training and testing, and select and review a randomly chosen sample of <em>20 percent </em>of the facility\u2019s records to ensure that services are being provided to the developmentally disabled persons in accordance with their IPP\u2019s. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 56048, subd. (d).) The regional center liaison must inform the administrator of the facility of any substantial inadequacies found in the care and services provided, the specific corrective actions necessary, and the date by which those actions must be completed. (\u00a7 4745.) A regional center may terminate its contract with a provider if it determines the provider has not complied with the contract or with applicable law and regulations. (\u00a7 4648.1, subd. (d).) If conditions constituting an immediate danger to a developmentally disabled person come to the attention of a regional center, the regional center must investigate the situation immediately, and if the immediate danger cannot be corrected within 24 hours of verification, the regional center must take immediate steps to relocate the developmentally disabled person. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 56053.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">However, the Legislature did not require of regional centers anything like the hour-by-hour monitoring that would have been required to prevent Bobby\u2019s tragic death. A regional center is required to establish a \u201cschedule of regular <em>periodic </em>review and reevaluation to ascertain that planned services have been provided, that objectives have been fulfilled within the times specified, and that consumers and families are satisfied with the individual program plan and its implementation.\u201d (\u00a7 4646.5, subd. (a)(6), italics added.) A regional center representative must meet with a developmentally disabled person at least <em>quarterly </em>to review progress towards achieving the IPP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>objectives. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 56047, subd. (a).) No fewer than <em>two </em>unannounced monitoring visits to a care facility are to be conducted by a regional center each year. (\u00a7 4648.1, subd. (a).) The regional center liaison is required to visit the facility at least <em>once </em>a year. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 56048, subd. (d)(1).) A service coordinator may be responsible for monitoring dozens of consumers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Stretched so thin, the service coordinators could not possibly provide the continuous monitoring contemplated by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">C. <em>The Doctrine of the Law of the Case Does Not Apply Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Plaintiffs contend, and the Court of Appeal agreed, this appeal is governed by the law of the case doctrine; this would preclude Harbor from taking issue with the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding in this appeal, which for purposes of this discussion we will refer to as <em>Morohoshi II, </em>that \u201cHarbor was vicariously liable under the rationale of nondelegable duty for any negligence on the part of Pacific Home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018law of the case\u2019 deals with the effect of the <em>first appellate decision </em>on the subsequent <em>retrial or appeal: </em>The decision of an appellate court, stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case, conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 895, p. 928.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The law of the case doctrine applies to this court even though the previous appeal was before the Court of Appeal, and it applies even though this court may conclude the previous Court of Appeal opinion was erroneous. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 786 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481].) \u201cIndeed, it is only when the former rule is deemed erroneous that the doctrine of the law of the case becomes at all important.\u201d <em>(Tally </em>v. <em>Ganahl </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 418, 421 [90 P. 1049].) The doctrine is, we have recognized, harsh. <em>(Clemente </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 202, 212 [219 Cal.Rptr. 445, 707 P.2d 818].) Accordingly, we have declined to adhere to it where its application would result in an unjust decision, e.g., where there has been a manifest misapplication of existing principles resulting in substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>injustice, or where the controlling rules of law have been altered or clarified by a decision intervening between the first and second appellate determinations. The unjust decision exception does not apply when there is a mere disagreement with the prior appellate determination. (Stanley, at p. 787.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In invoking the law of the case doctrine in <em>Morohoshi II, </em>the Court of Appeal misread its prior decision. The holding of <em>Morohoshi II, </em>that \u201cthe trial court erred in refusing to allow the jury to find defendant vicariously liable for Bobby\u2019s death caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s agent Pacific Home,\u201d was simply not a ground of the decision in <em>Morohoshi I. </em>Therefore, since the law of the case doctrine is itself inapplicable here, we need not address the applicability of exceptions to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In <em>Morohoshi v. Pacific Home </em>(Aug. 21, 2001, B143379) [nonpub. opn.] <em>(Morohoshi I), </em>Harbor moved for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion, and the Morohoshis appealed the dismissal of their action as to Harbor. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding the Morohoshis had presented evidence of multiple triable issues of material fact as to Harbor\u2019s breach of duties imposed on regional centers by the Lanterman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">However, in <em>Morohoshi II, </em>the Court of Appeal gave this description of its holding in <em>Morohoshi I: </em>\u201cIn <em>Morohoshi I </em>we recognized Harbor could be held liable for its own negligence toward Bobby <em>but we also specifically held Harbor was vicariously liable under the rationale of nondelegable duty for any negligence on the part of Pacific Home.'\u201d </em>(Fns. omitted.) \u201cThe nondelegable duty rule,\u201d the <em>Morohoshi II </em>court noted, \u201cis a form of vicarious liability. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The opinion in <em>Morohoshi I </em>is 22 pages long. The \u201cDiscussion\u201d portion of the opinion is 14 pages long. The passage in <em>Morohoshi I </em>that is cited in <em>Morohoshi II </em>appears on page 17 of the previous opinion. This passage, which is entitled \u201cHRC [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Could Not Delegate To Pacific Home the Duties It Owed To Decedent,\u201d is only eight lines long. In full, it reads: \u201cHRC contends it did not have a nondelegable duty to decedent because the statutory scheme does not envision it. HRC relies on <em>Privette v. Superior Court </em>[(1993) 5 Cal.4th 689 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 854 P.2d 721]]; however, <em>Privette </em>contains no such holding, [f] As a matter of law, HRC\u2019s duties could not be delegated to Pacific Home. HRC\u2019s duties under sections 4647, 4648, and 4742 are found in Article Two of the Lanterman Act which is entitled, <em>\u2018Regional Center </em>Responsibilities.\u2019 The Legislature\u2019s intent is clear and unambiguous. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>language [vzc][<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of the statutes in Article Two are imposed solely on regional centers as evidenced by the language of sections 4647, 4648, and 4742.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">As Harbor contends, the Court of Appeal in <em>Morohoshi I </em>\u201cdid not analyze the issue of \u2018vicarious liability\u2019 and it did not hint that Harbor Regional Center could be liable for <em>Pacific Home\u2019s </em>own negligence.\u201d To the contrary, the passage in question speaks only of \u201cHRC\u2019s duties.\u201d The duties mentioned, the court stressed, \u201care found in Article Two of the Lanterman Act which is entitled, <em>\u2018Regional Center </em>Responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d The duties arising under article 2, the court reiterated, \u201care imposed solely on regional centers as evidenced by the language of sections 4647, 4648, and 4742.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Harbor points out, the Court of Appeal in <em>Morohoshi I </em>\u201cnever suggested Harbor could be liable, even if it fulfilled its obligations under these statutes (as the jury concluded it had), simply because Pacific breached its independent duty of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">George, C.
