Before Swearingen, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">At the trial it appeared that the defendant employed the plaintiff to sell property for him, and it was agreed that plaintiff should receive a commission of five per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>cent., and the price fixed for the property was $27,000. Plaintiff brought to the attention of Fred. Vogel the property in question, and according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony Werner agreed to sell to Vogel for $27,000. This transaction took'place in November, 1913. Nothing further seems to have been done until March 6, 1914, when Werner entered into a written contract to sell the property to Vogel. Defendant claimed that Vogel had refused to purchase the property in November,, and that he entered into an independent arrangement with him, and that the sale was arranged through another person than the plaintiff, and that defendant had paid such person a commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,387.50. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-5\"><em>E.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The oral testimony in this case was so conflicting that it was necessarily a question for the jury. The court properly refused defendant\u2019s points and submitted the disputed facts to the jury in a fair and adequate charge. The motion for judgment non obstante veredicto was rightly refused, for the reason that binding instructions could not be given: Dalmas v. Kemble, 215 Pa. 410; Schwarz v. Glenn, 244 Pa. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">When an owner of real estate sets machinery in motion to induce a sale of the real estate through the agency of a broker and a sale results through the broker\u2019s intervention, it is not material that the negotiations Were concluded directly with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In this case the verdict means that the broker was the moving and effective cause in bringing about the sale, and under authority of Peters v. Holmes, 45 Pa. Superior Ct. 278; Warne v. Johnston, 48 Pa. Superior Ct. 98, he is entitled to his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The case was fairly tried and we see no reversible error in the record. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
