The only corroborative testimony that I recall is the fact \u2014 and it is for you to pass upon, as to whether it is corroborative or not \u2014 that she got a ring. She says she got a ring, and she had it on her finger on the witness stand. She says she got that about three months after she had met this man. She wore it on her finger, and there were others who saw this ring on her finger. There is testimony on the part of one person that the defendant got that ring from her; it was broken and he took it away and brought it back when it was repaired. Then, there is the further fact that this defendant himself, who has gone upon the witness stand and testified, does not deny that he did have improper relations with this girl, nor does he deny that he did induce her to have those relations under a promise of marriage. Those circumstances, if they tend to corroborate what the girl says \u2014 they are in evidence \u2014 are to be considered by you in passing upon the question as to the guilt or innocence of this defendant. ] (5)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-10\">[\u201cThe language of the proviso for suspension of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>statute of limitations is this: \u2018Shall not have been an inhabitant of this State.\u2019 Well, he was an inhabitant of the State. Accepting it literally, we cannot escape it. \u2018Or usual resident therein.\u2019 Those are the words that cause the trouble and cause the difference between counsel and myself. I don\u2019t know that I agree with the Commonwealth either on that subject. I don\u2019t know that it is necessary that he be a usual resident out in West Deer Township, unless something called him out there. He lived out near West Deer Township. That is where this offense was committed. I believe the girl lives out there,, and he lived out there, I think, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for him to go back and live in West Deer Township. It wasn\u2019t necessary for him to go back and live in Pittsburgh; if he lived in the State, the law presumes the officers would be duly diligent, and in two years find him. But he did more than that; he lived in Pittsburgh, and he had a reason for living in Pittsburgh, and presumably did not have any particular reason to live in West Deer Township. He had an interest in that farm out there, but it is not apparent that his interest would demand his presence out there all the time at least. Now, he lived in Pittsburgh, he did business in Pittsburgh, and he did business in his own name, and he got his mail in Pittsburgh, some of it was delivered, sent through the general delivery office, and sometimes it was sent to his place of boarding, and he voted in Pittsburgh, and he paid his taxes in Pittsburgh, and he met his friends and ate meals with them in Pittsburgh. The question is this: Did he live here in Pittsburgh as Charles Weber? Did he appear open and above board, and not attempt to disguise or conceal his identity; and if he did, he cannot, under the law be convicted here. But, if he did not, then he was not a usual resident of this place, because a usual resident does not disguise himself, does not conceal his identity, does not live alone and keep out of the way of other people. That would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>not be a usual resident.

It appears from the evidence that defendant met a girl of good repute, .under twenty-one years of age, in August, 1909. She testified that he became engaged to her. about three months later and bought her an engagement ring; that, in reliance upon his promise of marriage, she per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>xnitted him to have intercourse about once a week until July 31, 1910, when this relation ceased. She became pregnant, and the child was born May 6,1911.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahvj\">A warrant was issued April 7, 1911, charging defendant with seduction, upon an information made by her father before Justice of the Peace Clarke. This warrant, and an alias warrant issued in 1912, Avere not served because defendant had left the State. February 2, 1913, a pluries warrant was issued, upon the original information, by A. T. Lorch, a successor to Clarke. Loreh arrested the defendant on July 6, 1916. He denied his identity when arrested. He had visited the neighborhood several times, during the two years immediately preceding the trial, under an assumed name, and had denied \u2022that he was Charles Weber.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">At the trial defendant testified that he -had not seen the girl during the month of July, 1910. He produced witnesses to prove that he had resided, worked, and voted, in Pittsburgh, twelve miles from the girl\u2019s home, and about the same distance from his own, for three years before his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the court below erred in charging the jury \u201cthat because the defendant had upon a few occasions denied his identity, this .was sufficient to justify them in finding that this abiding within the County of Allegheny and State of Pennsylvania, during the two years and more prior to the date of the finding of the indictment did not make him during that period \u2018an inhabitant of the State of Pennsylvania nor an usual resident therein\u2019 within the meaning of the Act of Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The other objections of the appellant are without merit. His arrest was, so far as the record indicates, proper. It would not have been possible to amend the information so as to incorporate the exception to the statute when the appellant was arrested under the piuries warrant. He could be held before the justice only for the offense charged in the information and war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>rant, but the grand jury had authority to indict him for any offense warranted by the evidence before it. The court, therefore, properly refused to quash the indictment. The prosecution adduced sufficient evidence to convict on the charge of seduction. Defendant gave her a ring, subsequently had it reset, was continuously seen in her company, and she was reputed to be a good girl. Evidence of facts usually accompanying the relation of affianced persons is sufficient corroboration: Rice v. Com., 100 Pa. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">There remains the question whether the court below erred in charging the jury that under the facts they might find defendant was not an usual resident of the State. The seventy-seventh section of the Act of March 81, 1860, P. L. 450, provides, inter alia: \u201cAll indictments ......for......misdemeanors......shall be brought within two years......: Provided, However, That if the person against whom the indictment shall be brought or exhibited shall not have been an inhabitant of this State, or usual resident therein during the said respective term during which he shall be- subject and liable to prosecution as aforesaid, then such indictment shall and may be brought and exhibited against such person, at any period within a similar space of time, during which he shall be an inhabitant of, or usual resi-. dent, within the <em>State.......\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">. The burden of showing that defendant was not an usual resident rested upon the Commonwealth: Blackman v. Com., 124 Pa. 578, but the question before us, while considered, was not there decided. The Commonwealth satisfied the burden when it showed that defendant had absconded in 1910; that the officers had diligently attempted to find him, and that he succeeded in avoiding arrest by denials of his identity, frequent changes of boarding place, and receiving his mail at the general delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Every statute must be construed with reference to the object intended to be accomplished: Turbett Twp. Over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>seers of the Poor v. Port Royal Borough Overseers of the Poor, 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 520. The object of this proviso was to prevent persons from escaping and absenting themselves until the lapse of time would relieve them from punishment: Graham v. Com., 51 Pa. 255. The statute should be given that construction which is best calculated to advance its object by remedying the mischief and securing the benefits intended. In the interpretation, words in common use should be construed in their natural, plain and ordinary meaning: City of Pittsburgh v. Kalchthaler, 114 Pa. 547; Com. v. Shaleen, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 1, 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">The words \u201cusual resident\u201d do not refer to defendant\u2019s place of residence, but to his manner of residence. \u201cUsual,\u201d when used in this sense, means \u201ccustomary\u201d or \u201ccommon\u201d: Graham v. Com., supra, at page 258. To be an \u201cusual resident,\u201d therefore, one must conduct himself in accordance with his customary mode of life. One might commit an offense and move <em>to </em>another part of the State in an open manner, or even go from the State, if in military service, and not be barred from claiming the benefit of- the statute: Graham v. Com., supra; but this is not so where the offender flees from justice and, subsequently, by fraud and concealment, succeeds in avoiding arrest. Unless we so construe the act the words \u201cusual resident\u201d become meaningless. If the offender lives outside of the State he is a nonresident, and if he remains in hiding or concealment within the State he is an \u201cinhabitant\u201d, but not an \u201cusual resident.\u201d The question is primarily one of fact, and was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">While the analogy is not exact, owing to different phraseology in the statutes, the decisions in other jurisdictions are in accord with our conclusion: 12 Cyc. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The judgment is affirmed and the record remitted for purposes of execution.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"AEBb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Henderson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Avd\">Dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">The misdemeanor with which the defendant was charged was committed about six years before the indictment was found. He was therefore, entitled to the protection of the limitation provided by the seventy-seventh section of the Act of March 21, 1860, P. L. 450, unless he was not \u201can inhabitant of this State or usual resident therein\u201d during the term for which he was liable to prosecution. It is not alleged that he was absent from the State; his home was and continued to be in Allegheny County. He was, therefore, an inhabitant of this State and the statute was a bar to his prosecution. The learned trial' judge, however, gave a construction to the words \u201cor usual resident therein\u201d which permitted the jury to inquire as to his mode of living in the county and to determine whether he lived \u201copenly and aboveboard.\u201d This we think is not the sense in which the words are used in the statute. They refer to the whereabouts of the accused. The phrases are in the alternative, \u201can inhabitant of this State or usual resident therein.\u201d A person might reside in: the State who was not an inhabitant thereof. The word \u201cusual\u201d qualifies the term \u201cresident\u201d and. relates to the place of abode \u2014 the customary place of living \u2014 and not to the manner of life. The conclusion seems unavoidable that if the accused was an inhabitant of Allegheny County at the time the offense was committed and continued to be an inhabitant thereof he could not be lawfully convicted because of the lapse of time between the commission of the offense and the finding of the indictment. And even if not an inhabitant of the State he would be protected if he were a \u201cusual resident\u201d ; that is, if he commonly or ordinarily resided therein. I would reverse the judgment, therefore, for the reason stated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-4\">Orlady, P. J. and Kephart, J. concur in dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
