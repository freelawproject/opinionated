If you find that there was no levy under the landlord\u2019s warrant before that taking by the sheriff then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. But if you find that there was a levy under a landlord\u2019s warrant prior to the time that the sheriff went up there and took the goods for the Haltzel Furniture Company under the replevin \u2014 if you find that there was a legal levy under the landlord\u2019s warrant, then you still find in favor of the plaintiff, but you put this condition on it; \u2018on condition that he pay to the defendant the market value of the goods that he took out of the building under his writ of replevin.\u2019 So the first fact for you to find is whether there was a valid levy under the landlord\u2019s war1 rant before the goods were taken under the writ of replevin.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-5\">Verdict for plaintiff unconditionally upon which judgment.

The latter informed the company that he had abandoned the premises whereon the goods had been placed and that it should come and remove its goods. The company thereupon caused a writ of replevin to issue and upon the execution of the writ regained possession of the leased goods. Linnen, the owner of the premises, when he learned that the goods on the premises were being taken by the sheriff under the writ of replevin, through his agent, Kelly,, informed the sheriff as he was removing the goods th\u00e1t they were in the legal possession of Buckley a constable, by- virtue of a landlord\u2019s warrant issued by Kelly as Linnen\u2019s agent some days before, that the warrant had been duly executed and the tenant\u2019s goods had been distrain\u00e9d before the writ of replevin had issued. The sheriff served Kelly and Buckley and added their names to the return. Linnen subsequently was allowed to intervene and the issue was duly joined upon plaintiff\u2019s statement and the affidavit of defense thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">If the landlord\u2019s distress was made prior to the execution of the writ of replevin, his rights were superior to those of the plaintiff. The plaintiff however contended that there had been no warrant issued and no distraint made; that the warrant exhibited in the case was made after the goods had been seized by the sheriff and had been antedated and that the whole matter was a device to circumvent the effect of the replevin writ. There were certain elements in the case which lent color to plaintiff\u2019s claim in this regard. Certain peculiarities about the appearance of the warrant and the flat contradiction of the story of the constable by the sheriff and those who were with him were sufficient to discredit the claim of the defendant. The trial judge very properly left the question, as to whether or not the landlord distraint preceded the replevin, to the jury and they found for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The appellant argues that the above question was not properly in the case since the sheriff\u2019s return showed that the goods were found in possession of the landlord\u2019s agent and the constable, his bailiff, and that the only \u201cway under the pleadings they could have possession is under the landlord\u2019s warrant,\u201d and the case thus being a landlord and tenant case, the only question arising was whether there was any rent in arrear. If the issue were joined solely between Thompson as tenant and Linneu as landlord this might be true. In this case the question of rent in arrear arises only incidentally as part of defendant\u2019s proof. Even if there were rent due, the plaintiff might still maintain his action and if he could prove a title superior to that of the defendant, he would be entitled to the verdict. The jury by its finding settled the question that the plaintiff as owner of the goods in question repossessed himself of them before any landlord\u2019s levy had been placed on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The other assignments of error are directed to the admission of testimony as to certain goods of the tenants having been left on the premises at the time the writ of replevin was executed. As the landlord sold these his claim for rent was reduced pro tanto. Had he won the case and a conditional verdict been rendered as provid\u00e9d by the Act of April 19,1901, Section 6, P. L. 88, he could not have recovered from the plaintiff a greater amount than the rent due him. In this view of the matter, the testimony was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">All the assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
