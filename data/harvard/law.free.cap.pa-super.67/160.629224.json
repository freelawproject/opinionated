It alleges, among other things:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-12\">That on August 31, 1914, the petitioner appeared as defendant in a suit brought by the above-named plaintiff before \"Squire Shenk, of Benna Vista,\u201d of this county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-13\">Fairview Township, York County, Pennsylvania\u2014 That a hearing in said suit Ayas then and there had, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>which the plaintiff and defendant were both present with their respective attorneys. Witnesses were sworn and heard on behalf of the plaintiff and defendant; when, after the testimony was closed the squire (or justice-of the peace) announced to the effect that he would not decide the case at that time but would decide it later. On this point the witnesses for the petitioner, on depositions taken in support of the petitioner, testify that the justice of the peace said he would inform the parties when he rendered his judgment, etc., etc. The witnesses for the respondent, in support of allegations contained in his answer, say in substance, that the justice of the peace said he would render his opinion on the 3d of September next, at 7 o\u2019clock p. m., when the parties interested could be present and hear it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">The truth of these conflicting statements is immaterial to the present inquiry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">. The evidence shows that a judgment was rendered publicly by the justice of the peace at his office (the place where the hearing was held) on September 3,1914, at 7 o\u2019clock p. m. The plaintiff and his attorney being present; the defendant and his attorney not being present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">The petitioner prays that an appeal from said judgment shall be entered nunc pro tunc. The only reason upon which the prayer is based, is that he did not receive the notice of judgment, as he alleges the justice of the peace never notified him of its entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">That is a prayer for this court to do an impossible thing under the law and the circumstances of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">The statute law regulating appeals from judgments of justices of the peace is plain and should be well understood and it is not within the province of this court to overrule those statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">The merits of the suit before the justice cannot be inquired into by this court on this proceeding, and if the judgment was so unfair or inequitable as counsel for defendant attempted ,to argue to us, it was all the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>necessary why the petitioner, or his counsel should have been alert to the remedy given him by well known law ; even if the justice of the peace did say that he would notify parties of his judgment, it should have been well known that the law requires him to render the judgment within ten days after the evidence had been heard. See act approved March <em>22,1877, </em>P. L. <em>13.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-3\">Parties to suits of this kind cannot excuse themselves because of neglect of counsel: Ward v. Letsskus, 152 Pa. 318.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\">There is a class of cases which have allowed appeals to be taken nunc pro tunc, but there are none, which we have been able to reach, which allowed such appeals because of the laches of the petitioner. In the case before us there is no charge of. fraud, either legal or constructive. The thing most apparent from the testimony before us is, that the petitioner has slept on his legal rights, and it is not within the province of this court to disregard such neglect by what the attorney for petitioner describes as the exercise of \u201csound judicial discretion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">The language used by Mr. Justice Paxson, in Kerr v. Rogers, 9 Phila. 525, and sanctioned by the Superior Court, in 42 Pa. Superior Ct. 113, can be aptly applied to the circumstances of the present application: \u201cThe frequency of these applications admonishes us that we ought not to relax the rules of law applicable to such cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">Nothing short of an act of assembly can give a man an appeal when he has lost his right thereto by neglect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">There is a class of cases, the number of which we do not feel disposed to increase, in which it has been held that a defendant may be allowed to file his appeal nunc pro tunc.\u201d......\u201cThe present case is not a case where the defendant\u2019s attorney was, in any way, fraudulently misled or deceived by anything bn which he had a right to rely.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">Where counsel is the agent of his client, as he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>this case, the neglect of the one is the neglect of the other: Ward v. Letzkus, 152 Pa. 318.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-3\">I have carefully examined the cases cited in support of the respondent\u2019s contention and I cannot find in any of them, an intimation that the \u201csound discretion of the court,\u201d which was so eloquently and persistently invoked, can be made available to correct the consequences of negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-4\">And now, February 21, 1916, the rule is discharged at costs of petitioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-6\"><em>John A.

The opinion filed by the court in discharging the rule, so fully and clearly answers the appellant\u2019s contention that it is not necessary to add anything thereto. For the reason given therein the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
