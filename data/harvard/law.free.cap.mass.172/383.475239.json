Hearing before Barker, J., who reported the case for the consideration of the full court, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-8\">The members of the business partnership of Lot Phillips and Company resided in the town of Hanover, where they had a box factory, wherein they manufactured boxes. In the town of Duxbury the firm owned a permanent sawmill, dam, and mill privilege, and in the sawmill they sawed large quantities of logs into box boards, and used the boards so sawed mainly at their box factory in Hanover in making boxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">On May 25, 1895, the firm made due return of property for taxation, pursuant to St. 1894, c. 294, to the assessors of Duxbury. They were assessed in Duxbury for their real estate situate therein, and also for wood, boards, and slabs at the sawmill. They duly appealed to the county commissioners from the assessment, and so much of the tax assessed upon them for the year 1895 as was assessed upon the wood, boards, and slabs was abated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the wood, boards, and slabs were stock employed in the business of manufacturing in Duxbury, and the sawmill where the logs or wood were sawed into boards and slabs was a manufactory within the provisions of Pub. Sts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 1, or if the sawmill was a place of business within the provisions of Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 24, the writ of certiorari was to issue; otherwise, the petition was to be dismisssd.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-5\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHG9\">We are of opinion that the partnership of Lot Phillips and Company had a place of business in Duxbury, and that the personal property employed in that business was rightly taxed to the partnership in Duxbury, under Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 24. If the partners had been accustomed to sell at the mill in Duxbury the boards and slabs which they sawed from logs in the <em>\u201c </em>permanent sawmill, dam, and mill privilege \u201d which they owned there, we should have no doubt that they were engaged in business there within the meaning of the section. The fact that the boards sawed were box boards and were mainly used by the partners in the manufacture of boxes at their box factory in Hanover does not, we think, change the principle. The section provides that, \u201c If partners have places of business in two or more towns, they shall be taxed in each of such places for the proportion of property employed therein.\u201d See <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>137 Mass. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">It is unnecessary to consider whether the property was taxable in Duxbury under Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 20, cl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\n<em>Writ of certiorari to issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
