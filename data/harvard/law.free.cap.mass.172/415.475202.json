It was served upon that company by delivering a copy to its president, who was also president of the defendant company.

The declaration was under the employers\u2019 liability act, St. 1887, e. 270.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-10\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hardy, </em>J., there was no evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was injured by being thrown from the roof of a car belonging to or operated by the East Middlesex Street Railway Company, or that the car from which he fell was standing at the time of the accident upon any track belonging to or operated by the East Middle-sex Street Railway Company, or that the superintendent was employed by the East Middlesex Street Railway Company. A notice, a copy of which is given below, was served upon the East Middlesex Street Railway Company, by being delivered to A. F. Breed, its president, on August 4,1894, the day of its date. Breed was at that time also president of the defendant company, and the East Middlesex Street Railway Company had recently been leased to the defendant company. The notice was as follows : \u201c To the East Middlesex Street Railway Company: You are hereby notified that on the twenty-ninth day of July, 1894, between the hours ten and eleven in the afternoon, at or near the junction of Everett Avenue and Broadway, in the city of Chelsea, Massachusetts, I was severely injured by being thrown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>from the top of one of the cars of your company. I was upon the top of said car, and in the act of holding and pressing the trolley pole, which reaches from the top of the car to the trolley wire overhead, on to the trolley wire, when I was suddenly thrown to the ground. 1 was acting under orders of my superior at the time I fell, and was using due care.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-4\">The judge excluded the notice, on the ground that it was not a notice to the defendant, and directed a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-5\"><em>E.

The sheriff\u2019s return of service of the notice is that he served it upon the East Middlesex Street Railway Company by delivering a copy to A. F. Breed, its president. It appears that Breed was also president of the defendant corporation, and that the East Middlesex Street Railway Company had recently been leased to the Lynn and Boston Railroad Company. The court excluded the notice, on the ground that it was not a notice to the defendant. This was correct. The case is not one in which there was an omission to state the time, place, and cause of the injury correctly, but in which there was no notice whatever to the defendant. St. 1894, c. 889, relative to notices in cases of injuries to persons or property, therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
