The defendant thereupon notified the chief of police and superintendent of streets of Cambridge that the furniture was on the street and sidewalk, and returned the execution into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\">The sidewalk was not wholly obstructed, but upon the evidence the jury would have been warranted in finding that a free passage for travellers thereon was obstructed by the furniture so placed as aforesaid, and that the same remained on the sidewalk for more than twelve hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-8\">The judge ruled that the defendant was not justified in placing the furniture, or any part thereof, on the street and sidewalk as alleged in the complaint, and directed a verdict of guilty with the consent of the defendant, which the jury thereupon rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\">If the ruling was right, the verdict was to stand; otherwise the verdict was to be set aside, all further proceedings were to be stayed on the complaint, and the defendant was to be discharged therefrom, or such other order made as to the court should seem proper.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-10\"><em>H.

The defendant justifies on the ground that he acted as a public officer, and in obedience to a writ of execution ordering him to cause one Halli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>day to have possession of the tenement from which the furniture was removed. But the fact that the defendant was a constable did not put him above the law, and the writ did not require him to disregard it. For if we assume that the defendant\u2019s duty required him to remove the furniture irrespective of any request to him, <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>103 Mass. 495, 496, see <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>2 B. Mon. (Ky.) 507, <em>Witbeck </em>v. <em>Van Rensselaer, </em>64 N. Y. 27, 32, it did not require him to leave it upon the sidewalk contrary to the ordinance. There is no hardship upon the officer. He may store the goods at the owner\u2019s cost, <em>(Preston </em>v. <em>Neale, </em>12 Gray, 222,) and may require a bond of indemnity from the party who calls upon him to serve the writ. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Parkinson, </em>10 Allen, 133, 136. <em>Hamberger </em>v. <em>Seavey, </em>165 Mass. 505, 507.
