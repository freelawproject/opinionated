The conveyance referrred to in the opinion was executed on March 25, 1896. <em>Dewey, </em>J. charged the trustee on his answers to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories, and the trustee alleged exceptions.

No creditors appear to have become parties to the deed. The question before us is whether these facts warranted the Superior Court in charging the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The title had passed as between the parties to the deed. The trustee had the right to the immediate possession. We do not see why he was not as well \u201c able to turn it out, to be disposed of on execution,\u201d <em>(Andrews </em>v. Ludlow, 5 Pick. 28, 31,) as if he had taken possession by a formal act. The case of <em>Viall </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>9 Pick. 13, seems probably to have been similar to this, and in Maine it seems settled that in cases like the present the trustee is to be charged. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>15 Maine, 86. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Elwell, </em>13 Maine, 261. <em>Peabody </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>79 Maine, 572, 584. <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Boston Sandwich Glass Co. </em>7 Md. 287. See also <em>Mechanics' Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>150 Mass. 234, 235; Cushing, Trustee Process, \u00a7\u00a7 53-55 ; Drake, Attachment, (7th ed.) \u00a7 482; Freeman, Executions, (2d ed.) \u00a7 160. Section 26 of Pub. Sts. c. 183, is not intended to limit the liability of trustees under deeds like this to cases where they have taken possession, but simply to declare the existing law that they may be charged by trustee process under \u00a7 21. Rev. Sts. c. 109, \u00a7 35, Commissioners\u2019 note. We are of opinion that the property was \u201c intrusted in the hands \u201d of the trustee within Pub. Sts. c. 183, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">It is suggested that it does not appear from the trustee\u2019s answers to interrogatories that all the defendants had executed the deed before service of the writ. It does not appear that they had not.. The deed was executed, and, if it be material, may be presumed to have been executed by all three of the defendants on the day of its date, as it certainly was by two of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
