At the trial in the Superior Court, before Lilley, J., it appeared that the husband of the defendant was her authorized agent for the care of her real estate; that at the time of the alleged assault and in the commission thereof he was acting within the scope of his authority as such agent, and that she was not then present. The defendant requested the following rulings: \u201c The defendant in this case being the wife of the person committing the alleged assault cannot be held responsible therefor, because of the fact that she is his wife; that is to say, a wife cannot be held legally responsible for an assault committed by her husband, whether her husband was at the time her lawful agent for certain purposes, such as the care of her real estate, or not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The judge refused so to rule; and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.

Foley, 121 Mass. 259, and cases cited. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>67 Maine, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Our statutes have given to a married woman the right to hold, manage, and dispose of her property in the same manner as if she were sole, and a necessary consequence of this enlargement of her power is a corresponding increase of her responsibility for all acts relating thereto and growing out of her management and control. If she appoints her husband as her agent in such a matter, and in making such appointment acts of her own free will and without coercion from him, we see no reason for regarding her as incapable of authorizing any act to be done by him in her name, and on her behalf, or for shielding her from responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">It must be held that whatever is done within the scope of the agency is done by her authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
