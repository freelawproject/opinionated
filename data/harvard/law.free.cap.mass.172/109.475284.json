I don\u2019t know anything what became of me.\u2014 <em>Q. </em>You knew what you looked to see, what you were going to step on ? <em>A. </em>I did. \u2014 <em>Q. </em>Did you see whether yon were going to step on the platform or going to step off on the track or on the ground? <em>A. </em>I stepped on the track, on the step of the platform. \u2014 <em>Q. </em>Which, the track or platform <em>? A. </em>I could n\u2019t tell you. \u2014 <em>Q. </em>You did not know anything what you were going\u2019 to step on? <em>A. </em>I stepped on to the platform of the cars. \u2014 <em>Q. </em>You mean the platform of the station ? <em>A. </em>Yes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">She testified further that she tried to step off on the platform; and that when the train started she was stepping on the fourth step and just'stepping on the platform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">The defendant bailed ten witnesses, who testified that the train was made up of the engine, baggage car, a smoking car, two common coaches, two parlor cars, and a dining car. All the witnesses but one testified that the two common coaches were ahead of the two parlor cars, and that the dining car was at the rear end of the train next to the two parlor cars. The engineer said the two parlor cars were ahead of the two coaches. All the witnesses who testified as to the whereabouts of the plaintiff after she fell testified that she was found opposite the rear trucks of the dining car, on the earth, where there was no platform, and at a point which was westerly of the Milford Branch track, and at a distance of some two hundred feet from the west end of the station.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\">The plaintiff was found by the rear end brakeman, who was on the rear end of the dining car, after the train had come to a final stop at the station.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that she was in a common coach and not in a parlor car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-10\">The evidence for the defendant tended to show that the plain-i <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tiff was in the rear end of the rear common coach; that if the common coaches were in the rear of the parlor cars and next to the dining car, then nearly the whole length of the dining car passed the point where she stepped or was thrown off after she was so thrown off; that if the common coaches were ahead of the two parlor cars, then the whole length of the two parlor cars and nearly the whole length of the dining car passed the point where she stepped or was thrown off after she so stepped or was thrown off; and that the train made no stop until it reached the final stop at the station, and made no start after its final start, until it finally started for Boston, after the plaintiff had been found upon the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-4\">The defendant asked the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>\u201c </em>1. If the plaintiff undertook to step off the train when it was in motion, and was injured in consequence, she cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">\u201c 2. If the train had not come to a stop when she attempted to step off, she cannot recover, whether she knew it was in motion or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">\u201c 3. The plaintiff cannot recover unless the train, at the time she attempted to step off, had come to a stop at the place designed for passengers to alight, unless there is evidence to satisfy the jury that the defendant negligently led the plaintiff to suppose the train had reached and stopped at such place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">\u201c 4. The act of the brakeman in calling the station and the actual stopping of the train are not evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant negligently led the plaintiff to suppose the train had reached the place for her to alight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\">\u201c 5. She was bound to use due care to ascertain whether the train had reached the place designed for passengers to alight, and had no right to assume it simply because the brakeman announced the station, and the train had stopped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-10\">\u201c 6. The action of the brakeman in calling the station was not an invitation to alight from the train at all, or, if it was, it was not an invitation to alight from the train until it had come to a stop at the station where it was designed to discharge the passengers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-11\">\u201c 7. On the pleadings and evidence in this case there can be no recovery, unless the train had come to a stop at the place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>designed for passengers to alight, and while the plaintiff was, in the exercise of due care, in the act of alighting, the train was negligently started.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">\u201c 8. The evidence is not sufficient to warrant a finding that the train had, at the time the plaintiff attempted to step off, come to a stop at the place designed for passengers to alight.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">The judge gave the first three and the fifth rulings only in the form requested; declined to give the eighth request in any form; and instructed the j ury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">\u201c The practical contention comes to this : Had the train come to a standstill, and did the plaintiff, in relying upon that fact and the announcement which had been given of South Framing-ham, attempt to alight, believing the station had been reached, and in the exercise of due care, was she injured by the sudden starting of the train?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">\u201cFirst, then, had the train come to a standstill? If it had not, then the plaintiff cannot recover. . ... It is for you to say as between the conflicting testimony whether you are satisfied by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the train had come to a standstill. If it had, then the next question for you to determine, in order that the plaintiff may recover, is whether the train was negligently started by the defendant without notice to her and without any information that would lead her to believe, or lead a reasonable, prudent, and careful person to believe, that the train was about suddenly to start. If you are satisfied of that, then, so far as the negligence of the defendant is concerned, if she, the train having come to a standstill, attempted to alight and was thrown by the sudden starting of that train, she being in the exercise of due care herself, then it is competent for you to consider whether that act of suddenly starting, the train was an act of negligence on the part of the defendant, which was the proximate cause of the injury to her. If she fell off, if she started to get off while that train was in motion, if, supposing that the train had stopped or was about stopping, she suddenly jumped off, then she cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\">\u201cUpon the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence, I will further instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>train, at the time she attempted to step off, had come to a stop at a place designed for passengers to alight, unless there is evidence to satisfy you that the defendant negligently led the plaintiff to suppose that the train had reached and stopped at such a place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">\u201c The act of the brakeman in calling the station and the actual stopping of the train are to be considered by you in connection with the care which it was necessary for her, the plaintiff, to use in the exercise of her senses to determine whether the defendant negligently led the plaintiff to suppose the train had reached the place for her to alight.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">\u201c If you are satisfied of those things, then there is one other fact which must be proved by the plaintiff, and that is that she was in the exercise of due care herself in stepping from the train at a proper place. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">\u201c She was bound to use due care to ascertain whether the train reached the place designed for passengers to alight, and had no right to assume it, simply because the brakeman had announced the station, and the train had stopped. I think I substantially covered that before. She must use her senses. Simply because somebody said, 6 South Framingham,\u2019 is not enough. She must use her senses about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-7\">\u201c If the plaintiff fails to satisfy you, either that the train had not come to a standstill, or that she alighted at the proper place or was in the exercise of due care, then the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-8\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-9\"><em>P. P. Qoulding \u00bf- W. G. </em>Mellish, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-10\"><em>J. R. Thayer A. P. Rugg, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-11\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aha\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant requested the court to give certain rulings, eight in number. The court gave the first three and the fifth. The fourth was rightly refused in the form presented. There were other circumstances bearing upon the question whether the plaintiff supposed the train had reached the place for her to alight, and the court was not bound to rule upon the effect of the two facts named in the request considered as detached from all the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The instruction that \u201c the act of the brakeman in calling the station and the actual stopping of the train are to be considered by you in connection with the care which it was necessary for her, the plaintiff, to use in the exercise of her senses to determine whether the defendant negligently led the plaintiff to suppose the train had reached the place for her to alight,\u201d sufficiently covered the subject matter of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The subject matter of the sixth was fairly covered by the instruction that \u201c She was bound to use due care to ascertain' whether the train reached the place designed for passengers to alight, and had no right to assume it simply because the brakeman had announced the station, and the train had stopped. I think I substantially covered that before. She must use her senses. Simply because somebody said, 1 South Framingham,\u2019 is not enough. She must use her senses about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The seventh was rightly refused. The declaration did not require the plaintiff to prove that the train actually had come to a stop at a place designed for passengers. It alleges that \u201c at or near the station at South Framingham the defendant\u2019s employee called out in the car in which the plaintiff was seated, \u2018 South Framingham,\u2019 and thereupon the said car stopped and came to a standstill, and that thereafter the plaintiff, relying upon the said announcement and believing therefrom and from the stopping of said car that the passenger station had been reached, attempted to alight from said car; that as she was on the point of stepping from said car the train suddenly started, and she was thrown with great force to the ground.\u201d It nowhere states where the train stopped, and proof of a stopping elsewhere than at the place designed for passengers to alight was no variance. The rest of the request was given, subject to the modification contained in the latter part of the third instruction, which was given. This was all the plaintiff was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The refusal to give the eighth presents a question of more difficulty. The evidence produced by the defendant seems to have a very strong tendency to show that, at the time the plaintiff attempted to get off, the train had not come to a stop at the place designed for passengers to alight. On the other hand, the plaintiff testified that when she was stepping out she saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the platform of the depot, and tried to step upon it, and that she \u201c was stepping on the fourth step and just stepping on the platform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">It is argued for the defendant that in other parts of her testimony it appears that she did not know what she was going to step on when she left the car, and that in saying she saw the platform she was mistaken; and there is much in her testimony to support this contention. But the effect of the whole evidence was for the jury, and, there being a conflict, we cannot say, as matter of law, that they were not justified in coming to a conclusion the other way. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
