The declaration contained counts at common law and under the employers\u2019 liability act, St. 1887, c. 270. The case was tried in the Superior Court, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., and, he having ceased to be a justice of that court, a bill of exceptions, at the request of the parties, was allowed by <em>Dewey, </em>J., in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-11\">The accident happened in the machine shop connected with the hat manufactory of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-12\">The plaintiff was injured while oiling a countershaft, in which was a set screw that projected from the shaft, according to the evidence, between one and one eighth inches and one and seven eighths inches. There was no contention but that this set screw was a device in common use, and suitable for the purpose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>which ifc was intended. The countershaft was twelve feet long, eight feet and nine inches from the floor, and suspended from the ceiling by two hangers, one near \u00e9ach end. The ceiling was about ten feet and three inches from the floor. In each hanger was a small hole by means. of which to oil the bearing. The accident happened near the hanger at the south end of the shaft. Just north of this hanger and close to it was a pulley twenty-six inches in diameter, and just south of the hanger was a collar about two inches wide, seven eighths inches thick, and three and five eighths inches in diameter. This collar kept the shaft in place, and the purpose of the set screw was to fasten the collar to the shaft. The set screw was half an inch in diameter, and it had a square head also half an inch in diameter. The end of the shaft projected southerly beyond the collar about fourteen inches. The oil hole in the bearing was on the east side of the shaft, and close to the set screw. Just east of the centre of the bearing, and about fifteen -inches distant therefrom, was a post which supported the beam and the ceiling from which the hanger was suspended. The shaft was about one and seven eighths inches in diameter, and revolved at a speed between ninety and one hundred revolutions a minute. The room was on the ground floor of the building, and was lighted from windows on the south, east, and west sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-5\">The plaintiff testified that he reached the age of nineteen years at Christmas, 1897; that the accident occurred on December 14,1896, at which time he had been working in the machine shop as an apprentice very nearly three weeks; that the foreman of the shop, one Sackett, told one McClellan to show the plaintiff what was to be done; that McClellan showed him about the oiling, and went and got a step ladder, and oiled the shaft, placing the ladder on the east side of the shaft, and showing the plaintiff where the oil box was, and the plaintiff oiled the rest; that the plaintiff had not oiled this shaft at all before the accident; that the oiling was done on Mondays only; that in showing him how to oil McClellan got up on the step ladder, and put the oil in the oil box, and said nothing to the plaintiff except to tell him to put the oil in the box ; that the next time that he did any oiling was on the Monday two weeks later, being the morning of the accident about half past seven o\u2019clock; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that McClellan came to him and asked him if he had oiled up, to which he replied, \u201c No,\u201d and McClellan said, \u201c You had better go and oil up now\u201d; that he then went up stairs and got the ladder, and the first place he began to oil was where the accident happened; that he put the ladder upon the west side of the shaft because there were some castings on the east side; that the pile of castings was about two feet high, and spread out about five feet, and he could not put the ladder on that side; that besides the castings there were some pulleys and old pumps on the east side, the pulleys being about four feet high; that the plaintiff brought some of the castings there himself under Sackett\u2019s orders; that the pulleys were rolled in by McClellan, another boy, and the plaintiff; that he could see the shaft from the floor and see it turn; that he looked at it before he went up, but did not see any set screw; that he placed his ladder, looked up, and then went up with the oil can and oiled the shafting; that when he got up there he did not see any set screw; that to oil the shaft he stood on the next to the top step ; that he reached over with his left hand to oil, and while he was oiling something grabbed his sleeve, and he tried to pull away, but he could not do so, and it drew him right on to the shaft; that while he was doing that work he was looking where to oil, and did not see anything on the shaft or collar, or any place there that he thought could catch him; that he wore an over-all jacket with loose sleeves, as loose as an ordinary jacket sleeve; that nobody ever told him about the set screw being there, or gave him any warning about it at all; that he saw no reason why he should not oil from that side as well as from the other; that he could not take the castings away without Sackett\u2019s order ; that Sackett told him to put them there; and that nobody told him of any danger at all about that place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-5\">It was admitted by the defendant that it was the set screw which caught the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-6\">On cross-examination, the plaintiff testified that previously to becoming an apprentice in this shop he had been doing nothing for a long time; that before that he had been working at weaving for three or four months; that be was learning at one mill, and afterwards ran four looms at another mill; that these looms were connected with the shafting; that he saw the shafting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>belts, and pulleys; that he understood the machinery was run by belts and pulleys; that he was a little familiar with running machinery; that he could have laid the castings one side; that he did not know that Sackett would have been satisfied to take them away from there; that he knew that the shaft was in motion at the time he placed his ladder there; and that he could see the oil hole from where he was standing. .\u00ab</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-4\">He also testified as follows: \u201c I looked for the oil hole, that is all I looked for. ...
