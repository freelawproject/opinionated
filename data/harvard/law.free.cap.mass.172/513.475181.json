Wing was the defendant\u2019s intestate, and was the treasurer of the Wheeler Cotton Mills, and also executor of Jonathan D. Wheeler\u2019s will. The plaintiff in each case had received a part payment under a compromise agreement with the Wheeler Cotton Mills, and the plaintiffs sought to hold Henry F. Wing\u2019s estate on the ground that he was personally liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-11\">George K. Nichols, the president of both the plaintiff banks, testified for the plaintiff that prior to the giving of the notes, which were given in renewal of former notes similarly indorsed, and which had been originally indorsed by Jonathan D. Wheeler and during the life of the notes in suit, he had told the defendant\u2019s intestate that the indorsements bound him personally, and not the estate of Jonathan D. Wheeler; that when Wing first gave them notes indorsed by the Wheeler estate and by himself as executor, they questioned his right to indorse those notes in that way, and from that time constantly took that position toward him ; that Wing said he thought he had the right; that they took the notes with Wing\u2019s indorsements, feeling that he was good for them, and that he would be holden for them, and he was told so, and the banks consulted counsel and were told that that was true, and they told Wing' what the counsel said, and he also testified that the indorsements were on the notes at their inception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-12\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that the actions could not be maintained.

Wing, seeking to hold him upon two indorsements made by Henry F. Wing as executor of the will of Jonathan D. Wheeler. The indorsements were in the following form: \u201c Estate of Jo\u00f1a. D. Wheeler, Henry F. Wing, Executor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">A majority of the court are of opinion that these words mean \u201c Estate of Wheeler by Wing,\u201d and therefore that at least they failed to bind Wing by contract. It is quite true that the law does not know the estate of a dead man as a contractor, and that, unless the fact that these indorsements were the renewal of indorsements by Wheeler in his lifetime makes a difference, they did not bind the estate. But that merely shows that the indorsements were made by Wing under a mistake of law, as the testimony also proves to have been a fact. But the presence of Wing\u2019s name upon the paper and his failure to bind his supposed principal are not enough to make the contract his own. <em>Jefts </em>v. <em>York, </em>4 Cush. 871, and 10 Cush. 392, 395, 396. <em>Abbey </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>6 Cush. 54, 56, 57. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>30 Conn. 122. If a man does not purport to be a party to negotiable paper, he is not a party to it. See further 1 Dan. Neg. Instr. (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 306, 307,308. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>104 Mass. 336. It is true that it is suggested by Mr. Daniel that in such cases an ambiguous expression may be interpreted to bind the agent, but neither that suggestion nor a presumption that the agent knew the law can pervert words from their meaning if the meaning is plain. The so called presumption is a requirement, not a presumption of fact, and has no bearing or weight upon the construction of instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">We are of opinion that the court should have ruled that the defendant was not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
