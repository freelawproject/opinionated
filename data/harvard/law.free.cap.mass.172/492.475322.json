and commanding the defendants forthwith to take down and remove all signs, fittings, or other representations or displays at No. 10 Tremont Row, resembling or imitating the arrangement, signs, fittings, or displays at the plaintiff\u2019s doorway and window at No. 12a Tremont Row;

The judge must be taken to have found as an additional fact that more was not necessary to protect the plaintiff\u2019s rights and could not be granted with justice. We cannot say that such a finding was impossible, and we cannot revise the finding as the evidence is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
