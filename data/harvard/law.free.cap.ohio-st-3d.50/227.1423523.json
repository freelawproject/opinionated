Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E. 2d 420. This determination requires the commission to first consider the medical evidence indicating the claimant\u2019s degree of impairment. If the medical evidence does not establish that the claimant is permanently and totally impaired, the commission must then decide the disability issue \u2014 whether the claimant\u2019s age, education, work record, or any other physical, psychological, or sociological factor forecloses the claimant\u2019s return to the work force. <em>State, ex rel. Lawrence, </em>v. <em>American Lubricants Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 321, 322, 533 N.E. 2d 344, 346, following <em>State, ex rel. Stephenson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E. 2d 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">The court of appeals held that the factors set forth in <em>Stephenson </em>were irrelevant to appellant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation due to Dr. Reynolds\u2019s opinion that she could return to her former job despite her back injury. According to - the court, this opinion allowed the commission to conclude that appellant was able to engage in sustained remunerative employment without considering any possible effect of appellant\u2019s age and work record on her capacity to work generally. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\"><em>Lawrence, supra, </em>holds that the commission cannot declare a partially impaired claimant able to engage in sustained remunerative employment unless it considers evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Stephenson </em>factors and causes its order to reflect this consideration. <em>Lawrence </em>plainly establishes these factors as the foundation for the ultimate determination that must be made before an application for permanent total disability compensation is denied. Thus, contrary to the court of appeals\u2019 holding, evidence of the <em>Stephenson </em>factors is never completely irrelevant where, as here, the claimant is not permanently and totally impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Furthermore, we have said that for the purpose of a permanent total disability determination, examining physicians should confine their opinions to the question of medical impairment <em>{i.e., </em>\u201cthe amount of a claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function\u201d caused by an allowed injury, <em>Stephenson, supra, </em>at 171, 31 OBR at 373, 509 N.E. 2d at 950), and that the question of disability <em>{i.e., </em>\u201cthe effect that the physical impairment has on the claimant\u2019s ability to work,\u201d <em>id.) </em>is for the commission to determine. <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>at 322, 533 N.E. 2d at 346. Nevertheless, the commission determined in this case that appellant was able to return to her former place of employment, and therefore able to engage in sustained remunerative employment solely because of medical evidence. However, since disability is not a proper subject for medical reports, it follows that the commission cannot justify a decision denying permanent total disability by relying entirely on a medical report.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the commission was required to consider the <em>Stephenson </em>factors present in this record and to indicate such consideration in its order. Accordingly, the court of appeals decision is reversed and the commission is ordered to vacate its denial of appellant\u2019s application for compensation for permanent and total disability, and to proceed with her claim in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
