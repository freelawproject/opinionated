Also, the affidavit <em>must </em>contain a statement of alleged facts sufficient to indicate probable cause to believe that the person sought to be confined is a <em>\u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Therefore, by negative implication, if an affidavit is not filed, or if allegations in the affidavit which <em>must </em>be present are lacking, the proceedings for judicial hospitalization are never properly commenced. Accordingly, the threshold issue to be decided is whether the judicial hospitalization proceedings against appellant were properly commenced because, if not, ordering appellant\u2019s detention was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">In the case at bar, Blackwood\u2019s affidavit contained an allegation that! appellant \u201c[w]ould benefit from treatment in a hospital for his [sic] mental illness and is in need of such treatment as manifested by evidence of behavior that creates a grave and imminent risk to substantial rights of others or himself [sic].\u201d R.C. 5122.01(B)(4) contains this exact language and, accordingly, Blackwood specifically set forth a listed category contained in R.C. 5122.01(B) upon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>However, pursuant to R.C. 5122.11, the affidavit <em>must also </em>contain a statement of alleged facts sufficient to indicate probable cause to believe that the person sought to be confined is a <em>\u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order.\u201d </em>As such, R.C. 5122.01(B) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u201c <em>\u2018Mentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u2019 </em>means a mentally ill person who, because of his illness:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><em>t( </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u201c(4) Would benefit from treatment in a hospital for his <em>mental illness </em>and is in need of such treatment as manifested by evidence of behavior that creates a grave and imminent risk to substantial rights of others or himself.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">R.C. 5122.01(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u201c <em>\u2018Mental illness\u2019 </em>means a substantial disorder of thought, mood, perception, orientation, or memory that grossly impairs judgment, behavior, capacity to recognize reality, or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">In his affidavit, Blackwood stated that appellant sent letters to \u201c* * * various official sources such as school principals and agencies * * *\u201d and \u201c[t]he letters appear to show delusional content * * *\u201d focusing on Blackwood\u2019s sexual behavior and criminal conduct. Further, Blackwood stated that appellant was \u201c[Religiously preoccupied \u2014 thinks that God has told her to do certain things outlined in the letters.\u201d Finally, the affidavit contained a statement which apparently alleged that appellant had a history of noncompliance with medications. Apparently, one of appellant\u2019s letters was attached to the affidavit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The affidavit and the letter attached thereto do not substantiate appellant\u2019s alleged religious preoccupation even if we were to assume that the allegation could constitute a basis for involuntary commitment. Nor was any evidence presented in the affidavit that substantiates the alleged history of noncompliance with medication, or that the medications were prescribed and not taken, even if we were to assume that the failure to take medications could constitute a basis for involuntary commitment. Thus, these allegations do not make it probable, or more likely than not, that appellant suffers from a \u201cmental illness\u201d; that appellant would benefit from hospitalization; that appellant is in need of treatment; or that appellant\u2019s activities create a grave and imminent risk to the substantial rights of herself or others <em>(i.e., </em>that appellant is a \u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">Likewise, Blackwood\u2019s allegations that appellant\u2019s letters contain delusional content focusing on Blackwood\u2019s alleged sexual perversions and child molestation, in conjunction with the letter appended to the affidavit, do not constitute probable cause to believe that appellant is a \u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order.\u201d The affidavit contains no allegation that the letters falsely accuse Blackwood. The letters may contain truthful allegations since no evidence was contained in the affidavit that alleged otherwise. Even if the content of the letters is false, the filing of an affidavit alleging mental illness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>not the appropriate mechanism in which to ascertain the truth or falsity of accusations which may or may not be constitutionally protected. Disapproval or disbelief of a person\u2019s statements does not provide an adequate basis for involuntarily committing that p\u00e9rson. Our society oftentimes grants every person the right to be wrong, as the alternative may constitute censorship and promote tyranny.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Therefore, we hold that the jurisdiction of a court may not be invoked by an affidavit alleging that a person is a \u201cmentally ill person subject to hospitalization by court order\u201d under R.C. 5122.01(B)(4) when the factual allegations contained in the affidavit are insufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Appellant argues that R.C. 5122. 01(B)(4) is unconstitutional as being vague and overbroad both on its face and as applied to appellant. However, constitutional issues should not be decided by this court unless absolutely necessary. See, <em>e.g., Hall China Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 206, 210, 4 O.O. 3d 390, 393, 364 N.E. 2d 852, 854. We have found that no probable cause existed to order appellant\u2019s detention based upon the affidavit and the letter appended thereto. Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 5122.11, the court\u2019s jurisdiction was never properly invoked by the facially invalid affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b271-15\">Wright, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> Given the state of the record before us, we are unable to determine how many of appellant\u2019s letters, if any, were attached to the affidavit. However, we will assume that one of the letters entitled \u201cDear Principal\u201d was attached to the affidavit as indicated at the hearing before the referee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> For example, in <em>Desert Sun Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct. </em>(1979), 97 Cal. App. 3d 49, 51, 158 Cal. Rptr. 519, 520-521, it was stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u201c* * * It is an essential part of our national heritage that an irresponsible slob can stand on a street corner and, with impunity, heap invective on all of us in public office. At such times the line between liberty and license blurs. However, our dedication to basic principles of liberty and freedom of expression will tolerate nothing less. The alternative is censorship and tyranny.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u201cOur political history reeks of unfair, intemperate, scurrilous and irresponsible charges against those in or seeking public office. Washington was called a murderer, Jefferson a blackguard, a knave and insane (Mad Tom), Henry Clay a pimp, Andrew Jackson a murderer and an adulterer, and Andrew Johnson and Ulysses Grant drunkards. Lincoln was called a half-witted usurper, a baboon, a gorilla, a ghoul. Theodore Roosevelt was castigated as a traitor to his class, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a traitor to his country. Dwight D. Eisenhower was charged with being a conscious agent of the Communist Conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-16\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7e\">dissenting. I disagree with the court\u2019s holding that no probable cause existed justifying appellant\u2019s detention and examination. Thus, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
