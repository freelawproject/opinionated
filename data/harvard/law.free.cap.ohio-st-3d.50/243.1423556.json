For the reasons which follow, we answer such query in the negative, and affirm the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">In order to determine whether or not appellant is entitled to underinsured coverage we must determine whether the accident involved an underinsured vehicle. In mandating underinsured motorist provisions in every automobile insurance policy, R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\u201cUnderinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for an insured against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, where the limits of coverage available for payment to the insured under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the limits for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage at the time of the accident. The limits of liability for an insurer providing underinsured motorist coverage shall be the limits of such coverage, less those amounts actually recovered under all applicable bodily injury liability bonds \u2022 and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Simply put, the underinsured motorist statute requires an insurer to provide coverage to its insured when the tortfeasor\u2019s coverage is <em>less </em>than the limits of the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Appellant asserts that this case is controlled by the recent decision of this court in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 86, 526 N.E. 2d 1089. In <em>Wood </em>this court held that each wrongful death beneficiary has a \u2022 separate claim, compensable up to the subject insurance policy\u2019s per occurrence underinsured motorist coverage limits, even though the policy limited recovery for all damages for injury or death of one person to a <em>single </em>limit of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\"><em>Wood </em>is distinguishable and not applicable to our determination of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>case. In <em>Wood </em>the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance policy had per person limits of $50,000 and per occurrence limits of $100,000, whereas the plaintiff\u2019s policy in that case had underinsured motorist coverage of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The facts of <em>Wood </em>are not the facts here. At the time of the accident, the tortfeasor here had bodily injury liability coverage of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per occurrence \u2014 the same limits as those of Shaw\u2019s Allstate policy\u2019s underinsurance motorist coverage. Specifically, Shaw\u2019s Allstate policy provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cSS UNINSURED MOTORISTS BODILY INJURY $50,000 EACH PERSON - $100,000 EACH ACCIDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\n<em>\u201cAn uninsured auto is:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">\u201c(5) An underinsured auto which has liability protection in effect and applicable at the time of the accident in an amount equal to or greater than the amounts specified for bodily injury liability by the financial responsibility laws of Ohio, but <em>less than the limits of liability for coverage SS of this policy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">The decedent\u2019s estate was able to recover the full $50,000 to which it was entitled under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Accordingly, pursuant to both the plain meaning of Ohio\u2019s underinsurance motorist statute and the unambiguous terms of the subject Allstate policy, no underinsurance motorist coverage was available to the decedent\u2019s estate here because the \u201climits of coverage available for payment\u201d to the decedent\u2019s estate were not \u201cless than the limits for\u201d the decedent\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage \u201cat the time of the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, as shown in the above analysis, unless otherwise provided by an insurer, underinsured motorist liability insurance coverage is not available to an insured where the limits of liability contained in the insured\u2019s policy are identical to the limits set forth in the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Hagen </em>v. <em>J.C. Penney Cas. Co. </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App. 3d 218, 220, 16 OBR 234, 236, 475 N.E. 2d 177, 179 (In citing <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra, </em>fn. 3, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>held that underinsured motorists liability insurance precludes coverage where the limits of liability of the insured\u2019s policy are <em>identical </em>to the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy.); <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Yoby </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App. 3d 51, 54, 23 OBR 96, 98, 491 N.E. 2d 360, 363 (\u201c[I]n case of inadequate insurance, the underinsurance provision would be triggered, but only if the tortfeasor\u2019s coverage is <em>less </em>than the underinsured policy limits. Under-insured motorist coverage is an option by which an insured may voluntarily predetermine the amount of insurance he desires to protect him in the event of injury by a negligent motorist who has liability insurance in an amount <em>less </em>than that predetermined amount.\u201d); <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App. 3d 74, 75, 514 N.E. 2d 440, 441 (When the limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance coverage and the limits of the injured party\u2019s underinsurance coverage are equal, R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) is not applicable, even though multiple wrongful death claimants are involved.). This is in line with the public policy consideration of assuring that those persons injured by an underinsured motorist would receive at least the same amount of total compensation as they would have received had they been injured by an uninsured motorist. See <em>Ware, supra; James </em>v. <em>Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 386, 389, 18 OBR 440, 443, 481 N.E. 2d 272, 275.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We do not agree with appellant\u2019s argument that she would have been in a superior position if the tortfeasor had carried no liability insurance. While <em>Wood, supra, </em>establishes that wrongful death beneficiaries have separate <em>claims, </em>the policy language here applies the single limit ($50,000) to \u201call damages arising out of\u201d a <em>single bodily injury </em>(no matter how many separate claims may be involved). See <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 11, 540 N.E. 2d 716, paragraph one of the syllabus. The statute clearly permits appellee to contract in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Alternatively, appellant maintains that under this court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Wood, </em>each wrongful death beneficiary has a separate underinsured claim regardless of whether the insured\u2019s policy limits are equal to the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits. Specifically, appellant proposes that \u201c[t]he coverage mandated by R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) does not depend solely upon a comparison between the single person liability policy limits of the tortfeasor and the single person uninsured policy limits of the insured party * * *. Rather, that coverage is determined by a comparison between the portion of the tortfeasor\u2019s limits \u2018available for payment to the insured\u2019 and the limits of the uninsured coverage available to the separate claims of all those who are insureds under the uninsured/underinsured motorist provision of the applicable policy.\u201d We disagree. In effect, what appellant asks this court to fashion is an excess accident insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>provision by judicial fiat. Here, Allstate offered no such provision nor did Shaw contract in reliance on such a provision. Shaw contracted for coverage in the event the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance coverage failed to fully compensate his injuries, so long as the tortfeasor\u2019s limits were below the limits of his own policy. In the case <em>sub judice </em>the limits are equal and thus appellant has received precisely what Shaw contracted for. Moreover, as noted earlier, <em>Wood </em>does not apply where, as a threshold matter, the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage limits are identical to the insured\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage limits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the threshold requirement was not met. Consequently, each wrongful death beneficiary was not entitled to a separate limit of recovery, up to Shaw\u2019s policy\u2019s per occurrence limit for underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, even if we were to assume <em>arguendo </em>that the wrongful death beneficiaries here had separate viable claims under the <em>Wood </em>rationale, they would still be precluded from recovery under the Allstate policy, since their separate claims, if any, should have been filed against Western Reserve, the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. It is of no consequence that the Western Reserve policy limits may have been reached, since there was no underinsurance available to these beneficiaries under the unambiguous terms of the Allstate policy and R.C. 3937.18(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-10\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b297-11\">Sweeney, Douglas and Resnick, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> This same result was reached by a unanimous panel in <em>Buckeye Union Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wallace </em>(Mar. 27, 1981), Lucas App. No. L-80-146, unreported, motion to certify overruled (July 1, 1981), case No. 81-778, where the court construed a similar situation to the one before us in examining an insured\u2019s policy with identical liability limits to the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, and the insured\u2019s damages exceeded the limit on the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. The court denied the insured\u2019s claim, stating: \u201cThe literal terms of the clause state that, for a vehicle to be underinsured, it must carry a lesser limit than the limit imposed by the terms of the policy under which recovery is alleged. In this case the limits on the tortfeasor\u2019s policy were not less than, but equal to, the limit on the appellant\u2019s policy. Thus, by a plain reading of the statute, incorporated into the endorsement, the appellant may not recover under the policy for the tortfeasor\u2019s underinsurance, because, although the tortfeasor may be underinsured in relation to the appellant\u2019s damages, he is not underinsured for the purposes of the statute and policy endorsement. We find the contract clause and statute on this point to be a clear unambiguous statement of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-16\"> Therefore, under both the Ohio underinsured motorist statute and the relevant Allstate policy, there plainly can be no underinsured motorist coverage unless, at the time of the accident, the underinsured motorist limits of liability contained in the insured\u2019s policy are <em>greater </em>than the liability coverage limits of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Here, that was simply not the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\"> A motor vehicle insurance policy could conceivably provide more benefits than those required to be offered by R.C. 3737.18(A)(2); that is, not require that the limits of coverage available from the underinsured motorist be less than those available to the insured under his underinsured coverage. However, in this case Shaw\u2019s Allstate policy defines \u201cunderinsurance coverage\u201d as one where the available bodily injury liability coverage is less than the limits of the underinsured coverage. Thus, this policy does not provide benefits which are greater than those required to be offered under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> See, <em>e.g., Roeser </em>v. <em>Westfield Cos. </em>(June 5, 1986), Cuyahoga App. No. 50661, unreported, motion to certify overruled (Sept. 3,1986), case No. 86-1110 (where an insured\u2019s wife attempted to recover separate underinsured motorist benefits under the insured\u2019s policy for her own injuries resulting from the insured\u2019s accident with an alleged underinsured motorist who had identical coverage to that of the insured, the court held: \u201cThe issue of whether or not a derivative action exists is irrelevant based upon our reliance on <em>Hagen, supra. </em>B\u00e1sed upon the finding that the limits of the two policies are identical, appellants have failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of their policy\u2019s underinsured provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b297-12\">Alice Robie Re snick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_3\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent as the majority misconstrues our holding in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 86, 526 N.E. 2d 1089. I also believe the majority has run afoul of the well-reasoned public policy of this state. As the majority correctly points out, the issue before this court is whether underinsured motorist coverage is available to an insured\u2019s estate on a wrongful death claim, when the insured\u2019s policy limits are identical to the tortfeasor\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">The majority\u2019s recitation of the facts is essentially complete. It should be noted, however, that the decedent (Shaw) was survived by his daughter Linda J. Hill, his son, and his father. Linda J. Hill, appellant herein, is the executor of her father\u2019s estate and filed the present claim in that capacity on behalf of her father\u2019s next of kin. All three of the above persons listed as Shaw\u2019s next of kin are indeed covered under Shaw\u2019s policy with appellee. This policy specifically defines \u201cinsureds\u201d pursuant to the underinsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>motorist coverage provision as follows: \u201cPersons Insured * * * Any person who is legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury to you, a relative who resides in your household, or an occupant of your insured auto.\u201d According to the first portion of this sentence, appellant and Shaw\u2019s other next of kin named in the complaint are thus insureds under the policy issued to Shaw by appellee. This conclusion is further supported by R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u201cAn action for wrongful death shall be brought in the name of the personal representative of the decedent for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, the children, and the parents of the decedent, all of whom are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of wrongful death, and for the exclusive benefit of the other next of kin of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">Appellant and Shaw\u2019s other next of kin are clearly \u201cother person[s] who [are] legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury to [Shaw],\u201d as the policy provides. Therefore, it cannot be questioned that under the policy appellant and Shaw\u2019s next of kin are insured persons who are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages as a result of Shaw\u2019s death. It is of no consequence that appellant or the persons she represents have suffered no physical injuries. The legislative mandate concerning damages is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Having clarified the identity of the appellant in the present case, I will now turn to the merits. R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) mandates that every auto insurance policy issued in Ohio must contain an underinsured provision, and states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u201cUnderinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for an insured against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, where the limits of coverage available for payment to the insured under all bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured are less than the limits for the insured\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage at the time of the accident. The limits of liability for an insurer providing underinsured motorist coverage shall be the limits of such coverage, less those amounts actually recovered under all applicable bodily injury liability bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Appellee contends, and the lower court held, that the underinsured provision in Shaw\u2019s policy does not provide coverage because the tortfeasor\u2019s policy and the insured\u2019s policy contain identical limits: $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. While this argument superficially seems practical, it cannot withstand critical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">In <em>Wood, supra, </em>we held at the syllabus that \u201c[e]ach person entitled to recover damages pursuant to R.C. 2125.02 for wrongful death, and who is an insured under an underinsured motorist provision in an insurance policy, has a separate claim and such separate claims may not be made subject to the single person limit of liability in the underinsured motorist provision. (R.C. 2125.02 and 3937.18[A][2], construed and applied.)\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Therefore, it </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>is clear that appellant\u2019s wrongful death claim is not subject to the $50,000 per person limit. </em>Rather, the claim is subject <em>only to the per accident limit </em>contained in Shaw\u2019s policy, which is in the amount of $100,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This crucial distinction is completely disregarded by the majority without even a word, let alone a thorough analysis. Based on our holding in <em>Wood, supra, </em>it is axiomatic that under Shaw\u2019s policy, appellant is entitled to coverage of up to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy provided payment of $50,000. Because appellant is entitled to coverage of up to $100,000 on her father\u2019s (Shaw\u2019s) policy, the tortfeasor was underinsured for the purposes of appellant\u2019s claim. There were two claimants on the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, who exhausted the limits of that policy. As the majority opinion correctly notes, it is not clear which limit in the tortfeasor\u2019s policy was satisfied <em>(i.e., </em>$50,000 per person or $100,000 per accident). Were there only one claimant filing a claim against the tortfeasor in this case, then the majority\u2019s holding would be correct. Given that scenario, a rudimentary comparison of the policies would suffice. However, that is not the case before this court. We are confronted with multiple claimants who filed claims against the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. According to the majority\u2019s holding today, whenever more than one individual is injured in an automobile accident by a tortfeasor with identical policy limits as that of the injured party, those persons so injured would be better situated if their tortfeasor has no automobile insurance whatsoever.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">R.C. 3937.18(A)(2) speaks in terms of limits \u201c* * * available for payment to the insured under * * * insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured. * * *\u201d The proper comparison is thus between the amount available for payment under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy and the limit contained in the underinsured motorist provision of Shaw\u2019s policy. In situations where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>more than one person is injured by the tortfeasor, the amount available for payment must be the amount actually paid under the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. Therefore, a simple comparison of policy limits is shortsighted, and as demonstrated above cannot withstand our pronouncement in <em>Wood, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">By accepting appellee\u2019s narrow-minded argument, this court has placed the appellant in a worse position than if the tortfeasor had been completely uninsured. For example, suppose Heugatter (the tortfeasor) had no liability insurance whatsoever. Appellant would then simply file a claim for coverage pursuant to the uninsured provision in <em>tier father\u2019s policy. </em>On the authority of <em>Wood, </em>appellant\u2019s claim would be subject to the per accident limit of $100,000. Therefore, appellant and Shaw\u2019s next of kin would receive as payment the full policy limit of $100,000. According to the majority\u2019s holding reached today, they can recover only $50,000. Thus, it is <em>irrefutable </em>that appellant has been placed in a worse situation than if her father had been killed by an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The majority cites <em>James </em>v. <em>Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 386, 18 OBR 440, 481 N.E. 2d 272, and states that its holding \u201cis in line with the public policy consideration of assuring that those persons injured by an underinsured motorist would receive at least the same amount of total compensation as they would have received had they been injured by an uninsured motorist.\u201d In <em>James, supra, </em>we recognized that \u201c[u]nderinsured motorist coverage was first required by statute after the legislature discovered the \u2018underinsurance loophole\u2019 in <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage \u2014 <em>i.e., </em>persons injured by tortfeasors having extremely low liability coverage were being denied the same coverage that was being afforded to persons who were injured by tortfeasors having <em>no </em>liability coverage. * * *\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 389, 18 OBR at 443, 481 N.E. 2d at 274-275. We went on to state that the purpose of underinsured coverage was to \u201c* * * assure that persons injured by an underinsured motorist would receive at least the same amount of total compensation that they would have received if they had been injured by an -uninsured motorist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the above analysis and simple mathematical computations set forth above, it is difficult (if not impossible) to see what public policy consideration the majority is \u201cin line with.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The majority states that it does not agree with appellant\u2019s argument that \u201cshe would have been in a superior position if the tortfeasor had carried no liability insurance.\u201d Given the analysis set forth above and recognizing the result reached by the majority, it is no great wonder that the majority does not provide support for this conclusion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority states that \u201cthe policy language here applies the single limit ($50,000) to \u2018all damages arising out of\u2019 a <em>single bodily </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>injury </em>(no matter how many separate claims may be involved).\u201d This is the <em>exact type of limitation that was struck down in Wood, supra: </em>\u201cEach person entitled to recover * * * for wrongful death, and who is an insured * * * has a separate claim and such separate claims <em>may not be made subject to the single person limit of liability. </em>* * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">I would hold that when determining whether a tortfeasor is underinsured for purposes of a wrongful death claim, the proper comparison is between the amount available for payment <em>(i.e., </em>the amount paid) to the claimant under the tortfeasor\u2019s underinsured motorist coverage provision and the limit of coverage contained in the insured\u2019s policy. Because appellant was entitled to the $100,000 per accident limit in her father\u2019s policy and the amount paid to her from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy was $50,000, appellant has a claim for the remaining amount. The court of appeals\u2019 judgment should be reversed and the cause should be remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b301-7\">Sweeney and Douglas, JJ.., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\"> The validity of <em>Wood, supra, </em>has been <em>unanimously </em>upheld by this court on two different occasions.

The estates of the five passengers would then each assert claims against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company. Most likely, the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company will pay the per accident limit and, hypothetically, award each decedent\u2019s estate $20,000. If each decedent\u2019s individual insurance limits are identical to the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance limits, under the majority\u2019s holding the decedents would not be considered underinsured since their policy limits are identical to the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits. Thus, they <em>all </em>would be better off if the tortfeasor had no liability insurance at the time of the accident. The inequity of the majority\u2019s holding is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Furthermore, assume that three of the decedents carried underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident, while two of the decedents carried insurance limits identical to the tortfeasor\u2019s ($50,000/$100,000). The decedents\u2019 estates with the higher policy limits could, consistent with <em>Wood, swpra, </em>each potentially recover up to the $300,000 per accident limit. However, the estates of the two decedents with policy limits identical to the tortfeasor\u2019s limits would each be limited by the majority\u2019s decision today to the recovery of only $20,000 from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company, a difference of $280,000!</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\"> Considering the ramifications that today\u2019s majority opinion will have on Ohio drivers, it may be wise for the General Assembly to reconsider this issue in conjunction with the public policy of this state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"> The majority cites <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Skolnik </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 11, 540 N.E. 2d 716. However, that case could not be more distinguishable from the present case. <em>Tomlinson </em>involved a cause of action for loss of consortium. The court in <em>Tomlinson </em>was <em>not confronted, with a wrongful death claim. </em>Therefore, the holding in <em>Tomlinson </em>provides no support for the majority\u2019s conclusion, and to suggest that it does completely ignores <em>Wood, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
