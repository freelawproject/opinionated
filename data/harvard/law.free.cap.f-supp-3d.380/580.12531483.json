Having considered the motions and the relevant pleadings, the Court finds that the motions should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The procedurally complex facts of this case provide a textbook example of why parties should inform the Court of related cases. The facts begin with an arbitration and end with the motion pending before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court previously summarized the facts of the parties' arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [Defendant HealthSpring Life &amp; Health Insurance Company, Inc. \"HealthSpring\"] is a Texas corporation that offers \"Medicare Advantage Plans.\" In May 2013, HealthSpring and [THM] entered into an agreement for THM to provide in-home medical services to HealthSpring's Medicare Advantage Members in Texas. In pertinent part, the agreement required THM to provide HealthSpring with completed 360 Comprehensive Assessments Forms (\"360 Forms\"), which contained important medical information regarding HealthSpring's Medicare Advantage Members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 30, 2017, THM submitted a demand for arbitration (\"Arbitration Demand\"), which, among other things, sought fees allegedly owed to them for services THM provided to HealthSpring. Additionally, THM submitted an application for emergency measures of protection, which sought an equitable decree ordering HealthSpring to pay the invoices. The emergency arbitrator declined to award THM such emergency relief and referred the matter to a panel of three arbitrators (the \"Tribunal\") for further proceedings. On February 21, 2017, THM amended its original Arbitration Demand to include, in pertinent part, a claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   During discovery, in connection with its Sherman Act claim, THM sought copies of certain contracts between HealthSpring and THM's competitors. On June 16, 2017, the Discovery Master and Chair of the Tribunal ordered HealthSpring to produce such contracts, but allowed HealthSpring the ability to redact \"commercially sensitive terms.\" As such, HealthSpring produced such contracts in redacted form. On August 7, 2017, HealthSpring requested leave to file a motion for summary disposition on THM's Sherman Act claim. In response to HealthSpring's request, THM implored the Tribunal to reconsider its ruling that allowed HealthSpring to produce the subject contracts in redacted form. The Tribunal, declining to compel HealthSpring to produce the contacts in unredacted form, set an evidentiary hearing for THM to produce evidence in support of its Sherman Act claim. Prior to the hearing, THM withdrew its Sherman Act claim because it did not believe, with the evidence available, it could satisfy its burden of proof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Between October and November 2017, the Tribunal held several evidentiary hearings on the remaining claims. Throughout this time, HealthSpring requested the Tribunal to enter an interim order requiring THM to turn over unreturned 360 Forms in THM's possession. On December 14, 2017, the Tribunal issued an order (\"Order No. 6\") requiring THM to return all undelivered 360 Forms to HealthSpring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Healthspring Life &amp; Health Ins.

The State Court Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HealthSpring believed THM failed to comply with Order No. 6 and, consequently, on January 9, 2018, HealthSpring filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Order and for Injunctive Relief, in addition to, an Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Temporary Injunction to Enforce Arbitration Order in the 219th Judicial District Court of Collin County, Texas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203105655\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On January 12, 2018, the 219th District Court granted a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against THM and ordered THM to comply with the Tribunal's Order No. 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. On January 26, 2018, the 219th District Court converted the TRO into a temporary injunction and confirmed Order No. 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   THM ultimately failed to comply with Order No. 6.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 14, 2018, the Tribunal in the arbitration rendered its Final Award, which denied all of THM's claims against HealthSpring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 20, 2018, HealthSpring filed a Motion to File Under Seal requesting that the 219th District Court file the Tribunal's Final Award under seal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Notably, the Court remanded the first-filed suit to the 219th District Court on\n   <strong>\n    June 25, 2018, at 2:18 p.m.\n   </strong>\n   finding a lack of federal question jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Healthspring Life &amp; Health Ins.

The 90-Minute Window\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the first-filed suit-pending in this Court between April and June 2018-THM filed this case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 22, 2018 (the \"second-filed suit\") (Dkt. #1). In this case, THM petitions the Court to set aside the Final Award entered by the Tribunal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Dkt. #1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   HealthSpring notified Senior United States District Judge Victor Marrero of the Southern District of New York of the first-filed suit, but neither party notified this Court of the second-filed suit (Dkt. #16). Pursuant to the first-filed rule and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Judge Marrero transferred the second-filed suit to this Court on June 18, 2018 (Dkt. #16). The second-filed suit was not administratively transferred until\n   <strong>\n    June 25, 2018, at 3:48 p.m.\n   </strong>\n   (Dkt. #18). During the seven-days between the signing of the order and the administrative transfer, neither party contacted the Court to notify it of the transferred second-filed suit, despite the pending emergency motion to remand in the first-filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above and by sheer coincidence, the Court remanded the first-filed suit to the 219th District Court ninety minutes before the second-filed suit was administratively transferred to this Court.\n   <em>\n    Healthspring Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 4:18-CV-242 (Dkt. #19),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203105655\">\n    2018 WL 3105655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the Court could not consider whether the first and second-filed cases should be consolidated and remanded together. As the parties did not notify the Court of the second-filed suit and because of the unfortunately timed remand, the Court is now faced with parallel proceedings-the first-filed suit in the 219th District Court and the second-filed suit here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Meanwhile, in State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is evident from the briefing that THM has not fared well in the first-filed suit remanded to the 219th District Court. HealthSpring alleges the 219th District Court ordered THM at least five times to produce the 360 Forms (Dkt. #36 at p. 1). In response to this noncompliance, THM states that the 219th District Court \"wielded incarceration as a means to force THM's hand\" by imprisoning Joseph Stroffolino-THM's managing director and majority member-for five days and threatening to imprison THM's counsel (Dkt. #35 at pp. 1-2 n.3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   THM also moved the 219th District Court to vacate the Final Award. The 219th District Court struck and denied THM's motion to vacate and confirmed the Final Award on September 7, 2018 (Dkt. #34; Dkt. #40-1 at p. 23). HealthSpring states that THM has filed an appeal of these orders and THM claims the 219th District Court acted with \"complete disregard for the well-established principles of comity and federalism....\" (Dkt. #35 at p. 1; Dkt. #36 at p. 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Here and Now\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Re-Urge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 23, 2018, THM filed a Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award in the Southern District of New York (Dkt. #6). Pursuant to Local Rule CV-7(j), THM's motion to vacate was rendered moot, subject to re-urging, after Judge Marrero transferred the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On August 31, 2018, THM filed its Motion to Re-Urge THM's Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award (Dkt. #32). HealthSpring filed a response to the motion on September 4, 2018 (Dkt. #33). THM filed a reply in support of the motion on September 11, 2018 (Dkt. #35). HealthSpring filed a sur-reply to the motion on September 13, 2018 (Dkt. #36). Central to the parties' dispute is whether the Court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motions for Leave\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 7, 2019, THM filed a Motion for Leave to Amend Original Petition (Dkt. #44) and a Motion for Leave to Join Additional Parties (Dkt. #46). In its motion to amend, THM seeks leave to add\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims (Dkt. #44 at p. 8). These claims include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   - Claims by THM and Hamilton Fund Management LLC (\"HFM\")-an asset management company-against Judge Scott Becker of the 219th District Court alleging Judge Becker forced THM and HFM in the first-filed suit to produce the 360 Forms in violation of THM and HFM's Thirteenth Amendment rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   - Claims by THM, HFM, and Hamilton Green Crest Fund II L.P. (\"HGCF\")-an investment fund-against Judge Becker alleging Judge Becker failed to afford HFM and HGCF notice and an opportunity to be heard in the first-filed suit before ordering Robert Cutler-THM's Counsel-to produce the 360 Forms\n   in violation of THM, HFM, and HGCF's Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   - Claims by Stroffolino against Deputy Sheriff Amon of Collin County alleging Deputy Sheriff Amon illegally arrested and imprisoned Stroffolino in compliance with Judge Becker's two Capias warrants, issued in the first-filed suit, in violation of Stroffolino's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Dkt. #44 at p. 8; Dkt. #45). In its motion to join additional parties, THM seeks to join HFM, HGCF, and Stroffolino as additional plaintiffs and Judge Becker and Deputy Sheriff Amon as additional defendants (Dkt. #46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   THM filed its motions for leave on January 7, 2019 (Dkt. #44; Dkt. #46). HealthSpring filed responses to the motions on January 22, 2019 (Dkt. #47; Dkt. #48). THM filed replies in support of its motions on January 28, 2019 (Dkt. #49; Dkt. #50).

Therefore, THM explains, because Judge Marrero transferred the case to this Court pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a), Judge Marrero implicitly found that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Alternatively, THM claims that Judge\n   Marrero explicitly addressed subject matter jurisdiction in his order. THM's arguments are incorrect because THM does not account for the \"first-to-file\" rule and THM deliberately misquotes Judge Marrero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   THM provides unpersuasive authority for the proposition that a district court must address subject matter jurisdiction before transferring a second-filed case under \u00a7 1404(a) to the district court where a first-filed case is pending.

Therefore, at least in the Fifth Circuit, a second-filed court should not address subject matter jurisdiction before transferring a case to the first-filed court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court does not examine the Second Circuit's jurisprudence concerning the \"first-to-file\" rule because Judge Marrero expressly left the decision on subject matter jurisdiction to this Court. THM argues that it is \"clear that Judge Marrero\" found subject matter jurisdiction in this case (Dkt. #35 at p. 9). THM quotes Judge Marrero's order in support of its argument, \"there is no dispute that [this action] could have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas.\" (Dkt. #32 at p. 5; Dkt. #35 at p. 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   THM's quotation is misleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The full sentence from the order reads, \"\n   <em>\n    Assuming that the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction over this case\n   </em>\n   , there is no dispute that it could have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas.\" (Dkt. #16 at p. 4) (emphasis added). Contrary to THM's assertion, Judge Marrero assumed subject matter jurisdiction existed, he did not rule on the issue. In fact, in the same paragraph, Judge Marrero cites the similarities between the parties' jurisdictional dispute in this case and the first-filed suit as a reason favoring transfer (Dkt. #16 at p. 3). As Judge Marrero did not rule on subject matter jurisdiction, the issue is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Federal Question Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   THM alleges there is federal question jurisdiction in this case (Dkt. #32 at p. 4). To determine whether federal question jurisdiction exists, courts apply the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule. Looking to the face of THM's well-pleaded petition to vacate, THM does not allege a federally created cause of action establishing federal jurisdiction (Dkt. #1). Instead, THM petitions the Court to vacate the Final Award pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although \u00a7 10 is federally created, it is well-established that \" \u00a7 10 does not create federal subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

These claims center around two events that are connected to the issuance of the TRO and, more generally, the Interim Ruling that was made in the Arbitration: (1) [Deputy Sheriff] Amon's arrest and incarceration of Mr. Stroffolino and (2) [Judge] Becker's order at a hearing on September 6, 2018 directing Mr. Cutler to turn over to HealthSpring [360 Forms] located in Connecticut. The new claims can be summarized as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (1) claims by THM and HFM against [Judge] Scott J. Becker for violating their respective Thirteenth Amendment rights by forcing them, through Mr. Cutler to turn over [360 Forms] pursuant to an unlawful order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (2) claims by THM., HFM and HGCF against [Judge] Becker for violating their respective Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing to afford HFM and HGCF advance notice and an opportunity to be heard before ordering Mr. Cutler to turn over the 360s.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (3) Claims by Mr. Stroffolino against [Deputy Sheriff] Amon for violating his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by illegally arresting and incarcerating him after failing to follow the directives in the two Capias warrants issued by [Judge] Becker.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   These claims are logically related to the underlying Arbitration and THM and the additional proposed plaintiffs should be permitted to assert them in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (Dkt. #44 at pp. 7-8). THM seeks to join HFM, HGCF, and Stroffolino as additional plaintiffs and Judge Becker and Deputy Sherriff Amon as additional defendants (Dkt. #46). Before examining the jurisdictional question, the Court addresses a preliminary matter concerning the Local Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Local Rules: Certificate of Conference\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   HealthSpring claims THM's motions for leave do not comply with Local Rule CV-7(h) and (i) (Dkt. #47 at pp. 10-11; Dkt. #48 at pp. 8-9). Rule CV-7(h) requires parties to \"meet and confer\" before filing a motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   For opposed motions, the substantive component requires, at a minimum, a personal conference, by telephone or in person, between an attorney for the movant and an attorney for the non-movant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In the personal conference, the participants must give each other the opportunity to express his or her views concerning the disputes. The participants must also compare views and have a discussion in an attempt to resolve their differing views before coming to court. Such discussion requires a sincere effort in which the participants present the merits of their respective positions and meaningfully assess the relative strengths of each position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Rule CV-7(i) provides, in part, that parties must state in a Certificate of Conference accompanying their motion that they complied with Rule CV-7(h)'s \"meet and confer\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Clerk of the Court marked THM's motions for leave as deficient because the motions did not contain Certificates of\n   Conference (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Entries of Jan. 7, 2019). THM then refiled its motions for leave with Certificates of Conference (Dkt. #44 at p. 10; Dkt. #46 at p. 10). THM's Certificates of Conference state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CERTIFICATE OF CONFERENCE\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   I hereby certify that Petitioner's Motion [ ] for Leave ... is an opposed motion and that Counsel for the Petitioner has complied with the meet and confer requirement in Local Rule CV-7(h)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     by attempting to contact Counsel for the Respondent by phone and email on January 7, 2019\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Accordingly, discussions have ended in an impasse leaving an open issue for the court to resolve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    /s/ Robert A. Cutler\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Robert A. Cutler\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Dkt. #44 at p. 10; Dkt. #46 at p. 10) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In HealthSpring's responses, HealthSpring's Counsel state they have \"no record of any calls or emails from Mr. Cutler or anyone at THM on January 7, 2019, ... nor did HealthSpring's [C]ounsel have any discussion with Mr. Cutler that ended in an impasse.\" (Dkt. #47 at p. 11; Dkt. #48 at p. 9). In THM's replies to the motion, Mr. Cutler does not confirm that he contacted HealthSpring on January 7, 2019, but instead claims HealthSpring's argument is \"unfounded\" and the parties should not \"engage in a debate of the actions and events that preceded the filing:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   THM notes that HealthSpring's claim that THM did not comply with Local Rule CV-7(h) is unfounded. But rather than engage in a debate over the actions and events that preceded the filing, THM's counsel and HealthSpring's counsel agreed to schedule a telephone conference to unequivocally confirm the parties' respective positions regarding the two pending motions.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     This telephone conference occurred on January 23, 2019\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . At the conference the parties' counsel discussed, among other things, the legal basis for THM's new claims and why THM was seeking to add parties and did not bring claims against Mr. Becker and Mr. Amon in a separate action. Upon discussing these matters, the parties explicitly confirmed that a dispute exists that cannot be resolved without court intervention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Dkt. #49 at p. 5 n.2; Dkt. #50 at p. 5 n.4) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court reminds the parties that the Local Rules require a movant to meet and confer\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   filing a motion, not after an opposing party challenges the movant's compliance with the Local Rules. However, because there is at least a \"debate over the actions and events that preceded the filing,\" the Court will not deny THM's motions for failure to comply with the Local Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Retroactive Supplemental Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even if the Court granted THM's motions for leave, the newly asserted \u00a7 1983 claims could not establish jurisdiction over THM's current \u00a7 10 claim. As explained above, the Court cannot exercise federal question jurisdiction over the \u00a7 10 claim. Therefore, to maintain its \u00a7 10 claim in this Court, THM must establish supplemental jurisdiction over the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Tex. Sept. 3, 2008). However, based on the analysis and holding in\n   <em>\n    Katrina\n   </em>\n   and its cited authority, the Court cannot use THM's newly asserted \u00a7 1983 claims as a jurisdictional hook to retroactively assert supplemental jurisdiction over THM's original \u00a7 10 claim because THM cannot \"create subject matter jurisdiction when none exists.\" Therefore, even if the Court granted THM's motions for leave, the Court could not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over THM's \u00a7 10 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Although not cited by THM, the Fifth Circuit recently summarized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   With regard to federal question jurisdiction, this court has said, in certain contexts, that \"[a] complaint that is defective because it does not allege a claim within the subject matter jurisdiction of a federal court may be amended to state a different claim over which the federal court has jurisdiction\" if the claim \"arises out of the conduct or occurrence set forth in the original complaint.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    16 Front St., L.L.C. v.

THM initially petitioned the Court to vacate the Final Award under \u00a7 10 (Dkt. #1). THM's motion to vacate seeks to set aside the Final Award based entirely on conduct that occurred\n   <em>\n    in or during\n   </em>\n   the arbitration (Dkt. #7). The only constitutional issue presented in THM's motion to vacate is the violation of due process argument against the Tribunal (Dkt. #7 at pp. 35-36). In its motion, THM requests only that the Court vacate the Final Award (Dkt. #7 at pp. 57-58). If THM succeeds on its \u00a7 10 claim and the Court vacates the Final Award, this finding would not affect THM's \u00a7 1983 claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In contrast, THM's \u00a7 1983 claims arise solely from conduct that occurred\n   <em>\n    outside or after\n   </em>\n   the arbitration (Dkt. #44 at pp. 7-8). The constitutional violations alleged in the \u00a7 1983 claims concern the conduct of Judge Becker and Deputy Sheriff Amon, not the Tribunal (Dkt. #45 \u00b6\u00b6 121, 147). THM, and the putative plaintiffs, request exemplary damages as relief for their \u00a7 1983 claims (Dkt. #45 \u00b6\u00b6 145-46, 165). If the plaintiffs succeed on their \u00a7 1983 claims and the factfinder awards damages, this finding would not affect the Final Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Fundamentally, THM hopes to bring two separate suits as one-a \u00a7 10 petition to vacate an arbitration award and a \u00a7 1983 action. In resolving these claims, the Court would need to review separate facts concerning different periods and judicial proceedings, apply different law, and analyze the conduct of distinct parties. As a result, the Court does not find that THM's claims fit within the circumstances described by\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Silicon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516454\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/549/#p559\">\n    886 F.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For all the reasons stated above, the Court cannot exercise federal question or supplemental jurisdiction over THM's \u00a7 10 petition to vacate.

Mr. Appel alone made decisions and signed documents on behalf of the entire Tribunal though he lacked the authority to do so. He denied THM access to pricing information that was significant to THM's Sherman Act claim. He interrupted THM's cross-examination to answer questions for the witnesses and/or convince them to change their answers.

He awarded HealthSpring possession of the Forms without any assessment of the merits of the breach of contract claim or irreparable harm to HealthSpring. He ignored Mr. Daniels' ruling on the pricing terms in the contract. He did all of this while at the same time accepting financial incentives from HealthSpring and its parent company Cigna.\" (Dkt. #7 at pp. 57-58).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
