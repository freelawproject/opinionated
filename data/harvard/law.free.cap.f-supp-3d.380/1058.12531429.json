The court disagrees - construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In Hawaii,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [p]unitive or exemplary damages are generally defined as those damages assessed in addition to compensatory damages for the purpose of punishing the defendant for aggravated or outrageous misconduct and to deter the defendant and others from similar conduct in the future....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   In determining whether an award of punitive damages is appropriate, the inquiry focuses primarily upon the defendant's mental state, and to a lesser degree, the nature of his conduct. In the case of most torts, ill will, evil motive, or consciousness of wrongdoing on the part of the tort-feasor are not necessary to render his conduct actionable. In a negligence action, for example, the defendant may be required to make compensation if it is shown that he failed to comply with the standard of care which would be exercised by an ordinary prudent person, no matter how innocent of desire to harm. In contrast, to justify an award of punitive damages, a positive element of conscious wrongdoing is always required. Thus, punitive damages are not awarded for mere inadvertence, mistake, or errors of judgment....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   While an award of compensatory damages may be sufficient when injury has resulted from well-intentioned, but poorly advised behavior, when the defendant's conduct can be characterized as malicious, oppressive, or otherwise outrageous, a stronger sanction is needed. Imposing punitive damages effectively expresses to the defendant that such conduct will not be tolerated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Masaki v. Gen.
