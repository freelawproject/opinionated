Buzzfeed also seeks CIA records referencing a tweet by President Donald J. Trump that allegedly revealed the existence of the program. The CIA has now moved for summary judgment, arguing that it has properly refused to disclose the existence or absence of records relating to the alleged covert program (a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response\"), and that it has conducted an adequate search for, and performed adequate redactions when releasing, agency records relating to the presidential tweet. Buzzfeed cross-moves for summary judgment solely on the issue of whether the\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was appropriate, arguing that the President's tweet has already made the existence of the program public. Because the Court finds that the President has not revealed the existence of a\n   <em>\n    CIA-led\n   </em>\n   program to arm Syrian rebels, it grants the CIA's motion for summary judgment and denies Buzzfeed's cross motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In its opposition and cross motion, Buzzfeed argues that the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is improper because President Trump officially acknowledged the existence of a covert CIA program of payments to Syrian rebels in his July 24, 2017 tweet. Buzzfeed does not otherwise challenge the CIA's invocation of FOIA Exemptions 1 and 3, the adequacy of the agency's search, or the redaction of information on the two released e-mails. The Court first reviews whether the July 24, 2017 tweet officially acknowledged the existence of the alleged CIA program, and concludes that it did not. The Court next reviews the CIA's invocation of FOIA Exemption 1 and 3, and finally the agency's limited search for records. Because it finds that the agency properly invoked both exemptions and conducted an adequate search for records, the Court grants the CIA's motion for summary judgment and denies Buzzfeed's cross motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to Buzzfeed, the tweet constituted an official acknowledgment of a CIA program of payments to anti-Assad Syrian rebels mentioned in the Washington Post's July 19, 2017 article, and the CIA can no longer refuse to acknowledge the existence or absence of records concerning the program.

Buzzfeed does not argue that President Trump's July 24, 2017 tweet makes clear, on its face, the existence of the covert CIA program (and of records associated to such a program). Rather, Buzzfeed argues that the tweet, both alone and in conjunction with General Thomas's statements at the Aspen Security Conference and the President's interview with the Wall Street Journal on July 25, 2017, leads to the inescapable inference that such a program existed and was run by CIA before the President ended it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. 2-7. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   First, the Court finds that the tweet alone is not sufficiently precise to constitute an official acknowledgment of a CIA program of payments to Syrian rebels. In the tweet, the President stated: \"[t]he Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.\" @realDonaldTrump, Twitter (July 24, 2017, 07:23 PM). Buzzfeed contends that \"[a]ny reasonable person would understand the ... tweet as disclosing that the CIA had made payments to Syrian rebels.\" Pls.' Mem. Supp. 2. While the tweet states that the Washington Post \"fabricated the facts,\" Buzzfeed points out that \"it would not make any sense to describe non-existent payments as being 'massive, dangerous, and wasteful.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Buzzfeed also notes that it would be illogical for the President to accuse the Post of \"fabricat[ing] the facts on\n   <em>\n    my\n   </em>\n   ending massive ... payments\" if there were no payments to end in the first place. Pls.' Mem. Supp. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, Buzzfeed does not explain how the tweet reveals the existence of a\n   <em>\n    CIA\n   </em>\n   program of payments to Syrian rebels-nor can it. The CIA argues that the tweet \"does not link to or otherwise identify any particular article in the Washington Post,\" that it \"does not specify in what respect the Washington Post's reporting is inaccurate,\" leaving it is unclear what program, if any, exists, and in any event that the tweet provides no indication of \"the CIA's involvement in any such program.\" Def.'s Mem. Supp. 11. Without taking a position as to what program, if any, the tweet may have officially acknowledged,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court agrees on the last point. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that a program of covert payments to Syrian rebels existed, the President's tweet did not mention the CIA or create any inference that such a program would be linked to or run by the CIA. The President might have acknowledged the existence of \"massive, dangerous, and wasteful\" payments to Syrian rebels, but he did not mention from which branch of government such payments would have originated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even taking into account the context behind the tweet and assuming it referred to the Washington Post article, the President's characterization of the facts in the article as \"fabricated\" negates any inference that can be drawn from it as to the source of the payments. Because the article asserted that the program was a CIA program, Buzzfeed assumes that the President acknowledged as much, and that his reference to fabricated facts in the article necessarily concerned the details of the program rather than its origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. 6. The Court cannot make such an assumption. At most, the tweet revealed that multiple payments were made by the government\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Syrian rebels, that the President ended those payments, and that the Washington Post incorrectly reported on the payments. Nor is the CIA required to point to \"[an]other agency which would have authority to make payments to rebel groups in foreign countries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.'

The CIA used the search terms \"Trump,\" \"Twitter,\" \"Tweet,\" \"Syria,\" and \"President\" in different combinations, and also ran a search for the full text of the July 24, 2017 tweet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.

The agency does not meaningfully attempt to refute the commonsense conclusion that the President's tweet was in response to the July 19, 2017 article. Similarly, the CIA contends that because the tweet does not specify which facts were fabricated, it could be interpreted to mean that the article fabricated \"the existence of a covert program\" altogether.
