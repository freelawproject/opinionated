Defendants argue that Section (2) of the statute is inseverable from Section (3) and as a result the entire statute is unconstitutional. This argument fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    As a threshold issue, the opinion from\n    <em>\n     Cape Publications\n    </em>\n    is not binding precedent. The issue has never been addressed in a published opinion or by the Kentucky Supreme Court. Thus, Section (3) of KRS 413.249 is still good law. Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.28(4)(c) (unpublished state-court decisions are not binding precedent in any other case in any court of Kentucky). The Court need not determine here whether Section (3) is unconstitutional because, even assuming it is, Section (2) is severable. KRS 446.090 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    It shall be considered that it is the intent of the General Assembly, in enacting any statute, that if any part of the statute be held unconstitutional the remaining parts shall remain in force, unless the statute provides otherwise, or unless the remaining parts are so essentially and inseparably connected with and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is apparent that the General Assembly would not have enacted the remaining parts without the unconstitutional part, or unless the remaining parts, standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the intent of the General Assembly.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    KRS 446.090. The presumption is that if KRS 413.249(3) is unconstitutional, Section (2) will remain in force, unless either: (a) the statute provides otherwise; or (b) Section (2) is so \"essentially and inseparably connected with and dependent upon\" Section (3) that it is apparent the General Assembly would not have enacted Section (2) without Section (3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Neither exception to the presumption of severability applies here. First, KRS 413.249 contains no language stating the statute is not severable. Second, Section (2) is not \"essentially and inseparably connected and dependent upon\" Section (3). Section (3) provides that if the allegations are more than 10 years old, the complaint and case will be sealed until the court does one of three actions: rules on the motion to seal, rules on a motion to dismiss, or rules on a motion for summary judgment (where defendant has moved to seal). The initial sealing of the record provided by Section (3) is intended for the benefit of a defendant. Section (2) provides the 10 year-statute of limitations for civil cases that seek damages arising out of childhood sexual abuse and/or assault. The section is intended to benefit of victims of childhood sexual assault/abuse. The purposes of these sections are different and do not depend on one another. Either section could operate without the other and thus Section (2) is severable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Louisville v.

The legislature's intent to provide an extended statute of limitations for sexual assault or abuse during childhood is obvious from the title, language, and subject matter of Sections (1) and (2). Judge Cunningham reached a similar conclusion in C.F.'s case before its removal to federal court, denying Betts's argument that KRS 413.249 is special legislation:\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    This simply isn't special legislation. As an example, the General Assembly decided to give persons whose personal injury claims arise from a motor vehicle collision two years, rather than one, to file suit. KRS 304.39-230. No binding precedent has declared this unconstitutional as special legislation despite the tens of thousands of cases which have been filed under than longer limitations period. Similarly, KRS 413.249 is a constitutionally legitimate exercise of the legislature's prerogative. Moreover, there is a well-understood basis for concluding that the longer limitations period is both necessary and just for victims of child sexual abuse or assault.

Jan. 11, 2002) (citing the same).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court first looks to the statute.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Section (2) of KRS 413.249 defines\n    the statute of limitations for \"[a] civil action for recovery of damages for injury or illness suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse or childhood sexual assault ...\" Section (1)(a) defines childhood sexual assault as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    an act or series of acts against a person less than eighteen (18) years old and which meets the criteria defining a felony in KRS 510.040, 510.050, 510.060, 510.070, 510.080, 510.090, 510.110, 529.100 where the offense involves commercial sexual activity, 529.110 where the offense involves commercial sexual activity, 530.020, 530.064, 531.310, or 531.320.\n    <strong>\n     No prior criminal prosecution or conviction of the civil defendant for the act\n    </strong>\n    or series of acts\n    <strong>\n     shall be required to bring a civil action for redress of childhood sexual assault\n    </strong>\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Section (1)(b) defines childhood sexual abuse as:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    an act or series of acts against a person less than eighteen (18) years old and which meets the criteria defining a misdemeanor in KRS 510.120, KRS 510.130, KRS 510.140, or KRS 510.150.\n    <strong>\n     No prior criminal prosecution or conviction of the civil defendant for the act or\n    </strong>\n    series of acts shall be required to\n    <strong>\n     bring a civil action for redress of childhood sexual abuse\n    </strong>\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    KRS \u00a7 413.249(1)(a)-(b) (emphasis added). Thus, the statute defines \"childhood sexual assault\" and \"childhood sexual abuse\" as an act against a person less than 18 years old that meets the criteria defining a felony or misdemeanor in certain expressly enumerated criminal statutes. Thus, the plain language supports a finding that the 10-year statute of limitations only applies to claims which involve allegations that fall into one or more of the enumerated offenses.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Kentucky law allows individuals and corporate entities to be criminally liable for the criminal act of another under KRS 501.020 (liability for conduct of another; complicity); KRS \u00a7 502.050 (corporate liability), KRS 506.080 (criminal facilitation). However, KRS 413.249 does not enumerate Kentucky's statutes criminalizing complicity and facilitation. If the legislature had intended for KRS 413.249 to include criminal complicity or facilitation, it would have included those criminal statutes. However, two of the statutes enumerated in Section (1) of KRS 413.249 involve less direct forms of \"childhood sexual assault\": human trafficking ( KRS 529.100 )\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    and unlawful transaction with a minor in the first degree ( KRS 530.064 ). Under KRS 530.064, a person who \"knowingly induces, assists, or causes a minor to engage in ... illegal sexual activity\" is guilty of unlawful transaction with a minor. Here, whether any of the Defendants that have not been alleged to directly carry out sexual assault could fall within an enumerated offense in KRS 413.249, such as the enumerated offense under KRS 530.064, involves questions of fact not appropriate at this stage of the proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Although the Supreme Court of Kentucky has not addressed this issue, it was cited in\n    <em>\n     dicta\n    </em>\n    by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in\n    <em>\n     Roman Catholic Bishop of Louisville v.

Betts moves to dismiss the childhood sexual assault and abuse claims made by B.L. under KRS 413.249, arguing that KRS 413.249 is\n    not a stand-alone tort, but merely creates a specific statute of limitations for claims of childhood sexual assault and abuse.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , [DE 12, at 685].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    KRS 413.249 is part of chapter 413, \"Limitation of Actions\", within the Kentucky Revised Statutes. Although Section (1) the statute defines \"childhood sexual assault\" and \"childhood sexual abuse,\" this is for determining which civil actions the longer statute of limitations in Section (2) of the statute applies. No language in KRS 413.249 suggests that it creates a separate cause of action apart from a claim of sexual assault.

P. 41(b) for violating the Kentucky state court's order sealing the case under KRS 413.249(3). Betts argues that after the state court sealed the case on March 9, 2017, the contents of the complaint were disseminated by N.C.'s former counsel to the community before the state court ultimately unsealed the case on April 10, 2017. [DE 107-1, Betts Mot. Dis. at 4750-52]. Betts was criminally indicted in Jefferson Circuit Court on or around April 12, 2017, in\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Betts\n    </em>\n    , No. 170CR-1041. Betts states that this conduct was willful and in bad faith.

Certainly, dissemination of the contents of the complaint to the public after the case was sealed could be sanctionable conduct. That said, there is no evidence of record establishing when the dissemination occurred in relation to when the case was first sealed, although the timing of the news articles imply it may have occurred after the case was sealed. It also does not appear that Plaintiff was on notice that failure to comply would result in dismissal although counsel should appreciate same. Betts was criminally indicted in Jefferson Circuit Court shortly after N.C.'s case was filed and that matter was part of the public record. And the case was only sealed one month before the court dissolved the seal. Thus, even assuming all factors in favor of Betts, the prejudice suffered is not proportional to the sanction of dismissal. For these reasons, Betts's motion to dismiss N.C.'s case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    <strong>\n     L.

It is well settled under the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that alternative theories of relief can be pled. Rule 8(d)(2) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n    A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones.

Bad faith by the moving party does not appear to be in issue. C.F. has already amended his complaint once without adding this claim against Wood. Wood is not unduly prejudiced as discovery had not started when C.F. sought leave to file the amended complaint and no discovery had taken place. Here, the balance of factors support permitting C.F. to amend his complaint. As a result, C.F.'s motion to file second amended complaint is granted.
