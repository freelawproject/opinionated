Executive Partnership Deferred Compensation Plan (\"EPDCP\") and Liberty Mutual Group Inc. 2012 Executive Partnership Plan (\"EPP\" and, collectively, \"Defendants\" or the \"Plans\"), seeking review of Defendants' adverse benefits determination. Before me are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Because Defendants' adverse benefits determination was without reason and unsupported by substantial evidence, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and Defendants' motion for summary judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The EPP and EPDCP are employee benefits plans sponsored by Liberty Mutual Group Inc. (\"Liberty Mutual\" or the \"Company\"). (EPP \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.9, 14; EPDCP \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the plan administrator for the\n   EPP and EPDCP, Liberty Mutual both evaluates and pays benefit claims. (EPP \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.9; EPDCP \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.10; Foley Dep. 89:22-90:2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the EPP, eligible executives participate in the increase in Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc.'s enterprise value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 13.) Under the EPDCP, eligible executives receive deferred compensation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff was employed at Liberty Mutual for approximately sixteen years, beginning in 1999, and he was a participant in both the EPP and EPDCP during that time. (Defs.' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 2014 to 2015, Liberty Mutual began restructuring the division in which Plaintiff worked, Liberty International Underwriters (\"LIU\"). (Admin. R. 771.) In connection with that restructuring, \"Liberty Mutual retained the global management consulting firm Oliver Wyman to conduct a six-week analysis of the current and potential future organizational structures for LIU.\" (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Nowak Decl. Ex. 8.) During late 2015, unbeknownst to Plaintiff, Liberty Mutual employees exchanged emails discussing a plan to terminate Plaintiff's employment by offering him a retirement package, including one year of severance pay, and they even prepared a script to read to him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bernstein Decl. Exs. G-L.) Liberty Mutual intended to terminate Plaintiff's employment without cause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 9 (conceding that in October 2015 \"Liberty Mutual did not intend to terminate Plaintiff's employment for cause\").) Pursuant to this plan, Liberty Mutual intended to inform Plaintiff on October 15, 2015 that his position had been eliminated and his employment would be terminated, effective immediately. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bernstein Decl. Ex. I.) However, on October 12, 2015, three days before Liberty Mutual intended to terminate his employment, Plaintiff-who was unaware of Liberty Mutual's plans-gave Liberty Mutual notice that he would voluntarily resign, effective two weeks later, on October 26, 2015. (Defs.' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after Plaintiff's departure from Liberty Mutual, he began employment at one of Liberty Mutual's competitors, Aspen Insurance Services U.C. Inc. (\"Aspen\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) At approximately the same time, several other people resigned from Liberty Mutual and began employment at Aspen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Connolly Letter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately two months after Plaintiff's departure from Liberty Mutual, on December 23, 2015, Mary Connolly, a Liberty Mutual employee responsible for Employee Relations and HR Services, sent a letter to Plaintiff (the \"Connolly Letter\"). (Admin. R. 11-12.) The body of the Connolly Letter contained only two sentences: \"As a result of information uncovered after your voluntary resignation on October 25, 2015, we are reclassifying your termination from a voluntary resignation to a termination for cause. As a result, provisions will change under Compensation and Benefits Plans which you participated in as outlined in the attached document.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Under the heading \"EPP/EPDCP,\" the document attached to the Connolly\n   Letter stated: \"In the event of termination for 'cause', participant forfeits all vested and unvested units in the Plan. As a result of termination for cause, $ 971,500 of vested units and investment fund value and $ 299,125 of unvested units has [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] been forfeited.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 15, 2016, Plaintiff responded to the Connolly Letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285-86.) Plaintiff's response, which was addressed to \"Plan Administrator[,] Liberty Mutual [EPP] and [EPDCP],\" expressed that he was shocked to learn that his termination had been reclassified and that Liberty Mutual had determined to forfeit his benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285.) Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2)(ii), (i)(5), and (m)(8), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201024\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), Plaintiff requested several documents to assist in his \"decision as to whether to dispute the adverse benefit determinations set forth in [the Connolly Letter],\" including: \"any and all documents, records and other information that were relied upon in determining to reclassify [his] resignation to a termination for 'cause' \"; \"identification of the specific sections of the Plan on which the adverse benefit determination was based\"; and \"identification of the individual or individuals who made the determination to reclassify [his] resignation to a termination for cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In an email, Ms. Connolly apparently offered to send documents to Plaintiff on or before March 15, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 291.) Plaintiff reiterated his request on February 2, 2016, reminding Ms. Connolly of Liberty Mutual's obligation, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), to provide the documents no later than February 14, 2016 (i.e., within thirty days of his request). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He informed Ms. Connolly that the documents were necessary to his \"appeal of the adverse benefits determinations set forth in [the Connolly Letter].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 11, 2016, Ms. Connolly provided Plaintiff with \"plan documents and summaries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 293.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 19, 2016, without the benefit of many of the documents he requested, including any documents related to the reclassification of his resignation to termination for cause, Plaintiff formally appealed the December 23, 2015 adverse benefits determination in the Connolly Letter (\"February 19 Appeal\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-356.) The February 19 Appeal criticized the Connolly Letter and subsequent communications from Liberty Mutual \"because none of the Plans' Administrators (i) provided [Plaintiff] with the specific reasons or facts underlying their initial adverse benefit determinations or (ii) provided [Plaintiff] with reference to the specific Plan provisions on which such determinations were made.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) The February 19 Appeal also asserted that Plaintiff \"did not engage in any conduct during his employment that would fall under any reasonable definition of the word [cause].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Andrews Letter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Three months later, on May 19, 2016, Lori Andrews, the Vice President of Talent &amp; Enterprise Services at Liberty Mutual, sent Plaintiff a letter in response to the February 19 Appeal (\"Andrews Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 357-61.) The Andrews Letter recharacterized the February 19 Appeal as an \"initial claim for benefits under the Plans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 357.) Ms. Andrews stated that, pursuant to the authority granted to her by the Plans to \" 'construe and interpret the terms' of the EPP [and EPDCP],\" Plaintiff was not eligible for benefits because Liberty Mutual had notified him that \"his termination was classified as a termination for cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 357-59.) The Andrews\n   Letter stated that Ms. Andrews had \"reviewed [Liberty Mutual's] reasons\" for reclassifying [Plaintiff's] departure as a termination for cause\" and that the \"[t]he circumstances surrounding [Plaintiff's] departure and their resulting disruption to the Company's business provide ample evidence that [Liberty Mutual] acted in good faith.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 358.) The Andrews Letter did not provide any additional details concerning the reasons for the reclassification of his resignation. The Andrews Letter identified \u00a7\u00a7 7.5 and 9 of the EPP and \u00a7 8.5 of the EPDCP as the sections pursuant to which Plaintiff's benefits had been denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 358-59.) The letter also instructed that, if Plaintiff wishes to submit \"a petition for review,\" such petition must be delivered to \"Melanie Foley, Executive Vice President, Chief Talent and Enterprise Services Officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 360.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff responded to the Andrews Letter one week later, on May 26, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 361-64.) Having still not received many of the documents and information he requested in his January 15, 2016 letter, Plaintiff reiterated his requests, noting that it was his fifth request for the documents, and Plaintiff reminded Liberty Mutual of its obligation under the United States Department of Labor's ERISA claims-procedure regulation (\"ERISA Procedures Regulation\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to provide the materials he had requested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. 361-64 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(2)(ii), (i) 5, (m)(8), (b)(5).) In response to the Andrews Letter's vague statements regarding the reasons for the reclassification of Plaintiff's resignation as a termination for cause, Plaintiff also requested additional documents, such as \"[a]ny and all correspondence between [Liberty Mutual] and the plan administrators of the Plans pertaining to [Plaintiff's] termination,\" \"documents, records and other information pertaining to [Ms. Andrews'] review of '[Liberty Mutual's] reasons for classifying [Plaintiff's] departure as a termination for cause,' \" and \"documents, records and other information pertaining to the 'circumstances surrounding [Plaintiff's] departure and their resulting disruption to [Liberty Mutual's] business.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 362-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Ms. Andrews sent a letter (\"Andrews Follow-Up Letter\") in response to Plaintiff's May 26, 2016 letter, and stated that she was attaching the requested documents \"to the extent they fall within the plan administrator's obligations, the documents exist, and the documents have not previously been produced to [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 868-69.) The Andrews Follow-Up Letter attached a document that appears to be a printout from Liberty Mutual's human resources portal for Plaintiff, stating that the \"Leaving Reason\" is \"Co Initiated-Policy Violation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873.) The Andrews Follow-Up Letter also attached handwritten notes that appear to have been taken on May 3, 2016 (\"May 3 Notes\"), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 871-72), and May 12, 2016 (\"May 12 Notes\"), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 870).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Andrews Follow-Up Letter did not attach any documents that preceded the December 23, 2015 Connolly Letter. It is difficult to determine from the face of the May 3 Notes who took them or where they were taken, and the Andrews Follow-Up Letter did not identify whose notes were being produced. The May 3 Notes include several\n   names at the top: \"Brendan, Malik, Nancy Ross +2 (Nick &amp; Stephanie Gonsalves)[,] Nancy Keating,\" and they include the question, \"What lead [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to the reclassification to term for cause[?]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In apparent response to that question, the notes state, \"2015 performance related to legacy reserving &amp; shrinking[.] LOB that had grown irresponsibly - not cat losses more reducing LOB &amp; hemorraging [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] &amp; see Incentive results - attrib to David C. leadership, not cat related w/out [indecipherable] had a loss; 10% of planned PTOI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871.) The May 3 Notes also state, \"Cohen did not accept actuaries reserving judgment &amp; indication on reducing LOB exposure; Cohen felt actuaries were exaggerating cost\"; \"Cohen 'retired' &amp; then Vaughn resigned, exodus began w/ some disclosing &amp; other not\"; \"over 4-6 weeks, 25 people left to go to Aspen\"; \"financial damage pre-leaving; &amp; damage, &amp; havoc\"; \"staff loss in waves\"; \"term for cause related to his leaving &amp; taking all those people &amp; doing severe damage to our business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 872.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The May 12 Notes state at the top, \"Met w/ Chris, Lisa Pereira took notes; LBA added based on meeting content.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 870.) It appears, therefore, that one person took the notes, and Ms. Andrews later revised them. The notes are titled, \"Chris P. - LIU US Impact to Business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those notes included the following statements: \"DC Leaving and direct solicitation is concern\"; \"emergency summit in NY[,] ... brought all global people together to figure out how to address staff loss\"; \"DC - 3rd party business\"; \"market perception/reaction\"; \"Insurance 'insider' - Regular stories on poaching - impacted mkt perception\"; and \"\n   <em>\n    DC leaving &amp; taking so many team members\n   </em>\n   demanded significant &amp;\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   attention from mgmt. to preserve and keep the business\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Foley Letter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 21, 2016, Plaintiff formally appealed to Ms. Foley the determinations made in the Andrews Letter (\"July 21 Appeal\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   365-799.) Among other reasons for his appeal, Plaintiff argued that the Andrews Letter \"[did] not define ... the meaning of the term 'cause' under either [the EPP or EPDCP], nor [did it] identify any specific conduct by [Plaintiff] to support her decision, other than vague and unspecified references to 'circumstances' and 'disruption.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 367.) Plaintiff also noted that under the terms of both Plans, a reclassification required \" '\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   ... after employment termination that a Participant acted or failed to act in such a manner that would have provided grounds for a 'cause' termination[,]' \" and argued that the Andrews Letter did not \"specify - or even address - what evidence supposedly justified the reclassification of [Plaintiff's] retirement as a termination for cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 368 (quoting EPP \u00a7 7.5 and EPDCP \u00a7 8.5).) Plaintiff argued that this omission was a violation of the Plans, which require a denial of benefits to include the \"specific reasons for such denial.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing EPP \u00a7 13.2(a) and EPDCP \u00a7 17.2(a) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The July 21 Appeal also asserted that Plaintiff had not engaged in any conduct constituting \"cause\" under any reasonable definition of the term. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff attempted to address the apparent reasons for the reclassification that were stated in the May 3 and May 12 Notes, such as\n   \"term for cause related to his [Cohen] leaving and taking all those people and doing severe damage to our business\" and \"DC leaving and taking so many team members demanded significant immediate attention from mgmt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff interpreted those notes to \"presumably refer[ ] to the other employees who left [Liberty Mutual] after [Plaintiff] left[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 369), and he responded that he \"did not recruit or solicit any [Liberty Mutual] employees - either during or after his retirement from [Liberty Mutual].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of this assertion, Plaintiff attached to the July 21 Appeal an affidavit from himself and thirty-one additional affidavits-one from each of the Liberty Mutual employees who joined Aspen in the period following Plaintiff's retirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    747-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The July 21 Appeal criticized the Plans' administrators for failing to provide several documents that he had requested related to the reclassification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371.) Additionally, he requested the \"names of every individual employed by [Liberty Mutual] whom [Plaintiff] allegedly solicited or recruited, and any and all documents or other information supporting that incorrect speculation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 15, 2016, Ms. Foley sent a letter response to Plaintiff's July 21 Appeal (\"Foley Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 800-67.) The Foley Letter identified the provisions of the Plans under which Plaintiff's benefits were denied-\u00a7\u00a7 7.5 and 9 of the EPP and \u00a7 8.5 of the EPDCP-and explained that \"when [Liberty Mutual] ... makes the determination that an employee's behavior warrants a termination for cause, benefits under the two plans are forfeited. The plans do not authorize the plan administrators to override that decision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 801.) Ms. Foley stated that she had \"further investigated the circumstances giving rise to the termination for cause[,]\" and that she had spoken with the \"[Liberty Mutual] officers who made or were involved in the decision,\" although she did not identify them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also stated that she \"reviewed evidence supporting their concerns with the business disruption and tainted [Liberty Mutual] reputation caused by [Plaintiff's] departure,\" although she did not attach, identify, or explain the evidence she reviewed or the nature of the disruption or reputational damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Foley concluded that \"sufficient evidence supports [Liberty Mutual's] decision\". (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Foley asserted that Plaintiff's departure was not reclassified \"based solely on the substantial number of employees that joined him at his subsequent employer[;]\" rather, it was \"based on evidence of the overall disruption and harm to the business caused by [Plaintiff],\" but it did not explain \"the overall disruption and harm\" that Plaintiff caused, or how Plaintiff's conduct that allegedly led to that disruption and harm qualified as misconduct that could lead to a reclassification of a resignation as a termination for cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Foley stated that Plaintiff's \"contention that the plan administrator must provide evidence to justify the reclassification\" was \"misfocused,\" based on Ms. Foley's interpretation of \u00a7 7.5 of the EPP and \u00a7 8.5 of the EPDCP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Ms. Foley explained that Plaintiff had the right to bring a civil action under \u00a7 502(a) of ERISA within one year of the Foley Letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 804.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on December 1, 2016. (Doc. 1.) On December 19, 2016, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint. (Doc. 19.) On February 15, 2017, the parties appeared for a conference, during which I ordered that certain limited discovery could be taken. (Doc. 27.) On December 7, 2017, after the competition of discovery, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 65), along with a\n   memorandum of law in support, (Doc. 67), a Rule 56.1 Statement, (Doc. 66), and a declaration with exhibits, (Doc. 72). On the same day, Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, (Doc. 68), a memorandum of law in support, (Doc. 71), a Rule 56.1 Statement, (Doc. 70), and a declaration with exhibits, (Doc. 69).

(Defs.' Opp'n 4-8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants' argument lacks merit and is contracted by the Connolly Letter itself. In short, Defendants argue that a letter notifying Plaintiff that Liberty Mutual had determined that his benefits would be terminated was not an adverse benefits determination. I find that Defendants' reading of the letter is simply not credible since the letter explicitly referenced that Plaintiff's benefits are being terminated because the termination of his employment was reclassified to be for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' argument that \"Ms. Connolly was not acting on behalf of the Plans\" is equally unpersuasive. First, nowhere in the letter does Ms. Connolly state that she was not acting on behalf of the Plans, or that she was acting in some other capacity. Second, Ms. Connolly explicitly discussed in the letter an action taken that negatively impacted Plaintiff's benefits. Specifically, the Connolly Letter states that Plaintiff's termination was being reclassified \"from a voluntary resignation to a termination for cause,\" resulting in the change in his compensation and benefits outlined in the attached document, which, in turn, stated that \"[i]n the event of termination for 'cause', participant forfeits all vested and unvested units in the Plan. As a result of termination for cause, $ 971,500 of vested units and investment fund value and $ 299,125 of unvested units has [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] been forfeited.\" (Admin. R. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With regard to the need for Plaintiff to have made an affirmative claim for benefits, Defendants do not cite a single case in which a court has found that an affirmative claim must precede an adverse benefits determination, and they fail to adequately distinguish the case on which Plaintiff relies,\n   <em>\n    Infantolino v. Joint Industry Board of the Electrical Industry\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-CV-00520 (JG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20879415\">\n    2007 WL 879415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2007). In\n   <em>\n    Infantolino\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected a similar argument because an adverse benefits determination \"includes termination of a benefit ... 'including any such termination of, or failure to provide or make payment that is based on a determination of a participant's or beneficiary's eligibility to participate in the plan.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202560.503-1\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.503-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(4) ). Under the terms of the Plans, the administrator was Liberty Mutual, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EPP \u00a7 2.1, 2.9; EPDCP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.10), and therefore Plaintiff could reasonably construe any communication from Liberty Mutual-here from a Liberty Mutual employee with the title VP and Manager, Employee Relations and HR Services-related to the forfeiture of his benefits as an adverse benefits determination under the Plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, under the language of the Plans themselves, the Connolly Letter was obviously an action taken pursuant to the Plans. Section 7.5 of the EPP and \u00a7 8.5 of the EPDCP (the \"For-Cause Sections\") contain almost identical language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision ..., if [Liberty Mutual] ... terminates a Participant's employment for \"cause\", [Liberty Mutual] shall immediately forfeit all of such Participant's [benefits] regardless of whether such awards had previously become vested.... In the event that evidence is acquired after employment termination that a Participant acted or failed to act in such a manner that would have provided grounds for a 'cause' termination, then [Liberty Mutual] shall have the right to immediately forfeit any then outstanding [benefits] and/or recover any amounts received (determined on a before-tax basis) by such Participant....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The first sentence of the For-Cause Sections contemplates a circumstance in which a plan participant's employment is terminated for cause by Liberty Mutual. It is undisputed that this sentence does not apply to Plaintiff, because Liberty Mutual did not terminate his employment; he terminated his own employment when he voluntarily resigned. Accordingly, Plaintiff's benefits must have been denied pursuant to the second sentence, which addresses the circumstance where Liberty Mutual purportedly acquired evidence that could have supported the termination of Plaintiff's employment for cause. In this circumstance, Liberty Mutual has \"the right to immediately forfeit\" claimant's benefits. (EPP \u00a7 7.5; EPDCP \u00a7 8.5.) Defendants, who argue that the Connolly Letter was an employment action and not an action taken pursuant to the Plans, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 1; Defs.'

This apparent conclusion that there was no basis to terminate Plaintiff's employment for cause is inconsistent with Liberty Mutual's December 23, 2015 determination-after Plaintiff had already voluntarily resigned-that his departure should be reclassified as a termination for cause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. 11.)

Notwithstanding the several procedural irregularities in Defendants' review of Plaintiff's claim for benefits,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.2, I review the Plans' adverse benefits determination under the deferential arbitrary-and-capricious standard.

Whether Ms. Connolly was authorized to make this determination under the Plans or company policy is of no moment, because Ms. Andrews and Ms. Foley subsequently affirmed and reaffirmed that determination in their own letters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. 357-60, 800-04.) Ms. Foley attempted to distance her review of Plaintiff's benefits denial from the determination in the Connolly Letter because \"it is [Liberty Mutual], not the plan administrator, who determines whether cause exists in classifying an employee's termination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 802.) This statement ignores the plain terms of the Plans, which state that Liberty Mutual is the plan administrator, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   EPP \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.9; EPDCP \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 2.10); in other words, for all intents and purposes they are one in the same.

As an initial matter, Defendants offer no authority in support of the position that I should not review the reasonableness of the decisions underlying the initial adverse benefits determination. To the contrary, courts often consider each decision made by plan administrators throughout an ERISA claims procedure.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

Opp'n 16.) I have already explained why Defendants' determination that they had evidence demonstrating that Plaintiff's conduct could have provided grounds for a for-cause termination was an action taken pursuant to the Plans, and that their attempt to distinguish that determination from the adverse benefits determination therefore fails.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.2. I have also already explained that Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff with the procedures-purportedly distinct from the benefits review procedures-to seek review of the Connolly Letter's for-cause determination was an example of deceptive conduct that indicates a likelihood that Defendants' conflict of interest may have impacted the adverse benefits determination.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part IV.B.2. I further find that, to the extent Defendants did incorrectly construe the Connolly Letter as an employment decision and not a benefits decision, their failure to comply with their own policies regarding for-cause terminations is further evidence that the adverse benefits determination was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Manager Policy Manual, which was not provided to Plaintiff and is not a part of the Administrative Record, sets forth the policies and procedures that govern discipline, probation, and terminations for cause at Liberty Mutual. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nowak Decl. Ex. 6.) Other than in exceptional circumstances, Liberty Mutual addresses poor performance using a system of progressive discipline, beginning with warning, proceeding to probation, and ending with job action. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1705, \u00a7 1715 (\"In most cases, employees whose performance is unsatisfactory will be counseled in accordance with [\u00a7] 1705 - Discipline &amp; Probation Procedure.\").) The Manager Policy Manual also contemplates circumstances in which \"performance failures are so severe\" or \"employee misconduct [is] so serious, that they may, in the judgment of the management, warrant the employee's termination\n   upon the first occurrence.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1705.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Section 1715, which governs for-cause terminations, requires that, in all situations, \"the employee's actions or behaviors should be investigated and/or verified\" because \"it is especially important that management's decisions be based on a complete understanding of the relevant facts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also instructs that \"[w]here appropriate and practical, the employee should be afforded an opportunity to address all allegations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Manager Policy Manual provides that immediate termination \"should occur only after confirmation of the inappropriate actions or behaviors\" and must be authorized by the Home Office Employee Relations.

R. 801.) Ms. Foley clarified that, contrary to the reasons stated in the May 3 and May 12 Notes, Plaintiff's termination was not \"based solely on the substantial number of employees that joined him at his subsequent employer\"; rather, it was \"based on evidence of the overall disruption and harm to the business caused by [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 802.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The only evidence identified in the Foley Letter-other than Ms. Foley's conversations with unidentified Liberty Mutual officers\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   -are the \"notes provided by [Ms.] Andrews.\" The May 3 and May 12 Notes are unreliable for several reasons: (1) the Notes were taken during meetings held almost four months after the reclassification decision had been made in the Connolly Letter; (2) to the extent that the Notes appear to include statements about the performance of Plaintiff's division before and after his departure, those statements are vague and are not accompanied by supporting documents or data that would provide Plaintiff any meaningful opportunity to rebut the evidence and allegation of poor performance; (3) to the extent that the Notes appear to include statements about the performance of Plaintiff's division before and after his departure, those statements are contradicted by Liberty Mutual's own determination prior to Plaintiff's resignation that it would terminate his employment without cause and provide him with at least one year's severance, (Defs.' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 12); and (4) to the extent that the Notes appear to include statements that imply that the reclassification decision was based on Plaintiff's solicitation of other Liberty Mutual employees, that reason is rebutted by an affidavit submitted by Plaintiff and affidavits from thirty-one other former Liberty Mutual employees, (Admin. R. 747-83). For those reasons, I hesitate to refer to the May 3 and May 12 Notes as even a \"scintilla\" of evidence; they certainly are not substantial evidence of the type that \"a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the administrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Durakovic,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692051\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/133/#p138\">\n    609 F.3d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As the final decisionmaker, Ms. Foley stated that the reason for the adverse\n   benefits determination was \"concerns with the business disruption and tainted [Liberty Mutual] reputation caused by [Plaintiff's] departure,\" the \"overall disruption and harm to the business caused by Plaintiff,\" and other \"problems and issues resulting from [Plaintiff's] departure.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. 801-02.) If there was any \"disruption\" at Liberty Mutual before or after Plaintiff's departure, there is no reliable evidence in the record-either in the Administrative Record or in the exhibits provided in support of the parties' motions-demonstrating specifically what that disruption entailed. More importantly, Defendants did not provide any evidence that the disruption was a result of Plaintiff acting or failing to act \"in such a manner that would have provided grounds for a 'cause' termination,\" as required by the Plans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPP \u00a7 7.5; EPDCP \u00a7 8.5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the contrary, when asked if she \"ever saw any evidence of actual wrongdoing by [Plaintiff],\" Ms. Connolly, who made the reclassification decision, testified, \"Thinking about it.

In addition, the fact that evidence is not only required by the ERISA Procedures Regulation but is also an express requirement of the specific sections of the Plans on which the denial was based, (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692051\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/133/#p138\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), the absence of any reliable evidence on which the adverse benefits determination could be based is all the more troubling, and also demonstrates that the denial was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants argue that because the Plans give the administrator the authority in its discretion to \"construe and interpret the terms of the Plan[s], (EPP \u00a7 3; EPDCP \u00a7 3), that Ms. Foley's interpretation of the For-Cause Sections generally, and the word 'cause' specifically, is not subject to review,\" (Defs.'
