(\"IEF\") moves to dismiss Counts II, III, and IV for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for failure to join a party under Rule 19. (ECF No. 21.) In the alternative, IEF moves for a more definite statement.

(Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 1-2 at 7.) In March 2017, Plaintiff merged with The Study Abroad Foundation, Inc. (\"SAF\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) As the surviving entity, Plaintiff owns all SAF's assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 31, 2017, Plaintiff and its affiliates acquired SAF-IUNS, a Hong Kong company engaged in the recruitment of students in China exclusively on behalf of SAF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff relies on the goodwill it generates through its representatives' contact with universities and member schools in the United States, China, and elsewhere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Plaintiff maintains strict confidentiality of sensitive student information, member school information,\n   business information, program leads, and other information.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Chen had access to confidential information about SAF and its sending and receiving schools, which information included customer leads, enrollment histories, pricing information, strategies, discounts provided and received, employee information, student information, and primary contact information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) Chen further had access to SAF's marketing plans, recruiting methods, pricing information, strategies, enrollment figures, enrollment histories by institution, key school contacts, exclusive recruiting agreements and their terms, student information, employee information, customer lists, customer leads and information, revenues, programs, program costs, program margins, overall margins, cost information, commission information, markups, and know-how. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As SAF's Executive Director, Chen visited the offices of SAF-IUNS and met its employees, including Daniel Shen (\"Shen\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Chen was aware that Shen's employment agreement with SAF-IUNS included a two-year non-compete agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As Executive Director, Chen had contact with SAF's and SAF-IUNS's key contacts and primary customer representatives at their member schools in China, their sending schools in China, and their receiving schools in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere.

The agreements provide that Chen be paid $ 30,833; that Chen not return to SAF's or its affiliates' property; and that Chen keep SAF's confidential information secret for five years.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18.) There they met with SAF-IUNS employees, attempted to recruit the employees to Chen's and Shen's new companies, falsely told the employees that Plaintiffs would terminate all employees upon acquiring SAF-IUNS, and dissuaded the employees from meeting with Plaintiff's representatives to discuss the acquisition.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20.) As part of this effort, Chen and IEF induced SAF-IUNS employees to use confidential information, to create an IEF website using SAF-IUNS resources, and to create and use deceptive email addresses.

But it also contains substantive allegations tending to show the absence of justification, which allegations IEF's argument wholly ignores.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    To determine whether interference with a contract is justified, Indiana courts consider the following factors:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    (a) the nature of the defendant's conduct;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    (b) the defendant's motive;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (c) the interests of the plaintiff with which the defendant's conduct interferes;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the defendant;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the defendant and the contractual interests of the plaintiff;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (f) the proximity or remoteness of the defendant's conduct to the interference; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    (g) the relations between the parties.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     Winkler v.

At this stage, Plaintiff has pleaded enough facts to support its contention that IEF acted without justification. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that IEF interfered with Plaintiff's exclusive recruiting contract with SAF-IUNS by commandeering SAF-IUNS employees, offices, email accounts, and other resources to recruit on behalf of IEF and interfered with Plaintiff's business relationships with its university partners and member schools by using the confidential information, the commandeered SAF-IUNS employees, and other resources to solicit business from those university partners and members schools.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    IEF further contends that Plaintiff has pleaded itself out of court by alleging that IEF interfered with the contracts and business relationships to compete with Plaintiff. But competition justifies interference only if, among other things, \"the actor does not employ wrongful means.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Computs.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Unlimited, Inc. v.

Illegal act\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    IEF argues that Plaintiff's claim for tortious interference with a business relationship fails because Plaintiff does not allege an illegal act.

But Plaintiff's allegations also support the inference that Chen and IEF conspired to misappropriate Plaintiff's confidential information, used that information to engage in unfair competition, and induced SAF-IUNS employees to breach their fiduciary duty to their employer.

A subsequent suit by Plaintiff against the nonparties could very well subject\n    <em>\n     the nonparties\n    </em>\n    to obligations inconsistent with obligations imposed on\n    <em>\n     the parties\n    </em>\n    in this matter. For example, it is possible that Chen is found not liable in this case but Shen, Chen's alleged joint tortfeasor, is found liable in a subsequent case to which Shen is a party. But Rule 19(a)(1)(B) does not address such inconsistencies. Rather, it addresses inconsistent obligations imposed on\n    <em>\n     an existing\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     party\n    </em>\n    -typically, those instances where one judgment requires the defendant to convey some\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    to X and another judgment requires the defendant to convey that same\n    <em>\n     res\n    </em>\n    to Y. IEF's argument does not raise any plausible concern that any\n    <em>\n     existing party\n    </em>\n    to this suit would be subject to substantial risk of inconsistent obligations because the nonparties have not been joined.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Accordingly, IEF's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(7) is\n    <strong>\n     denied\n    </strong>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
