NATHAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action concerns Defendant Humana at Home, Inc.'s (\"Humana\") alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and New York Labor Law (\"NYLL\") with respect to overtime payments and wage statements owed to its\n   home health aide employees. Plaintiff Molly Green has moved to certify a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) for Humana's alleged overtime and wage notice violations under the NYLL. Dkt. No. 47. In light of events in a parallel proceeding, Green's motion is administratively denied with leave to refile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Also pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Dkt. Nos. 53; 65. For the reasons that follow, Humana's motion for summary judgment is DENIED and Green's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background on Class Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court begins by addressing background matters pertinent to the class certification motion and resolving that motion before turning to the pending motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Regulatory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This action concerns the Department of Labor's (\"DOL\") decision to remove a longstanding FLSA exemption for third-party agencies employing home health care workers. This new regulation, adopted in 2013 and assigned an effective date of January 1, 2015, provided that such agencies were no longer exempt from the FLSA's overtime and minimum wage provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060%2C454\">\n    78 Fed.

On December 22, 2014, the District Court for the District of Columbia declared this rule invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Care Ass'n of Am. v.

Cir. 2015) (\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   ). The DOL appealed this decision and on August 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the district court and held that the rule was valid.\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173194,4340423\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1084/\">\n    799 F.3d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mandate issued in that opinion on October 12, 2015. Pursuant to policy statements issued both in the fall of 2014 and after each development in the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation, the DOL informed employers that it would not enforce the regulation until November 12, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 56-1, Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service; Announcement of Time-Limited Non-Enforcement Policy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2060%2C974\">\n    79 Fed.

Pt. 552) (\"Oct. 2014 Policy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Many civil actions arose out of the third-party employer rule and the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation, including two at issue here: the action presently pending before this Court,\n   <em>\n    Green v. Humana at Home\n   </em>\n   ; and an action filed in Connecticut,\n   <em>\n    Kinkead v. Humana, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-1637 (JAM) (D. Conn.). In slightly different configurations, both of these actions allege overtime claims against Humana as of the effective date of the third-party employer rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Green v. Humana at Home\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Green filed this action on September 28, 2016 alleging that she was entitled to overtime payments under the FLSA and the NYLL and corresponding wage statements and spread-of-hours payments under the NYLL over the period from January 1, 2015 through November 12, 2015 as a result of the third-party employer rule. Dkt. No. 1. Under the logic that New York overtime requirements are generally \"subject to the exemptions\" of the FLSA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gold v. New York Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702388\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/137/#p145\">\n    730 F.3d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (2d Cir. 2013), her action asserted overtime claims under both the FLSA and the NYLL arising out of the same rule change and over the same period. Green initially sought to bring these claims on behalf of herself, a FLSA collective, and a Rule 23(b)(3) class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 2, 2016, Humana moved to dismiss Green's complaint on the grounds that the third-party employer rule did not go into effect until the date on which the DOL began enforcing the rule (November 12, 2015) or, in the alternative, the date on which the D.C. Circuit's mandate issued (October 12, 2015).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 14 at 7-14. Applying \"the general rule that all civil judicial decisions apply retroactively,\" the Court denied Humana's motion and held that the third-party employer rule should be treated as effective beginning on January 1, 2015, and therefore held that Green had stated a plausible claim for relief. Dkt. No. 32 at 7, 19, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 20, 2018, Green filed a motion to certify a Rule 23(b)(3) class of Humana home health aides based on two of her class claims: (1) her NYLL unpaid overtime claim and (2) her NYLL wage statements claim. Dkt. No. 47; Dkt. No. 48 at 8. Pursuant to a briefing schedule entered by the parties, Green then filed a motion for partial summary judgment on April 26, 2018, followed by Humana's motion for summary judgment on June 8, 2018, with briefing on all three motions completed on January 18, 2019. Dkt. Nos. 53, 65, 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Kinkead v. Humana, Inc.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 10, 2015, nearly one year in advance of the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   action, Humana home care worker Daverlynn Kinkead filed suit in the District of Connecticut alleging that she was entitled to overtime payments under the FLSA and the Connecticut Minimum Wage Act over a period beginning January 1, 2015. Ct. Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 48-54. Kinkead sought to bring these claims on behalf of herself, a FLSA collective, and a Rule 23(b)(3) class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 8, 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   court conditionally certified a nationwide FLSA collective. Ct. Dkt. No. 114. Out of 941 notice recipients, 189 Humana home health aides opted into the collective, including 42 New York home health aides. Dkt. No. 59-1 at 1-2. On September 19, 2017, Kinkead moved to amend her complaint to add Claude Mathieu, a New York home health aide, and two claims under the NYLL: (1) as of January 1, 2015, an \"effective date\" overtime claim parallel to the preexisting FLSA and Connecticut overtime claims; and (2) for the period prior to January 1, 2015, an \"unpaid hours\" overtime claim alleging that Humana failed to credit home health aides for the minimum number of hours of work mandated by the NYLL when they worked 24-hour or live-in shifts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 59-1 at 2; Ct. Dkt. No. 170; Ct. Dkt. No. 181 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 39-40, 71-73. Ms. Mathieu characterizes her effective date overtime claim as a class action on behalf of New York home care workers working between January 1 and October 23, 2015; and her unpaid hours overtime claim as a class action on behalf of New York home care workers who worked 24-hour or live-in shifts at any time between November 11, 2009 and the present. Dkt. No. 59-1 at 2; Ct. Dkt. No. 181 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 71-73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district judge presiding over\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   granted Mathieu's motion for leave to amend on November 8, 2017. Ct. Dkt. No. 180. On May 4, 2018, the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs moved to certify their NYLL and Connecticut law claims as Rule 23 class actions. Ct. Dkt. No. 204. In addition, on August 10, 2018, the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs again moved to amend their complaint to add an additional New York putative class representative. Ct. Dkt. No. 256.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Mathieu\n    <em>\n     Amicus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 9, 2018, Mathieu filed a motion for leave to file an\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief in opposition to Green's motion for class certification on the grounds that the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   action was first filed. Dkt. No. 59. On\n   February 19, 2019, the Court granted Mathieu leave to appear as\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   and ordered both parties to file briefs responding to the issues identified in Mathieu's submission. Dkt. No. 105. Those briefs were submitted on March 7, 2019. Dkt. Nos. 111, 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Certification of the\n    <em>\n     Kinkead\n    </em>\n    Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 18, 2019, the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   court resolved both of the motions pending before it. Ct. Dkt. No. 293. It certified, as a revision from what the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs initially sought, a \"New York Effective Date class\" consisting of \"all home healthcare workers employed by defendants in New York who worked in excess of 40 hours in a week including at least one 24-hour live-in shift between January 1, 2015 and October 12, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. And it permitted plaintiffs there to amend their complaint to add another representative of the New York classes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mathieu advised the Court of this development on March 19, 2019, and on March 22, 2019 Humana filed a letter response submitting that Green's class certification motion should be denied because the proposed class was subsumed by the newly certified\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   class. Dkt. No. 114-15. On March 25, 2019, Green informed the Court that she intended to file a petition for an interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   class certification order and requested that this Court defer ruling on the\n   <em>\n    Humana\n   </em>\n   class certification motion until such time as the Second Circuit ruled on Green's Rule 23(f) petition. Dkt. No. 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Green's Class Certification Motion Is Denied with Leave to Refile\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because the class proposed in the certification motion currently pending before this Court is largely subsumed by the class just certified in\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court agrees with the parties that class certification is not appropriate at this time. In light of Green's intention to petition to appeal the\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   certification order, the Court will administratively deny Green's class certification motion pending the disposition of the anticipated Rule 23(f) petition. Within two weeks of the Second Circuit's resolution of\n   <em>\n    Kinkead\n   </em>\n   , Green shall file a status update advising the Court of the Second Circuit's ruling and making any appropriate application to refile its class certification motion in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Background on Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Having concluded that a ruling on Green's class certification motion is not appropriate at this time, the Court turns to the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. All class-related facts and allegations are disregarded for purposes of these motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Regulatory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As this Court has previously summarized, in 1974, the Fair Labor Standards Amendments extended the protections of the FLSA to employees working in \"domestic service\" within a household but exempting live-in household employees. MTD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Op., Dkt. No. 32 at 1-2. In 1975, the DOL promulgated implementing regulations directing that the exemptions encompassed live-in household employees employed by third parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The third-party employer rule changed this regulatory landscape, removing third-party employees from the scope of the live-in worker exemption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This rule was publicized and issued on October 1, 2013, with a published effective date of January 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In December 2014, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   held that this rule was invalid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248668\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/138/#p139\">\n    76 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139-40 ). The D.C. Circuit reversed that decision on August 21, 2015, with the corresponding mandate issuing October 13, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248668\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/138/#p139\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173194,4340423\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1084/\">\n    799 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1087 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   During the pendency of the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation, the DOL issued several pieces of guidance. On October 9, 2014, the DOL announced that it would not bring enforcement actions for the first six months after the regulation's effective date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173194,4340423\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1084/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (citing Oct. 2014 Policy (\"The [third-party employer rule] will become effective on January 1, 2015.

On September 14, 2015, after\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   , the DOL published a policy statement notifying the public that it would not bring enforcement actions against employers for violations of the rule \"for 30 days after the date the Court of Appeals issues a mandate making its opinion effective,\" and on October 27, 2015, after the mandate issued, the DOL published a final policy statement identifying November 12, 2015 as the final day of its nonenforcement policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173194,4340423\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1084/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service; Announcement of 30-Day Period of Non-Enforcement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C029\">\n    80 Fed.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The facts below come from the parties' respective Rule 56.1 statements and responses thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Green's Employment with Humana\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff Molly Green worked for Humana as a home health aide from April 2015 through November 3, 2016. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 1. During the course of her employment, Green primarily worked as a \"live-in\" home health aide. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 2. The parties dispute whether, as a live-in health aide, she provided care and domestic services to a client on a twenty-four-hour basis, or was permitted to sleep through part of her shift and/or worked intermittently throughout the day. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Green also worked as an \"hourly worker\" for several weeks at the outset of her employment. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 5. In this role, she worked a 12-hour shift from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the rate of $ 10.10 per hour. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Green received compensation from Humana during this period for each of her roles. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 2. In accordance with Humana's classification of all companionship employees as exempt from the FLSA from January 1, 2015 to November 12, 2015, Green was considered an exempt employee throughout the term of her employment. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Accordingly, she was not paid overtime wages at the rate of one-and-a-half times her regular pay rate for all hours in excess of forty worked in a given week, and the wage statements she received from Humana did not reflect pay at these rates. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-7, 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Humana's Actions Pre-\n    <em>\n     Weil I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Humana is a member of multiple home care industry trade organizations. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 1. These trade organizations provide their members with email updates concerning substantive legal issues in the industry based on the expertise of employment lawyers and others in the home care industry. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 2. Humana executives subscribe to email lists from multiple trade organizations in order to monitor and track changes in the laws governing how the company pays its employees. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In part based on these subscriptions, Humana maintains that its \"objective has always been to be compliant with the law.\" Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 5. Green disputes this fact based on, inter alia, Humana's corporate representative's reliance on third-party commentators and industry-biased news sources; failure to subscribe to DOL updates or read DOL nonenforcement policies; and failure to review emails alerting her to any distinctions between DOL enforcement policies and private enforcement. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At some point in late 2013 or 2014, Humana became aware that the DOL had issued the third-party employer rule to amend regulations defining the companionship exemption to the FLSA. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 4. Based on its email and other updates from industry trade organizations, Humana understood that, when the rule took effect, its home health workers would no longer be exempt from the FLSA's overtime and minimum wage requirements. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 4. Humana claims that it planned, based on internal discussions, to reclassify all home care workers as non-exempt workers starting on January 1, 2015 based on the new rule, notwithstanding the commencement of the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 14. Green contests this claim based on the absence of corroborating evidence that Humana was planning to change its pay practice in the fall of 2014. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In either case, as Humana previously represented to this Court, it did not begin complying with the DOL's third-party employer rule until on or about November 12, 2015. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6 10; Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 17. The basis for the delay is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Humana's Actions After\n    <em>\n     Weil I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In December 2014 and January 2015, Humana received updates through trade organization email lists regarding the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 8. These updates informed Humana that a federal district court had enjoined the third-party employer rule before it took effect and then invalidated and vacated the entire rule. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. Humana understood, based on updates from industry trade organizations and conversations with others in the industry, that the DOL would not be able to enforce the new third-party employer rule unless the district court decision was overturned,\n   and accordingly that the companionship exemption that had been in place since 1975 would continue in effect. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Accordingly, it contends that it reconsidered its decision to reclassify its workers. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties disagree whether Humana could reasonably reach this understanding, and specifically whether there was a DOL administrative regulation or other writing on which Humana could have relied for this understanding and its concomitant decision to classify Green and similarly situated employees as exempt after January 1, 2015. Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Humana maintains that it relied on the 1975 companionship exemption, along with DOL's administrative practice and non-enforcement policies, in deciding to continue to treat its employees as exempt while DOL's appeal was pending. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 15; Response to Green 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. It further contends that it believed doing so would not violate FLSA or other laws. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Green contests the reasonableness of this conclusion based on the absence of specific guidance sanctioning the decision to disregard the regulation in its entirety notwithstanding its January 1, 2015 effective date and in light of \"red flags\" that she contends should have put Humana on notice about the limitations of DOL's nonenforcement policies. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties also disagree whether information about the DOL nonenforcement policy from the DOL or other sources of which Humana became aware led the company to believe the regulation could be reinstated retroactively. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 13. Humana contends that no such sources led it to this belief, while Green maintains that Humana was or reasonably should have been aware of this possibility based on the DOL's prominent inclusion of an \"effective date\" as well as emails alerting Humana of the fact that DOL enforcement policy did not bar private actions undermine this claim. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Humana's Actions After\n    <em>\n     Weil II\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on its industry trade organization subscriptions, Humana learned that in August of 2015 the D.C. Circuit had overturned the lower court's\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   decision. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 16. It also maintains that it learned that the D.C. Circuit's decision would not become effective until October 13, 2015 and that it became aware that the DOL had issued nonenforcement policies through November 12, 2015. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Humana claims that it discussed the new development internally and relied on the DOL's written nonenforcement policies in deciding to continue to treat its employees as exempt until November 12, 2015, in the belief that doing so would not violate FLSA or any other law. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Humana maintains that no policies or other sources led it to believe that the D.C. Circuit's decision could have retroactive effect. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 18. Green denies the reasonableness of this understanding. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 18\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Humana's Agreements with Green\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Humana provided Green with a Caregiver Employment Agreement explaining how Humana intended to calculate her wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 19. Humana did not provide Green with wage statements that reflected overtime rates of pay. Response to Green \u00b6 18. The parties disagree as to whether the wage statements Green was provided were compliant with the Wage Theft Prevention Act in light of the third-party employer rule as well as to whether those wage statements accurately reflected the pay arrangement set forth in Green's Caregiver Employment Agreement. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For live-in shifts, Green was paid either $ 130 or $ 150. Response to Humana 56.1 \u00b6 24. Humana maintains that she was instructed to perform eight hours of work during such shifts, while Green contends she worked more than eight hours. Response to Humana \u00b6 24. Humana maintains that Green was paid at hourly rates above the 2015 New York minimum wage of $ 9 per hour. Response to Humana \u00b6 23. Green agrees that she was paid more than $ 9 per hour as an hourly worker, but contends that her hourly rate as a live-in aide was less than this amount based on her actual hours worked. Response to Humana \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court's previous opinion resolving Humana's motion to dismiss this action held that\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   nullified the D.C. District Court's vacatur of the third-party employer rule and that the third-party employer rule therefore should be treated as effective beginning on its prescribed effective date of January 1, 2015. MTD Op. at 7. The Court also held that Humana had not demonstrated it was entitled to the Portal-to-Portal Act's good-faith defense because Humana had not demonstrated as a matter of law that it had a subjective good-faith belief that it was immunized from private suits under the third-party employer rule until November 12, 2015 and that this belief was objectively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n    at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   To the contrary, the DOL's policies continued to emphasize the January 1, 2015 effective date; and the gap between the prescribed effective date and the DOL's enforcement date did not alter the rule's effective date.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, in the September 2015 Policy, the DOL again noted that the rule \"had an effective date of January 1, 2015\" and that the Department \"ha[d] not begun enforcement\" because of its previous nonenforcement policy and because it was a party to the\n   <em>\n    Weil\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2065%2C646\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Green contends that Humana's claim of reliance on the 1975 Regulation is veiled reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   decision, which cannot satisfy the Portal-to-Portal Act's\n   <em>\n    administrative\n   </em>\n   action requirement; and reliance on the mere inference-rather than a written administrative policy-that the 1975 Regulation would apply in the wake of that decision.

It is undisputed that Humana was aware of the existence of both the 1975 Regulation and the third-party employer rule. Humana's argument that it could rely on the former rather than the latter is premised on\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   's disposition vacating the third-party employer rule. Humana therefore\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   relying on\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   -reliance Humana concedes is beyond the scope of the Portal-to-Portal Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   That Humana's reliance is ultimately tied to judicial rather than administrative action is further apparent in the fact that under Humana's logic the Portal-to-Portal Act defense ceases to be available not at the moment the Humana received agency guidance, nor at the moment the reinstated regulation became effective, but at the time that the Court of Appeals elected to issue its mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Humana's defense is necessarily based on matters outside the scope of a Portal-to-Portal Act defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Text of Section 259 Does Not Support Humana's Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even if the Court accepted Humana's premise that it was relying on the 1975 Regulation, in this situation, that regulation is not \"exactly the type of 'regulation' upon which Congress intended employers to base a defense under \u00a7 259.\" Humana MSJ Reply at 3. To the contrary, Humana's putative defense relies on an expanded interpretation of the Portal-to-Portal Act that is inconsistent with statutory text and binding precedent in this circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The text of Section 259 provides that an employer may raise as a defense to liability a DOL \"written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation ... or any administrative practice or enforcement policy\" with respect to the class of employers to which it belongs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20259\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

As the Second Circuit described this question in\n   the context of the objective good faith requirement, the Act applies to those situations in which \"the agency advice was specific and left no room for interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142344\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/252/#p263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142344\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/252/#p263\">\n    at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If \"the administrative interpretation is uninformative and leaves the employer to make its own reading of the precise requirements of the statute,\" the employer's \"honest, but unsuccessful intention to obtain information does not relieve it of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142344\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/252/#p263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Although Humana points to a regulation rather than an interpretation, the same logic applies: there must be a regulation that specifically governs the matter for the employer to be entitled to a Portal-to-Portal Act defense. Humana argues that the text of the 1975 Regulation fulfills that role here because it facially provides for the third-party employer exemption. But Humana identifies no administrative writing that answers the threshold question of whether the 1975 Regulation was in effect while the third-party employer rule was vacated. As Humana's corporate representative's testimony makes clear,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Driscoll Dep., Dkt. No. 88-2 at 57:8-59:18, it was Humana's own inference-not an administrative writing-that answered the question of which regulation might apply. And that inference was inescapably predicated on a prior judicial determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Statutory Context Confirms this Reading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Second Circuit's summary of the Portal-to-Portal Act's purpose confirms that the present situation-in which the agency has been silent on the interpretive or regulatory question, and only a court has spoken-is not what Congress intended the defense to cover. As the Second Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Home Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the Act \"was designed to protect employers from liability if they took certain actions on the basis of an interpretation of the law by a government agency, even if the agency's interpretation later turned out to be wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142344\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/252/#p263\">\n    672 F.2d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first section of the statute similarly includes Congress's findings that when it passed the Portal-to-Portal Act it was concerned that the FLSA had been \"interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees,\" thereby creating ruinous liabilities for employers, windfall payments for employees, and other undesirable effects.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20251\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Humana's purported reliance on the 1975 Regulation runs in reverse. Humana was not attempting to comply with a regulation that later turned out to be wrong or that was subsequently invalidated by judicial action. Rather, it was relying on a regulation that it determined continued to apply based upon an intervening judicial action. Finding for Humana would not protect employers' good-faith reliance on agency interpretations or regulations notwithstanding subsequent judicial intervention; it would permit reliance on a district court's judicial intervention to controvert an agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Humana is correct in pointing out that part of the purpose of the defense is to avoid penalizing employers for their good-faith reliance or creating windfalls for employees that disturb the expectations of the contracting parties. But as with the principles of retroactivity, the purpose of the Portal-to-Portal Act is not to protect employer bottom lines, it is to protect good-faith reliance on certain kinds of\n   <em>\n    agency actions.\n   </em>\n   If Congress had intended for reliance on judicial actions or inferences therefrom to qualify for protection under the statute, it could have written the Portal-to-Portal Act to cover such circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Remaining Arguments Favor Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Humana's remaining argument is that the Court's conclusion creates an \"irreconcilable tension\" between the Portal-to-Portal Act and the Administrative Procedure Act because failing to apply the Portal-to-Portal Act to cases like this one would preclude district courts from exercising the power to \"set aside\" or delay new regulations. Humana MSJ Reply at 5. That is, if after a Court set aside a regulation under the APA the employer could not rely in good faith on the preexisting regulation, the court would not be empowered to set aside the regulation at all. This would mean that the APA provided only a \"half-measure of relief\" to an employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As an initial matter, this argument underscores the extent to which Humana relied on a judicial opinion to reach its decision to rely on the 1975 Regulation. In any case, this argument is unavailing because the statutory regimes of the Portal-to-Portal Act and the APA are separate. The Portal-to-Portal Act applies only to a narrow set of statutes and provides limited relief from retroactive liability in specific contexts-here, in the context of employer compliance with later-invalidated, superseded, or modified DOL regulations. It is irrelevant to the vast majority of administrative action. Accordingly, an expansive interpretation of the Portal-to-Portal Act cannot be necessary to realize the purposes of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2. No Genuine Issue of Fact Regarding Humana's Objective Good Faith Reliance on DOL Nonenforcement Policies Remain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Green is also entitled to summary judgment as to Humana's second asserted Portal-to-Portal defense because Humana has failed to identify a genuine dispute of fact as to the objective reasonableness of its reliance on DOL nonenforcement policies for its continued decision not to comply with the third-party employer rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For reliance on a written administrative policy to be in good faith, the defendant must demonstrate that it was an\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   reasonable object of reliance; \"the employer's honest, but unsuccessful, intention to obtain information does not relieve it of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Home Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142344\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/252/#p263\">\n    672 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   266 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Humana has not identified any facts in the summary judgment record that disturb this analysis. There is no genuine dispute of material fact as whether the DOL's nonenforcement policies were silent on the matter of private enforcement or as to whether the policies consistently repeated references to the January 1, 2015 effective date. Given each of these undisputed facts, as detailed below, the enforcement policies at issue here are insufficiently specific to support objectively reasonable reliance for given each of these undisputed facts. Accordingly, no reasonable jury could conclude that it was objectively reasonable for Humana to rely on these enforcement policies in declining to enforce the third-party employer rule as of its effective date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Enforcement Policy Is Silent as to Private Enforcement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   First, the policy statements discuss only the\n   <em>\n    Department\n   </em>\n   's \"time-limited non-enforcement policy\" and the fact that \"the\n   <em>\n    Department\n   </em>\n   will not bring enforcement actions against any employer for violations of FLSA obligations\" resulting from the new regulations for 30 days after the mandate issues.

No. 56-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To dispute this distinction, Humana contends that the Second Circuit has embraced its logic that employers may rely on administrative nonenforcement policies as a defense to private enforcement. It notes that the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Darr v. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York\n   </em>\n   affirmed a lower court opinion validating a Portal-to-Portal Act defense against private plaintiffs notwithstanding the fact that the defendant had acted in good-faith reliance on an administrative enforcement practice.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1193120\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/169/262/#p265\">\n    169 F.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 265-66 (2d Cir. 1948). But\n   <em>\n    Darr\n   </em>\n   confronted the more basic question of the Portal-to-Portal Act's constitutionality, and neither the circuit nor the lower court discussed the issue presented here.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1193120\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/169/262/#p265\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Darr v.

Co.\n   </em>\n   , 78 F.Supp.28 (S.D.N.Y. 1947).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Court will instead follow the logic it and contemporary courts have previously adopted: that DOL policy statements concerning Department enforcement policies are insufficiently specific, under the requirements\n   <em>\n    of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Insurance\n   </em>\n   , to confer the protection of the Portal-to-Portal Act on a reasonable employer who purported to rely on them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Op. at 22;\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

Colo. 2016) (\"[T]he Court disagrees with the [d]efendant's premise that it is essential that the private right of action conferred by statute be necessarily circumscribed by those situations in which the DOL voluntarily decides to exercise 'prosecutorial discretion' due to its own uncertainties about the regulation's effect.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Humana also argues that its ability to follow agency guidance would be impeded by a principle that it could not assert a good-faith reliance defense against private plaintiffs notwithstanding an agency enforcement policy. There is no such risk. Humana may assert the Portal-to-Portal Act defense to defend itself against an agency action taken notwithstanding a nonenforcement policy on which it relied in good faith; and it may rely in good faith on agency advice whenever that advice specifically applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The \"Effective Date\" Listed in the Enforcement Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Even if it were objectively reasonable to conclude that an act was not privately enforceable during an administrative nonenforcement period that coincided with\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   's vacatur of the third-party employer rule, it was no longer objectively reasonable to do so after the disposition of\n   <em>\n    Weil II\n   </em>\n   . As Green points out, the nonenforcement policies repeatedly flagged the existence of an earlier effective date of January 1, 2015. Even if it were objectively reasonable for an employer to be unaware of the basic principles of retroactivity, after the D.C. Circuit reversed the\n   <em>\n    Weil I\n   </em>\n   opinion, the January 1, 2015 \"effective date\" in the nonenforcement policies would have had no apparent meaning if it could be disturbed by agency nonenforcement policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Accordingly, Green's motion for summary judgment as to Humana's affirmative defense is GRANTED. Because there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to Humana's Fair Labor Standards Act and New York Labor Law violations in the absence of this defense, summary judgment as to Green's overtime claims is also GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Green's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Her NYLL Wage Statements Claim Is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   It is undisputed that Humana provided Green with wage statements including wages and hours based on the hourly representation of the day rate Humana paid Green for working live-in shifts. The only question is one of law: whether the New York Wage Theft Prevention Act (\"WTPA\") imposes so-called derivative liability for misclassification violations or whether Humana may comply with the WTPA by disclosing how Green's wages were being calculated at the time. Because a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Humana reasonably believed in good faith that it was not required to provide Green with these statements, Green's motion for summary judgment is denied as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Humana argues that derivative liability for WTPA violations is not appropriate: the purpose of the statute was to enhance transparency, not to create an additional penalty for misclassification violations by making any such violation a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   violation of the WTPA. Indeed, Humana argues, the fact that when the WTPA added a penalty for misclassification it separately increased the penalties available for failure to pay overtime reinforces Humana's interpretation that the WTPA is not intended to be a penalty provision for the former violation. Humana also argues that it is entitled to the New York Labor Law's good faith defense for employers who reasonably believed in good faith that they were not required to provide employees with wage statements, because it believed that Green's wage statements were consistent with \"how Plaintiff's wages were being calculated\n   <em>\n    at that time.\n   </em>\n   \" Humana MSJ Br. at 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   NYLL \u00a7 198(1-d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Green contends that the plain text of the WTPA forecloses the first argument: the WTPA requires \"each employer\" to \"furnish each employee with a statement of every payment of wages\" and, for employees \"not exempt from overtime compensation as established in the commissioner's minimum wage orders or otherwise provided by New York state law or regulation,\" to include the \"regularly hourly rate or rates of pay; the overtime rate or rates of pay; the number of regular hours worked; and the number of overtime hours worked.\" NYLL \u00a7 195(3). The law makes no distinction as to the contingencies presented here and no exceptions for so-called derivative liability. Accordingly, courts in this district find employers liable for failing to \"comply with the strict requirements of the wage statement law\"-even, for example, for newly exempt home care workers notwithstanding that such workers were paid by shift.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Avondale Care Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-CV-3084 (SN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201582433\">\n    2018 WL 1582433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Green does not respond to Humana's contention that it is entitled to a defense for good faith compliance with the WTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court need not resolve the parties' disagreements regarding so-called derivative liability because a reasonable jury could conclude Humana harbored a good-faith belief that it was not obligated to make the WTPA disclosures applicable to nonexempt employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cabrera v. Schafer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270915\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/250/#p254\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254-55 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). Humana's obligation to provide home health aides with wage statements that comply with all elements of the WTPA for exempt employees from January 1, 2015 rests upon a chain of legal contingencies, including whether the WTPA imposes derivative liability as a general matter and whether WTPA obligations accrue based upon retroactive FLSA or NYLL liabilities. Although little evidence on this point is presently before\n   the Court, a good-faith misapprehension about these contingencies may be objectively reasonable and a reasonable jury might conclude that Humana harbored that misapprehension. Accordingly, at least in the absence of any argument by Green, the Court cannot conclude that its rejection of Humana's Portal-to-Portal defense necessarily precludes a good faith defense to its WTPA obligations as well. Summary judgment is therefore unwarranted as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

For the reasons given above, Humana-which would bear the burden of proof on this affirmative defense at trial-fails to identify sufficient undisputed facts from which the Court could conclude that no reasonable jury could find other than for Humana on its Portal-to-Portal defense. Accordingly, Humana's motion for summary judgment on this defense is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Humana's motion for summary judgment as to Green's request for liquidated damages is also denied.

Humana abandons the first argument in its reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   As to the second, as explained above, it is undisputed that Humana failed to provide Green with wage statements that reflected overtime rates of pay. But disputed facts concerning its comprehension of the relevant laws and whether it had a reasonable basis for such shortfalls remain.

As appropriate, Green may apply to refile a summary judgment motion with respect to those claims after the disposition of her\n    <em>\n     Kinkead\n    </em>\n    petition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Citations to Green's Rule 56.1 statement and Humana's response thereto, Dkt.
