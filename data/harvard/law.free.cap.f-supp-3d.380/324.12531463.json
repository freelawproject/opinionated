King, known as \"B.B. King.\" He brought this lawsuit against UMG Recordings, Inc. (\"UMGI\"), Kingsid Ventures, Ltd. (\"Kingsid\"), and the Estate of Riley B. King (the \"Estate\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") for copyright infringement after UMGI released several music albums with Craig's photos in them. Defendants have moved for summary judgment in favor of Kingsid and the Estate and partial summary judgment in favor of UMGI. In addition, Defendants have moved for sanctions against Craig and his counsel, Richard Liebowitz and the Liebowitz Law Firm PLLC, for filing a meritless motion to disqualify Defendants' expert witness. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' summary judgment motion is granted in part and denied in part. Defendants' motion for sanctions is granted with respect to Richard Liebowitz and the Liebowitz Law Firm PLLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the complaint and the parties' Rule 56.1 statements and are not subject to genuine dispute unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The renowned Riley B. King (\"King\"), professionally known as B.B. King, \"was one of the greatest guitarists and blues performers of all time.\" (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff, Glen Craig, is a photographer who took several pictures of King during King's music tours. (Dkt. No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 3.) Among the pictures Craig took, three appeared in a tour book published in 1971 featuring King. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 5.) It is these three photographs (the \"Photographs\") that are at issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant UMGI is a Delaware corporation in the business of selling, manufacturing, distributing, and otherwise exploiting sound recordings in the United States. (Dkt. No. 92\u00b6\u00b6 21, 23.) Craig alleges that UMGI published a series of recordings of King's music that used the Photographs without his permission. (Compl. \u00b6 12.) He further alleges that Defendant Kingsid-a company organized to license King's name to third parties-and the Estate facilitated and benefitted from UMGI's sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his complaint, Craig specifies 43 allegedly infringing albums (\"King Albums\") that were released at various times between 1971 and 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-55.) Among them, 29 albums\n   are published outside the United States by foreign corporate entities. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 24.) All of these entities, except for one, share the \"Universal\" name or have some affiliation with UMGI's parent company. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25.) Between July 7, 2013 and July 7, 2016, UMGI sold copies of 13 of the allegedly infringing albums within the United States. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Craig registered his copyright for the Photographs in March 2014. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 7.) In June 2014, Craig reached out to UMGI to retrieve the originals of the Photographs for an exhibition and was provided with copies of certain King CDs that featured the Photographs. (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 80-3.) Craig's then-attorney subsequently sent a cease-and-desist letter to UMGI in September 2014, informing UMGI of the alleged infringement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 11; Dkt. No. 91-3.) Unable to resolve the matter amicably, Craig initiated this action against Defendants on July 7, 2016, asserting a Copyright Act claim and a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the close of expert discovery, Craig filed a motion to disqualify Defendants' proposed expert witness, Professor Jeffrey Sedlik (\"Sedlik\"). (Dkt. No. 55.) After the parties had fully briefed this issue, the Court denied Craig's motion following an evidentiary hearing on May 25, 2018. (Docket Entry on May 25, 2018.) Defendants then filed a motion for sanctions-pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and this Court's inherent power-against Craig and his counsel, Richard Liebowitz and the Liebowitz Law Firm PLLC, for fees and expenses in connection with the motion to disqualify. (Dkt. No. 71.) Separately, they also moved for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 77.) Both motions are now fully briefed and ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Liability under the Copyright Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the copyright claims in favor of Kingsid and the Estate; they move for partial summary judgment in favor of UMGI. Each is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Liability of Kingsid\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on Craig's claims against Kingsid on the ground that Craig does not adduce any evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer Kingsid's involvement in the alleged copyright infringement. (Dkt. No. 78 at 9-10.) Kingsid is simply a company organized \"to license Mr. King's name to third parties.\" (Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 16.) Craig has failed to adduce any evidence to substantiate his claim that \"Kingsid ... improperly facilitated and wrongly benefited\" from the alleged copyright infringement (Compl. \u00b6 12), and in fact concedes that \"the record is insufficiently developed as to [Kingsid's] involvement in the infringing activity\" (Dkt. No. 90 at 2 n.1). Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment in Kingsid's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lessem v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193583\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/766/504/#p515\">\n    766 F.Supp.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (granting summary judgment to entities that had \"[no]thing to do with the copyright infringement alleged in th[e] case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Liability of the Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants next argue that summary judgment should also be granted in favor of the Estate because the record contains no evidence that the Estate has produced, distributed, or improperly benefited from any of the allegedly infringing albums. (Dkt. No. 78 at 9-10.) In response, Craig contends that a reasonable jury could potentially find the Estate liable because its trustee and executor, Louise LaVerne Toney (\"Toney\"), reviewed all album releases and received royalties from UMGI. (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6 8; Dkt. No. 90 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To start with, Craig mischaracterizes the record. Nothing in the deposition excerpt cited by Craig supports his allegation that Toney \"receive[d] all album releases from UMGI,\n   <em>\n    delivered to her for review.\n   </em>\n   \" (Dkt. No. 90 at 5 (emphasis added).) To the contrary, Toney testified that she has never had any approval power over UMGI's release of albums. (Dkt. No. 94-1 at 59:8-61:6.) Therefore, viewed in the light most favorable to Craig, the record can, at best, support the inference that the Estate has received royalties and communications about upcoming album releases. So, the question is whether receiving communications and royalties in connection with the allegedly infringing albums can render the Estate liable for infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court answers this question in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To establish direct liability for copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show that a defendant has \"engaged in some volitional conduct sufficient to show that [it] actively\" violated plaintiff's copyright.\n   <em>\n    Arista Records LLC v.

No evidence in the record shows that Toney delivered the Photographs to UMGI or cooperated in any way with UMGI regarding the use of the Photographs in the album production.

Liability of UMGI (Foreign Albums)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   UMGI argues that it cannot be held liable for the 29 allegedly infringing albums (\"Foreign Albums\") released outside the United States by foreign corporate entities. UMGI makes three arguments: (1) UMGI did not manufacture or distribute the Foreign Albums, (2) UMGI and the foreign affiliates that released the Foreign Albums are separate corporate entities, and (3) the Copyright Act does not cover extraterritorial infringements. (Dkt. No. 78 at 10-12.) The Court begins with UMGI's argument regarding the extraterritorial application of the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"It is well established that copyright laws generally do not have extraterritorial application.\"\n   <em>\n    Update Art, Inc. v.

But if a defendant (1) commits a predicate infringing act-such as the unauthorized manufacture of copyrighted material-in the United States, and (2) the act permits further reproduction abroad, the defendant might be liable for related infringing acts occurring outside the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robert Stigwood Grp.

UMGI is therefore entitled to summary judgment with respect to claims related to these albums. As to the remaining eight Foreign Albums that are named as \"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. B.B. King\" (the \"LG Albums\"), the evidentiary record compels a different result. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 33-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In particular, the evidentiary record could support the inference that UMGI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   has, through its employee Ryan Null (\"Null\"), transmitted an unauthorized copy of one of the Photographs (the \"Star Photograph\") from within the United States to UMGI's UK affiliate to produce an album named \"Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. B.B. King.\" (Dkt. No. 91-1 (\"Null Depo.\") at 129:4-9.) The evidentiary record would also allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the LG Albums have used the Star Photograph as their album covers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Null's acts of pulling the Star Photograph from a database and sending it over the Internet to the UK affiliate necessarily involve the acts of duplicating and transferring a digital file over the Internet. Therefore, even assuming that Null and UMGI did not make the decision to use this photo in the album, Null's unauthorized transfer of this photo-in which Craig allegedly holds the copyright-is sufficient to constitute a predicate act for purposes of the Copyright Act.\n   <em>\n    Capitol Records\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3893302\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/934/640/#p648\">\n    934 F.Supp.2d at 648-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that unauthorized online transfer of digital musical files infringes copyright owner's reproduction right);\n   <em>\n    Update Art, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542418\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/67/#p73\">\n    843 F.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that illegal reproduction of a copyrighted work in the United States constitutes a predicate act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having concluded that the evidence could support the inference that UMGI, through its employee Null, committed a predicate act of infringement in the United States, the Court next considers whether the act is one that \"permits further reproduction abroad.\"\n   <em>\n    Robert Stigwood Grp.

The crux of Craig's theory of liability is\n   not that UMGI manufactured or distributed the Foreign Albums or that the corporate veil between UMGI and its foreign affiliates ought to be pierced. Instead, Craig argues that UMGI's liability arises from its alleged reproduction and transmission of an infringing photograph to its UK affiliate. (Dkt. No. 90 at 7-8.) Therefore, even accepting that UMGI did not manufacture or distribute the Foreign Albums, and that the corporate distinctions between UMGI and its affiliates are to be respected, to the extent that a reasonable jury could find that UMGI committed a domestic infringement that enabled its foreign affiliates to commit further infringements abroad, UMGI can be liable for those further infringements under the governing law.\n   <em>\n    Robert Stigwood Grp.

Damages Under the Copyright Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court next turns to the question of damages. Defendants seek to limit the scope of potential damages in several ways. They argue that (1) Craig's damages award should be limited to damages arising from sales that occurred between July 7, 2013 and July 7, 2016, (2) Craig's actual damages should be limited to $ 9,452.21, (3) Craig is not entitled to any of UMGI's profits, (4) Craig is not entitled to any statutory damages, and (5) even if Craig is granted statutory damages, Craig's award should be limited to the amounts recoverable for innocent infringement. The Court addresses each proposed limitation in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants first argue that, to the extent that any damages are awarded, they should be limited to those arising from sales that occurred within three years of the filing of this suit-sales that occurred between July 7, 2013 and July 7, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 78 at 12-13.) Craig contends that damages should be calculated on the basis of sales from July 7, 2013 to the present. (Dkt. No. 90 at 9.) The Court agrees with Craig that the period for which damages are available is July 7, 2013 to the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Any civil action asserting a claim based on a Copyright Act violation must be brought within three years after the accrual of the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

After a plaintiff has established the timeliness of his or her claim with respect to any one particular act, courts in this Circuit have taken a \"rolling\" approach to the calculation of damages with respect to any other acts of infringement, which allows a plaintiff to recover damages for only those infringing acts that occurred within three years of the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Papazian v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But they fight over whether Craig can collect damages for acts of infringement that have occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he filed his lawsuit. (Dkt. No. 90 at 9; Dkt. No. 93 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants' argument is counterintuitive. According to Defendants' logic, a plaintiff would have to file continuous complaints to capture damages from violations occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he or she has already filed the first lawsuit that put a defendant on notice of the alleged infringement. Such a rule is contrary to the speedy and efficient resolution of disputes and conservation of judicial resources. Indeed, none of the authorities cited by Defendants supports their argument. Instead, those cases discuss how far\n   <em>\n    back\n   </em>\n   in time from the filing of the complaint damages would extend, rather than whether a plaintiff can recover damages for ongoing damages\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Petrella v.

Therefore, July 7, 2013 to the present (the \"Relevant Period\") is the proper time period for purposes of calculating damages. To sum up, Craig's maximum damages are limited to those arising from the sale of the 13 albums in the United States and the LG Albums abroad between July 6, 2013 and the present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Actual Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Copyright Act entitles copyright owners to two types of compensatory damages: actual damages and infringers' profits.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). These two types of damages serve different purposes and are based on different financial data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    On Davis v. The Gap, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106741\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/152/#p159\">\n    246 F.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (2d Cir. 2001). Here, Defendants seek to cap Craig's actual damages at $ 9,452.21 on the basis of their expert opinion. (Dkt. No. 78 at 13-15.) Craig objects to Defendants' figure by questioning the adequacy of Defendants' expert opinion. (Dkt. No. 90 at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants' $ 9,452.21 calculation takes into account only the thirteen albums sold in the United States, and not any of the Foreign Albums. (Dkt. No. 62-7 at 9, 27-28.) As the Court explained above, UMGI's liability for the LG Albums sold abroad is still a triable issue. Therefore, the Court cannot conclude at the summary judgment stage that no factual dispute exists as to the maximum amount of actual damages to which Craig might be entitled. Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to the actual damages calculation is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Infringers' Profits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Next, the Court turns to infringers' profits. The Copyright Act awards infringers' profits to ensure that infringers do not benefit from their wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    On Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106741\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/152/#p159\">\n    246 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute adopts a burden-shifting framework: first, \"the copyright owner is required to present proof only of the infringer's gross revenue,\" and second, \"the infringer is [then] required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the copyrighted work.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

(Dkt. No. 80-6 at 5.) But Defendants attack the \"causal connection\" between the Photographs and UMGI's revenue from selling the allegedly infringing albums. (Dkt. No. 78 at 16.) According to Defendants, the Photographs and UMGI's revenue are not \"reasonably related,\"\n   <em>\n    On Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106741\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/246/152/#p159\">\n    246 F.3d at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because \"all of UMGI's profits are attributable to Mr. King\" (Dkt. No. 78 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The evidence in the record, interpreted in the light most favorable to non-movant Craig, is sufficient to lead a reasonable jury to conclude that UMGI's revenues from selling the King Albums are reasonably related to the allegedly infringing photographs. The Photographs used as album covers feature prominently on those albums. Indeed, the Photographs are most likely the first things that catch a customer's eye when she is browsing the shelves either in a physical store or online. It is true that King is a great musician and that many people purchase his albums solely for the music. But it would be disingenuous to argue that the cover design does not affect the overall quality of an album, customers' willingness to buy, and, consequently, album sales. As UMGI itself admits, \"[UMGI] really [is] careful about what [it] choose[s] for a cover.\" (Null Depo. 39:11-12.) Indeed, its employees are expected to \"research as many [photographs] as [they] need to until [they] find the correct photo that's appropriate or the correct creative choice that the art director or the designer or anyone else would approve to be used from a creative standpoint,\" because UMGI is \"more concerned with the cover ... than what shows up inside.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   38:16-21, 39:14-15.) It cannot be said to be beyond genuine dispute that the revenues are not reasonably related to the photographs,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The cases cited by UMGI are inapposite. The out-of-circuit case\n   <em>\n    Mackie v.

It is distinguishable because the Photographs here feature King himself and are probably the most important image component of the albums. Also, unlike the three-second appearance of an infringing design in a 44-minute broadcast which \"[o]ne could miss ... in a blink of the eye,\" the Photographs used in the infringing albums are at the front and center of each album sold.\n   <em>\n    Mager v.

(Dkt. No. 92 \u00b6 7.) Therefore, Craig is not entitled to recover statutory damages or attorney's fees for those alleged infringements that occurred prior to March 2014. But Craig points out that in November 2015-after his registration-UMGI released yet another album named\n   <em>\n    Ladies and Gentlemen Mr. B.B.

Because the 2015 Album was released after the copyright registration, it could potentially entitle Craig to statutory damages. At issue is whether Craig would be entitled to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees for UMGI's 2015 Album if Craig succeeds in establishing UMGI's liability in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue that the 2015 release is merely a re-packaging of an earlier album named\n   <em>\n    Ladies and Gentlemen Mr. B.B.

As a so-called re-packaging of the 2012 Album, Defendants contend, the 2015 Album is a continuation of the alleged infringement that commenced prior to Craig's registration in 2014. (Dkt.

The record clearly indicates that the 2015 Album is part of an ongoing infringement that commenced with the release of the 2012 Album. The 2015 Album has the same front cover and back cover as the 2012 Album, uses the same four photographs that appeared in the 2012 Album, and contains the same seventeen musical compositions and sound recordings that appeared in the 2012 Album. (Dkt. No. 83 \u00b6 4.) The only difference is that the 2015 Album has fewer tracks and photographs\n   than the 2012 Album. (Dkt. No. 83 \u00b6 5.) In essence, by releasing the 2015 Album, UMGI infringed the same photographs in the same manner as it had done in releasing the 2012 Album. It is therefore beyond genuine dispute that the 2015 Album \"constitutes the continuation of a series of ongoing infringements\" that commenced with the 2012 Album.\n   <em>\n    Solid Oak Sketches\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204126543\">\n    2016 WL 4126543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, Craig maintains, based on Null's deposition, that \"UMGI employees concede that by their own standards the 2015 release is considered a new compilation.\" (Dkt. No. 90 at 14.) But Craig's argument misrepresents the record. Nowhere in Null's deposition excerpt submitted in the record does Craig's counsel or Null directly refer to the 2015 Album. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Null Depo.) Viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Craig, the closest he has come to probing the question of the 2015 Album's novelty is when his counsel asked Null if it would be unusual for UMGI to use the same cover from an old album in a new compilation, implicitly referring to the 2012 Album and the 2015 Album. (Null Depo. 61:2-8.) But Null categorically rejected such a possibility, stating that \"[a] compilation would have new art.... We wouldn't do that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   61:9-13.) According to Null, a new compilation would have new a cover photo, new title, and new track list, and would therefore constitute a completely new collection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40:9-12, 40:25-41:2, 59:16-60:2, 61:17-20.) The 2015 Album, which pulls its cover, title, and songs from the 2012 Album, does not fit Null's \"new compilation\" description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Craig argues that construing the concept of \"continuing infringement\" in this way will reduce the deterrent effect that the Copyright Act's statutory damages provision has against potential infringers. (Dkt. No. 90 at 14.) The Court is not persuaded. \"A defendant who continues infringing after registration will be subject to liability for actual damages, disgorgement of profits,\" and a possible injunction.\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201979227\">\n    2014 WL 1979227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. Such remedies are often sufficient to deter potential infringers and compensate copyright owners for their losses, thus serving the statutory purpose of deterring copyright infringement. In light of Craig's otherwise available remedies, the Court rejects Craig's argument and joins the other courts in this District that have adopted a bright-line rule.\n   <em>\n    Solid Oak Sketches, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204126543\">\n    2016 WL 4126543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4 ;\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201979227\">\n    2014 WL 1979227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9 ;\n   <em>\n    U2 Home Entm't, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203906889\">\n    2008 WL 3906889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because the alleged infringements occurred before Craig's registration of his copyright, UMGI is entitled to summary judgment on claims of statutory damages and attorney's fees. Because the Court denies statutory damages for Craig, the Court need not reach the remainder of Defendants' damages arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendants argue that, even assuming the Photographs had CMI, it was removed by a third party prior to 1971, when the Photographs appeared without CMI in a music tour book. (Dkt. No. 78 at 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 79 \u00b6 5; Dkt. No. 62-6 (\"Craig Depo.\") 55:13-25.) Craig neither adduces any evidence nor presents any alternative theory to rebut Defendants' claim. Nothing in the evidentiary record indicates that Defendants either intentionally removed the CMI or had reason to know that the CMI had been improperly removed when releasing the infringing albums. There is not even any evidence suggesting whether there was CMI on the Photographs when Defendants obtained them. Without any evidence from which the Court can draw a favorable inference for Craig, the Court must grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants with respect to the DMCA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In order to have Sedlik disqualified, Craig had to show at least that (1) it was objectively reasonable for him to believe that he had a confidential relationship with Sedlik, and (2) he actually disclosed confidential information to Sedlik.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Pataki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296611\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/293/305/#p311\">\n    293 F.Supp.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (S.D.N.Y. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In his motion to disqualify, Craig alleged through his counsel, and stated in a declaration, that he had disclosed confidential information to Sedlik in a phone call which he thought was confidential. (Dkt. No. 56 at 1-2.) But the evidentiary hearing revealed that Craig did not disclose any confidential information to Sedlik. Contrary to what Craig's counsel has mischaracterized as \"explain[ing] the whole theory of the case to Mr. Sedlik\" (Dkt. No. 56 at 7), what Craig told Sedlik was simply the basic facts of the case, his career path, and his licensing history-none of which can be categorized as confidential (Dkt. No. 73-1 (\"Hrg. Trs.\") 6:7-23). The only allegedly\n   \"confidential\" information-the discussion on Getty Image licensing fees-was not only told\n   <em>\n    by\n   </em>\n   Sedlik\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   Craig, but also publicly available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13:24-14:2, 22:9-16.) In fact, Craig also admitted that he let Sedlik lead the conversation on pricing and had little to contribute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16:2-4, 24:4-7.) Nothing from Craig's testimony can be characterized as \"litigation\" or \"settlement strategy.\" (Dkt. No. 64 at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition to the utter lack of merit to Craig's motion to disqualify, the Court concludes that the motion was made vexatiously and in bad faith. Bad faith can be inferred if the action is completely without merit.\n   <em>\n    In re 60 E. 80th St. Equities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205058,11192350\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/109/\">\n    218 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such is the case here. With the full knowledge that Craig had not disclosed any confidential information, Liebowitz went ahead and filed this meritless motion. Liebowitz's bad faith is most evident in the omission of the details of the alleged conversation in the moving papers. Those details were fatal to Craig's motion, and obviously so under a basic understanding of the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel forced Defendants to prepare papers opposing his motion, and required the Court to hold a wasteful evidentiary hearing.
