SWEENEY II, JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Under the Copyright Act, an employer is deemed to be the initial author of a \"work made for hire,\" and thereby the initial owner of the copyright in the work. In order for this Court to render a declaration of authorship or ownership, an independent basis for federal jurisdiction beyond the Declaratory Judgment Act must exist. The Court now considers whether, when authorship and ownership in a copyright under the work made for hire doctrine by virtue of an employee acting within the scope of the employee's employment is asserted, the determination of authorship\n   arises under the Copyright Act; for the reasons stated herein, it does. Thus, this Court has original subject matter jurisdiction over the Declaratory Judgment claim, and supplemental jurisdiction over the Plaintiff's state law claims and Defendant's motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Jonathan Reimer's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).

R. Civ. P. 10 (c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   R2Fit manufactures and sells specialized exercise equipment that utilizes data from proprietary software to provide the user with a customized workout. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 6.) In October 2016, R2Fit hired Reimer to work as a personal trainer to R2Fit clients. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 10.) A few months after Reimer joined R2Fit, R2Fit contracted with a third-party software development company, SpaceTech Corporation (\"SpaceTech\"), to upgrade its proprietary software. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 15.) Reimer grew interested in helping R2Fit further develop and upgrade its software and expressed his desire to assist R2Fit and SpaceTech with the software upgrade project (the \"project\"). (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.) Accordingly, R2Fit expanded the scope of Reimer's employment to allow Reimer to work on the project and included Reimer's involvement in the project in the \"Software Development Contract\" R2Fit executed with SpaceTech. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 19; ECF No. 1 \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   R2Fit promoted Reimer to Chief Technology Officer in January 2017, despite Reimer's lack of formal training in software development or any other related subject matter. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 16; ECF No. 1 \u00b6 26.) In around March 2017, R2Fit became concerned that SpaceTech may be unable to finish the project to R2Fit's satisfaction. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 29.) But, Reimer informed R2Fit's Chief Executive Officer that he could finish the project without SpaceTech, if R2Fit provided him \"additional training and resources.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March 2017, R2Fit accepted Reimer's proposition and terminated its business relationship with SpaceTech. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 31.) R2Fit terminated the services contract between it and SpaceTech and made final payment to SpaceTech to \"obtain the source code for the software [SpaceTech] had ... developed up to that point.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 31.) Following R2Fit's final payment to SpaceTech, SpaceTech sent the source code (\"software code\") to R2Fit's CEO, Ariel Huskins (\"Huskins\"), who shared it with Reimer. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 32.) R2Fit then provided Reimer the requested \"paid mentor, [ ]educational resources, and [ ]company computer\" to facilitate Reimer's continued work on the project. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 34.) Reimer worked on the project from April 2017 to October 2017, writing and rewriting the software code for R2Fit's upgraded software. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 35.) Other R2Fit employees assisted Reimer in the writing and rewriting of the code, which proceeded under Huskins' direction. (ECF N. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) R2Fit paid Reimer for his work on the project. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2017, Reimer \"abruptly decided\" that \"because of his efforts\" he owned the software code and demanded additional compensation to \"license\" the software to R2Fit. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 40.) R2Fit's CEO demanded that Reimer return the software code to R2Fit, but Reimer refused, stating that he would only return the software code if R2Fit provided him additional compensation. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 41.) R2Fit refused to provide Reimer additional compensation, and on November 7, 2017, R2Fit terminated Reimer's employment. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 42.) In a letter confirming Reimer's termination, R2Fit demanded that Reimer return to R2Fit \"any and all confidential information and company property in his possession.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 43.) Reimer refused to return the software code, stating in his reply letter that \"R2Fit believes it owns software that I have written;\n   <strong>\n    It does not\n   </strong>\n   .\" (ECF No. 1-5.) Rather, Reimer \"alleged he wrote [the software] 'on [his] own time and using [his] personal computer.' \" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 44.) R2Fit then filed the present suit seeking a declaratory judgment confirming R2Fit as the rightful \"author and copyright owner of the software/source code under the 'works made for hire' doctrine of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C \u00a7 101\" and alleging several state law violations related to Reimer's possession of the software code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   R2Fit asserts five legal claims, the first under the Copyright Act and the others under Indiana law: (1) a request for declaratory judgment confirming R2Fit's authorship and ownership of the software code copyright under the Copyright Act; (2) misappropriation of trade secrets; (3) conversion; (4) criminal conversion; and (5) breach of contract. Reimer's Motion asserts that this Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over R2Fit's declaratory judgment claim, because this claim (1) raises only a question of Indiana law: whether \"Reimer was acting as an employee\n   <em>\n    under Indiana law\n   </em>\n   when he wrote [the] software,\" (ECF 33 at 5), and (2) does not present a \"case or controversy\" as required by Article III of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. art. 3 \u00a7 2, cl. 1. (ECF No. 33 at 6-7.) Reimer also argues that if the Court dismisses R2Fit's only purported federal law claim, the Court should decline to exercise its discretionary supplemental jurisdiction over R2Fit's state law claims. (ECF No. 33 at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over R2Fit's declaratory judgment claim. Reimer, though admitting that this action arises under the Copyright Act of 1976,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (EFC No. 25 \u00b6 2), argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because this case is about copyright ownership turning on whether Reimer was acting as an R2Fit employee under Indiana law when he wrote the software. Reimer further contends jurisdiction is lacking here because R2Fit fails to present a \"case or controversy,\" as R2Fit suffered no \"injury in fact\" or no immediacy of injury as required by Article III of the Constitution. (ECF No. 33 at 6.) The Court rejects Reimer's arguments and finds that the Court has subject matter jurisdiction for two reasons: (1) R2Fit's request for declaratory judgment or authorship/ownership \"arises under\" the Copyright Act, requiring the Court to interpret certain of the Act's provisions and conferring to the Court subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) R2Fit has sufficiently alleged an Article III \"case or controversy,\" because R2Fitand has shown that it suffered the requisite \"injury in fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Article III Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   R2Fit has Article III standing to bring its claim for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Article III of the United States Constitution limits the judicial power to deciding \"cases and controversies.\" U.S. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. To establish Article III standing, \"a plaintiff must show (1) it has suffered an 'injury in fact' that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Silha v.

Here, R2Fit has alleged a concrete injury-that Reimer is holding R2Fit's proprietary software code hostage to extort payment from R2Fit based on his assertion that his efforts of authorship-namely, writing the code-in the software make him the owner of the software. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 42.) The pleadings reveal at least one injury-that Reimer has denied R2Fit's authorship/ownership rights granted under the Copyright Act-that rises above the speculative level. Many injuries may radiate outward from this offense. Without a copy of the code, R2Fit cannot use it, cannot register it, cannot sue for infringement, cannot license it, cannot modify it, cannot exercise any of its rights that authorship arising under federal law would vest in R2Fit as original owner if the software is deemed a work made for hire. Next, R2Fit's complained of injury is traceable to Reimer, as Reimer is responsible for claiming ownership rights adverse to those of R2Fit and for refusing to return the code to R2Fit. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 40-46.) Finally, a declaration that R2Fit is the rightful author and thereby the initial owner of the software code copyright would be a favorable result for R2Fit, as such a declaration would resolve the dispute over ownership of the copyright. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 57.) Indeed, Reimer admits that if the code is a work made for hire, which is defined under and requires application of the Copyright Act, then R2Fit is the rightful author and owner. (ECF No. 33 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yet, Reimer maintains there is no \"immediacy of injury,\" in this case. But, while Reimer notes that this is not an infringement case, he relies on cases where there is no infringement alleged or imminent. No immediacy is pleaded. Such cases are inapposite here, where R2Fit contrarily alleges currently being denied access to the code it authored under the work made for hire doctrine.

Here, the remedy R2Fit seeks is a declaration that R2Fit is the rightful author and owner of the software code copyright, a declaration that requires the Court to analyze, pursuant to the Copyright Act, whether Reimer wrote the software code at issue as a \"work made for hire.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining a \"work made for hire\" as \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment\"). Here there is no dispute whether R2Fit employed Reimer (ECF 25 \u00b6 10) during the relevant period. Rather, Reimer urges that he did not write the software within the course and scope of that employment. Resolving this issue, and therefor ownership under the work made for hire doctrine, he concludes, is a matter of state law; namely, the definition of \"employee\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-3-6-1\">\n    Ind.

Not only does Reimer admit to being an employee, the cited definition comes from a worker's compensation statute and provides no guidance for determining whether a work was prepared within the scope of an employee's employment. Rather, courts look to general common law of agency.\n   <em>\n    Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v.

Not only may such law be deemed federal common law rather than state law,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605170\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/730/#p743\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but it is not the threshold issue, which is that \"work made for hire\" must be construed, and that is an analysis under the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Conversely, it is true that on occasion ownership of copyrights may be based on state law. For example, if the ownership arose by virtue of a contract, then state contract law would govern. But, the cases relating to such ownership are inapposite as R2Fit claims initial ownership by virtue of authorship under the work made for hire doctrine. Initial ownership follows authorship as provided for under the Copyright Act, not under state law. Thus, authorship and initial ownership may not only vest in the actual author of a work, but also in a coauthor, or a non-author such as an employer in the case of a work made for hire. Each of these is defined by and must be construed under the Copyright Act. Indeed, Reimer concedes that determinations of initial ownership based on \"joint authorship\" or \"co-authorship\" can raise federal issues, \"such as whether a party's 'contribution' was copyrightable under the Copyright Act.\" (ECF 41 at 2.) First, the Court notes that the very same issues could arise in this case. For example, whether the contributions by Huskins or the other R2Fit employees are copyrightable.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\"[O]nce a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.\") Second, Reimer's attempts to distinguish initial\n   ownership under joint authorship from initial ownership under work made for hire by stating without authority that determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists-as determined by state law-is what triggers the application of the work made for hire doctrine. The state tail does not wag the Copyright Act dog. Authorship, whether it be sole authorship, joint authorship or work-made-for-hire authorship, is determined under the Copyright Act and determines initial ownership in the copyright. Subsequent ownership, which is not at issue here, may be a matter of state law, as may be a determination of other matters, such as whether others contributed to the writing of the software, and whether those contributions fall under the work made for hire doctrine. At base, though, it is enough that this case involves the construction of \"work made for hire,\" which necessarily requires analysis under the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Having found that work made for hire is at issue, Indiana employment law is not at issue. Also, there is also no allegation that the other mutually exclusive means of creating a work made for hire-namely a person, such as an independent contractor hired to create the work-is at issue. Indeed, none of the pleadings implicate a contractual obligation relating to a non-employee writing the software, for example a software development agreement with Reimer. In any event, courts would look to the general common law of agency. If the portion of the code written by Reimer is a work made for hire, then R2Fit is under the Copyright Act the author and ownership vests in R2Fit by operation of federal law, unless there is a written agreement between the parties to the contrary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such written agreement is alleged to exist. Accordingly, R2Fit's action arises under the Copyright Act and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not under state law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , to the extent disposition of R2Fit's claim requires the Court to interpret the Copyright Act's definition of \"work made for hire\" in determining whether Reimer wrote the software code within the scope of his employment at R2Fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Barnhart v.

Indeed, the court in\n   <em>\n    Gaiman\n   </em>\n   had subject matter jurisdiction where the plaintiff requested a declaration similar to R2Fit's request. The\n   <em>\n    Gaiman\n   </em>\n   court explained that the plaintiff's request for a declaration of copyright co-ownership clearly implicated the \"work made for hire\" doctrine of the Copyright Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaiman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164121\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/360/644/#p652\">\n    360 F. 3d at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2004).

Accordingly, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity weigh in favor of the Court's exercise of supplemental jurisdiction to facilitate an efficient resolution of R2Fit's closely related federal and state claims.
