The officers present included defendants Crawford, Ziino, Stein, and Howell, and, at some point, supervising officers Amaro and Demond arrived. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P4 &amp; P17; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 39-40 &amp; 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants were watching the Dalton residence because they had received information from a confidential informant (\"CRI-1\") on May 13, 2015, that plaintiff was transporting and selling methamphetamine from this residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-1, Sealed SUF at P3 &amp; D8; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 41, 51, 55; Dkt. 54-4, Exh. 23, Sealed Declaration of Timothy Crawford (\"Sealed Crawford Decl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). CRI-1 had identified the Dalton residence as Goodin's residence and told Crawford that CRI-1 had seen Goodin with methamphetamine during the prior 20 days, that Goodin was selling a large quantity of methamphetamine from the Dalton residence, and that CRI-1 had received large quantities of narcotics from Goodin and had been asked to sell them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-1, Sealed SUF at D10 &amp; D12-D15; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). According to Crawford, CRI-1 was a reliable source because CRI-1 had provided information in the past leading to the arrest of suspects for narcotics and weapons violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-1, Sealed SUF at D8 &amp; D9; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 7). Based on the information provided by CRI-1, Crawford began conducting surveillance of the Dalton residence on May 18, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 28, 2015, the tenth day of surveillance of the Dalton residence, defendants did not see plaintiff or any cars departing from or arriving to the Dalton residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P43-P46; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 47 &amp; 116). Nor did defendants see any drugs being sold from or transported to or from the Dalton residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P30-P31; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 46, 105, 108, 109). However, at some point that morning, between 9 a.m. and 1:09 p.m.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crawford received a call from a confidential\n   informant\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"CI\"), notifying Crawford that plaintiff was at the house, and that he had two pounds of methamphetamine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-1, Sealed SUF at D23-D24; Dkt. 54-2, Exh. 13, Hobbs Attachment at 1; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Though Crawford knew he needed a search warrant to enter the Dalton residence, he believed there were exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless entry based on his belief that drugs were \"potentially\" going to be destroyed or transported from the Dalton residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P15 &amp; P16; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 42; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 11). Therefore, at about 1:09 p.m., the six officers\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   present entered the Dalton residence - without a warrant or consent - through the closed but unlocked front door, without knocking and with guns drawn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P19-P22 &amp; P26; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 79-81, 97, 102, 146-47). Upon entering, Crawford announced, \"Glendora Police Department. Search warrant. Demand Entry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P23; Dkt. 54-2, Hobbs Attachment at 2; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 147; Dkt. 53-4, July 10, 2015 Incident Report at ECF 1464).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After entering the Dalton residence without a warrant, defendants went through the house and cleared it room by room. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P53; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 123). When they approached plaintiff near his bedroom, the bedroom furthest from the front door, their guns were pointed at him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P54; Dkt. 53-10, Goodin Decl. at \u00b6 6; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 123). Defendants detained and handcuffed plaintiff, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P56; Dkt. 53-10, Goodin Decl. at \u00b6 6; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 123), and Crawford left the Dalton residence and returned to the Glendora Police Station to prepare a search warrant application. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P57; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 58 &amp; 122; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At 3:14 p.m., approximately two hours after defendants entered the Dalton residence without a warrant, a state court judge signed a search warrant with a Hobbs Attachment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was sealed to protect the confidentiality of the CI. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P54; Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 14; Dkt. 53-3, Exh. 3, Search Warrant Affidavit). After obtaining the warrant, Crawford returned to the Dalton residence and defendants proceeded to search the house. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 54-4, Sealed Crawford Decl. at \u00b6 16). Defendants found Norco pills stashed in the cat litter box in plaintiff's bedroom, which plaintiff admitted that he had hidden there. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at D48; Dkt. 53-17, Goodin Depo. at 42-43). They also found a cell phone that plaintiff had hidden in a fish tank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-17, Goodin Depo. at 64 &amp; 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the bedroom of plaintiff's roommate, defendants found a bag with a silver scale, a plastic grocery bag with methamphetamine, four quart-sized baggies, and a bottle with about a dozen individually packaged baggies of methamphetamine. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P64; Dkt. 53-4, July 10, 2015 Incident Report at 1465-66; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 157). These items were later tested for DNA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P66; Dkt. 53-4, July 10, 2015 Incident Report at ECF 1466; Dkt. 53-5, Exh. 4, DNA Analysis Report at ECF 1484-89; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 152). The test results were negative for plaintiff, and positive for plaintiff's roommate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-5, DNA Analysis Report at ECF 1484-89; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 152, 153, 156, 175-79, 181). Because of the DNA test results, the Glendora Police Department never presented the case to the district attorney to file criminal charges against plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P69; Dkt. 53-5, Supplemental Narrative Report at ECF 1489; Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 30 &amp; 168-69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes the granting of summary judgment \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The standard for granting a motion for summary judgment is essentially the same as for granting a directed verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-14, Exh. 6, \"April 25, 2017 Application\"; Dkt. 53-15, Exh. 7, \"May 5, 2017 Application\"). Other than providing plaintiff with the face sheet of the search warrant, the Glendora Police Department denied the Requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-10, Goodin Decl. at 2-3). On the first request, signed by Crawford, the boxes for \"under investigation\" and \"not available\" are checked, and on the second, those boxes are unchecked, but the document says, \"Per Crawford, do not release other than face sheet.\" (Dkt. 53-15, May 5, 2017 Application). In other words, the only justification provided by defendants for not disclosing the records was that the case was still under investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, plaintiff submitted evidence that raises a triable issue of fact as to whether that was indeed the case. Specifically, plaintiff submitted a report dated October 22, 2015, in which Crawford wrote: \"Due to the DNA analysis report, this case will not be filed against suspect Goodin. The case will be cleared internally without further action.\" (Dkt. 53-5, DNA Analysis Report at ECF 1484-89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 168-69). It is undisputed that the Glendora Police Department did not file criminal charges against plaintiff because of the DNA evidence. (Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P69;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 30, 152, 153, 156, 168-69, 175-79, 181). In addition, Crawford later testified that when he signed the form denying plaintiff's April 25, 2017, Request, he was no longer in the detective bureau, and \"was not conducting further follow-up\" on the case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53-7, Crawford Depo. at 30, 152, 153, 156, 168-69, 175-79, 181, 182-83). Finally, with respect to plaintiff's May 5, 2017, Request, the box for \"under investigation\" is not checked. (Dkt. 53-15, May 5, 2017 Application). In short, plaintiff's evidence, along with the undisputed fact that plaintiff submitted the Requests two years after the underlying incident, raises a material factual dispute as to whether the case was actually \"under investigation\" when defendants refused to provide plaintiff with the requested records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants also argue that because the Hobbs Attachment was ordered sealed, disclosing any of the records could have \"jeopardize[d] the safety of the [confidential informant(s) ], ... compromise[d] the criminal investigation, and ... violat[e]d ... the ... sealing order with respect to the Hobbs Attachment.\" (Dkt. 53, Joint Br. at 44). But defendants provide no explanation as to why they could not have simply excluded the Hobbs Attachment and otherwise responded to the Requests. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206254\">\n    at 43-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 53-1, SUF at P49) (defendants' response). However, the Hobbs Attachment does not set forth any specific facts supporting a reasonable belief that drugs were going to be destroyed or transported prior to defendants' warrantless entry into the Dalton residence.

Also, the evidence defendants offer regarding Crawford's purported belief that drug transportation was likely to occur is a conclusory and unsupported statement in the July 10, 2015 Incident Report - prepared approximately six weeks after the incident - that, \"[b]ased on the information [Crawford] had developed there was the possibility the narcotics could be moved[.]\" (Dkt. 53-4, July 20, 2015 Incident Report at ECF 1464). Defendants provide no specific facts or evidence to describe what information Crawford had developed.
