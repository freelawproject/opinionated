(collectively, STK)'s Response [#82] in opposition, and World Class's Reply [#92] in support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having reviewed the documents, the governing law, the arguments of counsel, and the file as a whole, the Court now enters the following opinion and orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute concerns a lease agreement between World Class and STK. STK is a restaurant group that sought to open a restaurant in Dallas, Texas. Resp. [#82-1] Segal Decl. at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Towards that end, STK entered into discussions with World Class in 2014 regarding a potential lease of retail space at 1899 McKinney Avenue (the Premises).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Lease Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the lease negotiations, STK discovered the Premises lacked onsite parking and expressed concern about its ability to secure nearby offsite parking for its planned restaurant. Mot. Summ. J. [#79] at 106. In an attempt to allay these concerns, World Class undertook a search for offsite parking in early 2015. Internal emails exchanged within World Class around that time suggest World Class had considered eight possible parking lots in the vicinity, of which four were unavailable. Mot. Seal [#83-1] Ex. A at 2-6. World Class concluded the other four lots were likely only available on a month-to-month basis \"if they are available at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By May 2015, neither party had identified a parking solution, and on May 17, 2015, STK proposed \"add[ing] a contingency [to the proposed lease agreement] for finding acceptable offsite parking for intended use\" because \"[o]perations has not had a chance to secure a lot.\" Segal Decl. at 8-9. World Class responded that there was \"plenty of parking nearby in garages and surface lots\" and assured STK that it would \"help in any way as needed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But World Class resisted adding a parking contingency to the Lease Agreement on the ground that the addition of another contingency would \"throw a monkey wrench in execution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   STK ultimately conceded and informed World Class that it was \"okay forgoing a parking contingency\" but asked World Class to provide information on \"the company that provided parking services for the previous tenant.\" Segal Decl. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Lease Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Lease Agreement and a corresponding Guaranty Agreement were executed by the parties on June 5, 2015, and several of their provisions are relevant here. Mot. Summ. J. [#79] Ex. 2-A (Lease Agreement) at 62; Am. Compl. [#14] at 52-53 (Guaranty Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the Lease Agreement contains an \"as-is\" clause specifying that the Premises were to be leased \"as-is\" and without reliance upon any warranty as to the fitness of the Premises for any particular purpose. Lease Agreement \u00a7 3.1. The \"as-is\" clause does, however, require World Class to deliver the Premises to STK \"in compliance with\" all local codes and regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, the Lease Agreement contains a parking disclaimer clause. Lease Agreement \u00a7 3.2. Under the terms of that clause, STK acknowledged and agreed that the Premises \"may not contain sufficient parking\" for the Premises's intended use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In turn, World Class agreed \"at the request of [STK] but at no cost to [World Class], to assist [STK] in identifying and locating offsite parking.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Third, the Lease Agreement contains a provision establishing a contingency period. Under the terms of that provision, if the Premises were unable to be operated for their intended use because STK cannot \"obtain the necessary permits\" despite using \"commercially reasonable best efforts,\" STK could terminate the Lease Agreement so long as STK provided written\n   notice on or before August 3, 2015. Lease Agreement \u00a7 2.2(ii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fourth and finally, the Lease Agreement contains provisions affecting the timing of STK's rent obligations. Under Lease Agreement \u00a7 1.1 (i), the Rent Commencement Date falls on the earlier of (i) the date on which STK opened its restaurant to the public, or (ii) February 1, 2016, \"subject to extension as provided for in Section 28.18.\" In turn, Lease Agreement \u00a7 28.18 provides the Rent Commencement Date \"shall be extended by one day for each such day of delay\" caused by a \"Force Majeure Event.\" The Lease Agreement defines a \"Force Majeure Event\" as \"any delay[ ] due to strikes, riots, acts of God, shortages of labor or materials, war, governmental laws, regulations or restrictions or any other causes of any kind whatsoever which are beyond the reasonable control of such party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Parking Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the parties signed the Lease Agreement, subsequent attempts to locate offsite parking failed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Segal Decl. at 2 (\"In July 2015, One Group retained Lone Star, a parking consulting company, to assist in securing the deeded parking spaces needed for operation of a restaurant ... [but] [n]either One Group nor its consultants were ever able to secure the required number of deeded parking spaces under Dallas' local codes and regulations ...\"). Yet, in spite of the obvious obstacle the parking situation posed to opening a restaurant, STK failed to provide written notice within the contingency period of intent to terminate the Lease Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Segal Decl. at 3. STK also failed to pay its rent, and in March 2016, STK received a letter from World Class demanding that STK begin paying rent due under the terms of the Lease Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   STK Group then made two rent payments to World Class \"in the hopes that the needed parking would be found.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The needed parking was not found. In April 2016, STK informed World Class it was \"unable to get car parking,\" that it had not received any substantial assistance from World Class,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the City of Dallas (the City) was unwilling to grant STK a parking variance. Segal Decl. at 3. As a result of these obstacles, STK concluded it could not proceed with the restaurant and ceased making rent payments to World Class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Around the same time, STK learned a prior lessee had encountered similar parking problems and had applied for a parking variance from the City.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. In conjunction with the parking variance application, the prior owner of 1899 McKinney Avenue had written a letter to the City asserting the owner had \"tried in vain\" to secure an offsite parking agreement but had been unable to do so. Segal Decl. at 4. Despite this entreaty, the City had denied the variance application in January 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In October 2016, World Class and STK arranged an in-person meeting to discuss how to proceed. Segal Decl. at 4. STK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   alleges the parties agreed at this meeting that if they were unable to secure parking or a variance for operation of the restaurant, the parties would cancel the Lease Agreement and \"walk[ ] away with no claim on the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notwithstanding the parties' alleged agreement to cancel the Lease Agreement if parking could not be found, World Class filed suit in May 2017 alleging breach of contract. Notice Removal [#1-1] Ex. A (Pet.) at 13-14. STK then removed the action to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and filed counterclaims alleging fraud in the inducement, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract. Not. Removal [#1] at 2-3; Countercls. [#21] at 10-15. World Class responded by asserting a fraud claim against STK alleging STK had misrepresented its \"attention to detail\" and financial condition when, in reality, it \"could not meet the obligations under the Lease ... [and] Guaranty.\" [#48] at 14-15. World Class now moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract claims as well as on STK's affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Mot. Summ. J. [#79]. This pending motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mot. Summ. J. [#79] at 1. The Court first considers the parties' breach of contract claims and counterclaims. It then turns to STK's affirmative defenses and noncontractual counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In order to prevail on a breach of contract claim, the plaintiff must establish (1) a valid contract existed; (2) the plaintiff performed or tendered performance; (3) the defendant breached the contract; and (4) the plaintiff sustained damages as a result of the breach.\n   <em>\n    Valero Mktg. &amp; Supply Co. v.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties raise four separate breach of contract claims: (1) World Class alleges STK breached the Lease Agreement; (2) STK alleges World Class breached the Lease Agreement; (3) World Class alleges One Group breached the Guaranty Agreement; and (4) STK alleges World Class breached a subsequent oral agreement that STK and World Class would cancel the Lease Agreement if STK could not find parking. The Court examines each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Breach of Lease Agreement by STK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   World Class argues it is entitled to summary judgment on its claim that STK breached the Lease Agreement. Mot. Summ. J. [#79] at 10-11. In response, STK argues summary judgment is inappropriate because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to (1) whether a valid contract exists; (2) whether World Class performed or tendered performance; (3) whether STK breached the Lease Agreement; and (4) the amount of damages sustained by World Class. Resp. [#82] at 17-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Existence of a Valid Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, STK argues there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a valid contract exists because there is a factual question as to whether World Class fraudulently induced STK Group to sign the Lease and Guaranty Agreements by reassuring STK that there was \"plenty of parking nearby in garages and surface lots.\" Resp. [#82] at 17-18. This argument misses the mark because fraudulent inducement does not preclude formation of a valid contract. To the contrary, fraudulent inducement \"is a particular species of fraud that arises only in the context of a contract and requires the existence of a contract as part of its proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Haase v. Glazner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9457685\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/62/795/#p798\">\n    62 S.W.3d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798-99 (Tex. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, STK argues there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a valid contract exists because there is a factual question as to whether performance was impossible. Resp. [#82] at 19. This argument also fails. Though impossibility can serve as an affirmative defense to a breach of contract claim, STK does not explain whether or how impossibility prevents formation of a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. [#82] at 19\n   (arguing impossibility \"relieves a party\n   <em>\n    to a contract\n   </em>\n   of its duties\" (emphasis added)). The Court therefore concludes STK has failed to carry its burden of persuasion on this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, STK argues there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a valid contract exists because there is a factual question as to whether World Class failed to deliver the premises \"in compliance with all local codes and regulations ... with respect to the permitted use.\" Resp. [#82] at 17; Lease Agreement \u00a7 3.1. But this argument goes towards whether World Class performed under the Lease Agreement-by delivering the premises-and has no bearing on whether or not a valid contract existed in the first place. And in any event, STK fails to identify any code or regulation as to which the Premises were noncompliant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. [#82] at 17, 19-20 (arguing that World Class must have failed to deliver the premises because \"operation of a restaurant ... is impossible under applicable laws and regulations.\"). In light of these deficiencies, the Court concludes that STK has failed to carry its burden of persuasion as to this argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Performance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition to arguing that World Class failed to perform by failing to deliver the premises, STK also argues that World Class failed to perform by \"failing to cooperate\" with STK's efforts to seek permits and failing to assist STK in identifying and locating offsite parking.

STK was delayed in opening its restaurant because it could not secure sufficient offsite parking to comply with local rules and regulations prescribed by the City. Segal Decl. at 3. Thus, STK was arguably delayed by both a cause \"beyond the reasonable control\" of STK-the unavailability of parking-as well as by \"governmental laws, regulations[,] or restrictions\" which prohibited STK from operating a restaurant without such parking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lease Agreement \u00a7 28.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Though the unavailability of parking and the City's parking restrictions both satisfy the requirement that Force Majeure Events be beyond the reasonable control of both parties, World Class argues these circumstances nevertheless fall outside the scope of the clause because the clause implicitly excludes occurrences or causes which the party might have reasonably anticipated. Resp. [#82] at 15. To the extent the force majeure clause is ambiguous, World Class might be able to establish at trial that such an implicit limitation exists.

Thus, a fact issue exists as to whether the force majeure clause encompasses events anticipated by the parties and whether the unavailability of parking triggered the clause.

The Court therefore denies World Class's Motion for summary judgment as to this counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment on World Class's breach of contract claims as well as on STK's claim that World Class breached an October 18, 2016 oral agreement to cancel the Lease Agreement if STK could not find parking. The Court also concludes factual issues preclude summary judgment on STK's fraudulent inducement counterclaim/affirmative defense and negligent misrepresentation counterclaim as well as STK's affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages. But the Court grants summary judgment on STK's affirmative defenses of waiver, release, estoppel, laches, unclean hands, and failure to satisfy a condition precedent, on STK's fraudulent concealment counterclaim, and on STK's claim that World Class breached the Lease Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that STK's Motion to Seal [#83] is GRANTED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that World Class's Motion to Seal [#100] is GRANTED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that World Class's Motion for Summary Judgment [#79] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as described in this opinion; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that World Class's Motion to Strike [#103] is DISMISSED AS MOOT because the evidence which World Class sought to strike did not alter or affect the Court's disposition of World Class's summary judgment motion; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IT IS FINALLY NOTED that the Court's rulings herein are without prejudice\n   to any potential evidentiary objections the parties may seek to raise at trial.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The Court grants the parties' related motions to file documents under seal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    STK Motion to Seal [#83]; World Class Motion to Seal [#100].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In the interest of consistency, all page number citations refer to CM/ECF pagination.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    Mot.

STK suggests World Class did not deliver the premises in compliance with local rules and regulations because the premises did not contain sufficient parking.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp. [#82] at 17, 19-20. But STK has not identified any local rule or regulation requiring the premises to contain sufficient onsite parking, and presumably for this reason, the Lease Agreement explicitly contemplated a search for offsite parking. Lease Agreement \u00a7 3.2. Because there is no suggestion that local rules and regulations required onsite parking and because the Lease Agreement did not require World Class to deliver offsite parking in conjunction with its delivery of the premises, the Court concludes there is no genuine dispute that World Class did, in fact, perform by delivering the premises under the terms of the Lease Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v.
