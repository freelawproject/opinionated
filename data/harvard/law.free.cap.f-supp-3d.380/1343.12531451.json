Jiaxing further argues that the fact that the data from the Philippines groups together low carbon and mid carbon steel should not weigh against its specificity because that would only tend to \"conservatively overestimate\" the surrogate value generated by Commerce, as steel with higher carbon concentrations tends to be more expensive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044041\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/1352/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of these arguments establish that Commerce's selection of Thai data over that of the Philippines is unreasonable.

Commerce's calculation of Jiaxing's surrogate financial ratios as related to labor is thus unsupported by substantial evidence and is remanded\n   for further explanation or reconsideration consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. B &amp; H Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Jiaxing makes three arguments regarding B &amp; H costs. First, Jiaxing argues that Commerce unreasonably selected the World Bank's \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report to value Jiaxing's B &amp; H costs instead of the reported costs of Pakfood Company Limited (\"Pakfood\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Br. at 36-40. Second, Jiaxing argues that if Commerce is permitted to use the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report, it should exclude costs associated with letters of credit in calculating B &amp; H costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-42. Third, Jiaxing argues that Commerce's assumption in the calculation of B &amp; H costs that each shipping container weighs 10,000 kilograms is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-45. Defendant responds that Commerce properly calculated the surrogate value for B &amp; H costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 27-31. The court sustains Commerce's reliance on the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report to value B &amp; H costs. However, the court remands Commerce's decision not to make adjustments for costs associated with acquiring letters of credit and the weight assigned to shipping containers in the calculation of B &amp; H costs are unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In calculating normal value, Commerce subtracts \"costs, charges, and expenses incident to bringing the foreign like product from the original place of shipment to the place of delivery to the purchaser.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(B)(ii). The subtraction of these costs from a respondent's normal value is intended to allow a fair comparison to net (or \"ex-factory\") prices, which are not affected by the extra costs experienced by an exporter in shipping products around the world. These movement expenses include B &amp; H costs, among others. Commerce calculates a surrogate value for movement expenses in nonmarket economies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Commerce valued Jiaxing's B &amp; H costs using the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 23-26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Commerce's Prelim. S. V. Memo at Ex. 15. Commerce selected the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report because it was from the primary surrogate country and met \"all of the Department's criteria\" for surrogate values, including that the data was \"only two months outside the [period of review] and ... based on a broad survey of costs in the Thailand market.\" Final Decision Memo at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Commerce reasonably determined that the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report constituted the best available information,\n   as compared to the reported B &amp; H costs of Pakfood, because it \"reflects a broader experience than simply the experience of a single company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jiaxing argues that the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report is unrepresentative of a broad market average because it is \"based upon a hypothetical company's one-time hypothetical shipment of hypothetical merchandise at a hypothetical weight with a hypothetical value.\" Pls.' Br. at 39. Jiaxing does not, however, substantiate why being \"hypothetical\" should render the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report unrepresentative. Commerce's response to this argument is reasonably discernible from its discussion of the merits of relying on the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report over the data from Pakfood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 24-25. Commerce explained that the Doing Business reports represent a broad market average because they are based on \"companies' actual experience\" and to prepare them the World Bank gathers \"comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and over time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. In contrast, Jiaxing's proposed alternative - the reported B &amp; H costs of Pakfood - relies simply on the costs of a single exporter. Commerce's use of the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report is thus supported by substantial evidence as Commerce reasonably found that the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report was more representative of a broad market average than the alternative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although Jiaxing argues that the \"Doing Business 2014: Thailand\" report is unreliable because it does not specify whether the contributors have any relevant experience, Commerce reasonably inferred that the contributors had relevant experience.

However, in applying this standard, the Commerce Department should make appropriate adjustments to compensate for quality differences in the merchandise under investigation and the comparable merchandise from the benchmark country. The purpose of making such adjustments is to ensure that the foreign market value assigned to the merchandise under investigation fairly reflects any differential due to inferior or superior quality.

Br. at 15. Jiaxing argued that Commerce arbitrarily applied a higher standard of proof regarding the alleged distortion of imports into Thailand than it ordinarily applies regarding allegedly subsidized imports.\n    <em>\n     Pls.' Br. at 15\n    </em>\n    . However, the analogy is inapposite as the factual issues raised by the Customs Reports are dissimilar to those raised by subsidized imports.

This is a preliminary antidumping determination in which Commerce stated it would disregard import data relating to products from India, Indonesia and South Korea in the surrogate valuation of stainless steel sinks from the PRC when using Thailand as the primary surrogate country because it had reason to believe or suspect those products were subsidized.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Stainless Steel Sinks Prelim.

Br. at 15 (emphasis omitted). Rather, the evidence Commerce relied upon for disregarding imports from those countries in the Stainless Steel Sinks Prelim. Memo was that it had \"found in other proceedings that these countries maintain broadly available, non-industry-specific export subsidies\" and that consequently \"it is reasonable to infer that all exports from these countries to all markets may be subsidized.\" Stainless Steel Sinks Prelim. Memo at 17. Jiaxing's argument fails because the Customs Reports are not analogous to a prior finding by Commerce that a country maintains broadly available, non-industry specific export subsidies, and thus a comparison of the evidential weight of the two does not indicate that Commerce arbitrarily employed a higher standard of proof in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    In its brief, Jiaxing restates a number of its arguments as to reliability made at the administrative level.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'
