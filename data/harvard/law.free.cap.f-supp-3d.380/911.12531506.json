In early October, Chris Hanson told John Hanson that in order to obtain financing to close the Buildings' sale, he needed to generate cash. Varland Decl. Ex. A at 3. Chris Hanson and Berkey suggested that AVC assign the Lease Rights to MelTel for a lump-sum cash payment, which could be used to facilitate the sale of the Building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20577.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   John Hanson appears to have agreed to the proposal and to that end, on October 8, John Hanson told MelTel that the Lease Rights assignment would be in AVC's name, rather than Hillside's.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20577.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   John Hanson explained to MelTel that Chris Hanson had not yet been able to obtain financing to purchase the Buildings and it was uncertain when he would be able to do so.

Varland Aff. Exs. C, E. MelTel, in turn, took possession of the Assignment and subsequently recorded it with the Dakota County District Court on December 4. Boylan Supp. Decl.

Later on November 10, MelTel entered a separate agreement whereby it again agreed to \"wire the [Lease Rights] purchase proceeds ... to [AVC] ....\" Boylan Supp. Decl. Exs. 33, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Then, on the morning of November 12, MelTel received two landlord settlement statements, purportedly from AVC, with wiring instructions for the $ 440,000 payment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20577.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 39, 40.

Consistent with that instruction, MelTel wired $ 421,734.17 to Berkey's trust account. Boylan Decl.

Boylan Decl. Ex. 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   John Hanson was not aware of the wire transfer to Berkey and AVC did not receive any of the $ 421,734.17 payment. Varland Decl. Ex. A. at 7. The record does not show whether MelTel tendered the $ 35,000 payment. MelTel testified that it is not aware of any previous situation in which it paid the lease purchase price to an entity other than the title or property owner or lease landlord. Bauermeister Dep. at 94:25-96:11. Hillside ultimately was unable to secure financing and never purchased the Buildings. Varland Decl. Ex. A at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

AVC later agreed to assign its interest in the Buildings' to Lighthouse for the benefit of creditors, and in exchange, Lighthouse would conduct the audit and, if necessary, pursue legal action on AVC's behalf. Lighthouse agreed to reassign the Buildings back to AVC at the conclusion of its investigation and any related legal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During the course of the investigation, Lighthouse discovered that Chris Hanson had orchestrated a number of fraudulent real estate transactions involving assignments and other encumbrances on the Buildings.

Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   MelTel first asserts that Lighthouse's quiet-title claim fails as a matter of law because Lighthouse has not alleged that it engaged in fraud. However, MelTel cites no authority, and the court can find none, stating that the only basis for a quiet-title action is fraud. Indeed, \u00a7 559.01 simply requires that a plaintiff have \"possession of real property\" and that the defendant be \"another who claims an ... interest ... adverse to the person bringing the action\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   such that the court may determine the rights of the parties.

Specifically, MelTel argues that once John Hanson signed the Assignment on AVC's behalf and MelTel took possession of the Assignment, the Assignment was legally delivered, and consequently, MelTel became the lawful and indefeasible owner of the Lease Rights. MelTel further argues that its failure to remit the purchase payment to AVC does not invalidate its property interest because AVC legally conveyed the Assignment when it was signed and MelTel took possession. According to MelTel, AVC's recourse is limited to recovering damages related to payment. The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Delivery of a real property interest \"is effective if the grantor manifests a clear intention to part presently and unconditionally with all control ....\"\n   <em>\n    Mollico v.

The Assignment plainly states that MelTel's interest in the Lease Rights is subject to certain conditions. There is no dispute that a significant condition, that MelTel tender a $ 440,000 purchase payment, did not occur. In addition, MelTel failed to pay the second $ 35,000 payment as was also required under the Assignment. The court cannot conclude that the sale contemplated by the Assignment was fully delivered on November 10, given that MelTel did not pay AVC as required. Under these circumstances, the evidence does not show that AVC intended to presently and unconditionally surrender its interest in the Lease Rights on November 10, when the Assignment was signed.

Despite Chris Hanson's July 2014 representations that he was the Buildings' owner and/or landlord, MelTel was aware that he was neither by August 2014. In addition, by September 2014, MelTel had actual notice that Chris Hanson had not secured financing to purchase the Buildings. In mid-October 2014, MelTel was again on notice that Chris Hanson and Hillside still had not secured financing. In early November 2014, MelTel agreed several times to make the purchase payment to AVC, and not to Hillside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nevertheless, on November 12, MelTel made the purchase payment to Hillside through Berkey. Given these facts, a jury could find that MelTel had at least implied notice of AVC's right to the purchase payment. At a minimum, a jury could conclude that MelTel had a duty to ask why the wiring instructions had changed and why the previous payment agreements were no longer in place. Indeed, there is no indication in the record that MelTel ever questioned why the wiring instructions changed at the last minute. This is particularly curious given that there is no indication in the record that John Hanson ever told MelTel that the previous payment agreements had been rescinded or modified. MelTel could have simply contacted John Hanson before wiring the purchase payment to Hillside to verify the conflicting instructions, but it failed to do so. There are certainly facts that may explain why MelTel chose not to inquire, but they are for the jury to weigh in deciding the issue. As a result, the court must deny MelTel's motion for summary judgment on the quiet-title claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Lighthouse argues that MelTel has been unjustly enriched because it did not pay AVC for the Lease Rights and is collecting the proceeds under the Lease Rights. Lighthouse also argues that MelTel's retention of the Lease Rights under these circumstances is morally wrong. MelTel responds that it is entitled to summary judgment on the unjust enrichment claim because Lighthouse has not shown that it acted illegally or unlawfully.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In Minnesota, the elements of an unjust enrichment claim are: \"(1) a benefit conferred; (2) the defendant's appreciation and knowing acceptance of the benefit; and (3) the defendant's acceptance and retention of the benefit under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for him to retain it without paying for it.\"\n   <em>\n    Dahl v.
