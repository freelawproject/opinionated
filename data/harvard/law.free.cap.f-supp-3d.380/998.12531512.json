ECF No. 552.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for final approval of the class action settlement, asserting the $ 40 million settlement fund-for the benefit of almost 26,000 dairy-farmer claimants-is fair, reasonable, and adequate. ECF No. 575. Plaintiffs also move for attorney fees, costs, and service awards. ECF No. 567. Defendants do not oppose.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court will approve the settlement, award 33% of the fund in attorney fees, allow reimbursement of approx. $ 825,000 in litigation costs, and grant service awards of $ 45,000 for each current named Plaintiff and $ 5,000 for the former named Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Members of the class are dairy farmers who received payment for sales of raw milk, as calculated by Federal Milk Marking Orders (\"FMMO's\"). ECF No. 513 at p. 2 (Fourth Amended Complaint, the \"4AC\"). The USDA set the FMMO rates by surveying large milk sellers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One organization that provided survey data to the USDA was Defendant DairyAmerica, a marketing association that included Defendant California Dairies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2009, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants, alleging that between 2002-2007, DairyAmerica \"shape[d] the raw milk prices paid to farmers by [fraudulently] modifying the data it reported to the USDA each week\" through various schemes and artifices. ECF No. 1. at \u00b6 6. Defendants' alleged actions \"depressed raw milk prices and protected the co-op members' profits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Defendants deny these contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the currently-operative 4AC, Plaintiffs allege claims of negligent misrepresentation, intentional misrepresentation, and RICO conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 513.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After litigating this case for nine years,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties reached a settlement agreement under guidance from a mediator. The agreement releases all claims against Defendants related to those expressed in the 4AC (and prior complaints), and governs the following proposed class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All dairy farmers located in the United States who sold raw milk that was priced according to a Federal Milk Marketing Order during the period January 1, 2002 through April 30, 2007. Excluded from the Class are California Dairies and DairyAmerica, any entity in which California Dairies or DairyAmerica have a controlling interest, and their respective legal representatives, heirs, and successors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ECF No. 575-1 at \u00b6 1.4 (Ex. A, the \"Settlement Agreement\"). This settlement class includes approx. 84,000 dairy farmers, each of whom was eligible to receive a portion of the $ 40 million settlement fund-proportional to the amount of milk they sold between 2002-2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 12, 20. In September 2018, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. ECF No. 559.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Notice to Class, Exclusions, Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court appointed Rust Consulting to manage the notice procedure and processing of claims. ECF No. 559. In February 2019, Rust notified the Court of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   - After compiling and collating a list of every farmer who sold milk under the FMMOs, and after accounting for duplicate addresses, change of addresses, and supplemental information, Rust mailed notice of the class settlement and claim forms to 83,686 class members. Of these, Rust states 77,646 were actually delivered to the intended recipient;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   - In late 2018, a summary notice of the settlement was published in both the\n   <em>\n    Progressive Dairyman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    American Dairyman\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   - Rust has responded to 1,371 emails and 6,399 phone calls, and maintains the website was visited over 23,000 times;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   - As of May 1, 2019, the company received 25,707 completed claim forms and 80 requests for exclusion from the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 575-2. Additionally, the Court received seven written objections, only three of which were timely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF. Nos. 570, 572, 573, 577, 578, 579, and 580.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Motion for Final Approval and for Attorney Fees, Costs, and Service Awards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for final approval of the settlement, asserting it is fair, reasonable, and adequate. ECF No. 575. Plaintiffs calculate that, assuming a full award of fees, costs and expenses, the net settlement amount distributable will be approx. $ 26 million, to be distributed on a\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   basis to the 26,000 claimants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1-2. The amounts distributed to each Approved Claimant is to be determined by dividing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    the volume of the Claimant's total raw Grade A milk produced and pooled on the FMMO's\n   </em>\n   the total volume of raw Grade A milk produced and pooled on the FMMO's\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ECF No. 575-1 at \u00b6 8.7. The parties have agreed that any residual amounts left in the settlement fund are to be re-distributed, proportionally, to the Approved Claimants or, if not, then to a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   beneficiary selected by Plaintiffs' Counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.11. Upon final approval, the settlement funds (and interest) will be distributed from an already-established escrow account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Counsel for Plaintiffs have requested $ 13,333,333 in attorney fees, approx. $ 825,000 in litigation expenses, a $ 90,000 service award for each named Plaintiff, and a $ 10,000 service award for each former Plaintiff. ECF No. 567. These awards are payable from the $ 40 million\n   fund.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants have not opposed these fee requests.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Fairness Hearing and Post-Hearing Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 18, 2019, the Court held the fairness hearing concerning final approval of the agreement and Plaintiffs' motion for fees, costs, and awards. Plaintiffs indicated additional claims and exclusions had been submitted, and they would provide the Court with a written submission of up-to-date figures shortly. The parties otherwise reiterated their support for the agreement. The Court also requested information concerning the claims administrator's payment, the effort made by named Plaintiffs to justify any service award, and an update on an objector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 1, 2019, Plaintiffs provided the final list of exclusions (80), detailed the claims administrator's process for resolving disputed amounts as well as its request for fees, and submitted declarations from the named Plaintiffs in support of the service award.\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Final class certification is appropriate, and the notice given was appropriate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court previously conditionally certified the proposed settlement class and determined that the requirements of Rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   23(a) and (b) had been met. ECF No. 559 at pp. 4-8. The Court also previously stated that \"the mailing and publication of the Long Notice and Summary Notice ... constitute the best notice practicable under the circumstances, are sufficient notice, and comply fully with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the due process requirements of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court's findings on these issues have not changed, and no objections to class certification were raised. Accordingly, there is no need for the Court to repeat the analysis on these issues here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

This, coupled with the uniform nature of the payments made to the tens of thousands of farmers-due to the formula set by the FMMO's-weigh both in favor of class certification and in favor of a Plaintiffs' negligent misrepresentation claim against DairyAmerica.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn K.

Thus, using Plaintiffs calculations, a $ 40 million settlement represents a 48% recovery for the class as a whole, and close to full recovery for all actual claimants.

Additionally, the Court notes that the scope of the release only covers up through the effective date, so if these objectors believe-after a reasonable inquiry into the facts-that the misreporting is truly ongoing, nothing in this settlement would preclude another such suit from being brought (assuming Congress's action in 2007 would allow for such a suit).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Court similarly reasons through the objections of Mr. Spooner (ECF 572) and Mr. Myers (ECF 580) as to the scope of the release. Mr. Myers objects to his being barred from \"any lawsuits,\" and Mr. Spooner questions why the release has been \"tailored to cover conduct up to the present day.\" However, courts will only sustain objections to releases where the agreement bars additional, unrelated claims; the release in this agreement is specifically tailored to the misrepresentation and RICO claims concerning Defendants' misreporting, and does not bar other lawsuits against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    In re Anthem, Inc.

Further, the Court notes that any remaining amounts in the fund are to be distributed to the claimants on a pro rata basis.

However, as of the day of the fairness hearing, no such\n    <em>\n     pro hac vice\n    </em>\n    application had been submitted because Mr. Haar had failed to secure local counsel. Despite this, Mr. Haar appeared at the fairness hearing requesting to speak on behalf of the six objectors; the Court refused his request for the following reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    First, the Court reiterated this district's rules concerning\n    <em>\n     pro hac vice\n    </em>\n    requests.
