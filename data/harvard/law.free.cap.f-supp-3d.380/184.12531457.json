(Docket No. 1.) The United States moved for summary judgment, (Docket No. 32), and the Court referred the matter to Magistrate Judge Bruce McGiverin, (Docket Nos. 43-44). The magistrate judge issued a thorough and well-analyzed Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\"), recommending that the Court grant the United States' motion for summary judgment. (Docket No. 57.) Plaintiffs objected to the R &amp; R, (Docket No. 62), and the United States responded to their objection, (Docket No. 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In their objections, plaintiffs argue that the magistrate judge erred in finding that their claims required expert testimony to survive summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 62 at pp. 5-6.) Plaintiffs argue that their claims \"do not necessarily require the production of an expert witness to successfully establish a causal nexus between the Plaintiffs['] injuries and the Government's actions as a tortfeasor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They claim that their testimony, as fact witnesses, will be sufficient to establish defendant's negligence regarding removal of an object from Rodriguez-Sanchez's abdomen on May 2, 2011, his in-home fall on April 14, 2011, and his consent to the March 1st and 15th surgeries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    at p. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs appear to be arguing that their medical malpractice claims qualify for the narrow \"common knowledge exception\" because the alleged negligence is sufficiently \"blatant or patent\" to lay persons and can therefore be proven without the use of an expert medical witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 62 at pp. 5-6. As explained in the R &amp; R, however, it is not blatantly or patently obvious that leaving a \"dark silver, three- to four-and-a-half inches long, flexible, and malleable\" object, possibly a suture, in a patient is negligent. (Docket No. 57 at p. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Additionally, plaintiffs' fact testimony is insufficient to show that defendants' discharge of Rodriguez-Sanchez caused his fall on April 14, 2011, because analysis of recovery time and interaction of medicines is \"beyond the knowledge of laymen.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Before his surgery, he met with a VA surgeon and signed an informed-consent form. SUMF \u00b6 4. That form indicates the known risks of the various surgical procedures that were going to be performed. SUMF \u00b6 5. The medical records indicate that no complications were\n   reported from the surgery and that a complete instrument, needle, drape, and sponge count was performed. SUMF \u00b6 3. There is a genuine dispute as to whether Rodriguez or his son received any post-surgery instructions about caring for the wound. SUMF \u00b6 7; Docket No. 39-3 at 136:21-137:1-16. Yet, his medical records from March 6 and 8 do not indicate that he reported any post-surgery complications that were causing him pain. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 11, Rodriguez was seen at the VA hospital to treat a \"gout attack.\" SUMF \u00b6 10. Suffering from abdominal pain and various other symptoms, he returned to the VA hospital on March 14. SUMF \u00b6 11. He was readmitted to the hospital after a partial small bowel obstruction was discovered. SUMF \u00b6 11. That same date, a gastric-decompression procedure was performed. SUMF \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Second Surgery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 15, what appeared to be a complete obstruction in Rodriguez's bowel was discovered and the possibility of surgery was discussed with him. SUMF \u00b6 13. He met with VA medical staff to discuss the procedure and signed an informed-consent form. SUMF \u00b6 16. After doing so, various surgical procedures were performed. SUMF \u00b6 14. His medical records do not indicate any complications during the procedure, and a complete instrument, needle, drape, and sponge count was performed. SUMF \u00b6 15. After this surgery, a post-operative infection was discovered and treated with antibiotics. SUMF \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After he was discharged from the hospital on March 22, VA medical staff assisted Rodriguez with caring for his wound. SUMF \u00b6 20. He was also provided with literature on caring for his wound that he admittedly did not read. SUMF \u00b6 21. On March 28, Rodriguez visited the VA hospital, and the staples on his wound were removed. SUMF \u00b6 23. He returned the next day, however, complaining that the abdominal wound was draining fluid. SUMF \u00b6 24. At that time, an abscess was discovered and a small incision was made to permit cleaning and drainage. SUMF \u00b6 25. After this procedure was performed, he understood that the post-surgery instructions he received on March 22 to care for his wound remained applicable. SUMF \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In early April 2011, he was treated for a superficial wound infection. SUMF \u00b6 27. On April 14, he fell in his home, suffered head trauma, was admitted to the VA hospital, and received sutures on his head. SUMF \u00b6 28. He was discharged from the hospital on April 16. His surgical wound was again checked on April 18, when he visited the hospital. SUMF \u00b6 30. Thereafter, he attended various follow-up appointments to care for and observe his wound. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 31, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Object in Rodriguez's Abdomen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On May 27, 2011, Rodriguez visited the VA Wound-Care Clinic. SUMF \u00b6 37. During that visit, Rodriguez was complaining of pain in his abdomen. SUMF \u00b6 37. Wound Specialist Myrna Abrams Valle (\"Abrams\") examined him and identified a granuloma\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that was being produced by an object she identified as a suture. SUMF \u00b6 37. She informed Dr. Jose Sorrentino Brunisholz (\"Sorrentino\"), who confirmed the granuloma, confirmed that the object was a suture, and removed the suture. SUMF \u00b6 40, 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   And contrary to the allegation in the amended complaint, Abrams testified that a \"metal rod\" was not removed from Rodriguez's abdomen. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 99,\n   106(m); SUMF \u00b6 45. Rodriguez readily admitted that he is not familiar with any surgical equipment and therefore could not precisely identify the object removed from his body. SUMF \u00b6 60. He did, however, describe the object as dark silver, three- to four-and-a-half inches long, flexible, and malleable. OSMF \u00b6 92. The description of the object given by Abrams and Sorrentino was very similar, making the differing accounts immaterial. Abrams described the object as a thread of black suture that was three- to four-inches long. Docket No. 32-9 at 133-134. Sorrentino described the object as a three-inch long, dark blue, Prolene suture. Docket No. 32-10 at 38, 40. Sorrentino also confirmed that Prolene sutures had been used to close Rodriguez's surgical wound. SUMF \u00b6 48. Feeling confident that he had correctly identified the object, Sorrentino did not send it to the pathology laboratory to be identified. SUMF \u00b6 52. After the May 27 visit, the parties agree Rodriguez's pain eased and that he eventually recovered. SUMF \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Lack of an Expert Witness\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rodriguez has not spoken to a physician or anyone in the medical community to evaluate the soundness of the surgeries and medical treatment he received at the VA hospital. SUMF \u00b6 61. Rather, he alleges that notwithstanding the various notes in his medical records, he experienced pain in his abdominal area, as well as other symptoms, from March 2011 until he fully recovered. He believes he experienced these symptoms because \"something had gone wrong\" during the various medical procedures. SUMF \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This court ordered the parties to disclose any expert witnesses by September 5, 2014. Docket No. 22. On September 23, the government moved to preclude plaintiffs from presenting an expert witness at trial because they had not disclosed one by the court-ordered deadline. Docket No. 29. In November 2014, the court granted the motion, reasoning two months had passed since the court-ordered deadline and that plaintiffs did not oppose the government's motion.

Indeed, plaintiffs do not seriously contend that a layperson can determine, for example, the applicable standard of care for the exploratory laparotomy or other procedures performed on Rodriguez before, during, and after his first and second surgeries at the VA hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Attempting to shoehorn one of his claims into the \"blatant or patent\" medical malpractice exception recognized in\n   <em>\n    Rolon-Alvarado\n   </em>\n   , Rodriguez claims a \"foreign object\" was \"negligently left\" inside his abdomen and that his \"wound healed completely about one month after\" the removal of the object. Pls.' Opp'n 13; OSMF 15. That attempt is unavailing for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, a blatant or patent case of medical malpractice is not evident here. Contrary to the allegation in the amended complaint, Wound Specialist Abrams testified that a \"metal rod\" was not removed from Rodriguez's abdomen. And to ensure no surgical equipment remained inside Rodriguez's body, a complete instrument, needle, drape, and sponge count was performed by the VA healthcare professionals at the conclusion of both of his surgeries. SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, Rodriguez readily admitted that he is not familiar with any surgical equipment and therefore could not precisely identify the object removed from his body. He did, however, describe the object as dark silver, three- to four-and-a-half inches long, flexible, and malleable. The description of the object given by Dr. Sorrentino and Wound Specialist Abrams was similar. Abrams described the object as a thread of black suture that was three- to four-inches long. Dr. Sorrentino described the object as a three-inch long, dark blue, Prolene suture. Dr. Sorrentino later confirmed that Prolene sutures had been used to close Rodriguez's surgical wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because plaintiff has presented no expert witness, a factfinder would have no basis to determine whether the suture was properly applied or removed.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Legg v.

The First Circuit has explained that \"[t]his is so because medical malpractice is a field in which the issues tend to be scientifically driven and more nuanced than in most tort cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Serrano\n   </em>\n   , 568 F.3d at 286. Under the circumstances of this case, a layperson is ill-equipped without the assistance of an expert witness to determine whether the object was causing Rodriguez's health woes or whether Rodriguez's health began to improve coincidentally with the removal of the object. Because Rodriguez failed to retain an expert witness, his claim that the object was causing his health troubles amounts to a speculative, unsubstantiated allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rojas-Ithier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9164708\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/40/#p43\">\n    394 F.3d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third, Rodriguez presses that Dr. Sorrentino should have sent the object to the\n   pathology laboratory to be identified. But once again, without an expert witness, a factfinder is unable to determine the applicable standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rolon-Alvarado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507866\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/1/74/#p77\">\n    1 F.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"hospital protocol[, among other things, are] matters which are neither obvious to the untrained eye nor, by any stretch, within a layman's ken\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, Rodriguez contends summary judgment is improper because the \"conflicting testimony by the witnesses deposed\" shows a \"genuine dispute of material fact\" that requires a \"full blown hearing.\" Pls. Opp'n 5. Not so. The First Circuit considered a similar argument in a medical malpractice case where the plaintiff failed to secure an expert witness and held that \"[t]he existence of contradictions, standing alone ... is not enough to preclude summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Rojas-Ithier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9164708\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/40/#p43\">\n    394 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   44 &amp; 44 n.4.
