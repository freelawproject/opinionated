Conner, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\") filed a complaint in mortgage foreclosure against defendants Brian A. Gerber and Tracy L. Gerber (\"the Gerbers\"). In addition to answering the complaint and raising affirmative defenses, the Gerbers assert two counterclaims. U.S. Bank moves to dismiss both counterclaims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and also moves to strike many of the Gerbers' affirmative defenses. (Doc. 10). The court will grant U.S. Bank's motion to dismiss and will grant in part and deny in part the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background &amp; Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2007, the Gerbers borrowed $ 247,500 from HOMELOANADVISORS.COM and executed a promissory note in consideration for the loan. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 8; Doc. 1-2, Ex. A; Doc. 8 at 2 \u00b6 8, 19 \u00b6 38). The loan was a refinance transaction, not a purchase-money loan. (Doc. 8 at 19 \u00b6 38). The Gerbers secured the note with a mortgage, which offers as collateral real property located in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12, 17; Doc. 8 at 2-3 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 12, 17). The Gerbers are the record owners of the mortgaged property, and the mortgage was duly recorded. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18; Doc. 1-2, Ex. B; Doc. 8 at 3 \u00b6\u00b6 12 &amp; 18, 19 \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to U.S. Bank, HOMELOANADVISORS.COM indorsed the note to Encore Credit, and Encore Credit indorsed the note in blank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10). U.S. Bank claims that it currently possesses the original note. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). U.S. Bank\n   further asserts that HOMELOANADVISORS.COM assigned the mortgage to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\"), and MERS assigned the mortgage to Bank of America National Association (\"Bank of America\") as trustee for certain mortgage-backed securities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Around the time of the assignment from MERS to Bank of America, the mortgage was \"securitized.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 8 at 11 \u00b6 8). When U.S. Bank succeeded Bank of America as trustee for the mortgage-backed securities, Bank of America assigned the mortgage to U.S. Bank. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Doc. 8 at 3 \u00b6 16). U.S. Bank avers that all of these mortgage assignments were duly recorded. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14, 16; Doc. 1-2, Ex. C, D, E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   U.S. Bank alleges that beginning in March 2009 and continuing thereafter, the Gerbers failed to make loan payments as required under the note. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 19). U.S. Bank avers that it provided the Gerbers notice of default and notice of its intention to foreclose on the mortgaged property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; Doc. 1-2, Ex. G; Doc. 8 at 4 \u00b6 24). U.S. Bank filed the instant complaint in mortgage foreclosure in August 2017. At that time, U.S. Bank claimed the Gerbers owed approximately $ 456,000 in outstanding principal, interest, escrow deficit, and costs. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Gerbers answered the complaint and raised 22 affirmative defenses. The Gerbers also assert two declaratory judgment counterclaims against U.S. Bank. U.S. Bank moves to dismiss both counterclaims under Rule 12(b)(6) and to strike many of the Gerbers' affirmative defenses under Rule 12(f). The motion is fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for the dismissal of complaints that fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

(Doc. 8 at 11-12 \u00b6\u00b6 10-12). The problem with this claim is that the Gerbers fail to plausibly plead exactly how the terms of their contract were unilaterally changed or amended. Their counterclaim baldly states that U.S. Bank and its predecessors-in-interest \"(a) eliminated [the Gerbers'] rights under [f]ederal lending laws; (b) imposed several third-party 'servicers'; and (c) eliminated [the Gerbers'] ability to deal directly with the true and actual lender.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 \u00b6 15). The Gerbers suggest that sale of the loan \"eliminated\" their abilities to refinance or restructure the loan and to deal directly with the lender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 \u00b6 21). These general assertions do not explain how the Gerbers' rights or obligations under the contract were modified. It is entirely unclear from the Gerbers' pleading exactly how their alleged \"rights\" to refinance or restructure were affected, where such rights are established in the contract, how different third-party loan servicers would alter the contract, how the Gerbers were unable to \"deal directly\" with the lender, or how any of these occurrences would amount to a contractual modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moreover, transfer of the note and mortgage is not a modification. The note explicitly states: \"Lender may transfer this Note. Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the 'Note Holder.' \" (Doc. 1-2, Ex. A at 1). The mortgage likewise states: \"The Note ... (\n   <em>\n    together with this Security Instrument\n   </em>\n   ) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the 'Loan Servicer') that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

Fair notice, however, does not mean threadbare recitals. The affirmative defense must include, at minimum, a concise \"statement of the grounds for asserting an affirmative defense that demonstrates a logical relationship to the lawsuit,\" or it must \"refer to general facts elsewhere in the parties' pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Criswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267150\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/566/#p572\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   574 (citing 5C CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL. , FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 1382 (3d ed. 1989) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   U.S. Bank moves to strike two groups of the Gerbers' affirmative defenses: defenses six through fourteen, and sixteen through twenty-two. We address the challenges to these two groups\n   <em>\n    seriatim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Affirmative Defenses Six through Fourteen\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Affirmative defenses six through fourteen primarily focus on the transfers of the note and mortgage between various institutions and into the securitization trust. Many of these defenses oppugn the legitimacy of the transfers or assignments of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   U.S Bank argues that the defenses in this first group are \"insufficient as a matter of law,\" are disputed by the loan documents, or are meritless because the Gerbers lack standing to challenge the transfers. These arguments miss the mark. The Gerbers do not need to prove their defenses are correct or even plausible, nor do they need to establish standing to assert the defenses. At this stage, the Gerbers need only provide fair notice to U.S. Bank of the nature of the defenses. Affirmative defenses six through fourteen do just that. They plead sufficient facts and establish a logical relationship to the lawsuit such that U.S. Bank is fairly on notice and thus alerted \"to the existence of the issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyco Fire Prods. LP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835585\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/777/893/#p900\">\n    777 F.Supp.2d at 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We note, however, that the Gerbers' eighth \"defense\" appears to be nothing more than legal argument about standing to challenge a transfer of their mortgage loan to the securitization trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8 at 6-7). The Gerbers are certainly able to make such an argument during this litigation, but it is not an \"affirmative defense\" to U.S. Bank's foreclosure claim against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FED. R. CIV. P. 8(b), (c). Accordingly, out of the first group of defenses, we will strike only the eighth affirmative defense. The other defenses in this group are sufficient to withstand U.S. Bank's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Affirmative Defenses Sixteen through Twenty-Two\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Affirmative defenses sixteen through twenty,\n   <em>\n    per contra\n   </em>\n   , are textbook examples of insufficient pleading. They consist entirely of bare-bones recitals of potential defenses without any factual or logical connection to U.S. Bank's lawsuit. For example, affirmative defense sixteen simply states: \"The claims under the Complaint\n   against [the] Gerbers ... are barred by the doctrine of unclean hands.\" (Doc. 8 at 9). Defenses seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, and twenty differ only in the Rule 8(c)(1) defense generally asserted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consequently, these five affirmative defenses will be stricken.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Criswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267150\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/566/#p572\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Gerbers' twenty-first defense states that to the extent U.S. Bank is culpable of spoliation of evidence, its claims \"are barred.\" (Doc. 8 at 9). This general assertion is entirely speculative and untethered to the underlying facts or litigation.\n   <em>\n    Criswell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267150\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/80/566/#p572\">\n    80 F.Supp.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, as U.S. Bank correctly notes, spoliation is not an affirmative defense but rather an evidentiary doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donohoe v. Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7849119\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/155/515/#p520\">\n    155 F.R.D. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 520 (M.D. Pa. 1994). Thus, this defense will also be stricken. If spoliation becomes relevant in this case, either party will be free to assert such a claim and seek an appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the Gerbers' twenty-second defense states that they intend \"to avail themselves of any and all additional defenses which may become known to them throughout the discovery process.\" (Doc. 8 at 9). This general reservation to assert additional defenses in the future is not an affirmative defense and contravenes the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sensient Colors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890505\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/369/#p389\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (D.N.J. 2008). Rule 8(c) requires a party to \"affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense\" such that the opposing party has fair notice of what it must be prepared to address. FED. R. CIV.

Rather than providing notice of a defense, the Gerbers' general reservation \"injects only ambiguity into the pleadings and therefore violates Rule 8's notice requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Sensient Colors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3890505\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/369/#p389\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
