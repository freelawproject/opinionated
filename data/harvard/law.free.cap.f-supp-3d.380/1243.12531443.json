(Dkt. 206) The Court heard argument on Defendants' first iteration of the Motion to Dismiss. (Dkts. 154, 167) Upon consideration of all relevant filings, case law, and being otherwise fully advised, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 4, 2016, Defendant 21st Century Oncology Holdings, Inc. announced that on October 3, 2015, an unauthorized third party might have gained access to its database containing patients' personal information (\"Data Breach\"). As a result of the Data Breach, the information of approximately 2.2 million current and former patients was compromised. The patients brought eighteen (18) separate putative class action suits against 21st Century Oncology Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging, among other things, state statutory claims, negligence, and unjust enrichment stemming from the Data Breach. On October 7, 2016, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the individual actions to this Court for pretrial proceedings. (Dkt. 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 17, 2017, Plaintiffs Matthew Benzion, Steven Brehio, Judy Cabrera, Valerie Corbel, Veneta Delucchi, Jackie Griffith, Roxanne Haavedt, Kathleen LaBarge, Sharon MacDermid, Timothy Meulenberg, Robert Russell, Carl Schmitt, Stacey Schwartz, and Stephen Wilbur (hereinafter, \"Plaintiffs\") filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint merging their individual claims into a singular pleading. (Dkts. 100, 103) On July 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\"Amended Complaint\"), which is the currently operative complaint in this action. (Dkts. 191, 194)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On behalf of a putative nationwide class, Plaintiffs allege the following ten (10) causes of action: Negligence (Count I), Gross Negligence (Count II), Negligent Misrepresentation (Count III), Breach of Express Contracts (Count IV), Breach of Implied Contracts (Count V), Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Count VI), Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Count VII), Unjust Enrichment (Count VIII), Invasion of Privacy (Count IX), and Declaratory Judgment (Count X). (Dkt. 194)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants filed their initial Motion to Dismiss as against the original Consolidated Complaint, asserting that some of the Plaintiffs do not have standing in this action for failure to assert an injury in fact and that all Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim as to their asserted causes of action. (Dkt. 116) After the Motion was fully briefed and the Court heard argument on the Motion, Defendants filed a Notice of Petition in Bankruptcy, which prompted a prolonged stay of this case. Through a settlement between the Parties in the bankruptcy action, this action was permitted to proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parties conducted preliminary fact discovery, and thereafter, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint. (Dkts. 191, 194) On August 29, 2018, Defendants filed a Supplemental Motion to Dismiss based on the currently operative Amended Complaint while preserving its\n   previous arguments contained in its initial Motion to Dismiss. (Dkt. 195) Similarly, on September 28, 2018, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the Supplemental Motion to Dismiss that preserves its previous opposition to Defendants' initial Motion to Dismiss. (Dkts. 199, 205) Thus, the Court considers all arguments and responses made by the Parties in the briefings of both the initial Motion to Dismiss and the Supplemental Motion to Dismiss to the extent that such arguments and responses are applicable as against the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that prior to the Data Breach, Defendants acknowledged in a \"Notice of Privacy Practices\" posted on their website that they are \"required by law to maintain the privacy of your protected health information, to provide you with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to that protected health information, and to notify any affected individuals following a breach of any unsecured protected health information.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 8) Plaintiffs state that Defendants \"failed to maintain reasonable and/or adequate security measures to protect Plaintiffs' and other Class members' [personally identifiable information (\"PII\") and protected health information (\"PHI\") ] from being released, disclosed, and rendered publicly accessible to unauthorized parties.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that on November 6, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") \"learned that 'an unauthorized party was attempting to sell compromised 21st Century Oncology data,' which 'was advertised, in Russian, as approximately 10 million patient records from 21st Century Oncology available to purchase for $ 10,000' \" and that the FBI had \"obtained a sample of the data from the unauthorized party.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 114) (quoting the Declaration of FBI Special Agent Joseph Battaglia (\"FBI Declaration\"), Dkt. 195-1 at \u00b6 3) They claim that due to Defendants' insufficient security protocols, Defendants failed to detect the Data Breach until the FBI notified them on or about November 13, 2015. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 5) Plaintiffs allege that \"on November 19, 2015, 21st Century 'confirmed that the sample of data provided by the FBI contained its patients' information,' and the FBI informed 21st Century 'that the unauthorized party listed additional data beyond the sample for sale.' \" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 119) (quoting FBI Declaration, Dkt. 195-1 at \u00b6 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the Data Breach resulted in \"the release, disclosure, and publication of private and highly sensitive PII/PHI including: names, Social Security numbers, physicians' names, medical diagnoses, treatment information, and insurance information.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 6) Plaintiffs allege that the following injuries were suffered and are likely to be suffered as a direct and proximate result of the Data Breach:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) release, disclosure, and publication of their personal and financial information;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) loss or delay of tax refunds as a result of fraudulently filed tax returns;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (c) costs associated with the detection and prevention of identity theft and unauthorized use of their PII/PHI with regard to financial, business, banking, and other accounts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) costs associated with time spent and the loss of productivity from taking time to address and attempt to ameliorate, mitigate, and deal with the actual and future consequences of the Data Breach, including finding fraudulent charges, cancelling credit cards, purchasing credit monitoring and identity theft protection services (beyond the one-year offered by 21st Century), the\n   imposition of withdrawal and purchase limits on compromised accounts, and the time, stress, nuisance, and annoyance of dealing with all issues resulting from the Data Breach, including phishing emails and phone scams;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (e) the imminent and certain impending injury flowing from fraud and identity theft posed by their PII/PHI being placed in the hands of hackers and being offered for sale on the Dark Web;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (f) damages to and diminution in value of their PII/PHI entrusted to 21st Century for the sole purpose of obtaining healthcare services from 21st Century;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (g) money paid to 21st Century for healthcare services during the period of the Data Breach, because Plaintiffs and Class members would not have obtained healthcare services from 21st Century had it disclosed that it lacked adequate systems and procedures to reasonably safeguard patients' PII/PHI;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (h) overpayments to 21st Century for healthcare services purchased, in that a portion of the amount paid by Plaintiffs and Class members to 21st Century was for the costs for 21st Century to take reasonable and adequate security measures to protect the Plaintiffs and Class members' PII/PHI, which 21st Century failed to do; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (i) personal, professional, or financial harms caused as a result of having their PII/PHI exposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 214)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs propose a putative nationwide class action on behalf of themselves and all persons whose PII and PHI have been compromised or made publicly accessible as a result of the Data Breach. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 3) The fourteen named Plaintiffs are citizens of the following six states: California, Florida, Arizona, Kentucky, Rhode Island, New Jersey. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-107) The Complaint details the alleged impact that the Data Breach has had on each named Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Some Plaintiffs have experienced misuse of their private information, such as, for example, fraudulent attempts to open credit card and/or bank accounts in their name. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Allegations by Plaintiff Timothy Meulenberg at Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 71 (alleging that \"on March 10, 2016, an attempt was made by unauthorized parties to open a ... credit card account,\" and that \"on or about November 2016, Plaintiff Meulenberg discovered unauthorized charges totaling $ 173 on his ... credit card account\")) Other Plaintiffs, however, do not allege that their information has been misused subsequent to the Data Breach. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Allegations by Plaintiff Robert Russell at Dkt. 194 at \u00b6\u00b6 19-23) Nevertheless, all Plaintiffs have alleged that they (1) have endured past and will endure future costs for credit monitoring, (2) have spent hours checking their accounts and monitoring their credit, and researching the Data Breach, and (3) have suffered emotional distress as a result of the Data Breach.

That is to say, the differing sets of facts involved in each circuit's decision are what appear to have driven the ultimate decision on standing, not necessarily a fundamental disagreement on the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re SuperValu, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275352\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/763/#p770\">\n    870 F.3d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the differing results from the circuits on this issue \"ultimately turned on the substance of the allegations before each court\"). In this way, the Court can reconcile the decisions by extracting common guiding principles from the circuit decisions on the question of whether a plaintiff has adequately alleged an injury in fact based on an increased risk of identity theft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, several of the circuits base their decisions, in part, on the alleged motive of the unauthorized third-party who received access to the plaintiffs' sensitive information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Among the circuits that consider the third-party's motive as a factor in the analysis, the rule is the same: a plaintiff is more likely to establish an injury in fact based on the increased risk of identity theft where the plaintiff has alleged that the third party behind the data breach targeted the plaintiff's personal information with an intent to use the information fraudulently.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516627,12516628\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1020/\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1029 n.9 (finding that its decision that plaintiff adequately asserted an injury in fact is \"consistent\" with Fourth Circuit's finding in\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently assert an injury in fact, based on the plaintiffs' differing allegations regarding the unauthorized third-party's intent). Applying this analysis, the Ninth, Seventh, and Sixth Circuits found an injury in fact in their respective cases because the plaintiffs alleged that the third-party\n   <em>\n    targeted\n   </em>\n   their personal information. The courts reasoned that a cognizable future injury existed because the ill-intentioned hackers' purpose was ultimately to use the plaintiffs' private information fraudulently.\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516627,12516628\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/1020/\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1029 n.9 (finding that plaintiffs' sufficiently alleged an injury where they \"allege[d] that hackers specifically targeted their PII on Zappos's servers\");\n   <em>\n    In re Horizon Healthcare Services Inc.

On this basis, the Fourth Circuit distinguished the facts of its case from that of the cases decided by the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, in which the plaintiffs alleged that \"the data thief intentionally targeted the personal information compromised in the data breaches.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277363\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/262/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that one factor considered by the diverging circuits in determining whether Plaintiffs have alleged an injury based on an increased risk of identity theft is the alleged motive of the unauthorized third-party that obtained access to Plaintiffs' personal information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, several circuit courts on opposing sides of the \"split\" have considered the type of information compromised in the analysis of whether an increased risk of identity theft is an injury in fact.

In fact, there was no evidence that the thief even stole the laptop with the intent to steal private information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277363\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/262/#p273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, the Plaintiffs allege that their data has been stolen, accessed, and used in a fraudulent manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 622.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, in an attempt to harmonize the principles relied on by the circuits in the circuit split, the Court has distilled three non-exhaustive guiding factors for determining whether a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that an injury in fact based on an increased risk of identity theft subsequent to a data breach: (1) the motive of the unauthorized third-party who accessed or may access the plaintiff's sensitive information, (2) the type of sensitive information seized, and (3) whether the information was actually accessed and whether there have been prior instances of misuse\n   stemming from the same intrusion. In this case, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded facts that satisfy each of these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the intent of the unauthorized third-party, Plaintiffs have alleged that the third-party who accessed the Plaintiffs' personal information advertised the information for sale on the internet. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6114 (citations and quotation marks omitted) (\"[T]he FBI learned that an unauthorized party was attempting to sell compromised 21st Century Oncology data, which was advertised, in Russian, as approximately 10 million patient records from 21st Century Oncology available to purchase for $ 10,000.\")) This allegation demonstrates that the interception of the Plaintiffs' data was not merely incidental or accidental, but rather driven by an intent to sell such data. Because Plaintiffs' sensitive information was targeted in the Data Breach, this factor weighs in favor of an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Regarding the type of information seized, Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he Data Breach resulted in the release, disclosure, and publication of private and highly sensitive PII/PHI including: names, Social Security numbers, physicians' names, medical diagnoses, treatment information, and insurance information.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 6) Plaintiffs explain, \"PII/PHI such as Social Security numbers can be used indefinitely, because unlike credit and financial accounts, these numbers are extremely difficult to change. In addition, medical identity theft can continue to harm Plaintiffs and Class members indefinitely, because this information is often shared among numerous providers,\" and hackers may use it to procure prescription drugs or expensive medical equipment for months or years before the fraud is detected. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 207) Therefore, according to the Amended Complaint, \"hackers today are targeting non-financial information, so they can continue to monetize victims' identities over a longer period of time.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 208 (citations and quotation marks omitted)) Plaintiffs claim that on the black market, an individual healthcare record is worth more than a U.S-based credit card and personal identity with social security number combined. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 205) Because the information compromised in the Data Breach is highly sensitive, not easily replaceable, and can be used over a long period of time, the Court finds that this factor too supports a finding of injury in fact. (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 114)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that their information has been accessed and/or misused. First, Plaintiffs allege that the intruder accessed the information because he/she placed an advertisement for the information on the internet for sale. Second, according to Plaintiffs, an FBI informant purchased a sample of the advertised data and informed Defendants that \"the unauthorized party listed additional data beyond the sample for sale.\" (Dkt. 194 at \u00b6 119) Thus, the intruder not only accessed the information, but has also used the information in at least one transaction. This allegation factually distinguishes this action from the circuit court cases that precede it. Plaintiffs do not merely allege that they fear that their compromised information\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be advertised and sold on the Dark Web, Plaintiffs allege that it has\n   <em>\n    already happened.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third, half of the named plaintiffs, against whom Defendants do not assert an injury in fact challenge, have alleged that their personal information has already been misused. Among the alleged instances of misuse subsequent to the Data Breach, these Plaintiffs allege that unauthorized individuals made fraudulent purchases on their credit cards, attempted to open credit cards in their names, and fraudulently wired funds from their bank accounts, and one Plaintiff alleges that his health insurance was cancelled because his social security number was compromised. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 194 at \u00b6\u00b6 45-51, 61-95,101-107) Therefore, the factor of access/misuse likewise weighs in favor of Plaintiffs on the facts alleged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As the D.C. Circuit noted in\n   <em>\n    Attias\n   </em>\n   , \"[n]o long sequence of uncertain contingencies involving multiple independent actors has to occur before the plaintiffs in this case will suffer any harm; a substantial risk of harm exists already simply by virtue of the hack and the nature of the data that plaintiffs allege was taken.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275635\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/620/\">\n    865 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, based on the facts alleged in the Complaint, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated an Article III injury in fact based on an increased risk of identity theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Mitigation Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants also challenge the Non-Misuse Plaintiffs' alleged injury caused by the cost of mitigating their increased risk of identity theft. Defendants assert that since Non-Misuse Plaintiffs' future risk of identity theft is not \"certainly impending\" as would be necessary to confer standing, any time or expense spent to mitigate such hypothetical future harm is likewise insufficient to constitute a cognizable injury. (Dkt. 116 at 15) Courts have found that the harm resulting from mitigation of a risk of future harm is largely dependent on whether the risk itself is substantial enough to be a standalone injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Provost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201465766\">\n    2018 WL 1465766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   , 195 F. Supp. 3d at 1284 ) (\"[T]he majority of courts in data breach cases have held that 'the cost to mitigate the risk of future harm does not constitute an injury in fact unless the future harm being mitigated against is itself imminent.' \"). Thus, in data breach cases, where courts have found an injury in fact based on an increased risk of identity theft, they have also found an adequate injury in fact based on the harm incurred by protecting against that risk.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Galaria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12138569\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/663/384/#p388\">\n    663 F.

Likewise, where the risk of identity theft is too speculative to constitute an injury in fact, the alleged injury of mitigation efforts to minimize that risk is likewise typically found to be non-cognizable.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re SuperValu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275352\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/763/#p770\">\n    870 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   771 (citing\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1151 ) (\"Because plaintiffs have not alleged a substantial risk of future identity theft, the time they spent protecting themselves against this speculative threat cannot create an injury.\"). Here, as described above, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged an injury in fact based on an increased risk of identity theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thus, the Court finds that the time and money spent to protect themselves from that risk is also an injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Overpayment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants move the Court to reject Plaintiffs' alleged overpayment theory because the Non-Misuse Plaintiffs never alleged that they paid anything specific for data protection, that they received a higher level of protection than those who did not pay for data protection services, that they paid a premium or otherwise bargained for data protection, or that they received any information about data protection other than a HIPAA notice.

(Dkt. 146 at 22) As noted in\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Health Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , however, \"a number of courts have rejected an 'overpayment' theory of damages as an injury in fact for standing purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204732630\">\n    2016 WL 4732630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (collecting cases where courts rejected an \"overpayment\" theory of damages as injury in fact for standing purposes). Here, there are no factual allegations demonstrating that the Parties mutually agreed that any portion of the sums paid from Plaintiffs to Defendants would be allocated to data security. \"Put another way, Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that show that the market value of their insurance coverage (plus security services) was somehow less than what they paid.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sci.

Thus, the Court finds that this theory of injury in fact fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    iv. Decreased Value of PII/PHI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants further argue that Non-Misuse Plaintiffs may not base their injury-in-fact assertion on a claim of loss monetary value of their PII/PHI. (Dkt. 116 at 16) Plaintiffs claim that a growing number of federal courts have recognized the loss of value of PII/PHI as a cognizable harm. (Dkt. 146 at 22) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Anthem, Inc.

(Dkt. 146 at 20) According to Plaintiffs, if identity thieves use Plaintiffs' PHI/PII for medical services and thereby commingle Plaintiffs' legitimate medical records with the thieves' records, the misinformation on the Plaintiffs' records could result in misdiagnosis and erroneous medical treatment. (Dkt. 146 at 20) The Court finds that this theory of future risk of harm is too attenuated\n   to constitute an injury in fact. Unlike the threat of identity theft described above, this theory depends on a \"speculative chain of possibilities\" that do not make out a \"certainly impending\" threat or create a \"substantial risk\" of harm.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    568 U.S. at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For Plaintiffs' potential harm to manifest: (1) Plaintiffs' medical information must be sold on the dark web, (2) the buyer/perpetrator must successfully use that information for medical services, (3) the medical services used by the perpetrator must be documented on plaintiffs' medical record; (4) the medical services used by the perpetrator must be inconsistent with Plaintiffs' own treatment plan such that it creates a risk of harm in Plaintiffs' future treatment, (5) Plaintiffs must receive medical treatment subsequent to the perpetrators' use of the medical information, (6) Plaintiffs must be harmed by such future treatment, and (7) the harm suffered by Plaintiffs' must be caused by the misinformation placed on Plaintiffs' medical record due to the perpetrators' use of Plaintiffs' medical information. The Court finds this chain of possibilities too speculative to constitute an Article III injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In sum, although some of Plaintiffs' theories of injury fail to constitute an Article III injury in fact, Plaintiffs' Complaint survives Defendants' standing challenge because they have pleaded an injury in fact due to an increased risk of identity theft and the cost of mitigation efforts undertaken to minimize that risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Ind. 2001) (\"[T]he parties agree that this Court should be treated as the forum court because Plaintiffs filed their Master Complaint in this Court. Indiana's choice of law rules therefore are applicable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At the Motion to Dismiss hearing in this case, the Court discussed with the Parties' their intent regarding Plaintiffs' Consolidated Complaint. Plaintiffs made clear that their filing of the Amended Complaint was intended to supplant the individual complaints with a singular substantive complaint for choice of law purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 167 at 4-5) However, Defendants were not as definitive and indicated that they may raise a choice of law issue later in the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6) Nonetheless, Defendants indicate in a footnote in a subsequent filing that they agree that Florida's choice of law rules apply in this case, which suggests their agreement that the consolidated complaint should operate as a superseding pleading. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 157 at 1 n.1 (using Florida's choice of law rule to cursorily argue that Florida substantive law should apply to tort claims in this action))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Moreover, even if the Parties agree on which state's choice of law rules apply in this action, the Parties have not explained, except by passing reference in a footnote, how such rules would apply to the claims\n   asserted here. For instance, neither party has sufficiently applied the \"most significant relationship test,\" Florida's choice of law rule regarding tort claims, to the factual allegations asserted in the Complaint to determine which state's substantive law should apply to Plaintiffs' tort claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 156 at 2 (stating that \"Florida applies the 'most significant relationship' test and it is unclear on this record which states' substantive law would apply to common law ... claims asserted by citizens of different states\")). Likewise, neither party has attempted to explain which state's or states' substantive law should apply to Plaintiffs' contract claims based on Florida's choice of law rule for contract claims. Instead, the Parties support their respective arguments concerning Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim with law from an assortment of states. They also indicate that the substantive law of the various states on Plaintiffs' claims may differ in material ways. (\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 167 at 10 (suggesting that although Florida may require heightened pleading for a negligent misrepresentation claim sounding in fraud, \"we know certain states [e.g., California and Arizona] diverge from the notice requirements under 9(b).\"); Dkt. 146 at 29 n. 37 (distinguishing Florida's law on a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which requires that express term of a contract to be breached, from California, Arizona, and New Jersey's law on the claim, which do not)) Thus, the Court finds that briefing on the Parties' positions as to the substantive state law that is applicable to each of Plaintiffs' claims is necessary for the Court to resolve Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Thus, to this point, the motion is denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Due to this lack of uniformity, the Court refers to the decisions generally as either finding an injury in fact or not.
