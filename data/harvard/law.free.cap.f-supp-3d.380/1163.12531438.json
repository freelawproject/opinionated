Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs are surviving relatives and personal representatives of the Estate of Deandre Lloyd Armstrong-Starks. Mr. Starks, who was unarmed, was shot in the back by defendant Mark Wollmershauser, Jr., a police sergeant with the Tulsa Police Department (TPD), in the course of execution of a search warrant on a home in Tulsa on March 25, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs brought this action asserting claims against Sgt. Wollmershauser and the City of Tulsa under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 20, First, Second, and Third Claims for Relief). The \u00a7 1983 claims are premised upon allegations that Sgt. Wollmershauser used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs also assert a state negligence claim under the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act (OGTCA) against the City (Fifth Claim for Relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Starks was not a target of the search warrant, which named two other individuals and authorized the officers to search the premises for \"cocaine and other controlled dangerous substances,\" \"monies or unexplained wealth, records and financial records in physical, digital, or electronic form, proof of residency, cellular phones, keys, safes, surveillance equipment, [and] firearms.\" (Doc. 33-7 at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers discussed in advance a plan for execution of the warrant, which included briefing on the routes of approach, individual officer assignments, contingency plans for fleeing suspects, shots fired on approach or entry, failed breach, evidence destruction, officer down procedures, evacuation procedures, and transport to hospital. An EMSA unit was staged a few blocks away from the premises to be searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Three officers were assigned to outside containment, while two additional officers were to cover the bathroom window on the east side of the residence to monitor for potential evidence destruction. Eight additional officers made up the \"entry team.\" Sgt. Wollmershauser was part of the entry team, and he was to be the Emergency Radio Operator on the scene. Upon approaching the front porch, officers believed that they had been \"compromised,\" indicating that the occupants had seen them and recognized them as police. Wollmershauser provided an affidavit attesting that another officer yelled, \"Tulsa Police, search warrant; Tulsa police, search warrant\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   before making entry (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-1 at 6). However, the affidavit of Dominique Jones, who was present at the home during police entry, indicates that the TPD officers \"entered the house unannounced and without knocking.\" (Doc. 36-7 at 2). The evidence establishes very fast-moving events and chaos in the house immediately upon the officers' entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There are significant, material factual discrepancies as to what happened immediately before Sgt. Wollmershauser shot Mr. Starks in the back. Wollmershauser asserts that he heard \"Officer Kirby and one other female voice yelling commands such as 'show me your hands.' \" (Doc. 33-1 at 7). Wollmershauser states that he was positioned just to the left and slight rear of Officer Kirby, who was standing just to the left of Officer Criner. Criner was standing at the right side of the large unobstructed doorway that led from the living room to the dining room inside the house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wollmershauser contends that he saw a black male, whom he later learned was identified as Mr. Starks. Starks was kneeling in the corner of the dining room, with his back to the officers. Sergeant Wollmershauser alleges that he could not see Mr. Starks's hands but could see his arms moving, and Wollmershauser believed Starks's hands were located near the front waistband of his pants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wollmershauser asserts that \"Starks did not comply with the repeated commands to show his hands\" and \"continued looking down toward his front waistband while kneeling and just kept fumbling with his hands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that point, Wollmershauser says he told Starks to \"show me your hands. Show me your fucking hands,\" and then fired one shot at Starks, hitting him in the \"mid-right side of his back.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Starks died later that day. It is undisputed that he was not armed with a gun or other weapon, although the officers allege that, before he was shot, they believed he may have been attempting to retrieve a gun from the waistband of his pants. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 33 at 9; Doc. 34 at 9, Doc. 34-4 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dominique Jones asserts that he was in the home and \"personally witnessed the shooting of [Mr. Starks].\" (Doc. 36-7 at 2). In stark contrast to the affidavit of Sgt. Wollmershauser and the testimony of other officers, Mr. Jones maintains that Mr. Starks \"had his hands in the air\" at the time of the shooting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jones also states that he never heard anyone say \"show me your hands,\" and he instead heard someone yelling \"get on the ground\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), which is contrary to Sgt. Wollmershauser's assertions. Mr. Jones also alleges that \"[t]here were no guns in the house until the Tulsa Police Department showed up with theirs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants seek summary judgment on the plaintiffs' claims. (Doc. 33 and 34). Plaintiffs have responded (Doc. 36, 37), and Sgt. Wollmershauser filed a reply (Doc. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Wollmershauser first argues that the plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 excessive force claims must be brought under the Fourth Amendment and that such claims should be dismissed with prejudice for failing to \"allege any constitutional provision underlying their \u00a7 1983 claims.\" (Doc. 33 at 23-24). However, plaintiffs allege in their Amended Complaint that they seek \"to redress deprivations of rights secured by the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as enforced by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" (Doc. 20 at 2, \u00b6 10). The factual allegations of the Amended Complaint state a plausible excessive force claim under the Fourth Amendment. These allegations are sufficient to avoid dismissal on the first ground asserted by Wollmershauser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sergeant Wollmershauser asserts that he is entitled to qualified immunity. The general summary judgment standards apply to motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, and courts accordingly must still draw the evidence and reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/650/#p656\">\n    572 U.S. at 656-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002,12580258\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1861/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

While Wollmershauser and other officers insist that Mr. Starks's hands were not in the air and they believed he might be reaching into the front of his pants for a weapon, this Court may not ignore the plaintiffs' evidence, which includes the affidavit of Dominique Jones.\n   <em>\n    Tolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/650/#p656\">\n    572 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002,12580258\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1861/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly 'weigh[ed] the evidence' and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   These disputed facts are material to a determination of the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim against Sgt. Wollmershauser. Wollmershauser's arguments for qualified immunity and summary judgment are dependent upon a construction of the facts that is drawn in his own favor, rather than in favor of the non-moving plaintiffs. That is precisely what the Supreme Court rejected in\n   <em>\n    Tolan\n   </em>\n   , where the Court noted that there were disputed facts as to the conditions surrounding an officer's shooting of the plaintiff in that case. Those factual issues included whether the front of the home where the shooting occurred was well-lit and whether the plaintiff's statement to the officer to \"get your fucking hands off my mom\" and other disputed factual circumstances indicated the plaintiff was a threat to the officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 657-58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707002,12580258\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1861/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Construing the evidence relating to the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors in plaintiffs' favor, other than Mr. Starks's mere presence in the dining room of the home to be searched, officers did not have information that Starks had committed a crime, serious or not, prior to the shooting. Mr. Starks was not a target of the search warrant, and Wollmershauser did not know him prior to the shooting. The\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor of whether there was active resistance or an attempt to evade arrest also cannot be determined in favor of Wollmershauser at this stage, because the evidence viewed in the proper light would show that Starks was not armed, was kneeling with his hands in the air and his back to the officers, at the time he was shot. The final\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor at issue here is whether Starks posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others. As noted, the evidence is in direct dispute as to that issue, rendering summary judgment inappropriate. If, as plaintiffs' evidence would show, Mr. Starks was on his knees with his hands in the air when Sgt. Wollmershauser shot him in the back, a reasonable jury could find that Wollmershauser's actions were unreasonable and amounted to excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In short, the factual disputes are material to the issue of the reasonableness of Wollmershauser's actions, and he is thus not entitled to judgment as a matter of law based upon qualified immunity, so long as the law was clearly established under the second prong.

If, as Mr. Jones has stated, Mr. Starks had his hands in the air, then it was clear to the officers that he was not holding a gun or posing any threat. That is the crux of the genuine dispute in this case. If the jury believes Mr. Jones instead of the officers regarding the location of Mr. Starks's hands, then the jury could reasonably determine that Mr. Starks did not pose a threat to the officers or anyone else, such that Sgt. Wollmershauser's shooting Starks in the back was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.

Punitive damages are recoverable against a defendant, like Sgt. Wollmershauser, who is sued in his individual capacity under \u00a7 1983, where the individual's conduct \"is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

As noted, there are material fact issues bearing on the reasonableness of Sgt. Wollmershauser's actions. Crediting the plaintiff's evidence as is required at this stage, Wollmershauser shot Starks - who was unarmed, kneeling on the floor, with his hands in the air - in the back. A reasonable jury could find such conduct to involve reckless or callous indifference to Mr. Starks's federally protected rights. Accordingly, Wollmershauser is not entitled to summary judgment on punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Section 1983 Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The City seeks summary judgment on plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claims against it on two grounds. First, the City asserts that, absent a predicate constitutional violation by Sgt. Wollmershauser, the City cannot be liable for any alleged policy. (Doc. 34 at 17). As discussed at length above, there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment on plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment excessive force claim against Sgt. Wollmershauser. For that reason, the City is not entitled to summary judgment on its first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The City next argues that it is entitled to summary judgment under the law governing claims against municipalities. (Doc. 34 at 19). A municipality may not be held liable under \u00a7 1983 solely because its employee inflicted injury; municipal liability cannot be found by application of the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monell v.

Wollmershauser's conduct by accepting the results of an Internal Affairs inquiry and the determination of the Deadly Force Review Board that Wollmershauser's actions were within policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 23). There is a temporal problem inherent in the plaintiffs' ratification theory. The City's post-shooting review could not have been the direct cause of (or \"moving force\" behind) the shooting that occurred\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the review. In short, there is obviously no causal link between Mr. Starks's death and the City's alleged ratification of the shooting after his death. Mr. Starks died before the review and the City's alleged ratification thereof. Thus, the ratification could not have caused the constitutional injury, and the causation requirement of a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, the City's after-the-fact finding as to the shooting is a one-time occurrence, rather than the policy or custom necessary to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs do not provide any evidence of a City policy or custom of approving similar,\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   deadly shootings by its officers that would have effectively served as a policy that was the moving force behind Wollmershauser's shooting of Mr. Starks. Similarly, that the City has \"implemented no changes in use of force training\" and has \"declined to implement a policy requiring Special Investigative Division entry teams to carry less-lethal alternatives such as Tasers\" after the shooting of Mr. Starks suffers from the same temporal/causation problem. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 15).

The city's \"policy of inaction\" in light of notice that its program will cause constitutional violations \"is the functional equivalent of a decision by the city itself to violate the Constitution.\" A less stringent standard of fault for a failure-to-train claim \"would result in\n   <em>\n    de facto respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability on municipalities....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is \"ordinarily necessary\" to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.

In\n   <em>\n    Zuchel v. City and County of Denver, Colo.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n    997 F.2d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1993), the Tenth Circuit affirmed a trial court's denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding a jury verdict awarded to plaintiffs whose child was killed by a Denver police officer. In doing so, the court relied upon evidence that, two years before the shooting at issue, the City of Denver Police Chief received a letter from the Denver district attorney which established that there had been \"six police-citizen encounters involving deadly force ...within a six-week period,\" which \"support[ed] a reasonable inference that such encounters were a usual and recurring problem\" in the City of Denver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n    at 737-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The letter contained a specific recommendation from the district attorney that the City of Denver institute or expand training to minimize the likelihood of a violent confrontation and establish \"periodic target course 'shoot-don't shoot' live training under street conditions, particularly for officers on the front line.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n    at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs presented evidence that the City made no effort to implement that recommended periodic live range training after receiving the letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Zuchel\n   </em>\n   determined that the evidence was \"clearly sufficient to support the jury's determination that the Denver police training program in place prior to the Zuchel shooting was inadequate, and that a direct connection existed between the inadequacy and the shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n    at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court cited the same evidence as \"sufficient to sustain the jury's determination that the Denver Police Department was deliberately indifferent to the rights of persons with whom the police come in contact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878795\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/997/730/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The evidence in this case is distinguishable from that in\n   <em>\n    Zuchel.\n   </em>\n   Most notably, plaintiffs have not presented any evidence like the Denver district attorney's letter that was central to the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Zuchel\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   That distinction is crucial due to the Supreme Court's mandate that, to prevail on a claim of insufficient training, plaintiffs must present evidence that \"city policymakers are on actual or constructive notice that a particular omission in their training program causes city employees to violate citizens' constitutional rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Connick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    563 U.S. at 61-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5958866,12457892\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/51/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The circumstances of this case are more akin to the claims asserted in\n   <em>\n    Carr v. Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108803\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1221/\">\n    337 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2003). In\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for a municipality on numerous alleged failures to train, including an allegation of a failure to provide particular \"shoot/don't shoot\" training where officers are confronted with non-lethal weapons. In affirming summary judgment for the municipality, the court noted that the plaintiff had not provided any evidence of \"how the City had notice that its actions (or failures to act) were likely to result in constitutional violations\" and had not \"illustrated how the City consciously chose to disregard the risk of harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108803\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1221/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108803\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1221/\">\n    at 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The evidence does not support any reasonable finding of a direct causal link between any alleged failure to provide specific training and the shooting of Mr. Starks. As noted, the evidence, construed in favor of the plaintiffs, is that Starks was shot in the back, while kneeling on a floor, unarmed, with his hands in the air. The plaintiffs have not pointed to any City training policy that permitted a police officer to fire a gun under such circumstances. Plaintiffs have likewise not explained how the absence of specific scenario based or shoot-don't shoot training caused Wollmershauser to shoot Mr. Starks while his hands were in the air.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108803\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1221/\">\n    337 F.3d at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"one thing is certain: [The officers] were not trained by the City to shoot [a suspect holding a 4-inch piece of concrete] in the back after he no longer posed a threat. In sum, even if some inadequacy in training had been shown, [the plaintiff] cannot demonstrate how it was a direct cause of the officers' actions and of [the decedent's] consequent death.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the evidence in this case simply does not support the plaintiffs' contention that Sgt. Wollmershauser did not receive scenario based training which included training as to when to use deadly force. It is undisputed that the TPD Police Academy curriculum \"includes classroom instruction on 'Use of Force,' in the field training and\n   <em>\n    scenario based training on use of force up to and including deadly force.\n   </em>\n   \" (Doc. 37 at 8, \u00b6 3) (emphasis added). Sgt. Wollmershauser himself \"received several hours of classroom training and scenario based training in the use of force up to and including deadly force,\" and he received additional update \"Use of Force\" training on February 12, 2014, just weeks before the shooting of Mr. Starks. (Doc. 33-1 at 3, \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37 at 9, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is also uncontroverted that the TPD has a written policy and procedure on the use of force, including deadly force. (Doc. 37 at 10, \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34-6). The policy recites many of the general\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors as well as other legal principles set forth in Supreme Court Fourth Amendment cases (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34-6 at 2). The City is entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to plaintiffs' Third Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2. OGTCA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The City argues that the state law claim fails because plaintiffs have not established a violation of the Fourth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 34 at 26-27). The Court has already found the existence of genuine disputes of material fact regarding Wollmershauser's use of deadly force, which preclude summary judgment on the excessive force claim against him. Because the City's sole\n   argument for summary judgment on the OGTCA claim is based on its argument that Wollmershauser acted appropriately, the City is not entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Sgt. Wollmershauser's motion (Doc. 33) is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   , and the City's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 34) is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   SO ORDERED this 31st day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Wollmershauser was a sergeant at the time of the shooting. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of captain after Mr. Starks's death. The City's briefing refers to him as \"Sgt. Wollmershauser,\" and the Court will reference that title herein for consistency.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    All citations to page numbers from documents in the record are to the page numbers at the top of each page as docketed in CM/ECF.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The City also argues in its motion for summary judgment that plaintiffs failed to plead a claim under the Fourth Amendment. (Doc. 34 at 15-16). For the reasons already stated, that argument fails for the City as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    While plaintiffs cite evidence that Officers Criner and Kirby, who were present at the time of the shooting of Mr. Starks, had not received \"shoot-don't shoot\" training with the TPD (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Doc. 37 at 14, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4), those officers did not shoot Mr. Starks; Sgt. Wollmershauser - who undisputedly has received such scenario-based use of force training - shot him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The OGTCA claim appears to be premised upon a similar theory as plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train theory, which the Court has determined is subject to summary judgment. However, the City provided no argument, analysis, or authority to indicate that the state law claim should fail for the same reasons as the \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train claim. The Court must consider the arguments before it, and it would be unfair to the plaintiffs to grant summary judgment on a claim based upon an argument that the City did not make and which the plaintiffs thus had no opportunity or obligation to dispute in their response to the motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
