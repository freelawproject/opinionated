COLLYER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The State of Maryland cherishes the Chesapeake Bay and is determined to save the Bay by removing pollutants. The Susquehanna River delivers about 75% of the freshwater in the Bay; its environmental health is critical. The River is over 400 miles long, originating in New York State, flowing through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and then, for its last 15 miles, traversing part of Maryland before emptying into the Bay at Havre de Grace. This multistate watershed creates a pollutant problem. The River transports great amounts of phosphorus and nitrogen-farm nutrients-turned-pollutants-and other detritus from New York and Pennsylvania to the Bay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Exelon Generation Co., LLC operates the Conowingo Project, a Maryland dam and hydroelectric power plant that is ten miles upriver from the Bay. The Conowingo Project has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a new operating license. As the cost of such a federal license, Maryland insists that the Conowingo Project remove the phosphorus and nitrogen that flow downriver from New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. In lieu of cleaning the Susquehanna, Maryland would accept $ 172 million from Exelon each year for the next 50 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Conowingo Project adds no phosphorus or nitrogen to the Susquehanna River; it only passes the water along. Exelon protests that it should not be made to pay up to $ 7 billion to clean up pollution sent downriver by others. Exelon has sued Benjamin H. Grumbles and D. Lee Currey in their official capacities as Secretary of the Environment and Director, Water and Sciences Administration of the Maryland Department of the Environment, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Right now, the question is whether Exelon's lawsuit is brought in the right court. Maryland argues that it belongs in its State courts. Alternatively, it argues that the case should be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The issue is fully briefed\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court heard oral argument. For the reasons explained below, this Court disagrees on both points and concludes that venue lies in D.C. as well as Maryland. The Court will deny so much of Maryland's motion to dismiss as is based on improper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Exelon), owns and operates the Conowingo Dam and hydroelectric facility (the Conowingo Project). Exelon is a Pennsylvania limited liability company and a fully owned subsidiary of Exelon Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation. The Conowingo Project produces electricity, which it provides directly to the mid-Atlantic power grid and indirectly to a majority of Maryland homes and businesses; it generates more renewable electricity than all other facilities in the State of Maryland combined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Susquehanna River was first dammed at Conowingo ninety-odd years ago to create a reservoir for Baltimore, Maryland, and to produce hydroelectric power. The main branch of the Susquehanna originates in New York State and flows for over 400 miles through New York and Pennsylvania, where it is joined by a junior east-west branch from across Pennsylvania, and then into Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem at 3. Only about fifteen miles of the River are in Maryland before it empties into the Chesapeake Bay. The impoundment created by the Dam,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Baltimore reservoir, fully occupies the first five miles of the Susquehanna in Maryland, from the Pennsylvania/Maryland border to the Conowingo Dam. Compl. \u00b6 19. The mouth of the Susquehanna is ten miles downstream from the Conowingo Dam at Havre de Grace.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Over its lifespan, the Dam has trapped and retained some of the harmful nutrients-turned-pollutants in the runoff from upstream farms and businesses in New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, preventing such pollutants from reaching the Bay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Now, however,\n   its trapping capacity is declining, as sediment flowing downstream has been deposited in the reservoir and reduced its depth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Exelon has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to renew its operating license for the Conowingo Project for 50 years under the Federal Power Act (FPA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 791a - 823g ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30.

Maryland has welcomed the opportunity of the FERC re-licensing process to require that the Conowingo Project remove such pollutants from the Susquehanna River in the amounts that EPA would normally apportion among the multiple states around the Bay or the three states through which the Susquehanna flows.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 110, 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Alternatively, the Conowingo Project at the tail end of the River can avoid this obligation to clean up 400-plus miles of pollutants from neighboring states by paying Maryland approximately one-half million dollars ($ 500,000) each day over the life of its next FERC license, or approximately $ 7 billion in the next 50 years. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has submitted its Certification to FERC with such requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    \u00b6 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Exelon Application to FERC for a New License\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In anticipation of its renewal application, Exelon developed a study plan in or about 2009 and performed more than 45 separate studies regarding various environmental issues, including fish passage, stream flow, the water transport of sediment, and water temperature. Exelon filed its application with FERC on August 31, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2015, FERC issued an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for three hydroelectric projects on the lower Susquehanna, including the Conowingo Project in Maryland. The EIS noted that the Susquehanna River \"is the largest source of freshwater to the Chesapeake Bay, contributing about 70% of the total nitrogen and 55% of the total phosphorus, and that the presence of these pollutants is a watershed-wide issue.\" Compl. \u00b6 36. The EIS warned that if the Conowingo Reservoir could no longer trap sediment and pollutants, \"governmental jurisdictions in the watershed might need to increase their ... nutrient-reduction efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The EIS also evaluated whether dredging might be a reasonable way to increase the trapping capacity of the Conowingo Reservoir to continue its ability to reduce pollutants in the Bay. However, citing the Lower Susquehanna River Watershed Assessment-a joint assessment by the Army Corps of Engineers and the MDE-the FERC EIS concluded that \"operational changes at Conowingo would not address the sediment transport issue, and that dredging of Conowingo [Reservoir] would be cost prohibitive and ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Exelon also engaged in detailed negotiations with the Department of the Interior\n   (DOI) Fish &amp; Wildlife Service regarding fish spawning in the Susquehanna River as part of its relicensing process.

Exelon argues that the event that triggers\n   actual injury to it arguably interferes with FERC, EPA and DOI authorities and is a \"substantial part\" of the events giving rise to Exelon's claims can\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   happen in the District of Columbia and provides venue in this Court.

Maryland tries to blunt this fact by arguing that the requirements of the Certification \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   at some point be incorporated into a federal license issued by a federal agency headquartered in the District of Columbia\" but its argument is based on a false premise. Defs.' Mem. at 34 (emphasis added and internal citations omitted). To the contrary, there is no doubt that the conditions of the Certification\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   be incorporated into the new license for the Conowingo Project unless Exelon's appeal under state law or this lawsuit under federal law prevent that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
