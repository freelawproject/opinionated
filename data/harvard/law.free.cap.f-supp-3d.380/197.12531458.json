Moreover, Middlesex Hospital argues that there was no discriminatory pretext for Ms. Lamitie's termination because she refused to change her schedule, inappropriately interacted with employees, and she still received eight months of paid leave, which far exceeds the Hospital's FMLA obligations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Finally, Middlesex Hospital asserts that there is insufficient evidence for an FMLA claim because Ms. Lamitie had taken approved FMLA leave multiple times for years and was never discharged for exercising her FMLA rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In this case, there are three potential FMLA violations stemming from: (1) the March 2015 employee conduct warning; (2) the August 12, 2015 involuntary paid leave; and (3) the March 31, 2016 termination.

It does not constitute a contract or guarantee of any specific process or level of discipline, and all employment at the Health System remains 'at-will.' \" Middlesex Health System Human Resources Policy Manual, ECF No. 42-9. Because this policy is discretionary and not mandatory, its mere existence does not establish a causal connection between any alleged adverse employment action and Ms. Lamitie's requests for FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779105\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/161/#p174\">\n    445 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the FMLA \"does not create a right to be free from suspension with or without pay, nor does the FMLA create a right against infliction of emotional distress, which is the crux of [Plaintiff]'s claim here.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Middlesex Hospital's failure to implement a performance improvement plan for Ms. Lamitie is probative of a difference in treatment between employees who seek to assert their FMLA rights and\n   those who do not. In other words, Ms. Lamitie's FMLA retaliation claim cannot be premised on whether Middlesex Hospital does or does not implement performance improvement plans for all of its employees, but instead must be based on whether Middlesex Hospital treats those who are on FMLA leave differently from those who do not seek FMLA leave in how performance improvement plans are offered or implemented.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potenza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9252565\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/165/#p167\">\n    365 F.3d at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that an adverse employment action must \"occur under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Ms. Lamitie does put forth another employee's performance improvement plan in support of her claim of FMLA retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 8, July 20, 2015 Performance Improvement Plan, ECF No. 42-10.

Conn. 2016) (adopting and applying the retaliation analysis of an earlier ADA claim to an FMLA claim) (Bolden, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   While termination is one of the paradigmatic examples of an adverse employment action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055323\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/72/#p85\">\n    801 F.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Ms. Lamitie has not shown a causal connection between her termination and retaliatory animus for asserting her ADA rights or that her termination was motivated by retaliatory animus. As with her FMLA claim, from the start of the involuntary paid leave until the termination, there is no evidence in the record from which a jury could infer a causal connection between her alleged disability and her March 31, 2016 termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Further, as discussed above with respect to the FMLA claim, neither the alleged disparate use of Middlesex Hospital's performance improvement policy nor Ms. McNeil's deposition testimony create genuine issues of material fact. There is no evidence that the Hospital would have given a similarly situated non-disabled person in Ms. Lamitie's position a performance improvement plan\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.A.1.c, at 17-18. Indeed, Ms. McNeil's testimony suggests the contrary. Ms. McNeil, who wondered why Ms. Lamitie was not terminated earlier, thus cannot be used to infer that Ms. McNeil was fired improperly or should not have been fired at all.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   III.A.1.c., at 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In any event, even if Ms. Lamitie had a prima facie case, just as with her FMLA claim, this claim would be insufficient to carry her burden, given that the burden would shift back to her, given Middlesex Hospital's legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for her March 31, 2016 termination, and she has not created a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to carry her ultimate burden of persuasion on her ADA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant Middlesex Hospital's motion for summary judgment as to Ms. Lamitie's ADA claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
