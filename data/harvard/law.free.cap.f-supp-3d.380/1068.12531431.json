Factual Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises from an officer-involved shooting at the home of Plaintiffs in North Las Vegas soon after midnight on January 1, 2011. On the night of the incident, Plaintiffs and several other individuals were at Plaintiffs' home celebrating New Year's Eve. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 1:15-2:19, ECF No. 107). Special Operations Officers Jeffrey Pollard and Michael Harris\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were tasked that evening with patrolling the neighborhood near Plaintiff's home and particularly, to be on the lookout for celebratory gunfire, a common occurrence in North Las Vegas on New Year's Eve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:1-2); (Pollard Dep. 16:21-17:1, 20:6-14, Ex. A to Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. (\"MSJ\"), ECF No. 140-2). The officers were patrolling in Harris's unmarked pickup truck with Pollard in the passenger seat. (Order 2:1-2, ECF No. 107); (Pollard Dep. 38:11-13). The officers were wearing the NLVPD special operations uniform, consisting of an olive green, fatigue-style shirt with subdued-colored NLVPD insignia patches on each arm, and a duty belt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:2-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At approximately midnight, the officers drove past Plaintiffs' house when Pollard saw a group of people standing in front of the home with the lights on. (Pollard Dep. 34:12-25, 35:19-23). Pollard testified he did not see anything suggesting illegal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   36:3-18). Pollard and Harris continued down the street, circled the block, and from an adjacent street, three houses away, Pollard glanced at Plaintiffs' home and observed \"somebody holding something shiny up in the air that looked like maybe the barrel of a rifle.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   36:22-37:5-16). At this point, the officers did not hear any gunshots. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   37:17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Pollard described to Harris what he saw, the officers parked the truck a few properties away from Plaintiffs' house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   48:4-20). The officers notified dispatch, and waiting outside the truck for thirty seconds to a minute to devise a plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   40:23-25). Standing outside the truck, Pollard and Harris heard the sounds of gunshots in the distance, and subsequently notified dispatch, obtaining a \"code red,\" by which a police radio channel is cleared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   42:9-21). According to Pollard, the officers \"weren't sure that [Plaintiffs' home was] where the gunfire came from. We weren't sure. We only heard shots in the air. We were hearing numerous shots coming from different aspects of the city.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   45:25-46:18) (responding to question asking why Pollard thought he saw a rifle yet declined to wait for backup).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After devising their plan to make their approach, the officers exited the truck several houses down from Plaintiffs' residence, unholstered their guns, and walked toward Plaintiffs' home at normal pace without activating their handgun-mounted flashlights or announcing their presence. (Order 2:15-19, ECF No. 107). The officers heard no further gunshots once they commenced their approach. (Pollard Dep. 49:15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As the officers arrived within two houses of Plaintiffs, an unidentified individual standing in Plaintiffs' driveway noticed Pollard and Harris and asked who they were. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:20-21); (Pollard Dep. 56:21-57:6). The officers activated their flashlights and rushed onto the property. (Order 2:21-22). The officers claim that they announced themselves as police, but the other witnesses testified that the officers did not identify themselves and that in their camouflage uniforms, they did not recognize the officers as law enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2:21-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While Harris approached several individuals standing in the driveway, Pollard pursued other individuals who had run toward the residence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:1-7). The residence included a porch that is enclosed with a tarp, except for an opening that allowed for ingress and egress through the front door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:8-9). Chasing the runners, Pollard ran up to the porch and pulled back the tarp, looking in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:9-10). Pollard noticed movement to his left and turned to find Fernando Sauceda (\"Sauceda\") pointing a gun at his face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:11-13). Officer Pollard held down Sauceda's right arm and, after a struggle, fired twelves shots at Sauceda as he attempted to flee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:12-14); (Pollard Dep. 71:19-74:2). Officer Pollard's shots hit Sauceda nine times-five in the front and four in the back-and he died shortly thereafter. (Order 3:14-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 30, 2011, Plaintiffs filed the instant suit alleging six causes of action arising from the shooting: (1) violations of the Fourth Amendment under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) section 1983 municipal liability; (3) intentional or negligent infliction of emotional stress; (4) assault and battery; (5) negligence; and (6) negligent supervision and training. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-47, ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 12, 2014, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims, (ECF No. 101). In his order, Judge Gordon found in favor of Defendants on the municipal liability and\n   negligent supervision claims, as well as Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages emanating from municipal liability and state-law tort liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Order 11:1-14:4, 18:4-26, 19:1-13, ECF No. 107). Judge Gordon withheld judgment on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment excessive force claim, the three other state law claims, and Plaintiffs' prayer for punitive damages against Pollard pursuant to \u00a7 1983. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   19:14-20:8). As to excessive force, Judge Gordon concluded that the actual shooting of Sauceda itself was not excessive force. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6:7-8:6). However, Judge Gordon ordered supplemental briefing on whether Pollard's alleged conduct in provoking the shooting independently violated the Constitution such that the Fourth Amendment claim, as well as three state law claims, would survive summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:7-10:22, 16:1-18:3, 19:21-20:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following entry of the order, Plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider, (ECF No. 112), and both parties filed their respective supplemental briefs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 113, 114). Upon Judge Gordon's recusal, this matter was reassigned to this Court, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 115). On December 1, 2015, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and Defendants' motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 17:11-18:2, ECF No. 121). Applying the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule, the Court concluded Pollard may be liable for excessive force because of a disputed issue of material fact \"concerning whether Officer Pollard's actions leading up to the shooting constituted a constitutional violation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:19-21). The Court found that Defendants failed to establish entitlement to the exigency or emergency exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, and that Pollard is not entitled to qualified immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10:10-11, 17:7-10). Finally, the Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' state law claims given the Court's holding as to the provocation rule. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:19-22, 17:14-18:2). Pollard subsequently appealed the Court's judgment to the Ninth Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 123, 125-126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the pendency of Pollard's appeal, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    County of Los Angeles v.

In contrast, when the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense, the moving party can meet its burden in two ways: (1) by presenting evidence to negate an essential element of the nonmoving party's case; or (2) by demonstrating that the nonmoving party failed to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to that party's case on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To establish the existence of a factual dispute, the opposing party need not establish a material issue of fact conclusively in its favor.

Defendants state that Pollard chased individuals onto the enclosed porch only after they refused to yield to Pollard and Harris's command, yelling \"Police. Show me your hands.\" (MSJ 22:25-27, ECF No. 140); (Pollard Dep. 68:5-7, ECF No. 140-2). Several witnesses, however, testified in depositions that they did not recognize Harris or Pollard as police officers, nor did the officers announce themselves as such. (Francisco Aguire Dep. 54:2-14, ECF No. 83); (Jose Rodriguez Dep. 34:22-24, 35:6-9, ECF No. 85); (Cassandra Maynor Dep. 27:1-28:22, ECF No. 86); (Irene Sauceda Dep. 96:6-21, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   No. 80). Because there is a genuine factual dispute as to whether the officers announced themselves, the Court cannot credit the \"failure to obey\" explanation at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to Defendants' general contentions concerning residential gunfire and exigency, Defendants have not proffered any objectively reasonable basis for Pollard's belief that storming the enclosed porch was necessary to prevent destruction of evidence, apprehend suspected persons therein, or to safeguard against harm to officers or others. Instead, the facts Defendants rely upon in their Renewed Motion are either unsupported by the record or undisputedly unknown to the officers at the time of their approach of Plaintiffs' house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For example, Defendants state-without citation to the record-\"Pollard concluded the shots were coming from [Sauceda's house],\" and as the \"Officers parked and approached they heard additional gunshots coming from the house.\" (MSJ 22:4-9). Pollard expressly testified, when asked why he didn't wait for backup: \"We weren't sure that that's where the gunfire came from. We weren't sure.... Because it's dark. We didn't actually see the muzzle flash or anybody shooting there. We only heard shots in the air. We were hearing numerous shots coming from different aspects of the city.\" (Pollard Dep. 45:25-46:18). Indeed, when Pollard observed \"somebody holding something shiny up in the air that looked like maybe the barrel of a rifle,\" he nevertheless stated he could not identify any illegal activity and characterized the persons he saw as innocuously standing in front of Sauceda's house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   34:12-25, 35:19-23, 36:3-37:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Pollard further stated that once the officers left their vehicle and began walking toward Sauceda's house-at normal pace, passing by three houses along the way-the officers heard no further gunfire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   49:15-20). As the officers were in between the second and third house, one of Plaintiffs' unidentified guests asked, \"Who goes there?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   56:21-57:6). According to Pollard, at this point he and Harris announced \"Police! Show us your hands,\" and activated their flashlights. The guests ran in different directions, and Pollard chased after one group headed toward the enclosed porch. Pollard testified that prior to the officers' announcement, they did not see any guns, evidence of a crime, or otherwise feel threatened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   64:14-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Against this backdrop, the Court previously rejected Defendants' reliance on exigency, holding that in addition to an absence of articulable facts suggesting exigency or emergency, the officers' stealth approach was objectively unreasonable. The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The officers were not in pursuit of a fleeing suspect as they approached the house, and there is nothing indicating that the officers' stealth approach and storming of the residence was justified in order to prevent the destruction of evidence, to protect themselves or others, or to effect some other legitimate law enforcement effort. At the time of their approach, the officers did not see any weapons or hear any gunshots, so they had no reason to believe that a quick rush of the residence was necessary to protect themselves or others. Indeed, it was because of the manner of their search that the officers put their lives and the lives of others in danger by creating a chaotic and panicked situation in an area where they believed firearms to be located. Therefore, a jury could find that the manner of their search was unreasonable and not justified by exigent circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order 12:24-13:9, ECF No. 121). Of greater significance here, by resorting to\n   general justifications, Defendants fails to link these justifications to the facts of this case and, specifically, to Pollard's purportedly reasonable belief that entry\n   <em>\n    onto the porch\n   </em>\n   was necessary to achieve those ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants cite several cases for the proposition that gunshots alone, without any other evidence of criminal activity, is enough for an officer's warrantless search for victims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8:24-9:18). The commonality among these cases is that the officers were able to articulate facts leading them to reasonably connect the emergency or exigency with the location to be searched.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, these cases illustrate the point that is fatal to Defendants' position-exigency or emergency in the abstract cannot substitute for specific, articulable facts with respect to warrantless entry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandoval v.

A genuine issue of fact precludes the Court from holding the hot pursuit doctrine justified Pollard's entry.

The Court concludes the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As discussed above, Defendants advance two general arguments-one specific, and one general-to establish Pollard's reasonable belief that a warrantless entry onto the enclosed porch was justified: (1) gunshots in a residential area support an inference of imminent destruction of evidence, danger to officers, or the need to render emergency aid; and (2) Pollard chased Plaintiffs' guests onto the porch after they refused to obey his command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   With respect to Defendants' general contention that residential gunfire gives rise to a host of purportedly reasonable inferences, the absence of any\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   proffered factual basis for Pollard's entry onto the porch suggests to the Court that no reasonable officer could have believed that exigency or emergency justified the warrantless entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hopkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048786\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/752/#p763\">\n    573 F.3d at 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen there is a 'complete lack of evidence that would support a reasonable suspicion,' and the officers have provided a 'wholly inadequate justification for the[ir] search, we conclude that it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that [such a search] was unlawful.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ramirez v.
