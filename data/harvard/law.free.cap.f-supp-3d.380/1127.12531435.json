ECF No. 23. Defendant argues this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine. Defendant also argues that issue preclusion prevents Plaintiff from challenging the validity of the underlying foreclosure at issue in this case. Finally, Defendant argues that even if the Court were to reach the merits of Plaintiff's claims, each claim should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). For the reasons that follow, the Motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    denied in part\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Alternatively, Defendant argues dismissal is appropriate, because it is not clear what cause of action Plaintiff intends. First, I do not agree that this claim is so vague that it fails to state a claim. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant was not the beneficiary of the Note, yet Plaintiff made monthly payments to Defendant. ECF No. 12 \u00b6 23. As such, Plaintiff states it would be unjust to let Defendant retain the benefit of the payments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205882570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mayotte\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit recognized a similar claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266871\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1169/#p1175\">\n    880 F.3d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The plaintiff] alleges that the defendants...have no ownership interest in her promissory note or property, that they have been unjustly enriched by accepting payments not due them....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant also argues that the claim is governed by the terms of a valid contract. ECF No. 23 at 13 n.2. However, this argument would require that I consider the \"Corporate Assignment of Deed of Trust,\" which I have already found to be improper for a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis. Defendant makes no other argument to support dismissal of this claim. Therefore, the claim is not dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Claim 3: No Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In this claim, Plaintiff appears to argue that the Note he executed with Fremont is not valid, because the parties \"never had a meeting of the minds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. However, there is no indication that Defendant was a party to the Note, and Plaintiff otherwise does not demonstrate how Defendant is liable for any action relating to that contract. Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Claim 4: Fraud and Deceit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to meet Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard on his fraud and deceit claim. Rule 9(b) states, \"[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.\" Thus, a plaintiff \"must 'set forth the time, place, and contents of the false representation, the identity of the party making the false statements, and the consequences thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Absent from these allegations is the necessary time and place of any fraudulent act by Defendant, as well as a particular statement regarding harm to Plaintiff.
