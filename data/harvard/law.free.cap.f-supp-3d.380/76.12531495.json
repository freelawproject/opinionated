Buchanan \"cheerfully admitted\" that the House of Representatives had the authority to make inquiries \"incident to their legislative duties,\" as \"necessary to enable them to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedies for any abuses which may be ascertained.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221. But he objected to the Covode Committee's investigation of his conduct. He maintained that the House of Representatives possessed no general powers to investigate him, except when sitting as an impeaching body.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Buchanan feared that, if the House were to exercise such authority, it \"would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors, to whatever political party they might be attached.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Some 160 years later, President Donald J. Trump has taken up the fight of his predecessor. On April 15, 2019, the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives issued a subpoena for records to Mazars USA LLP, a firm that has provided accounting services to President Trump. The subpoena called for Mazars to produce financial records and other documents relating to President Trump personally as well as various associated businesses and entities dating back to 2011-years before he declared his candidacy for office. The decision to issue the subpoena came about after the President's former lawyer and confidant, Michael Cohen, testified before the House Oversight Committee that the President routinely would alter the estimated value of his assets and liabilities on financial statements, depending on the purpose for which a statement was needed. For instance, Cohen said that the President provided inflated financial statements to a bank to obtain a loan to purchase a National Football League franchise. But when it came time to calculate his real estate taxes, the President would deflate the value of certain assets. To support his accusations, Cohen produced financial statements from 2011, 2012, and 2013, at least two of which were prepared by Mazars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Echoing the protests of President Buchanan, President Trump and his associated entities are before this court, claiming that the Oversight Committee's subpoena to Mazars exceeds the Committee's constitutional power to conduct investigations. The President argues that there is no legislative purpose for the subpoena. The Oversight Committee's true motive, the President insists, is to collect personal information about him solely for political advantage. He asks the court to declare the Mazars subpoena invalid and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Courts have grappled for more than a century with the question of the scope of Congress's investigative power. The binding principle that emerges from these judicial decisions is that courts must presume Congress is acting in furtherance of its constitutional responsibility to legislate and must defer to congressional judgments about what Congress needs to carry out that purpose. To be sure, there are limits on Congress's investigative authority. But those limits do not substantially constrain Congress. So long as Congress investigates on a subject matter on which \"legislation could be had,\" Congress acts as contemplated by Article I of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Applying those principles here compels the conclusion that President Trump cannot block the subpoena to Mazars. According to the Oversight Committee, it believes that the requested records will aid its consideration of strengthening ethics and disclosure laws, as well as amending\n   the penalties for violating such laws. The Committee also says that the records will assist in monitoring the President's compliance with the Foreign Emoluments Clauses. These are facially valid legislative purposes, and it is not for the court to question whether the Committee's actions are truly motivated by political considerations. Accordingly, the court will enter judgment in favor of the Oversight Committee.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    James Buchanan, The Works Of James Buchanan Volume XII 225-26 (John Bassett Moore ed., J.B.

The 116\n     <sup>\n      th\n     </sup>\n     Congress and the House Oversight Committee\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    On January 3, 2019, the 116\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Congress began with the Democratic Party controlling a majority of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of the House's first actions was to adopt the \"Rules of the House of Representatives,\" which govern proceedings during the two-year term. This vote took place on January 9, 2019.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Rule X of the adopted House Rules, titled \"Organization of Committees,\" establishes various standing committees and their respective jurisdictions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Among the standing committees with the broadest purview is the Committee on Oversight and Reform (\"Oversight Committee\"). Its subject areas of primary jurisdiction range from the lofty-\"[o]verall economy, efficiency, and management of government operations\"-to the mundane-\"[f]ederal paperwork reduction.\" House Rules at 8. If there is a common thread running through the subjects within the Oversight Committee's jurisdiction, it is the oversight of the operations and administration of the Executive Branch.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    Each of the House's standing committees possess \"[g]eneral oversight responsibilities.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9. Those responsibilities are meant to assist the House in (1) \"its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of\" \"the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of Federal laws\" and (2) \"conditions and circumstances that may indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation,\" and (3) \"its formulation, consideration, and enactment of changes in Federal laws, and of such additional legislation as may be necessary or appropriate.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Some of the House's standing committees have \"[s]pecial oversight functions.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 10. The Oversight Committee is one of them. Its \"special oversight function\" is described as involving the \"review and study on a continuing basis the operation of Government activities at all levels, including the Executive Office of the President.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The Executive Office of the President consists of a small group of federal agencies that most immediately aid the President on matters of policy, politics, administration, and management. The President's closest advisors typically are situated in the Executive Office.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Rule X also vests the Oversight Committee with special authority to conduct investigations. According to the Rule, \"the Committee on Oversight and Reform may\n    <em>\n     at any time\n    </em>\n    conduct investigations of\n    <em>\n     any matter\n    </em>\n    without regard to [other rules] conferring\n    jurisdiction over the matter to another standing committee.\" House Rules at 11 (emphasis added). In other words, the Oversight Committee is empowered to investigate as to any subject matter, even in those areas that are expressly assigned to other committees. No other committee possesses such sweeping investigative authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The Oversight Committee's broad investigative power is not new. In each of the four preceding Congresses-all controlled by the Republican Party, including during the final six years of the Obama Administration-the House Oversight Committee enjoyed the same power \"at any time [to] conduct investigations of any matter.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    <strong>\n     B. The Oversight Committee's Investigation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    From the start of the 116\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Congress, the Oversight Committee, now led by a Democrat, moved aggressively to use its investigative powers. It did not adopt a resolution or issue a public statement defining the scope of what it intended to investigate. Instead, it sent a series of letters to the White House and elsewhere seeking various records regarding the President's personal finances, as well as records concerning his businesses and related entities. For instance, days before the new Congress started, the incoming Chairman of the Oversight Committee, Representative Elijah Cummings, wrote the President's personal lawyer, Sheri Dillon, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Compliance Counsel of the Trump Organization, George Sorial, asking them to produce previously requested \"documents regarding the Trump Organization's process for identifying payments from foreign governments and foreign-government controlled entities ...\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    In a different letter, the Chairman asked the General Services Administration (\"GSA\"), the agency that manages federally owned and leased buildings, to produce records concerning the federal government's lease with the Trump Organization for the Old Post Office Building, which houses the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Chairman Cummings indicated that he sought these records for multiple reasons, including the concern that the lease might violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clauses. Cummings' April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    GSA Letter at 1.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    These are but two examples of the\n    types of records requests made by the Oversight Committee at the start of the 116\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The investigative demand that sparked this lawsuit was issued on January 8, 2019. On that day, Chairman Cummings wrote to Pat Cipollone, the White House Counsel, asking the President to produce \"documents related to President Trump's reporting of debts and payments to his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to silence women alleging extramarital affairs with the President before the election.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    The prior year, in May 2018, the Office of Government Ethics had concluded that the President should have disclosed a payment made by Cohen as a liability on the President's public financial disclosure report.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Chairman Cummings noted in the January 8\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    letter that the Oversight Committee \"has jurisdiction over a wide range of matters, including the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,\" a law that requires \"all federal officials, including the President, to publicly disclose financial liabilities that could impact their decision-making.\" Cummings' January 8\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter at 1. On February 1, 2019, the White House Counsel responded to Chairman Cummings that the President was prepared to consider making some documents available for review.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Chairman Cummings wrote the White House Counsel again on February 15, 2019.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cummings' February 15\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter. He opened by stating that, by his January 8\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    letter, \"the Committee launched an investigation into the failure of President Donald Trump to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments and liabilities to his former attorney, Michael Cohen, to silence women alleging extramarital affairs during the 2016 presidential campaign.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1. Chairman Cummings explained that \"[t]he Committee's interest in obtaining these documents is even more critical in light of new documents obtained by the Committee from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that describe false information provided by lawyers representing President Trump ...\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The letter went on to detail a timeline of recent events starting with statements made by the President's lawyers to the\n    Office of Government Ethics and to the public about a supposed purpose of the Cohen payments unrelated to the election; followed by the President's disclosure of the Cohen payments on his 2017 Financial Disclosure form as a liability of less than $ 250,000; and then revelations by federal prosecutors that the Cohen payments in fact exceeded the $ 250,000 reported by the President.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2-6. In the end, Chairman Cummings cited Congress's \"plenary authority to legislate and conduct oversight regarding compliance with ethics laws and regulations\" as the source of its authority to make the records demand, as well as its \"broad authority to legislate and conduct oversight on issues involving campaign finance.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Subpoena to Mazars USA LLP\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    On February 27, 2019, Michael Cohen appeared for a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    By this time, Cohen had pleaded guilty to a host of federal felony charges, including tax evasion, campaign finance violations, and making false statements to Congress.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    During his testimony, Cohen alleged that financial statements prepared by the President's accountants falsely represented the President's assets and liabilities.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cohen Testimony at 13, 19. Specifically, Cohen stated that, in his experience, \"Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes ... and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Cohen supplied the Oversight Committee with portions of the President's Statements of Financial Condition from 2011, 2012, and 2013, some of which were signed by Mazars.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Following Cohen's testimony, Chairman Cummings wrote to Mazars on March 20, 2019. The letter first summarized aspects of Cohen's testimony accusing the President of manipulating financial statements to suit his purposes; it then identified a half-dozen questions about assets and liabilities reflected in the President's Statements of Financial Condition that Cohen had provided to the Oversight Committee.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cummings' March 20\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter at 1-3. Chairman Cummings stated that these financial statements \"raise questions about the President's representations of his financial affairs on these forms and on other disclosures, particularly relating to the President's debts.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1. The letter concluded by asking Mazars to produce four categories of documents with respect to not just the President, but also several affiliated organizations and entities, including the Trump Organization Inc., the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, the Trump Foundation, and the Trump Old Post Office LLC.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4. The records requested included statements of financial condition, audited financial statements, documents relied upon to prepare any financial statements, engagement agreements, and communications between Mazars and the President or employees of the Trump Organization.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    The relevant time period identified for the requested\n    records was \"January 1, 2009, to the present.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In his initial letter to Mazars, Chairman Cummings did not articulate any legislative purpose for the records requested.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    A week later, on March 27, 2019, Mazars responded that it \"cannot voluntarily turn over documents sought in the Request.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    Mazars cited various federal and state regulations and professional codes of conduct that prevented it from doing so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mazars March 27\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter at 1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    On April 12, 2019, Chairman Cummings distributed a memorandum to Members of the Oversight Committee (\"Memorandum\"), advising them of his intent to issue a subpoena to Mazars.\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Under a section titled \"Need for Subpoena,\" Chairman Cummings cited to Cohen's testimony that the President had \"altered the estimated value of his assets and liabilities on financial statements,\" as well as to the records Cohen had provided to support these claims. Cummings' April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Mem. at 1-2.

In the \"Conclusion\" section of the Memorandum, Chairman Cummings listed the purposes for seeking the Mazars-held records:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    The Committee has full authority to investigate whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office, to determine whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions, to assess whether he is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution, and to review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities. The Committee's interest in these matters informs its review of multiple laws and legislative proposals under our jurisdiction, and to suggest otherwise is both inaccurate and contrary to the core mission of the Committee to serve as an independent check on the Executive Branch.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4.

Chairman Cummings penned that Memorandum in anticipation of issuing the subpoena. It is therefore the best evidence of the Committee's purpose. The Memorandum lists four areas of investigation: (1) \"whether the President may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office,\" (2) \"whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions,\" (3) \"whether he is complying with the Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution,\" and (4) \"whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities.\" Cummings'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Mem. at 4.

App. 4 \u00a7 101\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    In his letter to the White House Counsel dated February 15, 2019, Chairman Cummings alluded to how documents relating to the accuracy of the President's disclosures fell within the legislative purview of Congress: \"Since the earliest days of our republic, Congress has investigated how existing laws are being implemented and whether changes to the laws are necessary. For decades, this has included laws relating to financial disclosures required of the President.\" Cummings' February 15\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter at 9. As to the specific demand made on February 15\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    , which related to the payments by Michael Cohen and the President's failure to publicly report them as a liability, Chairman Cummings explained that \"[t]hese documents will help the Committee determine why the President failed to report these payments and\n    <em>\n     whether reforms are necessary to address deficiencies with current laws, rules, and regulations\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138832\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/135/#p161\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). This legislative rationale applies equally to the financial records requested by the Mazars subpoena. Congress reasonably might consider those documents in connection with deciding whether to legislate on federal ethics laws and regulations. For example, the discovery of additional disclosure violations by the President could influence whether Congress strengthens public reporting requirements or enhances penalties for non-compliance. Thus, there can be little doubt that Congress's interest in the accuracy of the President's financial disclosures falls within the legislative sphere.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Investigating whether the President is abiding by the Foreign Emoluments Clause is likewise a subject on which legislation, or similar congressional action, could be had. The Foreign Emoluments Clause prohibits the President from \"accept[ing]\" any \"Emolument\" from \"any King, Prince, or foreign State\" without the \"Consent of the Congress.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 8. The Constitution thus expressly vests in Congress the unique authority to approve the President's acceptance of \"Emoluments,\" however one defines that term.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Blumenthal v. Trump\n    </em>\n    , No. 17-1154 (EGS),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530824\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/191/\">\n     373 F.Supp.3d 191\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201923398\">\n     2019 WL 1923398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.D.C. Apr. 30, 2019). Even under the President's favored interpretation, the Clause, at a minimum, \"was intended to combat corruption and foreign influence ...\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 203,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201923398\">\n     2019 WL 1923398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8. Surely, incident to Congress's authority to consent to the President's receipt of Emoluments is the power to investigate the President's compliance with the Clause. Without such power, Congress's constitutional function to approve or disapprove Emoluments would be severely and unduly constrained. The Founders could not have intended that result. A congressional investigation to carry out an expressly delegated Article I function, in addition to any legislation that might be had relating to that function, is plainly valid.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    So, too, is an investigation to determine whether the President has any conflicts of interest. As already discussed, it lies within Congress's province to legislate regarding the ethics of government officials. Indeed, exposing conflicts of interest is one of the core objectives of the Ethics in Government Act. As the D.C. Circuit has observed, \"the Act shows Congress'[s] general belief that public disclosure of conflicts of interest is desirable despite its cost in loss of personal privacy.\"\n    <em>\n     Washington Post Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473979,3635691\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/690/252/\">\n     690 F.2d 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 265 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Obtaining records to shed light on whether the President has undisclosed conflicts of interests is therefore entirely consistent with potential legislation in an area where Congress already has acted and made policy judgments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Finally, a congressional investigation into \"illegal conduct before and during [the President's] tenure in office,\" Cummings' April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Mem. at 4, fits comfortably within the broad scope of Congress's investigative powers.

Cir. 1962) (relying on historical practice to determine the scope of a congressional investigation). Twice in the last 50 years Congress has investigated a sitting President for alleged law violations,\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    initiating impeachment proceedings. It did so in 1973 by establishing the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, better known as the Watergate Committee, and then did so again in 1995 by establishing the Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and Related Matters.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    S. Res. 60 (93rd Cong., 1st Session) (Feb. 7, 1973) [hereinafter Watergate Res.];\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    S. Res. 120 (104th Cong., 1st Session) (May 17, 1995). The former investigation included within its scope potential corruption by President Nixon while in office, while the latter concerned alleged illegal misconduct by President Clinton before his time in office. Congress plainly views itself as having sweeping authority to investigate illegal conduct of a President, before and\n    after taking office. This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Before moving on to Plaintiffs' arguments, the court notes that the Oversight Committee has identified several pieces of actual legislation that, it asserts, are related to its overall investigation of the President.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Oversight Committee's Opp'n to Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Injunction, ECF No. 20, at 5-6. The House has passed H.R. 1, which requires, among other things, the President and Vice President to file new financial disclosure forms within 30 days of taking office, and to divest all financial interests that would pose a conflict of interest by \"either converting those interests to cash or investments that satisfy ethics rules or placing those interests in a qualified blind trust or disclosing information about business interests.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256795\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/306/270/#p275\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 6 (citing H.R. 1, 116th Cong., Title VIII (2019)). Other bills cited by the Oversight Committee include H.R. 745, which would strengthen the Office of Government Ethics, and H.R. 706, which would prohibit the President and Vice President from conducting business directly with the Federal Government.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256795\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/306/270/#p275\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing H.R. 745, 116th Cong.

There is no mention of any of these bills in any written request from the Oversight Committee, let alone the April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Memorandum justifying the Mazars subpoena. That absence is not fatal, however. Again, the question for the court is whether the congressional investigation pertains to a subject matter on which legislation could be had, so Congress need not proactively identify any specific legislation to justify its activities. Here, the bills identified by the Oversight Committee demonstrate Congress's intent to legislate, at the very least, in the areas of ethics and accountability for Executive Branch officials, including the President. These are subjects, therefore, on which legislation could be had.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Plaintiffs' Contentions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The court now turns to Plaintiffs' contentions. Each of Plaintiffs' arguments for why the Mazars subpoena exceeds Congress's Article I investigative power fall into one of three general categories. First, by characterizing the Oversight Committee's investigation as one delving \"into the accuracy of a private citizen's past financial statements,\" Plaintiffs contend that the Oversight Committee is engaged in \"a quintessential law enforcement task reserved to the executive and judicial branches.\" Pls.' Stmt. at 11. Plaintiffs similarly contend that an investigation into the accuracy of the President's financial disclosures, his adherence to the Emoluments Clauses, and his present or past compliance with the law is \"law enforcement\" activity that encroaches on the prerogatives of the coordinate branches. Hrg. Tr. at 7, 13-18, 25. Second, Plaintiffs charge that the Oversight Committee's investigation \"has nothing to do with government oversight,\" but is instead intended to expose for the mere sake of exposure \"the conduct of a private citizen years before he was even a candidate for public office ...\" Pls.' Stmt. at 11. Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that the Oversight Committee has exceeded its authority, insofar as it is doing nothing more than \"conduct[ing] roving oversight of the President,\" and the records\n    sought from Mazars are not \"pertinent\" to any legitimate legislative purpose. Pls.' Reply in Support of Pls.' Mot. for Prelim. Injunction, ECF No. 24 [hereinafter Pls.' Reply], at 11-12. The court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <em>\n     1. Usurpation of Executive and Judicial Functions\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Plaintiffs first assert that each of the four justifications for the Mazars subpoena identified by Chairman Cummings in the April 12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Memorandum falls outside the bounds of legislative power, because each seeks to determine whether the President broke the law, a function reserved exclusively to the Executive and Judicial branches.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13-14. That argument, however, rests on a false premise. Just because a congressional investigation has the potential to reveal law violations does not mean such investigation exceeds the legislative function. The Supreme Court's understanding of a \"legislative\" purpose is not so constrained.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    To be certain, the Supreme Court has said that the \"power to investigate must not be confused with any of the powers of law enforcement; those powers are assigned under our Constitution to the Executive and the Judiciary.\"\n    <em>\n     Quinn\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334163\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/155/#p160\">\n     349 U.S. at 161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334163\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/155/#p160\">\n     75 S.Ct. 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Watkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     354 U.S. at 187\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 1173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Nor is the Congress a law enforcement or trial agency.\"). But that limitation is not so absolute as to foreclose Congress from investigating any law violation by a private citizen, let alone a sitting President, so long as Congress is operating with a legislative purpose. As the Court explained in\n    <em>\n     Sinclair v. United States\n    </em>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    It may be conceded that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits; but the authority of that body, directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906798\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/263/#p295\">\n     279 U.S. 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 295,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906798\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/263/#p295\">\n     49 S.Ct. 268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906798\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/263/#p295\">\n     73 L.Ed. 692\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1929). Thus, the Court has made clear that the mere prospect that a congressional inquiry will expose law violations does not transform a permissible legislative investigation into a forbidden executive or judicial function.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McGrain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138832\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/135/#p161\">\n     273 U.S. at 179-80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138832\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/135/#p161\">\n     47 S.Ct. 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Nor do we think it a valid objection to the investigation that it might possibly disclose crime or wrongdoing on [the Attorney's General's] part.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Townsend\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1002484\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/95/352/#p355\">\n     95 F.2d at 355\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (describing\n    <em>\n     McGrain\n    </em>\n    as holding that \"the presumption should be indulged that the object of the inquiry was to aid the Senate in legislating ... even though the investigation might possibly disclose crime or wrongdoing on the part of the then Attorney General, whose name was expressly referred to in the resolution\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Moreover, appellate courts have demanded exacting proof before declaring that Congress has impermissibly intruded into exclusive executive or judicial territories. According to the Supreme Court, \"[t]o find that a committee's investigation has exceeded the bounds of legislative power it must be\n    <em>\n     obvious\n    </em>\n    that there was a usurpation of functions exclusively vested in the Judiciary or the Executive.\"\n    <em>\n     Tenney\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148214\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/367/#p378\">\n     341 U.S. at 378\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148214\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/367/#p378\">\n     71 S.Ct. 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

Therefore, a congressional investigation that seeks to uncover wrongdoing does not, without more, exceed the scope of Congress's authority.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    In this case, there is nothing \"obvious\" about the Oversight Committee's activities to support the conclusion that the subpoena to Mazars is a usurpation of an exclusively executive or judicial function.

Nor is there evidence before the court that the Oversight Committee initiated its investigative activities at the behest of federal or state law enforcement officials, or is coordinating its actions with such officials. If anything, the evidence is to the contrary.

In addition, Plaintiffs cite to statements made by Chairman Cummings before he issued the Mazars subpoena. For instance, in his March 20\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    letter to Mazars, Chairman Cummings focused solely on Michael Cohen's allegations that President Trump misrepresented his assets and liabilities and made no mention of a legislative purpose for obtaining the records.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cummings' March 20\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n    Letter;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    First Supp. Decl. at 5-9.

The [P]resident is a guy who calls truth lies and lies truth. But at some point, he's also creating policy, and that's affecting people's day-to-day life.\" First Supp. Decl. at 42. Plaintiffs also provide a\n    <em>\n     Politico\n    </em>\n    article in which Chairman Cummings is quoted as saying, \"[o]ver the last two years President Trump set the tone from the top in his administration that behaving ethically and complying with the law is optional ...

Accordingly, although the notion from\n    <em>\n     Kilbourn\n    </em>\n    that Congress does not have the general power to investigate into personal affairs remains alive today, the case is largely impotent as a guiding constitutional principle.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Landis, 40 HARV.

The Supreme Court has provided some guidance. In\n    <em>\n     Quinn\n    </em>\n    , the Court said that Congress cannot use its investigative power \"to inquire into private affairs\n    <em>\n     unrelated\n    </em>\n    to a valid legislative purpose.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334163\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/155/#p160\">\n     349 U.S. at 161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334163\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/349/155/#p160\">\n     75 S.Ct. 668\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Watkins\n    </em>\n    , the Court stated that: \"The public is, of course, entitled to be informed concerning the workings of its government. That cannot be inflated into a general power to expose where\n    <em>\n     the predominant result can only be\n    </em>\n    an invasion of the private rights of individuals.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     354 U.S. at 200\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 1173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

As discussed above, legislation could stem from the Oversight Committee's investigation of the President's personal and corporate finances and the possible conflicts of interest under which he is operating. Thus, the potential presence of some intent to \"ridicule, harass, or punish\" the President cannot overcome this facially valid legislative purpose.\n    <em>\n     McSurely\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695138,616239\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/521/1024/\">\n     521 F.2d at 1038\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    In their Complaint and in their supplemental evidentiary submissions, Plaintiffs reference various statements from Democratic Members of Congress and congressional aides to the effect that Democrats are intending to use their subpoena power to exact political retribution.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-30;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    First Supp. Decl. at 35-79.

Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     McGrain\n    </em>\n    , the Court rejected a lower court's decision echoing the arguments Plaintiffs advance here: \"The extreme personal cast of the original resolutions; the spirit of hostility towards the then Attorney General which they breathe; that it was not avowed that legislative action was had in view until after the action of the Senate had been challenged; and that the avowal then was coupled with an avowal that other action was had in view-are calculated to create the impression that the idea of legislative action being in contemplation was an afterthought.\"\n    <em>\n     McGrain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138832\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/135/#p161\">\n     273 U.S. at 176\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6138832\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/135/#p161\">\n     47 S.Ct. 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This argument suffers from two problems. The first is that Plaintiffs conflate the concept of \"pertinency\" with the notion of \"relevancy\" as used in civil proceedings. \"Pertinency\" does not require the court to ask, as it would in a civil discovery dispute, whether the documents requested are likely to yield useful evidence. Instead, pertinency \"is a jurisdictional concept ... drawn from the nature of a congressional committee's source of authority.\"\n    <em>\n     Watkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     354 U.S. at 206\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 1173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The concept appears most often in the context of a\n    <em>\n     criminal\n    </em>\n    conviction for contempt of Congress, in which a person has refused to comply with a subpoena or answer questions posed at a hearing. Pertinency, in this setting, is an element of criminal contempt.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20192\">\n     2 U.S.C. \u00a7 192\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (making it a misdemeanor for a person summoned as a witness before Congress either to not appear or, if \"having appeared, [to] refuse[ ] to answer any question\n    <em>\n     pertinent\n    </em>\n    to the question under inquiry ...\") (emphasis added). The pertinency inquiry therefore asks whether the question posed to a witness is one that fell within the scope of the Committee's investigative authority, which typically is defined by the resolution authorizing the investigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Watkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     354 U.S. at 207-10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159550\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/178/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 1173\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     Sinclair\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906798\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/263/#p295\">\n     279 U.S. at 292\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906798\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/279/263/#p295\">\n     49 S.Ct. 268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that, under the contempt statute, \"a witness rightfully may refuse to answer where the bounds of the\n    power are exceeded or where the questions asked are not pertinent to the matter under inquiry\"). This is not a contempt case and therefore the pertinency inquiry, properly understood, has no role here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    But even if the court were to treat pertinency as akin to a relevance determination, that test is satisfied here. The standard adopted by the Supreme Court is a forgiving one.

Here, the Oversight Committee has shown that it is not engaged in a pure fishing expedition for the President's financial records. It is undisputed that the President did not initially identify as liabilities on his public disclosure forms the payments that Michael Cohen made to alleged mistresses during the presidential campaign.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations arising from those payments.\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n    These events, when combined with Cohen's testimony and the financial statements he supplied, make it reasonable for the Oversight Committee to believe that the records sought from Mazars might reveal other financial transgressions or improprieties. As already discussed, it is not unreasonable to think that the Mazars records might assist Congress in determining whether ethics statutes or regulations need updating to strengthen Executive Branch accountability, promote transparency, and protect against Executive Branch officials operating under conflicts of interest. Additionally, the Mazars records could provide the Oversight Committee with clues about the President's foreign interests or sources of foreign income, if any, which would assist in determining Congress's obligations under the Foreign Emoluments Clause. This concern is not a new one. In other letters seeking records, one sent to the Trump Organization and the other to the GSA, Chairman Cummings expressly stated that the records sought would be useful in assessing the President's compliance with the Foreign Emoluments Clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    n. 7 &amp; 8,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .

More broadly, Plaintiffs maintain that\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    regulation of the \"President's finances or conflicts of interest\" would be unconstitutional for the same reason.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiffs' contention flies in the face of decades of legislation covering the President. For example, the Ethics in Government Act requires the President to report the source, type, and amount of certain income and assets to the Office of Government Ethics.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    5 U.S.C.

The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 provides that\n    no \"executive branch employee,\" including the President, may use \"nonpublic information derived from such person's position\" \"as a means for making a private profit,\" and further states that \"executive branch employees,\" including the President, \"owe[ ] a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence to the United States Government and the citizens of the United States with respect to material, nonpublic information derived from [their] position.\" Pub. Law No. 112-105 \u00a7 9. And, the Presidential Records Act \"directs the President to 'take all such steps as may be necessary to assure that the activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of his constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately documented and that such records are maintained as Presidential records.' \"\n    <em>\n     Armstrong v.

The Supreme Court said as much in\n    <em>\n     Rumely\n    </em>\n    : \"Whenever constitutional limits upon the investigative power of Congress have to be drawn by this Court, it ought only to be done after Congress has demonstrated its full awareness of what is at stake by unequivocally authorizing an inquiry of dubious limits.

Unlike\n    <em>\n     Robert Half Int'l\n    </em>\n    , where the challenged disclosure was to a market competitor, the disclosure here is made to Congress, and the D.C.

That said, the court is not na\u00efve to reality-a reality confirmed by the fact that the Oversight Committee has said that the decision whether to make the records public lies within its discretion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hr'g Tr. at 59. Thus, there is a chance that some records obtained from Mazars will become public soon after they are produced. The second factor of irreparable harm therefore favors a stay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The final two factors-the balance of equities and the public interest-merge when, as here, \"the Government is the opposing party.\"\n    <em>\n     Nken v.

These factors tip the balance in favor of denying a stay. In\n    <em>\n     Exxon\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiff had challenged Congress's right to obtain records from the Federal Trade Commission that contained its trade secrets.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827196,3778820\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/589/582/\">\n     589 F.2d at 586-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The district court denied the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief. In affirming that decision on appeal, the D.C. Circuit held that the public interest favored Congress having access to the records. The court stated that the plaintiff's burden to obtain injunctive relief was \"considerably heightened by the clear public interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the investigatory powers of Congress ... It would, then, require an extremely strong showing by the appellants to succeed in obtaining an injunction in light of the compelling public interest\n    <em>\n     in denying such relief\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827196,3778820\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/589/582/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"827196,3778820\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/589/582/\">\n     at 594\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

But on the question of whether to grant a stay pending appeal, the President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail. Plaintiffs have not raised a \"serious legal question[ ] going to the merits.\"\n    <em>\n     Population Inst.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610489,1615116\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/797/1062/\">\n     797 F.2d at 1078\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And, the balance of equities and the public interest weigh heavily in favor of denying relief. The risk of irreparable harm does not outweigh these other factors. The court, therefore, will not stay the return date of the subpoena beyond the seven days agreed upon by the parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    <strong>\n     VI.

The fact is, no court has ever been asked to address the extent of Congress's power to police the Emoluments Clause. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that there is no case holding that Congress may exercise its power to investigate in relation to that Clause. But just as Congress's authority to legislate is expressly rooted in Article I, so too is its power to consent to presidential receipt of Emoluments. If Congress's power to investigate is incidental to its legislative function, it likewise must be incidental to carry out its Foreign Emoluments Clause function.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"24\">\n    <p id=\"p-138\">\n     Plaintiffs suggested at oral argument that Congress's informing function was limited to rooting out corruption only in \"agencies\" of the Government, and the President is not an \"agency\" of the government.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Hr'g Tr. at 9, 75.
