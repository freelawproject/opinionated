Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sucheta Vyas and Davis Vyas-together, \"Vyas\"-sued Atain Specialty Insurance Company and Team One Claims in Texas state court, alleging that these defendants unreasonably investigated and underpaid an insurance claim for storm damage to their hotels. (Docket Entry No. 1-2 at 9). Atain Insurance removed based on diversity jurisdiction, asserting that Team One was improperly joined. (Docket Entry No. 1). Vyas moved to remand, arguing that the court lacks diversity jurisdiction because Team One is a proper defendant. Atain Insurance responded and submitted documents. (Docket Entry Nos. 6, 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After a careful review of the state-court pleadings, the notice of removal, the motion to remand, response, and the properly considered documents, the court concludes that there was improper joinder and denies the motion to remand. The reasons are explained in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The allegations are straightforward and all too familiar. Vyas alleges that a February 2018 storm damaged some hotels they owned. Although they timely filed an insurance claim, Atain Insurance \"overlooked or ignored\" the property damage and paid too little. (Docket Entry No. 1-2 at 9). Team One investigated the claim on Atain Insurance's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Vyas alleges that Team One \"was unable or unwilling\n   to perform or complete a reasonable inspection\" and missed storm damage to two hotels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Vyas alleges that the Casa Loma Motel had \"exterior damage to the property, including damage to the built-up 3 ply roof, roll roof, soft metal and gutters, as well as stucco damage to the exterior elevations,\" and that the Holiday Plaza Motel had \"exterior damage to the property,\" including damage to the roofs of buildings 1-4, a storage shed, and a laundry room; exterior elevation damage; and damage to rooms 204, 205, 219, 245, and 248, all of which Team One omitted or undervalued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10). Vyas alleges that Team One's \"unreasonable investigation led to the wrongful underpayment and/or denial of [the] claim,\" and that Atain Insurance ratified Team One's findings and actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2019, Vyas sued in the 85th Judicial District Court of Brazos County, Texas, asserting a contract-breach claim and violations of the Texas Insurance Code and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act against Atain Insurance and Team One. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 16-17). Atain Insurance timely removed on the basis that it is not a Texas citizen and that Vyas improperly named Team One as a defendant because Atain Insurance had accepted \"whatever liability\" Team One had to Vyas for its \"acts or omissions related to the claim.\" (Docket Entry No. 1 at 3 (quoting TEX. INS. CODE 542A.006(a) )). Atain Insurance submitted a November 2018 letter it sent to Vyas, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to section 542A.006(b) of the Texas Insurance Code, Atain [Insurance] accepts any liability that Robert Gutierrez, Team One Adjusting Services, Scott Abraham, [or] EnVista Forensics may have for their purported acts or omissions related to this claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 1-2 at 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Vyas has moved to remand, arguing that \u00a7 542A.006 permits \"insurers to assume responsibility for their agent-adjusters without allowing insurers to claim complete diversity when they assume responsibility for a non-diverse adjuster.\" (Docket Entry No. 6 at 4). Atain Insurance responds that Vyas relies on cases involving insurers that elected to accept liability only after the lawsuit had been filed in state court, while Atain Insurance elected to accept liability for Team One months before suit was filed. (Docket Entry No. 9 at 3-5). As a result, Atain Insurance argues, Vyas's claims against Team One had no possibility of success when Vyas sued Team One.
