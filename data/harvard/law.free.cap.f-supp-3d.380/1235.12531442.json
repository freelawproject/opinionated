After a review of the filings and the record, the Court will defer ruling on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss until after an evidentiary hearing. As discussed below, issues about Plaintiff's standing must be resolved before the Court can assess the sufficiency of Plaintiff's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit is based on alleged violations of the Medicare Secondary Payer (\"MSP\") provisions of the Medicare Act (\"MSP Act\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(A). Of relevance, Part C of the Medicare Act authorizes Medicare enrollees to obtain their Medicare benefits from private insurers instead of the government. This insurance is secondary to a primary insurance plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And by law, these private insurance entities\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are \"secondary\n   payers\" for certain medical expenses typically covered under an insured's primary coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   If a primary plan \"has not made or cannot reasonably be expected to make payment\" for covered medical expenses, Medicare insurers are authorized to make a conditional payment as a secondary payer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(i). The primary plan must then reimburse the Medicare insurance \"if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1395y(b)(2)(B)(ii). The MSP provisions contain a private cause of action against a primary plan when the primary plan does not timely reimburse a secondary payer for its conditional payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff MSPA Claims I, LLC (\"MSPA\") alleges entities that administer Medicare benefits assigned to MSPA their legal rights to recover reimbursement of conditional payments made on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. MSPA alleges Defendant First Acceptance Insurance Company, Inc. (\"FAIC\") is a primary plan that failed to reimburse entities for their conditional payments under the MSP Act. FAIC issues motor vehicle policies with no-fault/personal injury protection benefits and/or medical payments to cover medical expenses arising from motor vehicle accidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MSPA illustrates the process of Medicare insurance coverage and secondary payments by referring to the situation of \"D.W.\" MSPA explains that D.W. was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, FAIC provided coverage to D.W. through her automobile insurance policy. D.W. was also a Medicare Part C beneficiary enrolled in an insurance plan administered by Florida Healthcare Plus, Inc. (\"FHCP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.W. received medical services and treatment for her injuries, and her medical providers sent a bill to FHCP. FHCP paid for D.W.'s expenses, totaling $ 19,079.00. According to MSPA, FHCP assigned its legal rights to recover reimbursement to MSPA. MSPA alleges that FAIC failed to pay D.W.'s expenses and then, timely reimburse MSPA for FHCP's conditional payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MSPA asserts two causes of action in its class complaint: one under the private cause of action for the Medicare Act, and another for breach of contract under 42 C.F.R. 411.24(e). MSPA brings its lawsuit on behalf of FHCP and the following class members:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All Medicare Advantage Organizations, First Tier, Downstream and Related entities, or their assignees, that provide benefits under Medicare Part C, in the United States of America and its territories, who made conditional payments for a Medicare beneficiary's medical expenses resulting from injuries arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle (the \"accident-related medical expenses\"), where Defendant:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) is the primary payer by virtue of having issued a motor vehicle insurance policy that offers no-fault/personal injury protection benefits (\"PIP\") and/or medical payments (\"Med Pay\") coverage for accident-related medical expenses to a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) failed to reimburse the Medicare Advantage Organizations, First Tier, Downstream and Related entities, or their assignees, that made conditional payments on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries\n   for their accident-related medical expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   This class definition excludes (a) Defendant, its officers, directors, management, employees, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and (b) any judges or justices involved in this action and any members of their immediate families.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Dkt. 1, p. 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   MSPA's alleged chain of assignment also bears mentioning. According to MSPA, FHCP, a secondary payer under the MSP Act, contracted with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and provided Medicare benefits to its enrollees and participants. FHCP entered into an assignment agreement with La Ley Recovery Systems, Inc. (\"La Ley\"). The agreement noted that \"any rights conferred to [FHCP] by Medicare Advantage plans either by statute, contract and/or any other reason whatsoever will be administered by La Ley Recovery.\" Dkt. 1-1. The agreement also required FHCP's approval of any subsequent assignee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Almost a year after FHCP's assignment to La Ley, La Ley assigned its rights to MSPA. Later, the Florida Department of Financial Services (FHCP's receiver) executed a settlement agreement with La Ley and MSPA confirming that \"all rights, title and interest to recover payments made by FHCP on behalf of FHCP members pursuant to ... incidents recoverable pursuant to the Medicare Secondary Payer Act ... were and continue to be irrevocably assigned to La Ley.\" Dkt. 1-3. The settlement agreement noted that \"the Assigned Claims may be assigned by ... La Ley,\" and \"... any assignment of the rights ... [by] La Ley occurring prior to the execution of this Settlement Agreement shall be valid and enforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MSPA alleges this settlement confirmed that La Ley validly assigned MSPA its rights under the MSP Act, including the right to recover reimbursement from primary insurers like FAIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Attacks on subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) come in two forms.\n   <em>\n    Meszaros ex rel.

Though the parties dispute the necessity for pre-suit notice here, the Court concludes that MSPA was required to file a pre-suit notice in compliance with \u00a7 627.736(10), Florida Statutes.

MSPA points to no authority stating otherwise, and the Court has found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Turning to the sufficiency of the demand letter, FAIC argues the letter lacks the level of specificity required by the statute, was sent before any payment was due, and did not include a copy of the assignment. Based on the limited record at this stage, the Court cannot determine if all the pre-suit notice requirements were met. For example, the statute requires the notice \"state with specificity ... the type of benefit claimed to be due.\" Fla. Stat., \u00a7 627.736(10). The demand letter does not discuss benefits with specificity. The letter does contain columns titled \"dx01\" through \"dx08,\" but there is no explanation of the codes, including whether they even relate to any type of benefit. Because MSPA's compliance with the pre-suit notice requirements implicates MSPA's right to sue, it must be determined promptly. Accordingly, the Court will consider MSPA's compliance with the pre-suit notice requirements at an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holden v. Bober\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7041153,7041111,7041215\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/39/396/\">\n    39 So. 3d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010) (\"compliance with the requirements of [a statute's presuit notice requirements] ...

So, FAIC argues, MSPA's claim for reimbursement is moot. MSPA argues it rejected the payment from FAIC. It also argues the payment was not the complete amount owed. Based on the limited record, including piecemeal email communications, the Court cannot determine whether payment was timely and in compliance with the MSP Act's reimbursement requirements. The parties do not discuss what date payment was due or overdue, which is central to this argument and the pre-suit notice issue. This issue further demonstrates the need for an evidentiary hearing and perhaps before then, some limited discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As an additional point, if MSPA's demand letter met the statutory requirements and FAIC tendered the amount due,\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   payment was overdue, MSPA would still have standing to bring its claims. Said otherwise, if FAIC's payment was overdue, the payment would not render MSPA's claims moot. As the Eleventh Circuit recently explained, the \"alleged injury stems not just from [MSPA's] entitlement to reimbursement of the appropriate amount but also from its entitlement to receive that reimbursement on time... The question is whether delay alone is a 'concrete' injury. It is.\"\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

Fla. Aug. 29, 2016). There, the court concluded MSPA did not allege a valid assignment in its complaint because MSPA did not allege that FHCP approved its assignment. The\n   Court also found merit in FAIC's factual attack on MSPA's standing, noting that the assignment from La Ley was not valid at the time MSPA filed its lawsuit. The court dismissed the case and later, denied reconsideration of its order. In denying reconsideration, the court explained that MSPA \"is not prejudiced in filing a new lawsuit because the case is only at the pleading stage and [MSPA] may well re-plead its claims.\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

For instance, FAIC argues that FHCP did not approve the assignment from La Ley to MSPA, which was required for a valid assignment. The court in the aforementioned Southern District of Florida case found this argument persuasive. But today, this Court has the benefit of a new opinion from the Eleventh Circuit concluding otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claim 1, LLC v.

The court then observed that since those decisions, \"... things have changed. One week before filing this lawsuit, FHCP entered into a settlement agreement with La Ley and MSPA.

The Court is therefore inclined to conclude that based on the Eleventh Circuit's decision, MSPA has a valid assignment of rights for its cause of action. Since the Court is referring other standing issues to a hearing, the Court will allow the parties to present argument about the application of this Eleventh Circuit decision at the hearing, if they choose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   MSPA's lawsuit is yet another one of its attempts to bring a class action against an insurance company under the MSP Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this stage of the litigation, MSPA's standing is at issue. Specifically, questions about MSPA's pre-suit demand letter and FAIC's payment remain a concern for the Court. The Court will therefore refer the matter to the Magistrate Judge assigned to this case to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The Court will leave the issue of conducting limited discovery before the hearing to the Magistrate Judge's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Upon review and consideration, it is therefore\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1.
