Kendall, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Paul Murphy is indigent and homeless. He was convicted of possession of child pornography in 2012 and received a sentence of three years' probation. Five years after his release date, and nearly twice the number of years of his sentence, he remains incarcerated because the Department of Corrections cannot find an appropriate place for him live.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Illinois, like many states, requires sentencing courts to follow a term of imprisonment with a term of mandatory supervised release. Supervised release is a form of post-confinement monitoring intended to assist individuals in their transition from prison to liberty. Most supervised release terms are determinate, but some-including those that apply to several sex offenses-are indeterminate, meaning they range from three years to natural life. The clock on these terms does not start ticking until sex offenders are out of prison, but\n   some never make it that far because they are indigent and the State demands that they first secure a qualifying host site before it will release them. Many offenders successfully complete their entire court-ordered terms of incarceration yet remain detained indefinitely because they are unable find a residence due to indigence and lack of support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The question presented is whether this practice violates the Constitution. The plaintiffs are a class comprising the affected sex offenders and the defendants are the Attorney General of Illinois and the Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections. Both parties moved for summary judgment. (Dkts. 75, 88.) The Court now grants the plaintiffs' motion (Dkt. 75) in part, denies it in part, and denies the defendants' cross-motion in full (Dkt. 88). At the very heart of the liberty secured by the separation of powers is freedom from indefinite imprisonment by executive decree. The Attorney General and Director's current application of the host site requirement results in the continued deprivation of the plaintiffs' fundamental rights and therefore contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Illinois, almost every criminal sentence includes a mandatory supervised release (\"MSR\") term that follows the term of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   730 ILCS 5/5-4.5-15(c). Most MSR terms are determinate, meaning the Legislature sets a finite number of years for the offender to serve.

So, the PRB sets the conditions for an inmate's MSR, but the Legislature directed the IDOC to assist inmates with finding a suitable \"host site\" for residential placement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if the PRB approves an individual for MSR, the IDOC will not extricate that person unless and until he or she satisfies certain conditions, most importantly securing a qualifying host site to reside at while on MSR. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 2.) The IDOC exercises the sole power to approve or deny an inmate's proposed host site based on a variety of statutes and regulations that restrict where sex offenders may live while on MSR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. Ultimately, a parole agent must okay the placement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the case of a someone who is labeled a sex offender, a variety of other statutes and rules also kick in to restrict where and how that individual may reside. These include registration laws and regulations that prohibit sex offenders from living a certain number of feet from schools, parks, and day care centers, as examples. The only time a person can apply for the termination of his or her indeterminate MSR term is after successfully serving three years of that term outside of prison.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Taken together, what all this means is that someone who the PRB approves for release after serving his or her entire term of imprisonment will remain indefinitely confined if the individual is unable to identify a host site that passes muster.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Host Site Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   No more than six months before release, an inmate may propose a host site by giving an address to the field services representative or counselor at the facility who then enters that information into a database. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 1.) Next, the database routes the proposed host site to the appropriate district, where the parole commander verifies the receiving district is correct and that the MSR date of entry is no more than six months away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. If those things check out, the commander assigns the host site to a parole agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The assigned agent begins the host site investigation\n   by checking the Department's mapping software for day care centers and schools within 500 feet of the address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. If none appear, the agent turns to Google Earth to check for playgrounds, parks, and other facilities providing programs exclusively for minors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If any such grounds come up in the search, the agent will generally deny the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moving forward, the agent calls the local registering agency, usually the police department, to verify that it will register an offender at the specified address because state law requires it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The police department, in fact, has the authority to arrest and return to IDOC custody a sex offender who violates any of the residency restriction statutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, if the local police department states that it will not register the offender at that address, the IDOC agent will deny the host site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following the call with the police department, the parole agent visits the proposed host site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. During this visit, the agent looks for day care centers or playgrounds that he or she perhaps missed on the map.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agent will also meet with the host, if any, to ensure that he or she is indeed willing to have the offender reside there and understands all the rules.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Additionally, the agent will determine who else resides in the house and confirm that any co-owners or co-leaseholders agreed to the offender living there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agent's overarching aim and objective is to ensure that the home will be a good environment, meaning financially and emotionally supportive, physically safe, and structurally sound.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   If at any point in the process the agent denies a host site, the parole commander\n   <em>\n    informally\n   </em>\n   reviews the denial to make certain that it is reasonable and meritorious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; Dkt. 91 \u00b6 24. The commander has the prerogative to affirm or reverse the agent's decision. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 8.) But the parties dispute whether there is a\n   <em>\n    formal\n   </em>\n   process for a person to contest the decision of a parole agent to deny approval of a host site. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29.) The plaintiffs claim there is no such procedure through the proper channels in the IDOC, while the defendants state that an offender who disagrees with the denial of a host site may file a grievance at his or her facility. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22.) In the defendants' view, the counselor or grievance officer at the facility can request that the IDOC Parole Department reinvestigate a denied host site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the objection appears to be meritorious, the Parole Commander can either ask the original agent assigned to take a second look or may put a new agent on the case to investigate the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs dispute this, asserting again that the IDOC does not treat denials of parole sites as grievable issues. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants so state, even though their witness 30(b)(6) witness testified that he did not know whether the denial of a host site is a grievable issue. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22 (citing in part Pl. Ex. 14, Dep. of Dixon, at 114:20-115:3); Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29; Dkt. 128 \u00b6 160.) What is more is that the IDOC denied one of the class members' grievances because \" 'IDOC does not set sex offender laws.' \" (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 26 (quoting Ex. 21).) The Administrative Review Board denied review of that decision because \" '[i]ssues are outside the scope of the ARB.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Ex. 21). The defendants did not cite a single example of a grievance concerning a host-site denial being reviewed or overturned. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An offender may also contact the parole agent's supervisor to request review of the agent's decision. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 23.) But the parties dispute whether anybody advises these individuals of this right or gives them any information about how they can contest an unfavorable disposition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants acknowledge that the source\n   the plaintiffs cite for the proposition that offenders never receive notice of this right or any information about potential review does not support that assertion; however, in the same breath they do not provide any evidence suggesting when they are in fact given this information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"While the cited source does not include this information, this does not mean that parolees are never given this information.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   What is clear is that there is no formal PRB procedure that determines whether a parole agent's rejection of a proposed host site was appropriate or not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. \"The parolee has no opportunity to contest the parole agent's decision(s) to reject proposed housing at a PRB hearing and the PRB does not review the IDOC's decision to reject proposed host sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Housing Restrictions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For at least the first two years of their indeterminate MSR terms, many sex offenders must participate in an electronic home detention program. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 6 (citing 730 ILCS 5/5-8A-3(g) ).) The parties dispute whether the technology utilized requires a landline. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 6; Dkt. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20; Dkt. 108 \u00b6 151; Dkt. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 150-51.) By the plaintiffs' account, the IDOC has a \"preference\" for a landline, but the equipment can function without one so long as cellular service exists in the area. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20; Dkt. 108 \u00b6 150.) The PRB may impose additional residential conditions on sex offenders while they are on MSR, such as prohibiting them from \" 'resid[ing] near ... parks, schools, day care centers, swimming pools, beaches, theaters, or any other places where minor children congregate' \" without the prior approval of the IDOC. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 10 (quoting 730 ILCS 5/3-3-7(b-1)(12) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The statute does not define \"near\" and thus leaves it up to the IDOC to exercise its discretion in determining whether a proposed host site is too near an off-limits location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That said, the Department generally considers \"near\" to be 500 feet, consistent with the statute that restricts child sex offenders from residing within 500 feet of schools, playgrounds, and daycare facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11 (citing 720 ILCS 5/11-9.3 ). On top of that, IDOC parole agents have the option to bar a sex offender whose victim was an adult from living near locations where the offender had committed crimes in the past, such as a massage parlor or nail shop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is another statute that prohibits one sex offender from residing in the same \"condominium complex or apartment complex\" as another offender, and the IDOC interprets that to mean that more than one sex offender cannot live in the same trailer park, unless each trailer is on separately-owned land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The IDOC seems to interpret it that way because the Illinois State Police and the Chicago Police Department said it was so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   With respect to computers and other electronics in the home, the IDOC analyzes each request to live at a host site with internet access on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. The plaintiffs dispute this contention because the written policies, by their count, indicate the opposite. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) The defendants claim that the Department recently promogulated new guidelines that proscribe internet-related sex offenders from living in an internet-accessible home while individuals convicted of offenses not relating to the internet (and with no history of misusing computers or the internet) may be allowed to reside in a home with internet access. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiffs see it the other way and contend that it fails to address the residency restrictions dealing with internet access. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Moreover, as a practical matter, the plaintiffs say the\n   IDOC does not let any sex offender live in a host site with computers or other devices. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 14-17; Dkt. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) To illustrate, Daniel Barron's conviction for criminal sexual assault did not involve the use of a computer or the internet but he still may not access it. Dkt. 108 \u00b6\u00b6 148, 158; Dkt. 128 \u00b6 158. By plaintiffs' count, Jason Tucker, Nicole Uhlir, Jennifer Tyree, Mike DiMichele, Bill Carney, and Robin Frazier's crimes all were unrelated to the internet, but notwithstanding that, the IDOC prohibits them from paroling to host sites with internet access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-157, 159; Dkt. 128 \u00b6\u00b6 153-57, 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Upon sex offenders' initial release, the IDOC forbids all of them-whether convicted of crimes against adults or children-from living in a home where children also live or even visits \"one time.\" (Dkt. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20.) Even so, a parent of a minor child may at some undefined later point request the ability to visit or live with the child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In other words, the IDOC will not release a married parent of a minor child to his or her own home to be with his or her spouse and child.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The only way that individual can get out of prison is if he or she can obtain a residence separate and apart from his or her family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Parole agents have the additional discretion to deny approval of host sites for the presence of any of the following: a dog or other pets; alcohol; children's toys or clothes; devices that can access the internet like an iPad (perhaps on a case-by-case basis); pictures of children (even if those children are relatives of the individual on MSR or his or her own child); cameras, binoculars, telescopes, video equipment; gaming systems; and safes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. If the host agrees to remove the problematic items, however, the agent can still approve the site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Transitional and Interstate Housing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There are no halfway houses or transitional housing facilities in Illinois that will accept an individual convicted of a sex offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 25. Additionally, the IDOC does not permit any sex offender to use a homeless shelter as his or her host site. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 29.) This group of people is also ineligible for work release programs that the IDOC provides.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. It is possible for an offender to serve his or her MSR term outside of Illinois, however he or she must satisfy the criteria for transfers under the Interstate Compact for Adult Supervision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 9. These criteria include, in part, a requirement that the individual will either receive income or other financial support in the receiving state. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 31; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 9-10.) The person can prove that they receive such support with evidence that he or she has a job, a letter from a family member or friend agreeing to cover him or her, evidence that he or she receives adequate government benefits, or possibly through other means.

The Wisconsin DOC subjects homeless parolees to special restrictions, including GPS monitoring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137.

The system tracks offenders' whereabouts, their movement, how long they remain in any location, and the precise time of their movement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139. It additionally sends parole agents an immediate alert when a parolee enters an exclusion zone-somewhere the agent does not permit the person to be-or an inclusion zone, wherever\n   the agent specifies that the offender should be at a specific time, like a job or appointment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The agent can use a computer to see where the offender is at any given time and review stored location data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties dispute whether GPS and electronic monitoring are duplicative of each other and truly necessary (for example, to monitor a parolee when he or she is home). (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 19.) The parties further dispute whether a well-used GPS monitoring system is enough standing alone to monitor homeless sex offenders, or whether additional parole agents and resources are necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b621.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The defendants' representative testified that using this GPS system to track sex offenders is \" 'not a good fit.' \" (Dkt. 88 \u00b6 140.) He also stated that using GPS to monitor these individuals would be a \" 'huge public safety risk' \" because the offender would not have a defined place to be or a purpose for his or her actions, defeating the purpose of MSR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The witness asserted being homeless would place a sex offender at greater risk of being blamed for other crimes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That said, the IDOC releases other convicted felons (including murderers and violent criminals) into homelessness to serve their MSR terms so long as they do not have electronic monitoring as a condition of that term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 18.

For instance, a court convicted Jason Tucker of predatory criminal sexual assault in 2011 and sentenced him to seven years in prison (at 85%), plus an MSR term of three years to life. (Dkt. 128 \u00b6 143.) Since moving from prison to MSR in 2017, the IDOC has always required Tucker to wear a GPS ankle monitor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Taking another example, Nicole Uhlir is currently on MSR for predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, and she wears a GPS ankle monitor on top of the \"beacon\" device in her home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Further illustrations abound, including Jennifer Tyree, Michael DiMichele, Bill Carney, and Robin Frazier, all sex offenders who the IDOC requires to wear GPS monitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-47, 149. Many also have beacon monitors in their homes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-47. The technology allows parole agents to keep an eye on the individuals, which one time prompted Tyree's agent to ask her why she stopped at a Steak and Shake on her way home from work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.

This application of the statutory scheme discriminates against the plaintiffs because of their poverty. The undisputed record demonstrates that the class members are adult criminal sex offenders who have completed their terms of imprisonment and attempted to comply with the requirements imposed upon them in securing a host site. Because they are indigent and homeless, however, the plaintiffs have been-and still are-incapable of doing so. The fact that the defendants are not requiring the plaintiffs to pay them via a\n   fine, but rather a third-party (potentially a landlord), is entirely beside the point because the defendants still require the defendants to have money and financial support to get out of prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   By way of example, J.D. Lindenmeier completed the term of incarceration that the trial court ordered him to serve for the commission of his original sex crime (one count of predatory criminal assault of a child) in 2011, which is when the PRB approved him for release. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 63.) His continued imprisonment is not the result of the underlying offense but is instead the consequence of his indigency, homelessness, and the attendant powerlessness to procure housing that will satisfy the IDOC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70. Lindenmeier's incarceration, then, is for reasons completely beyond his control. Looking at another instance, Stanley Meyer completed his term of imprisonment for his original sex crime (one count of criminal sexual assault) in 2011, when the PRB approved him for release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-73. He, too, remains incarcerated-not as a consequence of the underlying offense but because he is indigent and homeless, leaving him unable to identify a host site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   On its face, the statutes and regulations equally apply to all convicted sex offenders by mandating a stable host site that satisfies all associated requirements. The scheme does not facially classify offenders, and upon completion of the court-ordered term of imprisonment, all sex offenders can theoretically regain their liberty by providing an address that meets all obligations. As applied, however, the opportunity for an indigent and homeless sex offender to procure release from confinement following completion of incarceration is virtually nonexistent. As the undisputed and material evidence demonstrates, only those sex offenders with access to funds to pay for their own accommodations at an approved location will be free from incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Indigents without the resources to pay for lodging will remain in prison indefinitely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (\" 'Q: Is it possible for a sex offender with an indeterminate MSR term who, A, does not have money to pay for his own housing, and, B, does not have family or friends on the outside who can pay for his housing [whether by living with them or paying for separate accommodations] to ever get out of the Illinois Department of Corrections? A: Never say never, but, ... using those criteria, no.' \"). This confinement is potentially endless for the indigent and homeless sex offender solely because he or she has no money to secure a place to stay when imprisonment ends and mandatory supervised release (supposedly) begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The defendants have created separate consequences for indigent, homeless sex offenders and for non-indigent, non-homeless sex offenders. Only those who have no financial resources suffer a continued deprivation of liberty following the completion of their court-ordered term of incarceration for the original sex offense. The defendants are punishing the plaintiffs for their indigency and homelessness, matters totally beyond their control. The defendants are therefore wrong to argue that the IDOC's requirement that sex offenders have a stable host site (applied collectively through statute, regulation, and policy) is rationally related to protecting the public, especially children. The right pivot point in the equal protection context is whether the government's separate and discriminatory treatment of similarly situated individuals rationally relates to a legitimate penological interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In this case, the defendants' application of the laws to keep indigent and homeless sex offenders locked up (while non-indigent sex offenders roam free) has\n   no reasonable relation to public protection. Quite the contrary, \"the condition at issue here-indigency-is itself no threat to the safety or welfare of society.\"\n   <em>\n    Bearden v.

There is no meaningful penological distinction between indigent and non-indigent sex offenders: the state's public safety objective is constant. A homeless and indigent sex offender is presumably as dangerous to the community as one who is capable of paying for his own lodging. That wraps up the first\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   factor, and turning to the others, they also weigh in favor of invalidation of this practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stojanovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3489933\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/309/48/#p52\">\n    309 F.

Perhaps the defendants could relax some MSR requirements that do not implicate wealth, but that is hard to imagine on the record as it stands now. Even assuming that factor tilted toward the defendants, the other two do not. The impact that accommodating the right will have on prison resources is actually a positive one. (Dkt. 88 \u00b6\u00b6 134-35 (agreeing that the average cost to the State of supervising a parolee on release in the community is approximately $ 2,000/year, compared to $ 26,365/year to incarcerate a person).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   There are alternatives to the policy. The Court is of course aware that the intent of the Illinois Legislature, public safety, is a compelling state interest. The manner in which the defendants are administering the enacted corrective framework, however, unconstitutionally subjects indigent, homeless sex offenders to a loss of liberty for the solitary reason that they cannot afford rent. The defendants are capable of utilizing constitutional methods to effectuate the legislative purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For instance, the defendants may demand that a determination be made in every case whether an offender made efforts to comply with the statute and failed to do so only because he or she was indigent. This is a process endorsed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   , from which the defendants may take their cue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    461 U.S. at 668-69, 72-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An extension of that rule here would require the defendants to \"consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment.

The parties fundamentally disagree on whether there\n   is a formal process in place for a person to contest the decision of a parole agent to deny approval of a host site. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29.) The defendants submit that an offender who wishes to contest the denial of a host site may file a grievance at his or her facility. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22.) The plaintiffs call the defendants bluff on this point, asserting that the IDOC does not treat denials of parole sites as grievable issues. (Dkt. 107 \u00b6 30.) For what it is worth, the defendants' witness testified that he did not know whether the denial of a host site is a grievable issue. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 22 (citing in part Pl. Ex. 14, Dep. of Dixon, at 114:20-115:3); Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29; Dkt. 128 \u00b6 160.) The record contains several illustrations of the IDOC refusing to review a host-site denial; in fact, the defendants did not come up with one example of a host-site denial being reviewed or overturned. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 26, 71; Dkt. 107 \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   That is not all. The parties also dispute whether the IDOC ever advises offenders of their right to contact the parole agent's supervisor to request review of the agent's decision, let alone gives them any information pertaining to how they can challenge an unfavorable disposition. (Dkt. 91 \u00b6 23.) Consequently, it is unclear whether releasees are ever given this information. As it stands now, all that appears to be agreed on is that a releasee \"has no opportunity to contest the parole agent's decision(s) to reject proposed housing at a PRB hearing and the PRB does not review the IDOC's decision to reject proposed host sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Granted, the PRB does have a process in place to protect against a capricious taking of liberty: it is called revocation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   730 ILCS 5/3-3-9(a)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

The defendants' application of the host site requirement, while perhaps contributing to public safety, frustrates the rehabilitation process and is constitutionally void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Because the substantive-limits claim carries the day, the Court need not reach the plaintiffs' additional and alternative argument that the challenged scheme violates the Eighth Amendment by imposing a disproportionate sentence. The parties also briefed the issue of deliberate indifference earlier on in this litigation but have since seemed to abandon it in their reply briefs. The question of whether state of mind is a necessary element of a substantive-limits Eighth Amendment claim, as opposed to, for instance, a kinds-of-punishment claim (e.g.\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ), is one not definitively answered by the case law. That might not come as a surprise because the Supreme Court applies the substantive limitation (proscribing punishment of a status) \"sparingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Ingraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126861\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/651/#p667\">\n    430 U.S. at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126861\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/651/#p667\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For what it is worth, none of the cases on this Eighth Amendment branch discuss deliberate indifference. In its standing analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit recognized as a general matter that when \"the state transgresses this limit, a person suffers constitutionally cognizable harm as soon as he is subjected to the criminal process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5322325\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/444/1118/#p1137\">\n    444 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (vacated as moot following settlement). A plaintiff with this species of claim, then, need only show that\n   <em>\n    objective\n   </em>\n   deprivation of liberty or property after the state overstepped the bound on its ability to criminalize. The Court appreciates, though, that this as-applied challenge is unique in the sense that the punishment is a post-conviction harm (extension of incarceration) and not a pre-conviction one. So, it is the jailers-not the arresters-that matter in this case, and\n   <em>\n    subjective\n   </em>\n   intent is generally a prerequisite in lawsuits against correctional staff (but not the police).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Assuming for the sake of argument that the plaintiffs must plead and prove deliberate indifference, the Court concludes that they have.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Childress\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228849\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/433/#p438\">\n    787 F.3d at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants knew of this problem and the risk that they were inflicting unwarranted punishment (e.g. numerous lawsuits, admissions in this case, news media and other public records); they failed to act or took ineffectual action (indeed, their continued enforcement exacerbated it); and their response caused the unjustified detention (they chose to confine these individuals past their release date).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329114\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/665/#p669\">\n    452 F.3d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This awareness amounts to a reckless disregard of constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Once again, the Court notes that its decision relates to an as-applied challenge and it in no way purports to tell the defendants\n   how to best administer mandatory supervised release for sex offenders. The Court does not order the immediate release of the plaintiffs, nor does it hold that the framework always operates unconstitutionally or that there are no set of circumstances under which it would be valid. The Court only holds that the host site requirement is unconstitutional under the specific facts in this case and as applied to the defendants. It remains the IDOC's job to appropriately exercise its discretion to achieve the goals of the state legislature in implementing mandatory supervised release for sex offenders. Accordingly, the Court grants the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 75) on the Eighth Amendment claim (Count IV) and denies the defendants' cross-motion (Dkt. 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Sex offenders are criminals, plain and simple. Yet the \"one enduring lesson in the long struggle to balance individual rights against society's need to defend itself against lawlessness,\" is that it \" 'is easy to make light of insistence on scrupulous regard for the safeguards of civil liberties when invoked on behalf of the unworthy. It is too easy. History bears testimony that by such disregard are the rights of liberty extinguished, heedlessly at first, then stealthily, and brazenly in the end.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Constitution thus entitles them to the same conditional liberty that all other releasees receive. Because the defendants' current application of the host-site requirement permits the indefinite detention of the plaintiffs, it breaches the promises enshrined in the Bill of Rights. The Court accordingly grants the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 75) as to their equal protection (Count II) and Eighth Amendment claims (Count IV), denies it as to their substantive (Count I) and procedural (Count III) due process claims, and denies the defendants' cross-motion in full (Dkt. 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Although the Court today decides liability, it reserves ruling on the proper remedy to afford the plaintiffs. The Court sets a status hearing for 4/22/2019 at 9:00 a.m. to discuss a trial date for the procedural due process claim and the need for a remedial hearing to determine the scope of equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    This specific exercise of discretion is very troubling; however, the Court notes that Judge Feinerman is currently considering the constitutional propriety of this restriction in\n    <em>\n     Frazier et al. v. Baldwin\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-1991 (N.D. Ill. 2018).
