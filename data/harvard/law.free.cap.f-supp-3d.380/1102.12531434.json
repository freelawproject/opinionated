Plaintiffs, a group of technology firms primarily engaged in the business of cryptocurrency mining, asked this Court to enjoin Grant County PUD No. 2 from implementing its \"Evolving Industries\" electricity rate class, which substantially increases the cost of electricity supplied to \"evolving industries,\" including Blocktree\n   and other Grant County cryptocurrency miners. The Court finds that Blocktree has failed to show that they will suffer irreparable harm unless a preliminary injunction is imposed. Further, Blocktree is not likely to succeed in showing that Rate Schedule 17 is discriminatory or arbitrary, that their classification as an evolving industry was made without due process, or that the District's actions violated Blocktree's right to carry on a business under the Washington State Constitution's Privileges and Immunities Clause. Therefore, the Court denies Blocktree's request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cryptocurrency Mining and Blockchain Technology\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs Blocktree Properties, LLC; Corsair Investments WA, LLC, Cytline, LLC; 509 Mine, LLC, MIM Investors, LLC; Miners United, LLC; Telco 214 Wholesale Software, Inc.; Mark Vargas; and WeHash Technology, LLP (collectively, \"Blocktree\") are a group of technology firms that provide verification and security services for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. ECF No. 25 at 11. Cryptocurrencies are digitally-based currency that exist solely on the internet and are unregulated and unmanaged by third parties, such as banks or governments. ECF No. 1 at 7-8. The blockchain is the data structure through which cryptocurrency transactions are identified, tracked, and shared across networks of computers, working as a digital ledger.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Supporters of cryptocurrencies claim that the blockchain allows for more secure and transparent monetary transactions than traditional payment methods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the blockchain to track cryptocurrency transactions, the transactions must be verified by independent blockchain participators. ECF No. 1 at 7-8. Blockchain verifiers, also known as cryptocurrency miners, are given the chance to verify cryptocurrency transactions by solving complicated mathematical problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The first miner to solve the problem, and then verify the transaction on the blockchain, is rewarded with a small amount of cryptocurrency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Miners rely on advanced and specialized computer hardware to successfully mine cryptocurrency before others can secure the cryptocurrency reward for themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because cryptocurrency mining is technologically complex and requires advanced equipment, one of a miner's biggest expenses is electricity. ECF No. 1 at 9. Cryptocurrency miners work to reduce their power bills by locating their operations in areas with inexpensive and reliable access to high amounts of electricity. ECF No. 37-6 at 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Grant County PUD No. 2's Relationship with Cryptocurrency Miners\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants are Grant County Public Utility District Number 2, its Commissioners, and staff (collectively, \"the District\"). ECF No. 1 at 6-7. The Public Utility District is established under Title 54 of the Revised Code of Washington and operates as a municipal corporation at the direction of elected Commissioners, who are assisted by hired staff. ECF No. 37 at 9. The District boasts one of the least expensive power rates in the country due to its close proximity to reliable energy sources, such as the Grand Coulee Dam. ECF No. 32-1 at 656. Blocktree, drawn to the District by the affordable and reliable electricity, set up operation centers in the District over the previous five years. ECF No. 25 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District charges its customers for power based on the customers' operations and power consumption. ECF No. 37 at 9. Customers of similar industries and operations are grouped into rate classes and are\n   charged for power under the rates imposed on each class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Currently, Blocktree is charged under Rate Schedule 7 (\"RS-7\"), which is the rate for large general service customers who use between 200 kW\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 5,000 kW of power a month. ECF No. 37-6 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District contends that it received unprecedented interest from cryptocurrency miners in the summer of 2017. ECF No. 37-6 at 7. Since 2017, the District states that it has received interest from over 125 cryptocurrency mining companies, which the District equates to 1,500 MW of power, more than double the District's average load of 600 MWa.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The District became worried that the large number of cryptocurrency miners would overload the District's power systems and inhibit the District's ability to supply power to all of its customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Additionally, the District was worried about the risks imposed by the uncertainties in the cryptocurrency mining industry and whether the miners' failure to profit from the activity would result in a failure to pay high power bills, leaving the rest of the District's customers responsible for the unpaid electricity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To address the issues generated by the growing interest from cryptocurrency miners, the District developed two different strategies. The first was known as a two-queue approach. ECF No. 37-6 at 13. Under the two-queue approach, \"traditional\" customers are placed in one queue for electricity, and those belonging to an \"evolving industry,\" such as cryptocurrency miners, are placed in another queue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The District would service the traditional customers before servicing those in the evolving industry queue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The second strategy developed by the District was the evolving industry rate class, whose electricity bills would be calculated under the newly-developed Rate Schedule 17 (\"RS-17\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rate Schedule 17\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District's hired staff began the creation of RS-17 in late 2017 as an approach to handle the sudden interest from cryptocurrency mining companies. ECF No. 37-6 at 11. On April 24, 2018, the staff, in a public presentation, recommended that the Commissioners establish a new rate schedule for industries like cryptocurrency mining that face certain viability risks while simultaneously consuming a relatively large portion of the District's power load.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. On May 8, 2018, the Commissioners approved the creation of an evolving industry class by passing Resolution No. 8885.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following Resolution No. 8885, the District's staff drafted a memorandum describing the problems presented by the rapidly-growing cryptocurrency mining industry and how the new rate class, authorized by the Resolution, could potentially solve those issues. ECF No. 37-6 at 90. The staff recommended that customers would be placed into the \"evolving industry\" category, and therefore subjected to the secondary queue and RS-17, if the industry in question showed certain risks. The District classified the risks into three categories, as quoted from the memorandum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Regulatory Risk - Risk of detrimental changes to regulation with the potential to render the industry inviable within a foreseeable time horizon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Business Risk - Potential for cessation or significant reduction of service due to a concentration of business risk, in an evolving or unproven industry, in the value of the customer's primary output.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Concentration Risk - Potential for significant load concentration within Grant PUD's service territory resulting in a meaningful aggregate impact and corresponding future risk to Grant's revenue stream. Evaluation would begin to occur when industry concentration of existing and service request queue customer loads exceeds 5% of Grant PUD's total load.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The staff recommended that an industry be categorized as an evolving industry if the industry showed a concentration risk and one of the other two risks, and that the District evaluate an industry's placement in the evolving industry category on an annual basis. ECF No. 37-6 at 91. For regulatory risk, the District would consider pending state and federal legislation, regulatory rulings from state and federal agencies, and feedback from investment banks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For business risk, the District would consider trends in the price volatility of the industry's primary product, the financial strength of market participants, and the viability and competitiveness of the industry based on the threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of customers, bargaining power of suppliers, and industry rivalry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For concentration risk, the District would consider whether all customers within the industry use 5% or more of the District's power load.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After another public meeting on June 26, 2018, the Commissioners adopted RS-17 by passing Resolution No. 8891 on August 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111. Thereafter, cryptocurrency mining was classified as an evolving industry, subject to the secondary queue and RS-17. ECF No. 32-1 at 490.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The rate charged for electricity under RS-17 is significantly higher than the rate charged under RS-7. As a result, the District decided to incrementally implement RS-17. ECF No. 37-6 at 113. The District will begin charging RS-17 rates to evolving industry customers on April 1, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The rate will increase on April 1, 2020, and then increase again to its full rate on April 1, 2021.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rates are calculated on a monthly basis by totaling three separate charges: a Basic Charge, which is a flat monthly fee; an Energy Charge, which is a fee calculated based on the amount of power used by the customer in the billing month; and a Demand Charge, which is a fee calculated based on the most amount of power that the customer needed at the customer's peak power consumption over a 15-minute period. ECF No. 37-6 at 4-5. The following chart shows the increase in electricity prices that Blocktree must pay as RS-17 is incrementally implemented:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-29\"><strong>RS-7</strong> <strong>RS-17B (April</strong> <strong>RS-17B (April</strong> <strong>RS-17B (April</strong> <strong>2019)</strong> <strong>2020)</strong> <strong>2021)</strong> <strong>Basic Charge</strong> $148.32/month $500/month $750/month $1,000/month <strong>Energy Charge</strong> $0.02100 per $0.02219 per $0.02465 per $0.03518 per kWh for the firs kWh kWh kWh 50,000 kWh; $0.01875 per kWh thereafter <strong>Demand</strong> $4.96/kW $8.00/kW $19.00/kW $30.00/kW <strong>Charge</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113. According to Blocktree, once RS-17 is fully implemented, their electricity expenses will increase between 295% and 400%. ECF Nos. 26-31; 36-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Miners' Objections to the Evolving Industry Classification and RS-17\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Throughout the development and implementation of the evolving industry class and RS-17, Blocktree voiced its objections. Blocktree submitted written comments to the District, arguing that the classification was unnecessary and that cryptocurrency miners should not be placed within that classification. ECF No. 37-6 at 99-106. They also appeared at several public presentations to voice their objections to RS-17.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-18. Blocktree argued that the District developed the evolving industries classification and RS-17 based on misconceptions and misunderstandings about the cryptocurrency mining industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-106. Blocktree also voiced concerns that the District was using the evolving industries classification and RS-17 to discriminate against cryptocurrency miners based on public opposition to the mining operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-1 at 389-393.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After RS-17 was implemented and cryptocurrency mining was classified as an evolving industry, Blocktree filed the present lawsuit against the District. ECF No. 1. Blocktree claims that the District violated the dormant Commerce Clause, the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Washington State Constitutions, the Federal Power Act, Washington's utility laws, the District's own internal policies, and the Washington State Constitution's Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the present Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Blocktree asks this Court to enjoin the implementation of RS-17, set to begin on April 1, 2019, throughout the litigation. ECF No. 25. Blocktree argues that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-35. Blocktree also argues that they will suffer irreparable harm because RS-17 will raise their power costs sufficiently to cause them to go bankrupt; that the equities are in their favor; and that a preliminary injunction will further the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To succeed in securing a preliminary injunction, the moving party must demonstrate \"that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

ECF No. 25 at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Blocktree fails to recognize one of the main aspects of the District's justification\n   for classifying cryptocurrency mining as an evolving industry: the sudden influx of interest from cryptocurrency mining companies in the District's area of service. According to the District, since the summer of 2017, they have received 125 requests for service totaling 2,000 MW of new load, 75% of the new load being from cryptocurrency mining operations.

The District also argued that the volatility of cryptocurrency prices exposes the District to the risk of unpaid power bills by Blocktree and other cryptocurrency mining operations. ECF No. 32-1 at 659. Further, the District has stated that RS-17 also will apply to future industries that present the same traits as cryptocurrency mining. ECF No. 37-6 at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Blocktree's arguments can be summarized as picking and choosing traits from different industries and combining them together, resulting in the District's discrimination against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26 at 13-18 (Mr. Kemp's conclusions); ECF No. 42 at 61 (price volatility chart of polysilicon). However, the Court finds that combining the traits from several different industries together does not show, at this point in the litigation, a likelihood that the District intentionally discriminated against Blocktree or that their decision to classify cryptocurrency mining as an evolving industry was made in the absence of evidence. Blocktree ignores the main reason motivating the District's classification decision: the sudden influx of interest from cryptocurrency miners in the District's power services. ECF No. 32-1 at 457. The cryptocurrency industry's sudden interest in Grant County and the unique traits of the industry, all of which were considered by the District in creating and implementing RS-17, show that Blocktree has failed to overcome the presumptive reasonableness of RS-17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Shiloh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20P.2d%201083\">\n    724 P.2d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that Blocktree is not likely to succeed on their second utility rate statutory argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Blocktree's third argument under Washington's ratemaking laws is that the District did not rely on \"scientific statistical analysis\" to create RS-17, and instead relied on subjective determinations.

ECF No. 25 at 23. While scientific statistical analysis could be one way to show that the charged rates are reasonable,\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Shiloh\n   </em>\n   does not state that a utility district is required to use scientific statistical analysis to prove the reasonableness of charged rates.\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Shiloh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=724%20P.2d%201083\">\n    724 P.2d at 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument also implies that the burden is on the District to prove that its rate is reasonable by showing\n   that the rate is based on scientific statistical analysis.

According to Blocktree, the 31% premium can be attributed to an \"adder,\" or an additional charge for a specific purpose, to pay for an upgraded transmission system by 2021, an extra charge for the extra wear on the District's distribution systems caused by cryptocurrency miners, and an extra charge to protect the District from abandoned facilities if the cryptocurrency miners cease operations. ECF No. 25 at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The District argues that RS-17 is based on both direct and indirect costs to the District in servicing cryptocurrency miners. ECF No. 37 at 25. In calculating the rates charged under RS-17, the District assumed 200 MW of new load from cryptocurrency miners, which is far less than the potential load of the interested miners (1,500 MW) or miners that had actually applied for services from the District (313 MW). ECF Nos. 32-1 at 549; 37-6 at 16. The District then calculated RS-17's rate based on the effects estimated from 200 MW of new load, including: a need to upgrade transmission systems by 2021 instead of 2026; projected wear on the distribution system from the new customers; and the risks involved in losing a cryptocurrency mining customer without warning. ECF No. 37-2 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While Blocktree disagrees with the method with which RS-17 was calculated, the District has provided justifications for every element of RS-17. The District argues that the transmission adder is necessary because the current load of cryptocurrency customers, along with the projected new 200 MW of load, will require an equipment upgrade quicker than the previously-planned upgrade in 2026. ECF Nos. 37-2 at 7; 37-4 at 7; 37-5 at 14-15. Further, customers charged under RS-17 are only paying a portion of the costs for the new equipment and are not subsidizing the new equipment for the benefit of the entire district. ECF No. 37-5 at 7. While it is true that cryptocurrency miners' current electricity load has not caused wear on the District's equipment yet, RS-17 was calculated based on the costs associated with the projected wear from an increased 200 MW of load from cryptocurrency miners, including additional equipment and crew. ECF No. 32-1 at 518 (excerpt from public presentation explaining that a portion of RS-17 payments \"[a]llocates additional equipment and crew time to deal with overheating and additional wear.\") and 602 (\"Have not experienced residential equipment failure due to cryptocurrency mining.\"). Additionally, the District states that the upgrades would not be needed if they did not receive a large amount of interest from the cryptocurrency mining field, necessitating the extra charge that protects the rest of the District's customers from paying for upgrades that they do not need.

The District, as a government entity, is serving the public by protecting the public's need for long-term power while addressing the immediate needs and concerns generated by the cryptocurrency's interest in Grant County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-1 at 387-403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Court recognizes the uniqueness of the factual scenario presented by this case. The Court's research did not find a case similar to the case at hand, in which a utility district implements a new rate schedule and rate classification through public comment and participation, but then classifies a group of customers thereafter using subjective factors. However, the Court's task in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction is to weigh the four\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   factors and determine whether Blocktree is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims; whether Blocktree will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction; whether the equities tip in its favor; and whether an injunction would be in the public interest, based on the case law and standards currently available for the Court's consideration.\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Court finds that Blocktree has failed to make a clear showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits of any of its claims. In addition, the Court finds that Blocktree has not shown that it will suffer an irreparable injury without the imposition of a preliminary injunction. Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 25\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .

Billing rates are calculated using \"kilowatt hours\" (\"kWh\"), a unit for measuring power consumption. A device that consumes one kW of constantly-supplied power for one hour consumes one kWh.
