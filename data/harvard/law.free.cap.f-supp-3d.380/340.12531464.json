Hoover, alleging that Defendants violated the Securities Act of 1933 (the \"Securities Act\" or the \"Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a, et seq., by selling unregistered securities through an initial coin offering of the digital asset ATB Coin. Before me is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because I find both that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over all Defendants, and that the Complaint plausibly alleges violations of \u00a7\u00a7 12(a) and 15(a) of the Securities Act, Defendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED in its entirety. Plaintiff's unopposed motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff and the appointment of Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP as Lead Counsel is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants Edward Ng and Herbert W. Hoover are co-founders and officers of Defendant ATBCOIN LLC (\"ATB\"), a technology start-up company aimed at facilitating rapid, low-cost digital financial transactions through revolutionary blockchain technology. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 15-16.) From June 12, 2017 through September 15, 2017, ATB conducted an initial coin offering, or \"ICO,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   through which ATB offered digital \"ATB Coins\" to the general public in exchange for other digital assets\n   (the \"ATB ICO\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Defendants promoted the ATB Coin as \"an innovative decentralized cryptocurrency incorporating the advanced technologies that tailor the needs of primary market players-users, investors, and business owners.\" (4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 1, at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ATB Coin was \"designed to overcome well-known inefficiencies within government central banks and other crypto currencies [and to] induce[ ] transactions that are fully secure, private and anonymous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The primary purpose of the ATB ICO was to raise capital to enable Defendants to create and launch a new blockchain (the \"ATB Blockchain\") on which the ATB Coins would operate. (Compl. \u00b6 3.) According to Defendants, the ATB Blockchain would be \"the fastest blockchain-based cryptographic network in the Milky Way galaxy,\" capable of delivering \"blazing fast, secure and near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the ICO, Defendants issued a range of promotional materials touting the ATB ICO as an investment opportunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4 (\"Only 3 days left before the launch of ATB Coin! Invest in the cryptocurrency of the future, while the project offers the most favorable terms!\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28 (\"Now every investor has the opportunity to become apart [sic] of the world technological evolution!\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (\"Grab the chance to invest in a very prospective project and change your life by filling it with new financial opportunities!\").) Based on Defendants' statements in these materials, participants in the ICO expected the value of the ATB Coins they purchased to increase as more users adopted the ATB Blockchain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When the ATB ICO launched in June 2017, Defendants offered one ATB Coin for $ 1, payable in the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ether (\"ETH\"), or Litecoin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The terms of the offer varied throughout the ICO period, and by September 2017, the price of one ATB Coin had risen to $ 2.50, again payable in Bitcoin, ETH, or Litecoin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 37.) All participants in the ICO also received a certain number of additional ATB Coins as a bonus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) On August 21, 2017, Plaintiff Raymond Balestra (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Balestra\") participated in the ATB ICO, purchasing 388.5 ATB Coins in exchange for 2.100441 ETH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.) In total, the ATB ICO raised over $ 20 million from thousands of investors. (Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants launched the ATB Blockchain on September 14, 2017 at the close of the ICO; however, the blockchain is not capable of the technological feats Defendants advertised. A review of the ATB ICO commented that it had \"yielded nothing but a cheap reskinned [Bitcoin] wallet which is still in beta\" and noted that the ATB Coin software failed to deliver many of the features Defendants had promised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (commenting that there was \"[n]o indication of development on a public blockchain testnet ... even though it was previously promised on [ATB's] roadmap\").) As a result of the subpar performance of the ATB Blockchain, \"adoption of ATB Coin and the ATB Blockchain has been essentially nonexistent, and the value of ATB Coins has continuously fallen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 42.) As of March 11, 2018, the value of Plaintiff's ATB Coins had decreased by more than 85% from the price at which he purchased them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1; Lead Pl. Br.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants did not file a registration statement for the ATB ICO with the SEC at any point, either before, during, or after the ICO. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9, 55-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Complaint on December 21, 2017, (Doc. 1), alleging two claims against Defendants under the Securities Act: (1) a violation of \u00a7 12(a) for offering and selling unregistered securities in the form of ATB Coins, and (2) a violation of \u00a7 15(a) against Ng and Hoover as \"control persons\" of ATB. On January 9, 2018, counsel for Plaintiff published a notice over\n   <em>\n    Business Wire\n   </em>\n   , a nationally-circulated business-oriented wire service, announcing the initiation of this securities class action (the \"Notice\"). (3/12/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Notice was targeted at and informed all persons who purchased ATB Coins pursuant to the ATB ICO that they would have until March 12, 2018 to file a motion to be appointed lead plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 12, 2018, the date specified in the Notice, Balestra filed his Motion for Appointment as Lead Plaintiff and Approval of Selection of Counsel, (Doc. 22), along with a supporting memorandum and declaration, (Docs. 23-24). No other member of the putative class has filed a motion seeking to be appointed lead plaintiff or opposing Balestra's motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 13, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction over Defendants Ng and Hoover, and pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (Doc. 27.) On that same date, Defendants also submitted a memorandum of law, (Doc. 31), and several supporting declarations, (Docs. 28-30). On April 27, 2018, Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss, (Doc. 33), along with a declaration in support, (Doc. 34). Defendants filed their reply, and an accompanying declaration, on May 4, 2018. (Docs. 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants Ng and Hoover move to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), and all Defendants move to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because I find both that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over Defendants Ng and Hoover, and that the Complaint plausibly alleges violations of \u00a7\u00a7 12(a) and 15(a) of the Securities Act, Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint is denied. Plaintiff's unopposed motion for appointment as Lead Plaintiff and the appointment of Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP as Lead Counsel is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Rule 12(b)(2)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a defendant moves for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Kernan v.

On a motion under Rule 12(b)(2), when the issue of personal jurisdiction \"is decided initially on the pleadings\n   and without discovery, the plaintiff need show only a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\"\n   <em>\n    Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v.

Ex. 14.) A June 29, 2017 press release entitled \"Ongoing ATB Coin ICO Raises over $ 14 million in 2 weeks from over 1000 Investors,\" (4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 8), contains an embedded video featuring both Hoover and Ng participating in what appears to be a second conference to promote the launch of the ATB ICO at the Marriott Marquis hotel in midtown Manhattan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 8 (providing link to\n   <em>\n    ATB Coin - Herbert W. Hoover &amp; Edward Ng at the press conference, Marriott Marquis, New York\n   </em>\n   (June 18, 2017),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://bitcoinprbuzz.com/press-release-atb-coin-ico (last visited Mar. 29, 2019) ).) That same press release includes a quote\n   from Ng boasting that the ATB Coin had \"already attracted excited investors from the United States,\" among other countries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) In addition, Ng and Hoover are the sole members of Defendant ATBCOIN LLC, which conducted the ATB ICO and which lists a New York City address as its principal place of business in its incorporating documents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   4/27/18 Kupka Decl. 13, at 2-3.) Finally, a June 6, 2017 ATB press release in fact claims that \"ATB Coin co-founder Herbert W. Hoover III is a member of America's iconic manufacturing family\" who \"resides in New York and travels worldwide.\" (4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, Hoover's residence in New York (thereby making the United States his place of domicile), Hoover's and Ng's management of a business based in the United States, and their participation in conferences in the United States aimed at promoting the ATB Coin to United States investors clearly demonstrate that both Hoover and Ng \"purposefully avail[ed themselves] of the privilege of conducting [business] activities within\" the United States with respect to the ATB Coin and its corresponding ICO.\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p474\">\n    471 U.S. at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p474\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

I find that Plaintiff's allegations establish that purchasers of ATB Coins reasonably believed that those coins would increase in value based primarily on Defendants' entrepreneurial and managerial efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, Defendants launched a marketing campaign for ATB Coins that highlighted the potential profits that would result simply from holding those coins. In a July 9, 2017 press release, ATB stated: \"ATB investors are serious people from many prosperous countries, they are interested in the development of the company, the growth of the rate, and of course, the profit, which as is known, will soon come to those who are 100% sure of the possibilities of cryptocurrency.\" (Compl. \u00b6 38 (quoting 4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 7, at 1).) That same press release described the ATB ICO as \"the realization of a crowdfunding model, where participants finance the development of the company now in order to get revenue from it in the future.\" (4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 7, at 1.) Similarly, the Frequently Asked Questions section of ATB's website states: \"the first users of ATB Coin cryptocurrency can be compared to investors in a start-up, which can later acquire value, due to its usefulness and popularity. Thus, the acquisition of the first ATB Coin becomes a kind of investment with a long-term perspective.\" (Compl. \u00b6 39 (quoting 4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 11).) All of these advertisements \"promoted\" ATB Coins \"as an investment\" that would generate profits for investors without any effort on their part.\n   <em>\n    Leonard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626274\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/83/#p88\">\n    529 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   88 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zaslavskiy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204346339\">\n    2018 WL 4346339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (finding third prong of\n   <em>\n    Howey\n   </em>\n   test satisfied where ICO token at issue \"was described to investors as 'an attractive investment opportunity' which 'grows in value,' and as having 'some of the highest potential returns' \" (internal citations omitted) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Defendants are correct that \"[t]he mere presence of a speculative motive on the part of purchaser or seller does not evidence the existence of an investment contract,\" (Defs.'
