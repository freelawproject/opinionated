(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 3-6). Defendants Robert Smeltz (\"Commissioner Smeltz\") and Jeffrey Snyder (\"Commissioner Snyder\") served as chairman and vice-chairman of the Board of Commissioners, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). Defendant Joel Long (\"Commissioner Long\") served as the third member of the Board of Commissioners at all times relevant to this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Clinton County Prison Board (the \"Prison Board\") oversees the Clinton County Correctional Facility (the \"Facility\"), (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 4-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Doc. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 4-8), and recommends Facility personnel decisions (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , hiring, termination) to the Board of Commissioners for approval, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-6, Snyder Dep. 28:4-29:7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In January\n   2012, a new Prison Board took office, consisting of Commissioners Smeltz, Snyder, and Long, as well as the County's district attorney; a state court judge; the County treasurer; and the County sheriff. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 13). Commissioner Snyder served as Prison Board chairman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Duran served as warden of the Facility from 1993 to 1997, and again from 2000 through his termination in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 9). Duran worked for the County without a written employment contract until 2007. (Doc. 61-2, Duran Dep. 55:19-22, Aug. 16, 2016 (\"Duran Dep. I\") ). Duran testified that he was considering other positions at that time and was concerned about the ramifications on his job security if the County decided to \"go to Home Rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:22-54:13). To ensure Duran's continued services as warden, the then-Board of Commissioners awarded him a five-year employment contract to commence on November 5, 2007. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Doc. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; Duran Dep. I 54:13-18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-3). The County and the Prison Board could terminate the contract \"only upon a finding of dishonesty or gross malfeasance by [Duran].\" (Doc. 61-3 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duran's Medical Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Duran experienced a variety of significant health issues throughout his tenure as warden, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"arthritis and contracting MRSA.\" (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 12). Duran required eight surgeries between September 2008 and September 2011 and time away from work to recover. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 55 \u00b6\u00b6 35(c)-(j); Doc. 57 \u00b6 35). Duran testified that he frequently worked a full day at the Facility and then brought work home in the evenings. (Duran Dep. I 42:18-44:13; Doc. 65-2 at 1). In 2009 or 2010, Duran began utilizing a Comcast business account and work laptop at home to access the Facility's cameras, phone systems, and inmate accounts. (Duran Dep. I 40:20-42:2). When he missed work due to medical issues, Duran would \"ma[ke] up a lot of it working at home\" and used the laptop to monitor the Facility from his hospital bed and his home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:14-22, 47:23-48:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early January or February 2012, Commissioner Snyder allegedly learned that Duran was \"spending an hour or less a day at the facility.\" (Snyder Dep. 20:21-25). Commissioner Snyder and another Prison Board member met with Duran and informed him that County policy supposedly required the warden to \"be present at the facility eight hours a day and on-call 24/7, unless the warden notifies someone as to why he or she is not there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:25-21:9;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63-21 at 7). Commissioner Snyder stated that he wanted Duran on site eight hours a day. (Snyder Dep. 21:10-12; Doc. 61-9, Duran Dep. 34:18-20, Apr. 10, 2018 (\"Duran Dep. II\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63-22, Bechdel Dep. 16:9-15). Duran claims that he replied to Commissioner Snyder by noting that he just had both knees replaced a few months prior and was \"still healing\" but that Commissioner Snyder maintained that he wanted Duran present eight hours per day. (Duran Dep. II 34:22-35:5). Commissioner Snyder denied that Duran \"made ... reference to any medical issues.\" (Snyder Dep. 21:13-16). When asked what informed Duran's belief that the commissioners harbored disdain for his health-related accommodations, Duran testified that it was \"more speculation than having ... any evidence to say that.\" (Duran Dep. II 28:18-29:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Medical Provider Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Clinton Medical Associates (\"Clinton Medical\") is the contracted medical provider for the Facility. (Duran Dep. I 25:4-9). Clinton Medical physician Michael Greenberg (\"Dr. Greenberg\") treated patient inmates at the Facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:13-23). In January 2012, Commissioner Snyder discovered that Clinton Medical was purportedly billing the County \"for items which were not within [ ] the scope of the contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 5; Snyder Dep. 56:19-57:15). Dr. Greenberg allegedly \"admitted that he actually was over-billing\" when confronted at a Prison Board meeting. (Snyder Dep. 79:12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Commissioner Snyder tasked Duran to review past invoices and ascertain whether and how much Clinton Medical had overbilled. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 5; Duran Dep. I 25:24-26:10; Doc. 63-35 at 3). Between January and September 2012, the Prison Board repeatedly asked Duran about the status of this assignment. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 6; Doc. 63-35 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Snyder Dep. 56:19-57:15). In September 2012, Duran provided a memo to the Prison Board indicating that medical staff members' failure to sign in and out of the Facility explained a portion of the alleged overbilling. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63-12 at 2; Snyder Dep. 80:20-82:4). Duran testified that he was fired before he could complete a full review. (Duran Dep. I 26:11-16, 67:3-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Prison Board also learned that Dr. Greenberg was performing surgery on inmates at an offsite location in violation of the contract with Clinton Medical. (Snyder Dep. 57:17-22; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Doc. 63-3 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Duran Dep. I 26:17-27:7). Duran was aware of this practice and testified that \"at the time it was cheaper in the long run to send them there\" than to a hospital. (Duran Dep. I 69:1-71:7). At a May 2012 Prison Board meeting, Commissioner Snyder directed Duran to bring an end to this practice. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 7; Duran Dep. I 27:10-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Snyder Dep. 56:19-57:22). The parties disagree as to whether Duran did so. Duran claims that he instructed Dr. Greenberg to stop treating inmates offsite. (Duran Dep. I 27:10-24, 69:24-70:6). Commissioner Snyder represents that Duran did not, resulting in an investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (the \"Department\"). (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Snyder Dep. 77:21-78:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Commissary Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Facility maintained a commissary through which inmates could use personal funds to purchase items such as snacks or toiletries. (Duran Dep. I 21:16-22:8). When an inmate made a purchase, Facility staff deducted the price of the item from the inmate's account and then placed an order with Oasis Commissary (\"Oasis\") for the item. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:8-22). Oasis then filled the order and delivered the item to the Facility for the inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:22-25). Facility policy mandated that any profits generated by the commissary were to be used to purchase goods that benefitted the entire inmate population, as recommended and approved by the warden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:12-20:1; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Commissioner Snyder received a letter from the County's auditors' office dated April 2, 2012, detailing items on the Facility's commissary account that were \"questionable.\" (Doc. 61-4). The auditors' office identified the following charges as suspect: monthly Comcast internet service bills for a private residence, hotel-related expenses, receipts for iPad and iPod accessories, screen printing bills from an embroidery shop, and numerous meal expenses lacking receipt documentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). The letter indicated that one of the hotel bills was in Duran's wife's name. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-4). Commissioner Snyder alleges that Duran used the commissary account\n   to pay for these various expenses to benefit himself and other Facility staff. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 16). Duran testified that these expenses were related to business trips or to facilitate working from home. (Duran Dep. I 58:14-64:8). He explained that his wife accompanied him on a business trip and that the Prison Board never inquired with him about these charges prior to his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:6-13, 64:9-13; 84:20-85:10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Duran had also signed a new contract with Oasis to provide commissary services. (Duran Dep. I 21:2-7; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 15). Oasis provided gym equipment for use by Facility staff in conjunction with that contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-11). Commissioner Snyder questioned Duran at the July 2012 Prison Board meeting about the contract and gym equipment. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 15). The record is unclear as to whether Facility funds were used to purchase the gym equipment for staff use or whether Oasis provided the equipment to Duran and his staff as a complimentary \"incentive\" for awarding Oasis the contract. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Duran Dep. I 21:2-10; Snyder Dep. 59:3-22, 84:16-25). Duran testified that other potential commissary vendors offered similar incentives but that he chose Oasis because the Facility \"had been with Oasis for years and [he was] satisfied with their service.\" (Duran Dep. I 21:11-15). The Prison Board subsequently voted to require all contracts to be submitted to and approved by the Prison Board and the County solicitor prior to signing. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Facility Financial Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Throughout 2012, the new Prison Board, led by Commissioner Snyder, was focused on reducing the Facility's operating costs and expenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Duran Dep. I 17:18-18:10, 74:4-75:5, 75:19-76:18; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 13). The Facility housed inmates for the Department as well as other counties and charged a\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   fee. (Duran Dep. I 33:18-34:5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Snyder Dep. 82:12-21). The Facility received a\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate of $ 47 under the contract with the Department in 2012. (Duran Dep. I 34:24-35:8; Snyder Dep. 82:19-83:1). Neighboring counties received\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rates ranging from $ 50 to $ 65 under their respective contracts. (Duran Dep. I 35:9-19; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Duran was responsible for renegotiating the Department contract by May 1, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 65-1 \u00b6 9; Duran Dep. I 34:6-17). Commissioner Snyder avers that Duran failed to enter negotiations with the Department before the deadline. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 9). The\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate therefore remained at $ 47 for the balance of 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Using a neighboring county's\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate of $ 65, Commissioner Snyder projected that Duran's failure to renegotiate the contract resulted in a loss to the Facility of at least $ 1,800 per day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). Commissioner Snyder testified that the County subsequently renegotiated with the Department for a higher\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate. (Snyder Dep. 83:10-14). The Department later removed prisoners under its jurisdiction from the Facility, but Commissioner Snyder denies that this decision was a result of the higher\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83:15-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The cost to run the Facility increased by approximately $ 400,000 each year from 2010 to 2012, with expenses reaching $ 1.9 million in 2012. (Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 12). Commissioner Snyder represents that he asked Duran for cost-saving suggestions at Prison Board budget meetings and \"received no response.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Duran did not recall these alleged requests but noted that he did eliminate the laundry supervisor position. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Duran Dep. I 74:4-14, 94:1-4). Defendants maintain that, at the September 2012 Prison Board meeting, Duran submitted a proposed Facility budget for 2013 projecting $ 3.2 million in\n   expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 24 (citing Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 12); Doc. 63-35 at 3). Defendants have not produced a copy of this alleged budget. For his part, Duran has adduced a 2013 budget proposal dated October 6, 2012, which projected total 2013 revenues at approximately $ 3.28 million and total 2013 expenses at approximately $ 2.07 million. (Doc. 63-5 at 1, 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-8, Long Dep. 29:17-20, 30:15-31:10). The Prison Board's October 10, 2012 meeting minutes do not reflect discussion of the proposal dated October 6, 2012. (Doc. 63-16 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Request for Medical Leave and Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On October 5, 2012, Duran sent a memo by interoffice mail to the Prison Board notifying its members of his shoulder surgery scheduled for October 29, 2012 and his desire to take corresponding medical leave. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 32; Duran Dep. I 52:5-11). Duran projected that he would be able to return to work \"on a limited basis\" the following week and full time by November 5, 2012. (Doc. 63-36 at 2). Duran testified that Commissioner Snyder never made any comments or expressed any displeasure at Duran request to take medical leave. (Duran Dep. I 88:18-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Prison Board required Duran to attend a public Prison Board meeting on October 24, 2012. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 33). During the meeting, Commissioner Long moved to suspend Duran with pay for the remainder of his employment contract and then terminate him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30; Doc. 63 \u00b6 30; Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 21). The Prison Board voted 5-1 to suspend and then terminate Duran (the district attorney was absent from the vote). (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 31). Duran was 55 years' old at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants maintain that Duran was fired for various performance issues related to the management and finances of the Facility. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 21; Snyder Dep. 100:24-101:3; Long Dep. 25:11-26:13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 63-15, Conway Dep. 37:11-17). Commissioner Snyder testified that Duran was not fired in April 2012 for the \"questionable\" charges to the Facility's commissary account because the Prison Board wanted to give Duran an opportunity to improve his performance. (Snyder Dep. 98:11-21). Commissioners Snyder and Long stated that they decided to terminate Duran following an exchange with him during the September 2012 Prison Board meeting. (Snyder Dep. 101:11-22; Long Dep. 28:24-29:16). They claim that, in response to a question about how to decrease the $ 3.2 million in projected expenditures, Duran \"shrugged [his] shoulders and said it's up to you guys.\" (Snyder Dep. 101:11-17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Long Dep. 28:24-29:6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Susan Conway (\"Conway\") served as the assistant chief clerk, payroll clerk, and benefits administrator for the County during the relevant time. (Conway Dep. 15:12-17). She maintained employee personnel files in her office which included performance evaluations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:21-35:2). According to Conway, Duran's file containing numerous \"commendations\" and no negative performance evaluations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:3-25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Duran Dep. I 82:14-83:12). Conway testified that she knew of Duran's impending suspension before the October 24, 2012 Prison Board meeting. (Conway Dep. 36:11-37:20). She also recalled overhearing the commissioners discussing Duran's medical leave request in the weeks prior to that meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:21-25, 38:16-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Post-Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Deputy warden Jackie Motter (\"Motter\") became the Facility's acting warden after Duran's termination. (Doc. 61-1 \u00b6 43; Doc. 61-10, Motter Dep. 14:12-14). At a November 28, 2012 Prison Board meeting, Motter reported that the daily cost to house an inmate at the Facility was $ 54.79, which she calculated to be a $ 7.79 loss per day based on the $ 45\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   rate originally negotiated by Duran. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 61-5 \u00b6 11). This cost difference resulted in a total loss to the Facility of approximately $ 254,800 per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 2, 2012, the County began advertising the warden position online. (Doc. 63-41 at 2).

Following Rule 12 motion practice, a period of discovery, and several amended pleadings, this matter is now proceeding on Duran's third amended complaint. Duran advances claims against the County for retaliation in violation of the FMLA (Count I), discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ADA (Counts III, IV), and discrimination in violation of the ADEA (Counts V, VI). He asserts a common-law claim for tortious interference with contractual relationships against Commissioners Smeltz, Snyder, and Long (Count II). The County brings common-law counterclaims against Duran for conversion and set-off or recoupment of overpayment. Defendants' instant motion for summary judgment pertains to only Duran's claims. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Through summary adjudication, the court may dispose of those claims that do not present a \"genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and for which a jury trial would be an empty and unnecessary formality.
