KORNMANN, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs in these two cases filed complaints seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing the State of South Dakota from enforcing Initiated Measure 24\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"IM 24\"), which was enacted by the South Dakota voters in the 2018 general election. IM 24 bans out-of-state contributions to South Dakota ballot question committees. Plaintiffs assert that IM 24 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The trial on the merits was advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction as authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Any judge must view with great deference any legislative enactment, especially when enacted by a majority of the voters of South Dakota, which is the case here. I do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The South Dakota Constitution expressly reserves to the electorate the rights to initiative and referendum. S.D. Const. art. III, \u00a7 1. Initiated or referred laws are placed on the ballot only after the sponsor complies with the provisions of SDCL Chapter 2-1. Once a proposed measure complies with all laws required for placement on the ballot, the South Dakota Secretary of State oversees the collection of pro and con statements as well as the Attorney General's statement that will accompany the proposed measure on the ballot, in compliance with SDCL Chapter. 12-13. The Secretary of State also oversees compliance with campaign finance laws, SDCL Chapter 12-27, applicable to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , ballot question committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2016, South Dakota voters passed Constitutional Amendment S, a crime victim's rights measure which was dubbed in the media as \"Marsy's Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ,\" despite an extensive media campaign by opponents who complained it was entirely funded by an out-of-state interest. Marsy's Law was not the only measure on the 2016 ballot that was supported by out-of-state interests. According to then-Governor Dennis Daugaard in his published pro statement in support of IM 24, six of the seven initiated measures on the 2016 general election ballot were urged by out-of-state interests who donated 97% of the $ 9.6 million spent on such initiatives.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   That year, out-of-state interests used South Dakota's low signature requirements and cheap media markets as a testing ground for their ideas. They\n   have turned our state founders' intent completely on its head. Let's send their political business model somewhere else. Support initiated measure 24 to ban out-of-state financial contributions to ballot committees. Let's protect a SOUTH DAKOTAN's right to petition the people, but deny that privilege to New York, Massachusetts and California business interests. They don't have kids in our schools, they don't attend our churches, and you won't see them at the football game this weekend. That's because they don't live here. Let's limit their involvement unless they can demonstrate either residency or a legitimate business interest in South Dakota.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/assets/2018BQPamphlet.pdf (visited May 7, 2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   IM 24, which will be codified as part of South Dakota's campaign finance laws at SDCL 12-27-18.2 effective July 1, 2019, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any contribution to a statewide ballot question committee by a person who is not a resident of the state at the time of the contribution, a political committee that is organized outside South Dakota, or an entity that is not filed as an entity with the secretary of state for the four years preceding such contribution is prohibited. If a statewide ballot question committee accepts a contribution prohibited by this section, the secretary of state shall impose a civil penalty equal to two hundred percent of the prohibited contribution after notice and opportunity to be heard pursuant to chapter 1-26. Any civil penalty collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the state general fund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The prohibition on receipt of out-of-state contributions applies only to ballot question committees. No restriction on out-of-state contributions applies to candidates or candidate committees, political action committees, or political parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A person who is not a resident of South Dakota cannot donate to a statewide ballot question committee but no state law prevents an individual from making an independent communication expenditure, as defined by SDCL 12-27-1(11), to support or oppose a ballot initiative. An entity, defined by SDCL 12-27-1(15), that is not \"filed\" with the Secretary of State may not contribute to a ballot question committee but nothing prevents a foreign corporation organized under the laws of another state but registered with the Secretary of State to do business in South Dakota from contributing (as long as they have been so registered at least 4 years). Further, an \"entity\" organized in South Dakota can freely contribute to a ballot question committee without regard to the source of the funds contributed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The term \"statewide ballot question committee\" is not defined by IM 24 nor by South Dakota's campaign finance laws, SDCL Title 12-27, where IM 24 is to be codified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although ballot question committees must register with the Secretary of State, SDCL 12-27-3, and comply with state campaign finance rules, individuals, whether they are residents or non-residents, have no obligation to register their independent spending in support of or in opposition to a ballot measure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. First Amendment Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that IM 24 violates their First Amendment right to engage in debate on public issues through contributions to fund advocacy efforts. Plaintiffs South Dakota Newspaper Association, et al. also contend that IM 24 prohibits their\n   associational rights protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The major purpose of the First Amendment \"was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

IM 24 seeks to target only out-of-state contributors who want to make contributions to fund speech about ballot issues. IM 24 does not prevent any non-resident person, corporation, or Political Action Committee from contributing to the campaign for a candidate. Most state laws are enacted by state legislators (as opposed to by initiative). Since political candidates who are elected are the usual lawmakers, state law can still be manipulated by non-residents who contribute to the election of candidates who possess similar ideology or who have made campaign promises to support certain laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IM 24 does not prevent a non-resident from contributing to a South Dakota PAC (which may then contribute to a ballot question committee) or from contributing to some other South Dakota entity that makes contributions to ballot question committees. Interestingly, the major donor to the ballot question committee that supported Marsy's law was a South Dakota corporation (apparently funded by a California resident).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   IM 24 is not designed to eliminate the \"evil\" of interference in self-governance.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Where a regulation restricts a medium of speech in the name of a particular interest but leaves unfettered other modes of expression that implicate the same interest, the regulation's underinclusiveness may diminish the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting speech in the first place.

However, there is no prohibition on the residency of donors to other political committees that are organized in South Dakota. Thus, a South Dakota PAC could receive substantial sums from out-of-state donors and legally contribute those funds to a ballot committee. IM 24 does nothing to prohibit out-of-state\n   individuals or corporations from making independent expenditures to purchase political ads from media outlets or disseminating political materials through the mail on their own behalf. Phillip Morris could purchase political ads urging South Dakotans to oppose an initiated measure banning smoking and neither IM 24 or any other South Dakota campaign finance law would prevent the expenditure. IM 24 would not have prevented the so-called evil it sought to target - independent spending by an out-of-state individual to support a South Dakota ballot issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   IM 24 allows contributions to ballot question committees from \"an entity\" that is \"filed as an entity with the secretary of state for the four years preceding\" the contribution. \"Entity\" is defined by SDCL 12-27-1(15) as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   any organized or unorganized association, business corporation, limited liability company, nonprofit corporation, limited liability partnership, limited liability limited partnership, limited partnership, partnership, cooperative, trust except for a trust account representing or containing only a contributor's personal funds, a business trust, association, club, labor union, or collective bargaining organization; any local, state, or national organization to which a labor organization pays membership or per capita fees, based upon its affiliation and membership; any trade or professional association that receives its funds from membership dues or service fees, whether organized inside or outside the state; any other entity of any kind, except a natural person that is, has been, or could be recognized by law; or any group of persons acting in concert that is not defined as a political committee in this chapter except, an entity is not a candidate, a public office holder, or a political committee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There are of course thousands of such entities registered with the South Dakota Secretary of State who have been registered for over four years. Any of those entities could receive funds from out-of-state sources and donate to a ballot question committee. Thus, that exception does nothing to further the State's interest in preventing out-of-state money from influencing South Dakota ballot questions. What that exception does is prevent any entity newly formed from making contributions and participating in political speech. IM 24's ban is underinclusive, which diminishes the credibility of the State's rationale for restricting speech in the first place. In addition, as pointed out by the Chamber Committee, IM 24 discriminates against new business coming into South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   IM 24 bans political speech by certain speakers through its ban on certain contributions to ballot question committees. The ban violates the First Amendment because it is not narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. IM 24 is not even closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The right of initiative is very important in states like South Dakota where the dominant political party controls, and has for 26 years, the office of the governor, the state House and the State Senate. This so-called \"trifecta\" makes it more difficult for the opposition party to pursue its agenda in the state legislature. https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_South_Dakota_state_government (visited May 7, 2019). The evidence presented in this case demonstrates how important out-of-state contributions are for the ballot question committees to pursue political speech.

IM 24 is vague in that the measure bans contributions to \"statewide ballot question committees\" but that term is not defined by IM 24 nor is it defined elsewhere in South Dakota's campaign finance laws. Does the contribution ban apply only if a particular ballot question committee operates in all counties, a given number of counties, or only certain enumerated counties?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IM 24 bans \"any\" contribution to a statewide ballot question committee by a non-resident. Contribution is defined to include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , any gift or other valuable consideration, and the use of services or property without full payment. SDCL 12-27-1(6). The term \"contribution\" as used in SDCL Chapter 12-27 does not include volunteer services or the free use of a person's residence. SDCL 12-27-1(6). IM 24 does not just apply to a contribution, it applies to \"any\" out of state contribution. It is not clear whether the exception for volunteer services in 12-27-1(6) applies to non-resident volunteers. That issue was raised by the Court at the hearing in this matter. The defendants, through their representative from the Secretary of State's Office and through counsel, stated that IM 24 would ban contributions from non-resident volunteers coming here and incurring expenses in connection with a ballot issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IM 24 would ostensibly prohibit plaintiff Barnett, a former South Dakota resident who still maintains a law license in this state, and other non-residents from traveling to South Dakota to campaign, thus donating travel, lodging, and other expenses in support of a ballot question committee. Any ballot question committee who \"accepts\" such a contribution is subject to heavy civil and criminal penalties. This ban on volunteer contributions is especially egregious when the ballot question committee is not affiliated with or able to supervise such out-of-state volunteers. Volunteers could well subject any ballot issue committee to heavy civil and criminal penalties. Ballot issue committees could well be required to attempt to prevent non-resident volunteers from traveling to South Dakota or at least disclaiming the acceptance of such volunteers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I find that IM 24 is an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

It further prohibits in-state ballot committees from soliciting and receiving contributions from non-residents. One question is whether campaign contributions constitute commerce. They do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It is without question that the term \"affecting interstate commerce,\" when used in the context of federal criminal law, encompasses financial transactions involving banks and other financial institutions.

IM 24 interferes with concrete and particularized First Amendment rights to engage in political speech and to associate with others to do so and their concern that the law will prevent them from engaging in protected conduct is actual and imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The remaining plaintiffs also have standing to bring their First Amendment claims because they are all prohibited by IM 24 from accepting contributions to ballot issue committees from non-residents to fund their political speech. Such funding has historically been a major portion of the funds available to ballot committees to fund their speech. The Supreme Court has also recognized that where plaintiffs challenge a statute that allegedly chills free speech, litigants \"are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of State of Md. v.
