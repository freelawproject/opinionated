JUNG, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case concerns alleged First Amendment retaliation through administrative code inspections and the constitutionality of a revised city ordinance authorizing such inspections. The matter comes to the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment from Plaintiffs, Dkt. 71, Defendant Town of North Redington Beach (the \"Town\"), Dkt. 73, and Defendant Sheriff Bob Gualtieri in his official capacity as Pinellas County Sheriff (the \"Sheriff\"), Dkt. 81. The parties have filed responses to the opposing motions. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Sheriff's motion, and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   in part the Town's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Incorporated in 1953, the Town is a beachside community, one square mile in size, with approximately 1,427 full-time residents. Dkt. 82-6 at 48. A five-member Commission, including Mayor Queen, governs the Town.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. The Town has four employees: Town Clerk Campbell, Deputy Clerk Schmader, Public Works Projects employee Lewis, and a groundskeeper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. Since 2013, the law firm Trask Daigneault has been \"the retained Town Attorney,\" and Jay Daigneault of the firm has been appointed as the Town Attorney. Dkt. 82-8 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Sweet Sage Caf\u00e9, LLC (\"Sweet Sage\") operates a restaurant named Sweet Sage Caf\u00e9 (the \"Caf\u00e9\") in the Town. Dkt. 56 at \u00b6 3. Plaintiff Messmore owns and manages the Caf\u00e9 with his wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Caf\u00e9, which closes at 2:00 p.m., offers breakfast and lunch in a \"casual Florida beach-themed setting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It also features a gift shop. Dkt. 82-4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Caf\u00e9 displayed various signs outside, including some for which Sweet Sage was issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) of a sign ordinance. Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Sweet Sage Cafe, LLC v. Town of N. Redington Beach, Florida\n   </em>\n   , 8:15-CV-2576-T-30JSS (M.D. Fla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nov. 2, 2015), ECF: 1 at 3, 9. In November 2015, Sweet Sage sought a declaration that the Town's sign ordinance, adopted in June 2015, violated the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. On January 27, 2017, the district court entered summary judgment, agreeing that the ordinance was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Sweet Sage Caf\u00e9 v. Town of North Redington Beach, Florida , LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20385756\">\n    2017 WL 385756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sweet Sage has contested other Town ordinances as well. To confront its shortage of public parking, the Town has an off-street parking ordinance, Ordinance 2009-685, that requires at least one parking space for every four seats in an establishment. Dkt. 73-8 at 2-3. Before 2009, one space was required for every three seats.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20385756\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 82-6 at 66. The new ordinance grandfathered the number of nonconforming seats as of September 10, 2009 but did not allow additional seats without additional on-site parking. Dkt. 73-8 at 3. To determine the grandfathered numbers, the Town's former code enforcement officer, Mr. Lewis, counted seats at the existing bars, lounges, and restaurants. Dkt. 82-6 at 67. The Town Clerk created a typed chart from the handwritten results, which was then included as an attachment to the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20, 68. Mr. Lewis, along with Mr. Messmore, counted 61 seats at the Caf\u00e9. Dkt. 82-1 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2016, the Town contracted with the Sheriff to enforce code violations, including the parking ordinance. Dkt. 56-1. Deputy Clerk Schmader serves as the secretary for code enforcement, which includes typing up forms for the officer and taking and forwarding complaints. Dkt. 84-1 at 12. Beginning in July 2016, Deputy Joshua Short was the Town's code enforcement officer. Dkt. 82-3 at 2. In March or April 2017, Corporal Chris Kohmann assumed code enforcement duties for the Town. Dkt. 82-2 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The code enforcement officer exercises some discretion in enforcing code violations. For example, only the officer is authorized to determine that a code violation has occurred and to issue a NOV. Dkt. 84-1 at 3, 25. The officer also determines the method by which notice is served, the length of time for compliance before the case is set for an enforcement hearing before the Special Magistrate, and whether compliance is met upon re-inspection. Dkt. 84-1 at 6. Deputy Short and Corporal Kohmann have visited the Caf\u00e9 a number of times to assess compliance with the parking ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To apply for an annual business tax receipt (basically a business permit) from the Town, a restaurant, bar, or lounge must list its number of seats on the application. Dkt. 56-4 at 3. There is also an annual inspection. Dkt. 84-1 at 12. For seat counts at grandfathered establishments, Deputy Clerk Schmader gives the code enforcement officer a copy of the parking ordinance and \"a copy of their business tax receipts to go to every restaurant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Until the most recent application, since 2010 Mr. Messmore had attested on his business tax receipt applications that the Caf\u00e9 has 61 seats, Dkt. 74-4 at 2-12, and had been issued an occupational license for the same, Dkt. 75-1 at 9-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A Special Magistrate hearing followed an April 19, 2018 NOV issued to the Caf\u00e9 for noncompliance with the parking ordinance. Dkt. 75-2. On May 29, 2018, the Magistrate found that the Town failed to prove that the Caf\u00e9 had exceeded its designated 61 seats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The order \"noted that nothing in the Town ... Code ... specifies a formula for calculating the number of seats based on the length of a bench seat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. In response, the Town adopted Ordinance 2018-801, which did not alter the grandfathered seating allotments. Dkt. 75-3; Dkt. 82-6 at 30-31;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dkt. 82-8 at 12-13. As represented by counsel at oral argument, litigation concerning the Town's parking ordinance is ongoing in the Florida state courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2016 Mr. Messmore, through Plaintiff Shermee, LLC, purchased a vacant lot approximately 150 feet north of the Caf\u00e9. Dkt. 82-5 at 14. He hoped to use the property as off-site parking for Caf\u00e9 customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 82-4 at 5. \"[H]e said that after 2:00 when [the Caf\u00e9] closed, then anybody could use it to park there to go to the beach. It was definitely for Sweet Sage up until 2:00 when they closed.\" Dkt. 82-6 at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Town's zoning code, however, did not allow parking as a primary use of property at the location. Dkt. 83-1 at 2. Mr. Messmore sought to rezone the lot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Town directed Mr. Messmore to section 98-3 of the Town Code, noting \"You may want to check with your attorney for procedural steps.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At a November 10, 2016 Commission meeting, Mr. Messmore presented materials in support of the rezoning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. According to a memorandum by the Town Attorney, no action was required based on the presentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. The Mayor scheduled a workshop for January 5, 2017 to discuss the proposal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the workshop, the Commission conditioned the rezoning of the property on Mr. Messmore not adding \"statuary, trellis[es], art or anything that draws attention to the parking area\" to the lot. Dkt. 83-1 at 41. Mr. Messmore returned to the Commission on January 12, 2017 with paperwork including a draft of a rewritten ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42; Dkt. 82-6 at 59. The Mayor initially scheduled another workshop for February 7, 2017 that was later canceled. Dkt. 82-6 at 28. \"[A]s the Commissioners came in and said, what's the workshop about and [Town Clerk Campbell] told them, they were like, why are we doing this, he's already said he doesn't agree to [the conditions] and he's already showed us at the last meeting he doesn't agree to it. So, they didn't want to do [another workshop].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Messmore abandoned the parking lot proposal and sought to build a new business on the lot called the Sugar Shack. Dkt. 82-6 at 62-63. This required two variances and the approval of a site plan, which was eventually completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64. The Commission approved the site plan with conditions, and Mr. Messmore has begun construction. Dkt. 82-5 at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 3, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their original complaint for First Amendment retaliation against the Town and unreasonable search and seizure against the Town and Sheriff. Dkt. 1 at 7-8. The next day Plaintiffs sent a letter to the Town advising it that officers could no longer enter the Caf\u00e9 to conduct code enforcement inspections without a lawfully issued warrant. Dkt. 75-4 at 18. On May 10, 2018, the Town Attorney responded with a letter stating the Town's Business Tax Code permitted the officers to enter without a warrant. Dkt. 56-2. In response, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to challenge the constitutionality of the warrantless search provisions of the Business Tax Code. Dkt. 23 at 12. Plaintiffs also added a state law trespass claim against the Town and the Sheriff. Dkt. 23 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 11, 2018, the Town adopted Ordinance 2018-804 which amended the Town's Business Tax Code. Dkt. 75-4 at 2-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the Town, the amendment's purpose was to address the warrantless inspection provisions subjected to constitutional challenge. Dkt. 82-8 at 32. The amendment authorizes, among others things, warrantless administrative inspections of businesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [e]ngaged in a closely-regulated industry and where the inspector has a reasonable good faith belief, based upon a record of non-compliance or other verifiable evidence of probable non-compliance to include citizen complaints, that providing advance notice of the inspection may allow the business to conceal the code violation which is the subject of the inspection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Code of the Town of North Redington Beach, Florida, \u00a7 66-45(c)(3). The Code defines the term \"closely regulated industry\" as: \"[a] firearms retailer...; [a] business which is licensed and regulated by the Florida Beverage Law as defined in Florida Statutes \u00a7 561.01(6) ; and [a] public food service establishment licensed under Florida Statutes Chapter 509.\" \u00a7 66-45(g). The record is clear there is no firearms dealer in the Town and the Town does not actually regulate gun dealers or the Florida Beverage Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Town also modified its business tax receipt application (effectively a business permit) to require businesses to consent to warrantless inspections as a condition of the \"privilege of conducting business within the Town.\" Dkt. 84-1 at 19. The Town Attorney's office provided the revised application's language, which is a mandatory component of the business tax receipt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20; Dkt. 82-6 at 32-34; Dkt. 82-8 at 34:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   By signing the below, the business owner/manage[r] acknowledges that all of the information on this Business Tax Receipt Application is true, and that as a condition of the privilege of conducting business within the Town, consent[s] to the Town's Code Enforcement Officer to periodically conduct inspections of the business premises during business hours to confirm the information provided in this Application is true, and to verify that the business is complying with Town code provisions governing the business's condition, conduct and operations, is hereby given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dkt. 84-1 at 18-19. Sweet Sage's most recent application did not include the seat number as required and was therefore rejected. Dkt. 56-4 at 3. Mr. Messmore has not refiled because he does not approve of the above consenting language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On November 13, 2018, Plaintiffs once more amended their complaint to lastly challenge the constitutionality of the Town's Business Tax Code as amended by Ordinance 2018-804, both facially and as applied. Dkt. 56. After exhaustive discovery, Plaintiffs filed summary judgment on only the constitutionality of the Business Tax Code and business tax receipt application. The Town and the Sheriff move for summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Prospective relief against the Town and Sheriff for any Fourth Amendment or state law trespass violations is unwarranted.

Part of the Court's analysis is informed by the unique circumstances of the case: the Town has but four employees, a Commission of five members including the Mayor, and a Town Attorney who is very involved in the Town's affairs and provided for in the Town's Code. According to the Town Attorney, by charter his position makes him a city officer. Dkt. 90-4 at 7. Section 2-61 of the Town's Code further provides that the Town Attorney \"shall either be counsel to the [code] enforcement board or shall represent the Town by presenting cases before the board ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is record evidence that the Town Attorney represented, spoke on behalf of, and made discretionary decisions for the Town. In fact, the Town Attorney was designated and deposed as the corporate representative of the Town for a 30(b)(6) deposition under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure related to this matter. Dkt. 82-8 at 2. There is, moreover, evidence that the Town Attorney was aware of the timing of some of the code enforcement against the Caf\u00e9, which coincided with his deposition, and that his firm \"handled\" code enforcement matters. He and his firm also had the authority to draft ordinances, which were later passed by the Commission, to allegedly target Mr. Messmore. The Commission, in turn, had the authority to pass ordinances as well as cancel workshops on zoning matters.

City of Wilton Manors\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-61653-CIV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%208433166\">\n    2006 WL 8433166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2006), which requires the absence of \"meaningful administrative review\" of a final policyholder, is misplaced. The gravamen of the claim there was the searches themselves, not as they related to a First Amendment retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Rather, the more nuanced municipal action alleged here is the decision to inspect for code violations in an unconstitutional manner, not necessarily enforcement. Indeed, if coupled with a retaliatory animus and causation, this behavior would be all that is necessary to make out a First Amendment claim; it would not matter if a Special Master did not ultimately find a violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Furthermore, there is no record evidence that there was meaningful administrative review of the Town Attorney's alleged decision to retaliate through code inspections. Though the contract for services provided that the Sheriff would be tasked with most aspects of code enforcement, the Sheriff nonetheless agreed to confer with the Mayor and the Town Commission regarding code enforcement problems within the Town. Under the contract, the Sheriff \"shall accept from the Town Commission general policy direction on how law enforcement and code enforcement services are delivered and to what portion of the municipality a particular type or level of service should be delivered to counteract law and codes enforcement problems within the TOWN.\" Dkt. 56-1 at 6-7. Arguably the Deputies could have raised the issue of any selective enforcement with the Sheriff for a second opinion, but this hardly constitutes \"administrative review.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It moreover defies common sense to argue the Town Attorney possessed no authority\n   in code enforcement matters when there is record evidence he was involved in the matter. Indeed, emails were sent to and from the Town Attorney and Tom Trask, another lawyer at the law firm retained by the Town, and the Town employees about enforcing code violations at the Caf\u00e9. Dkt. 61-2 at 85-87, 91-93, 103-104. Town Attorney Daigneault further testified he was aware of code enforcement action against Sweet Sage at the time of his deposition on September 30, 2016, and that his partner, Mr. Trask, is \"handling [code enforcement against Sweet Sage] from the town attorney's perspective.\" Dkt. 90-4 at 76-77. Mr. Daigneault also withdrew from the sign ordinance litigation because a previous code enforcement official stated the Town Attorney made enforcement decisions at issue in the case. Dkt. 61-2 at 70-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Equally unavailing is the Town's argument that because \"ultimately, the Code Enforcement Officer is responsible for deciding whether an issue is a violation or not,\" Dkt. 82-8 at 4, the enforcement actions were not by policymakers. But an NOV and eventual enforcement action is certainly not an unexpected outcome of an inspection. A reasonable jury could find that implicit in the instruction to inspect is also an instruction to enforce compliance. Such a limited analysis also ignores the fact that, again, the inspections themselves are problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The facts presented here are closer to\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

Furthermore, the Town sets forth no authority for the proposition that the Town's conduct with the vacant lot is irrelevant as evidence of retaliatory intent more broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Viewed as a whole, the alleged retaliation manifested in code enforcement, a refusal to grant a request for rezoning of the vacant lot, and the drafting and passing of Town ordinances. More specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   - Between September 2016 and April 2018, the Town conducted numerous inspections of the Caf\u00e9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 73-6.

He wrote, \"As to having the [American with Disabilities Act] regs and such, yes, I looked them up last evening to be sure, and we can be sure to print them out and make them part of the backup materials. Just for your info, I didn't need the ADA finding since my actual regulation does not incorporate the ADA standard. So why, you ask, did I add the finding? Because I want him to see that in addition to the count violation, it is likely that his seating does not meet the ADA standards either.\" The Town Attorney confirmed that \"he\" refers to Mr. Messmore. Dkt. 82-8 at 41.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   - When Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the Business Tax Code, the Town amended it in a way that would still allow unwarranted, unnoticed inspections of the Caf\u00e9. Dkt. 75-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In response to the above, the Town suggests it delegated all code enforcement responsibilities to the Sheriff, that enforcement was not selective and indeed other establishments saw repeat inspections (and, most persuasively, that the Caf\u00e9 had been repeatedly out of compliance with the parking ordinance), that decisions related to the vacant lot were justified, and that the overlap of inspections with key moments in litigation was coincidental. In this way, the Town attempts to minimize each individual instance but misses the bigger picture. A reasonable jury could, from the\n   entirety of the evidence Plaintiffs have put forward, infer that the Town Attorney and the Commission acted with a retaliatory motive against Mr. Messmore and Sweet Sage. At some point mere coincidence morphs into something else. Where precisely is a question for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Town also argues that no conduct \"adversely affected\" Mr. Messmore. Indeed, he is still vocal at meetings, the sign ordinance litigation was successful, and, to the extent it is or is not relevant as protected speech, the vacant lot is now under construction for another business. But this injects a subjective element into the inquiry, which instead asks whether the retaliation \"would likely deter a person of ordinary firmness\" from engaging in the protected speech. Mr. Messmore has given every indication that he is not a person of ordinary firmness. This factual question is another for the jury.

As applied to the Caf\u00e9 that has now revoked consent, warrantless inspections under subsection (c)(2) are unconstitutional. Summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs is thus appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ripeness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Article III's ripeness doctrine requires courts to weigh: \"(1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision; and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Beaulieu v.

Relevant to the fitness and hardship prongs are: \"(1) whether delayed review would cause hardship to the plaintiffs; (2) whether judicial intervention would inappropriately interfere with further administrative action; and (3) whether the courts would benefit from further factual development of the issues presented.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5564778\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/1219/#p1227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In analyzing the above, the Court is mindful of the unique circumstances of the case. Though the Town has not yet invoked Section 66-45 of the revised Business Tax Code, there is nonetheless a long history of inspections of the Caf\u00e9. This suggests the certain likelihood of future inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   These prior inspections were purportedly justified by the Code's precursor. Dkt. 82-8 at 31. What is more, that precursor was amended in direct response to Plaintiffs' challenge to its constitutionality. The Town has further represented that code enforcement officers in the future will be obligated to conduct administrative inspections pursuant to the Code. Dkt. 82-8 at 42. Why else, after all, pass the ordinance? Put simply, the Town is unable to render a constitutional challenge to an ordinance unripe simply by amending the ordinance and waiting until the dust of litigation settles to use it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   More tangibly, the Town has decided to tie its amended business tax receipt applications (basically the Town's business permit) to the administrative inspections. Mr.\n   Messmore has objected to the practice and has thus not reapplied after his most recent application's rejection. Plaintiffs have thus suffered-and continue to suffer-a concrete harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 75-4 at 7 (\"Any person who engages in or manages any business ... without first obtaining a local business license ... is subject to a penalty of 25 percent of the business license tax due, in addition to any other penalty provided by law or ordinance ....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 75-4 at 3 (\"It shall be unlawful for any person ... to engage in or manage any business ... without a business license.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Delay in resolving the constitutionality of the ordinance would merely put off the inevitable and cause hardship to Plaintiffs. The above considerations distinguish this case from one like\n   <em>\n    Bayside Enterprises, Inc. v. Carson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4005987\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/450/696/\">\n    450 F.Supp. 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. 1978) that was decided in a near factual vacuum.\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Free Speech Coal., Inc. v.

Judicial review would not interfere with administrative action, much less \"inappropriately.\" And the factual development of the issue, with voluminous discovery, is comprehensive enough for the Court to rule. Because Plaintiffs' challenge of Section 66-45 of the revised Business Tax Code is fit for review and withholding consideration would cause hardship, the issue is ripe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Facial Attack on Subsections (c)(3) and (g)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"Search regimes where no warrant is ever required may be reasonable where 'special needs' ... make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable\" and the \"primary purpose of the searches is distinguishable from the general interest in crime control.\"\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations, alterations, and some quotation marks omitted).

Plaintiffs argue that the Town's notice on the new ordinance did not include the classifications and rates as required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally allege that the Town lacks authority to do the following: levy taxes outside the authority delegated to municipalities by statute under Chapter 205,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b694; reinstate the use of the term \"business license\" after it has been eliminated by the Florida legislature, \u00b6 95; require businesses to provide information irrelevant for the computation of business, such as the number of seats, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98; require businesses to attest to the truthfulness of information that will be utilized in the enforcement of the Town Code, \u00b6 99; or require businesses to consent to inspections of business records, by federal state, county and Town inspectors, \u00b6 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The Court agrees with the Town that Ordinance 2018-804 did not itself levy a business tax that, indeed, had existed before the ordinance. Ordinance 2018-804 merely clarifies on whom the prior existing tax applies and revises the process and standards of applying for a business tax receipt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 75-4 at 3.

Plaintiffs, moreover, do not cite persuasive authority in support of most complaints against the Ordinance. For example, it is not immediately clear to the Court why a municipality cannot require seating information, which is relevant to a code provision, on an application for a business tax receipt. While Plaintiffs argue that nothing in Chapter 205, Florida Statutes, authorizes this and other requirements the ordinance imposes, it is equally true that nothing expressly forbids such conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the nomenclature of \"license\" to replace \"tax receipt,\" the Court finds that such a technical point cannot invalidate the entire Ordinance.

The Town is hereby enjoined from inspecting\n   the Caf\u00e9 or any business under subsection (c)(3) of Town Code Section 66-45. The Town is also ordered to remove the following language from its business tax receipt application:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   and that as a condition of the privilege of conducting business within the Town, consent to the Town's Code Enforcement Officer to periodically conduct inspections of the business premises during business hours to confirm information provided in this Application is true, and to verify that the business is complying with Town code provisions governing the business's condition, conduct and operations, is hereby given.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   The Town is further enjoined from inspecting the Caf\u00e9 pursuant to Town Code Section 66-45, subsection (c)(2).
