(Pls.' MSJ 13:18-26, ECF No. 66). In turn, SFR raises five arguments as to why the Federal Foreclosure Bar does not apply to this action: (1) the Court lacks jurisdiction; (2) Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred; (3) Plaintiffs fail to proffer admissible evidence; (4) Plaintiffs lack a property interest; and (5) FHFA consented to the extinguishment of the DOTs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SFR's MSJ 5:2-7:11); (SFR's Resp. 6:5-25:27, ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   No. 115). The Court first addresses the threshold questions of jurisdiction and statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(SFR's MTD 5:22-7:22, ECF No. 60). These four properties are identified as: (1) Rolling Boulder; (2) Benezette Court; (3) Cimarron Cove; and (4) Sea Rock Road. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 55, 62, 86). According to SFR, \"[t]he inclusion of the [ ] properties divests this Court of jurisdiction over the amended complaint.\" (SFR's MTD 7:21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs concede that the four properties should be dismissed from the action. (Pls.' MTD Resp. 4:3-5:5, ECF No. 65). Additionally, Plaintiffs request voluntary dismissal of an additional two of the properties: Hazel Croft Way and Lady Lucille Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 107, 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SFR provides no authority, nor is the Court aware of any, that the mere presence of the four at-issue properties divests the Court of jurisdiction over the remaining properties. The Court therefore rejects this argument. As to the four at-issue properties, the Court agrees it does not have jurisdiction based on the other pending actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

The Court will therefore dismiss these properties from the Amended Complaint, along with the two additional properties that Plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    2) Judicial Estoppel - Silver Brook Property\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SFR argues that the Silver Brook property should be dismissed from the action based on judicial estoppel. (SFR's MTD 9:1-11:24). Specifically, SFR contends that Nationstar Mortgage LLC (\"Nationstar\"), the recorded beneficiary of Silver Brook's deed of trust and authorized servicer for Freddie Mac, argued in a state court action that it was entitled to a distribution of excess proceeds obtained from the property's HOA foreclosure sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to SFR, this position is inconsistent with Plaintiffs' current position that the HOA sale did not extinguish the DOT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that Nationstar's position was not inconsistent because Nationstar premised its argument on the DOT surviving the HOA sale. (Pls.' MTD Resp. 11:15-13:8); (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nationstar Argument at 4, Ex. E to Pls. MTD, ECF No. 65-4). Specifically, Plaintiffs note that Nationstar argued for excess proceeds based on Freddie Mac's lien being the \"next-most senior lien\" after the HOA's superpriority lien was satisfied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, Plaintiffs contend that Nationstar's claim was not premised on the HOA sale extinguishing Plaintiffs' DOT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that precludes a party from gaining an advantage by asserting one position, and then later seeking an advantage by taking a clearly inconsistent position.\n   <em>\n    Rissetto v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 343\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11333550\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/597/#p600\">\n    94 F.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600-601 (9th Cir. 1996) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

In analyzing judicial estoppel, courts consider factors such as: (1) whether a party has taken a \"clearly inconsistent\" position; (2) whether the party succeeded in persuading a court to accept that earlier position; and (3) whether the party would derive an unfair advantage if not estopped.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9467780,9466799\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/270/778/\">\n    270 F.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (9th Cir. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the Court finds that SFR has not met the first prong of showing that Nationstar's prior statements were \"clearly inconsistent.\" To the contrary, Nationstar explicitly premised its arguments on Plaintiffs' DOT surviving the HOA sale. While SFR asserts this position is irreconcilable with Nationstar's ability to obtain excess proceeds in the underlying state court action, the ultimate merits of Nationstar's arguments are separate from whether Nationstar's representations are inconsistent to this action. Accordingly, the Court rejects SFR's judicial estoppel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SFR argues that 53 of the properties in this action are time-barred based on a three-year statute of limitations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The limitations period for any contract claim is the longer of six years or \"the period applicable under State law;\" and for any tort claim, the period is the longer of three years or \"the period applicable under State law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204617\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although this case does not clearly fit under either category, the Court finds Plaintiffs' claims more clearly sound in contract.

As these liens were created by contract, an action to enforce those liens is necessarily a \"contract action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. LN Mgmt.
