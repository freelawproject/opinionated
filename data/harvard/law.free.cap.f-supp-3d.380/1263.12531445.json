BYRON, UNITED STATE DISTRICT COURT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   William Howard was arrested and booked into an Orlando jail in late 2016 after a domestic incident. Shortly thereafter, he suffered a fractured neck when guards tackled him to the ground in his cell during a use of force incident, and he died the next day. Those events form the basis of this action. Now, Plaintiff Carolyn\n   Howard,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   individually and on behalf of Mr. Howard's estate, brings constitutional and state claims against Orange County (the \"\n   <strong>\n    County\n   </strong>\n   \"), five correctional officers, and four nurses for their actions contributing to Mr. Howard's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Each Defendant now moves for summary judgment, with the following motions, responses, and replies before the Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Defendant, Orange County's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 77); Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 97); and Orange County's Reply (Doc. 102);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Officer-Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 79); Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 95); and Officer-Defendants' Reply (Doc. 103);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. Nurse-Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment (Docs. 80-83); Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 96); and Nurse-Defendants' Reply (Doc. 104).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With briefing complete, the matter is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Pre-Use of Force\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 16, 2016, William Howard, a seventy-five-year-old man, was arrested for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon against his wife. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 1). Mr. Howard disclosed to medical staff numerous medical problems-including hypertension, asthma /COPD, high cholesterol, and glaucoma-when he was booked into the Orange County Jail (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Jail\n   </strong>\n   \"). (OCCHS 09645-49).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Medical staff commented that Mr. Howard was disoriented so he was treated for psychotic symptoms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   09650-51). He was then taken to a \"safe book\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   cell and kept on suicide prevention status. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 18, Dr. Leonard Branch evaluated Mr. Howard and found him \"very confused and unable to answer questions in a reality[-]based manner.\" (OCCHS 09631-33). Mr. Howard rambled, acted as if he knew Mr. Branch when he didn't, and became visibly agitated by his continued detention. (Doc. 94-4, \u00b6 4; OCCHS 09631-33). After the evaluation, Dr. Branch terminated Mr. Howard's suicide prevention status and placed him on psychological observation status. (Doc. 94-4, \u00b6 5; OCCHS 09631-33).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That afternoon, Mr. Howard was forcefully moved from safe book to \"a safety cell in the Acute Mental Health housing unit.\" (Doc. 94, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the move, day-shift correctional\n   officers sprayed Mr. Howard with pepper spray (Oleoresin Capsicum Spray) because he was \"combative.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; OCCHS 09628).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later that afternoon, at approximately 5:32 p.m., the nurse on shift for Mr. Howard's cell, Penelope Gray, LPN, entered a progress note stating that correctional officers had difficulty dressing him and could not move him from the safety cell. (OCCHS 09619, 09621).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When officers attempted to handcuff Mr. Howard for transport, he several times approached the food port to be handcuffed but would immediately pull his hands back before he could be restrained. (Doc. 78-4, pp. 5-6; Doc. 94, \u00b6 18). Mr. Howard was also observed \"feeling his way\" around his cell for approximately three to four hours; Nurse Gray thought this was due to his glaucoma and being pepper sprayed. (Doc. 78-4, p. 5). Nurse Gray and two other medical staff members decided Mr. Howard should not be moved since he was \"fine in [the safe cell] until he [was] ready to come out...he [was] safe...[and] there [was] no need to bring him out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6; Doc. 94, \u00b6 19). Another nurse relayed instructions to night staff to not move Mr. Howard to another cell given his perceived reluctance to move. (Doc. 78-3, 59:10-60:13; Doc. 78-4, p. 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Night-shift staff then came in to replace day-shift staff. Corporal Padilla\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   was on duty; he supervised Officers Wilkinson, LeBlanc, Wilson, and Nelson that night. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 20). Officer LeBlanc was told at the beginning of his shift that force was used on Mr. Howard earlier that day. (Doc. 78-5, 53:23-54:18). He tried speaking with Mr. Howard, which was unsuccessful, as Mr. Howard was \"pacing around in the cell and talking-mumbling incoherently.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   64:3-9). Officers Wilkinson and Padilla saw similar behavior when they checked on Mr. Howard. (Doc. 78-13, 112:8-113:3; Doc. 78-16, 34:22-35:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At some point, the decision was made to relocate Mr. Howard again. Officer Padilla testified that \"it was relayed by mental health and medical staff, that we needed to move him due to operational needs due to the - it was busy that day.\" (Doc. 78-14, 132:3-8). According to Officer Padilla, an influx of detainees was expected because of \"some type of game\" that night, and the safety cell \"needed to be open.\" (Doc. 78-13, 108:5-9; Doc. 78-14, 132:9-13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Officer Padilla maintains that Nurse Martin told him that the safety cell needed to be available. (Doc. 78-14, 132:14-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Aside from mentioning Nurse Martin's purported statements, Officer Padilla did not identify which other \"mental health and medical staff\" sought removal of Mr. Howard from the safety cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   139:3-7). Officer Padilla contends that he did not have \"the final say as to whether operational needs dictate that...someone be moved.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   131:14-24). Lt. Murray had the final say; Officer Padilla contends that Lt. Murray was consulted on the move but stopped short of saying that Lt. Murray approved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   131:14-132:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In anticipation of moving Mr. Howard, Officer Padilla requested that medical staff evaluate him again. (Doc. 78-13, 112:8-113:3). Mental Health Specialist (\"\n   <strong>\n    MHS\n   </strong>\n   \") Welch evaluated Mr. Howard and reported back to Officer Padilla that \"he could be moved.\" (Doc. 78-5, 98:5-22; Doc. 78-14, 139:13-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Use of Force\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Having resolved to move Mr. Howard, Officers first attempted a voluntary move. The Officers unsuccessfully tried to coax Mr. Howard toward the food port to be handcuffed. (Doc. 78-14, 154:25-155:9; Doc. 94, \u00b6 22). Because of his impaired vision, officers \"bang[ed] [o]n the cell door\" to guide Mr. Howard toward the noise to be handcuffed. (Doc. 78-14, 146:22-147:9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   These efforts were futile. A few times, he approached the door and touched the food port, but he did not put both hands through to be handcuffed. (Video 1; Willis Affidavit, Exhibit K (\"\n   <strong>\n    Video 2\n   </strong>\n   \")). In response to the Officers' requests to approach the food port, Mr. Howard at one point responded, \"I've been through enough today.\" (Video 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After abandoning a voluntary extraction, Officer Padilla purportedly took time to plan a use of force action to move Mr. Howard. (Doc. 78-14, 173:8-19). Officer Padilla requested Officer Wilson assist in the use of force (Doc. 78-17, 35:4-10), and recruited Officer Nelson to operate a handheld camera to film the extraction, per Jail policy (Doc. 78-11, 54:11-55:4; Doc. 78-14, 181:23-182:1). Besides Officer Nelson recording, a camera attached to a stationary tripod recorded the events. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Officers then put the plan into action. First, they tried one last time to convince Mr. Howard to approach the door to be handcuffed and warned that \"force would be used\" if he did not comply. (Video 1; Video 2). Next, Officer Wilson pepper sprayed Mr. Howard through the food port. (Video 1; Video 2). As they prepared to enter, Officer Padilla instructed his Officers, \"[O]pen it up, take him down, put him into prone, and let's get him secured.\" (Video 1; Video 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Officers then entered the cell, and a flurry of action ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon entry, Mr.\n   Howard was huddled in the corner with his head physically touching the cell wall and his arms down. (Video 1; Video 2; Willis Affidavit, Exhibit H (\"\n   <strong>\n    Video 3\n   </strong>\n   \")). Officers LeBlanc, Wilson, and Wilkinson grabbed Mr. Howard, holding the back of his neck and each arm. (Video 1; Video 2). Mr. Howard grunted and moaned as Officers alternately yelled \"don't move\" and \"put your arms behind your back.\" (Video 1; Video 2). After a brief struggle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   one Officer said \"takedown,\" and Officer Padilla repeatedly instructed \"put him into prone.\" (Video 1; Video 2). Then, the Officers spun Mr. Howard toward the front of the cell and slammed him headfirst into the ground, with Officer LeBlanc riding on Mr. Howard's back throughout the takedown,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and straddling Mr. Howard once he was on the ground. (Video 1; Video 2; Video 3). Officer LeBlanc then handcuffed Mr. Howard. (Video 1; Video 2). While on the ground, Mr. Howard can be heard coughing, wheezing, and saying \"I'm dead. I'm dead.\" (Video 1; Video 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Next, Officers moved Mr. Howard out of his safe book cell. While he continued coughing and wheezing, Officer Padilla directed the others to \"assist him to his feet.\" (Video 2). With Mr. Howard's head hanging limp, Officers LeBlanc and Wilkinson propped him up with his knees touching the floor and torso held upright by Officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). One of the Officers instructed Mr. Howard to \"get up\" and walk to a new cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mr. Howard did not respond to this command, and his head and body remained limp. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Seconds later, Officer Padilla ordered Officer Wilson to \"grab the legs.\" (Video 1). Then the Officers each grabbed an extremity and carried Mr. Howard's limp body-neck dangling from his shoulders-to a new cell a short walk down the hall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). There, Officer Padilla instructed Officers to \"place him into prone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Officers put Mr. Howard face down on the floor, removed his pants and handcuffs, and left Mr. Howard naked on the cell floor with his hands still behind his back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On their way out, Officer Padilla congratulated the others, \"Good job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Laying face-down and naked on the cell floor, Mr. Howard was motionless for about five minutes. (Video 2). When Officers returned with medical staff, he was in the same position that he was left in, except his left hand had moved slightly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Post-Use of Force Until 6:00 a.m. November 19\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nurse Mendoza, who was assigned to supervise Mr. Howard's cell, was the first\n   medical staff to visit Mr. Howard after the use of force. (Doc. 78-7, 38:4-10; Video 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officers asked Mr. Howard to approach the door to be restrained so he could be medically evaluated and decontaminated following the use of pepper spray. (Doc. 78-9, 42:13-16, 79:5-80:6; Video 2). Mr. Howard told them he could not use his legs or stand up, so the Officers and Nurse Mendoza walked away. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 51; Video 2). A few minutes later, Nurse Mendoza returned with her supervisor, Nurse Martin. (Video 2). When Officer Wilson asked if Nurses Martin and Mendoza wanted to go into Mr. Howard's cell for an evaluation, Nurse Martin replied \"No, no. Wait and see what happens. He's moving the upper part of his body.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Later, Nurse Martin asked Mr. Howard how he felt, to which he replied \"I can't get up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Nurse Mendoza was present for this exchange. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At one point, an officer walked into the cell, asked Mr. Howard if he wanted food, and left after Mr. Howard refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nurse Mendoza later testified that she observed Mr. Howard breathing regularly during her visual observation. (Doc. 78-9, 40:6-11). She also maintains that he was moving his \"arms and legs, feet and hands[, a]ll extremities\" without difficulty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   41:6-17). The Court pauses briefly to note that Video 2 paints a starkly different picture, in which Mr. Howard does not move his legs whatsoever, and he struggles to move his arms after lying motionless for several minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   At one point, an Officer standing next to Nurse Mendoza encouraged Mr. Howard, \"[M]ove your legs to get up.\" (Video 2). Mr. Howard responded, \"I can't,\" and the video clearly depicts his motionless legs between Nurse Mendoza and another Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For three minutes, Nurse Mendoza watched Mr. Howard try to get up or roll over without moving his legs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nurse Martin would testify that he was concerned for Mr. Howard's welfare and \"tr[ied] to find a reason to - to send him to the hospital, so - but there were no injuries, nothing actionable.\" (Doc. 78-7, 77:4-9). Nurse Martin concluded that his visual assessment \"was sufficient,\" though he acknowledged that certain injuries are not identifiable from a visual inspection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   78:3-79:21). Neither Nurse Martin nor Nurse Mendoza conducted more than a visual inspection of Mr. Howard (or even go into his cell) that night despite his explicit complaints that he could not move his legs and watching him lay nearly motionless on a concrete floor minutes after a use of force event. (Video 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the group walked away, Mr. Howard can be seen struggling to turn over- which he just barely accomplishes-using only his arms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The camera on the tripod stopped recording a few minutes after the Nurses and Officers walked away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In the approximately thirty-minute span of time in which the tripod recorded the new cell, Mr. Howard's legs do not appear to move and Mr. Howard only manages to roll over from a prone to a supine position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the succeeding hours, regular cell checks continued but little changed. Officers LeBlanc and Wilkinson checked on Mr. Howard every thirty minutes until their shifts ended at 6:00 a.m. on November 19. (Doc. 78-5, 134:9-11; Doc. 78-16,\n   94:9-17). They observed that Mr. Howard remained on his back on the concrete floor where Officers left him for the rest of their shift. (Doc. 78-5, 134:15-24; Doc. 78-16, 95:3-6). Likewise, Nurse Mendoza made repeated checks of Mr. Howard that night and did not observe him sit up or stand, rather he remained in a supine position all night. (Doc. 78-9, 53:16-54:6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    D. November 19 Events\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nurse Mendoza entered a 6:09 a.m. progress note on November 19, 2016, saying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Patient remains lying on floor. Medical and security have made numerous attempts to encourage patient to get in bed. Patient refuses to move off of floor. Patent continues to roll side to side on floor. Patient able to move both upper and lower extremities. Patient able to respond when addressed by staff. Patient refused breakfast. Security staff continues to encourage patient to get up and eat; patient continues to refuse. Patient continues to refuse all help from medical staff. Patient continues to refuse medication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Doc. 94, \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nurse Gray interacted with Mr. Howard during her November 19 day shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   That morning, Nurse Mendoza told Nurse Gray that Mr. Howard was forcefully moved the night prior. (Doc. 78-3, 66:17-67:10). When Nurse Gray visited Mr. Howard's cell to give him medication, he \"was laying on the floor naked\" still in a supine position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   69:10-71:2; OCCHS 09611). Nurse Gray saw that Mr. Howard had to be lifted by corrections officers from the floor into his bed and needed officers to hand him a sandwich that he could not reach because it was three feet away. (Doc. 78-3, 74:24-76:10; Doc. 94, \u00b6 60). Mr. Howard reyated to Nurse Gray that he \"hurt all over\" and complained of neck pain. (Doc. 78-3, 77:7-13, 85:1-14). Nurse Gray testified at her deposition that, once in bed, Mr. Howard was able to move his legs \"back and forth.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   77:7-13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also checked his vital signs, which appeared to be normalizing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   95:16-96:13). During her twelve-hour November 19 shift, Nurse Gray did not observe Mr. Howard stand up or even sit up without assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   97:9-11). In a nurse progress note entered at 5:51 p.m., November 19, Nurse Gray reported that Mr. Howard was still laying in his bunk and continued complaining of neck and back pain. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 63; OCCHS 09607).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At approximately 7:00 p.m. that evening, Nurse Distin relieved Nurse Gray (who had already left) of her post overseeing Mr. Howard's cell in the acute mental health ward. (Doc. 78-1, 22:6-13; 24:16-17). According to Nurse Distin, she was briefed on day-shift happenings by Nurse Martin, mentioned no uses of force against Mr. Howard or his condition generally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   27:15-28:16). When Nurse Distin approached Mr. Howard's cell for the first time, she saw him laying on his back and learned that he \"wasn't going to get up to the door.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24:21-23). A nurse progress note entered by Nurse Distin states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Patient is supine on his bunk. Asked patient to sit up to take his medication and receive his eye drops. Patient assisted to sitting position by correct[ions] staff. Patient states that he can't sit up\n   on his own or move his legs....Moves bilateral upper extremities[ ] freely. Denies any pain. [Nurse Martin] updated on patient complaints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Doc. 94, \u00b6 65; OCCHS 09605). Nurse Distin apparently did not take immediate action to address Mr. Howard's complaint that he could not move his legs, instead opting to simply relay the complaint to her supervisor. (Doc. 78-1, 37:14-38:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At approximately 10:00 p.m., Nurse Distin found Mr. Howard unresponsive in his cell. (Doc. 94, \u00b6 66). He was taken to the hospital by ambulance and died the next morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67). The medical examiner classified Mr. Howard's death as a homicide and concluded that it was \"the result of hypoxic encephalopathy due to a neck fracture with cervical spinal cord trauma, which was due to blunt force.\" (Doc. 99-6, p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Following an investigation, Dr. Robert J. Buck, III, the County's Corrections Health Services Department Medical Director, disciplined Nurses Gray and Mendoza by written reprimand for violation of Jail policies and failing to document and follow through on patient care. (Doc. 78-21, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Doc. 94, \u00b6 68). Dr. Buck fired Nurse Martin for similar reasons. (Doc. 78-21, \u00b6 14; Doc. 94, \u00b6 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After uses of force, Jail policy requires medical staff to \"conduct an assessment of the inmate involved...and provide treatment as possible.\" (Doc. 99-3, 10:3-25, 11:12-18).

Application of the\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   factors leads to the obvious conclusion that the Officer Defendants' use of force was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The first factor emphatically favors Plaintiff. The Court cannot perceive even a rational need for force. Mr. Howard was isolated in a padded cell, \"so the only possible threat [he] posed was to [himself].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shuford v. Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12146705\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/666/811/#p816\">\n    666 F. App'x 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). The only evidence of a need to relocate Mr. Howard is Officer Padilla's vague assertion that medical personnel wanted him moved. Conversely, significant evidence shows jail personnel wanted Mr. Howard to stay put. Specifically, three day-shift medical staff agreed that Mr. Howard should not be moved by force and relayed this instruction to night-shift staff. Further, Nurse Martin told Officer Padilla in an \"extensive[ ]\" conversation that Mr. Howard should not be moved because of his mental state, age, and the prior use of force. But these concerns were ignored because Officer Padilla \"had to do what he had to do.\" (Doc. 78-7, 57:18-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Whether the need for force was nonexistent or, in Defendants' best case, moderate, the amount of force used grossly exceeded this need. Officers pepper sprayed Mr. Howard, rushed him with over nine-hundred pounds of muscled Officers, and pinned him against the wall momentarily before turning and slamming him head first into the ground, breaking his neck. The Officers then propped him up and, after Mr. Howard \"refused\" to walk, each grabbed an extremity and carried Mr. Howard, body limp and head dangling, to his new cell. There he was stripped naked and left on a concrete floor the rest of the night. All the while, Mr. Howard coughed, wheezed, and moaned in pain, stating at one point: \"I'm dead. I'm dead.\" Thus, the first factor favors Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The second factor, the extent of the plaintiff's injury, likewise strongly supports Plaintiff. Defendants correctly concede this factor, but \"believe this should be tempered due to the freak accident nature of the injury.\" (Doc. 79, p. 13). Nonsense. Three large corrections officers slammed a seventy-five-year-old man head first into hard ground. There is nothing \"freak accident\" about the injury. Rather, Mr. Howard's injury was the natural consequence of a grotesquely ill-conceived maneuver-it was as foreseeable as nightfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The third factor, officers' attempts to limit force, is mixed though it, too, favors Plaintiff. The Officers spent substantial time and energy trying to handcuff Mr. Howard at the door for a voluntary move, an effort also attempted by day-shift staff. Efforts at restraint, however, were quickly abandoned after Officers entered the cell and failed to immediately handcuff Mr. Howard. The penultimate head-first slam into the ground was anything but restrained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The fourth factor, the severity of the security problem, weighs heavily for Plaintiff. Indeed, there was no security problem. There was purportedly a facilities management problem, which Defendants do not contend affected security. The Officer Defendants' hypothetical problem that may have arisen \"if a new [suicidal] inmate was admitted\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   is unpersuasive. (Doc. 79, p. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The fifth factor, Mr. Howard's perceived threat, likewise completely favors Plaintiff. Before he was moved, Plaintiff was isolated and could only threaten himself. He was also seventy-five-years old and would pose at most a minimal threat to the four younger, larger, and stronger Officers that moved him. In their motion, Defendants point to Officer Padilla's deposition testimony that \"a partial handcuffing can turn the handcuffs into a weapon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Which is to say, corrections officers may create a threat by arming a person with unsecured\n   handcuffs to justify using force. The Court disagrees with Defendants' backwards reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The sixth factor, whether the detainee was actively resisting, is mixed. The Officers assert, \"Mr. Howard 'actively resisted by tensing his muscles and attempting to pull away from our group,' \" thus this factor favors the Officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the one hand, Mr. Howard was non-compliant; he did not put his hands through the food port to be handcuffed and seemingly made it difficult for Officers to secure his hands. On the other hand, he was cowering in the corner when the Officers entered his cell, essentially blind due to pepper spray and glaucoma, and was under three Officers' control as soon as they reached him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of these factors, and viewing the evidence in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has established a Fourteenth Amendment violation. In sum, the Officers' conduct in pepper spraying an elderly detainee in an isolation cell, grabbing and slamming him head first into the ground breaking his neck, and then carrying his limp body, neck unsupported, to a new cell was \"not rationally related to a legitimate government objective [and] ... excessive in relation to th[e proffered] purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/#p2473\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This conclusion applies equally to the four Officers who jointly executed the use of force. Officer Padilla's responsibility stems from the directions he gave other Officers leading to and during the events, besides his participation in carrying Mr. Howard to the new cell. Officers Wilkinson's, LeBlanc's, and Wilson's respective responsibility derives from their actions executing the relocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The conclusion that the Officer Defendants' (excluding Officer Nelson) actions constitute excessive force is supported by a growing body of caselaw applying\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   .

She, too, observed Mr. Howard on November 19 and learned that he could not sit up or move his legs. Armed with this information, she administered eye drops and decided not to inquire further or declare a medical emergency, and instead merely reported the complaint to Nurse Martin. Hours later, Nurse Distin found Mr. Howard unresponsive, and he died soon after. In the Court's view, a patient's complaints that he or she cannot sit up or move his or her legs evinces a need \"that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor's attention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530627\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/1176/#p1187\">\n    40 F.3d at 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nurse Distin was subjectively aware of this need because Mr. Howard reported it to her, and, accepting Plaintiff's version of the facts, she essentially ignored it and failed to even report his symptoms to emergency responders.

Some saw him naked on the ground, writhing in pain with his still-functioning arms; others viewed him while standing next to his cot (from which he did not rise once being placed there) and heard his complaints. Yet not one of them made a meaningful effort to examine the source of his pain-his broken neck-with a potentially life-saving x-ray or even manual manipulation. Instead, he received superficial treatment and eventually died\n   from a neck fracture, untreated for approximately twenty-four hours.

Plaintiff maintains that liability should be imposed on the County because it \"delegated final decision-making authority to [Nurse] Martin for performing post-use of force assessments.\" (Doc. 97, p. 11). In support, Plaintiff emphasizes that: (i) Nurse Martin had no oversight in making medical decisions at night because his supervisors did not work nights (Doc. 99-3, 96:5-16); (ii) County regulations conferred on Nurse Martin complete discretion in conducting post-use of force evaluations and did not provide training on performing same or documenting results (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10:1-11:18); (iii) Nurse Martin was not required to report post-use of force assessments to a supervisor or fill out a medical form specific to uses of force-though a special form is required when pepper spray is deployed (Doc. 78-7, 43:18-46:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The County argues that Nurse Martin lacked final policymaking authority, so the County may not be held liable for his actions.

The County's argument that \"established policies and procedures\" constrained nurses' discretion (Doc. 77, p. 18) is belied by the vague and standard-less policies that applied to nurses treating inmates after uses of force at the time of the incident. The County strains, imploring that while nurses have discretion, they \"are obligated to stabilize obvious injuries and act in an emergency.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20). The County, and many officials who testified, pay this \"obligation\" lip service; the evidence shows twenty-four hours of corrections and medical officers utterly ignoring \"obvious injuries and [failing to] act in an emergency.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202860926\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).

Defense Counsel decision to repeat Nurse Mendoza's demonstrably false version of events in her motion (Doc. 83, p. 20) is baffling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The County's attempts to distinguish\n    <em>\n     Mandel\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Kimbrough\n    </em>\n    are likewise unavailing. While the circumstances that led a physician's assistant to operate without review in\n    <em>\n     Mandel\n    </em>\n    differ from the facts here, the result-basically a nurse in charge of treatment decisions without meaningful oversight-is the same. Also, the County argues that the official delegated final policymaking authority in\n    <em>\n     Kimbrough\n    </em>\n    was a \"medical director,\" thus the County seems to divine a rule that only medical directors may be delegated final authority. Of course, the County offers no legal support for such a rule, and regardless the\n    <em>\n     Mandel\n    </em>\n    decision disproves it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    These include an arrest based on aggravated assault allegations (Doc. 78-13, 18:14-20:13; Doc. 78-15, p. 117), a written reprimand by the Jail for failing to report a use of force (Doc. 78-15, pp. 118-141), a fourteen-day domestic violence injunction that the County did not document in Officer Padilla's employee file (Doc. 78-13, 52:15-55:20), and allegations of unauthorized uses of force against detainees, which were investigated and \"not sustained\" (Doc. 78-15, pp. 150-164).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
