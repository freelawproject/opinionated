WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff First Technology Capital, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action on February 5, 2015, against Airborne, Inc. d/b/a/ Firstflight (\"Defendant\"), for damages allegedly sustained when Defendant breached a contract to purchase an aircraft from Plaintiff. (Dkt. 1). Following the filing of the parties' competing motions seeking various forms of relief (Dkt. 30; Dkt. 39; Dkt. 47; Dkt. 57), the Court issued a Decision and Order on August 2, 2017, granting Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing Plaintiff's Complaint based upon Defendant's perfect tender defense (Dkt. 71). On September 5, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the judgment entered against it. (Dkt. 73). On July 3, 2018, the Second Circuit issued a summary order vacating the judgment and remanding the case for this Court to consider Plaintiff's motion for contract reformation before addressing Defendant's perfect tender defense. (Dkt. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment based on Defendant's failure to appear through counsel as directed by the Court. (Dkt. 89). On May 6, 2019, the Court issued a Decision and Order, granting Plaintiff's motion for a default judgment, and directing the Clerk of Court to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and to close the case. (Dkt. 92). The Clerk of Court entered default judgment in favor of Plaintiff on May 7, 2019 (Dkt. 93), and the case was terminated on May 8, 2019. On the same day the case was closed, Plaintiff filed a motion to alter the judgment. (Dkt. 94). Plaintiff requests that the Court delete the language in its May 6, 2019, Decision and Order directing the Clerk of Court to close the case. (Dkt. 94-1 at 1). Plaintiff seeks this relief because it intends to pursue post-judgment discovery and will likely need the Court's assistance in obtaining the discovery it seeks pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court interprets Plaintiff's application as a motion to reopen the case to seek post-judgment discovery. For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 94) is denied because the case need not be reopened in order for Plaintiff to seek post-judgment discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Post-judgment discovery is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69....\"\n   <em>\n    EM Ltd. v.
