A condition precedent to the agreement was the adoption of an OEA amendment that would permit the redevelopment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44. In early 2018, a proposed redevelopment plan was distributed to the other property owners, and Hamra Enterprises, the property development company that controlled and managed Chicago Bread,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39, discussed amending the OEA with them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 7, 2018, KMK and Chicago Bread amended their redevelopment/lease agreement to provide that Chicago Bread could terminate the agreement if it could not in good faith secure the OEA amendment by August 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-49. On June 13, 2018, Hamra Vice President Ben Kaplan emailed all parcel owners a proposed Third Amendment to the OEA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55. The email stated that Chicago Bread would terminate its agreement with KMK if it could not secure the amendment by August 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The proposed amendment designated the area in which the planned redevelopment would take place, required KMK's parcel to leave twenty-four parking spaces available to Panera customers, and replaced a provision allowing KMK's former tenant Arby's to post Arby's signs with one permitting any restaurant occupant of KMK's parcel to post its signs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 57-59; Doc. 1-1 at 62. None of these changes would have negatively affected any other store in the shopping center. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 7, 2018, Kaplan sent an email to all parcel owners attaching a revised proposed Third Amendment, noting in bold and underlined font that all parties had \"agreed in concept to the attached, with the one owner exception of [Helco President] Heather Mooney,\" from whom Kaplan had received no comment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 61. Kaplan stated that he hoped to finish the amendment process by July 20.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 61. On July 12, Kaplan told KMK that all parcel owners other than Helco had agreed to the proposed amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   No later than July 13, 2018, Mooney sent Kaplan suggested revisions to the proposed amendment and expressed her belief that two Helco tenants, a Sears Outlet store and a Great Clips hair salon, had \"approval rights\" over OEA amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. Mooney stated that she did not want to ask the tenants for approval until the proposed amendment was finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. The OEA did not require Helco to obtain its tenants' approval before signing an amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. In a July 13 email, Kaplan attached a final draft proposed amendment incorporating Mooney's suggestions and asked Mooney to \"immediately go[ ] to her two tenants to seek approval,\" reminding her of the August 6 \"drop dead date\" and asking all Approving Parties to execute the amendment by July 27.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All parcel owners except Helco approved the proposed Third Amendment by July 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-68. On July 31, Kaplan told the parcel owners in an email that he \"ha[d] been told that [Mooney] went to the two tenants\" and had \"heard ... from a local official\" that the tenants \"have no issue and would welcome Panera to the center.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69. Kaplan again reminded Mooney about the August 6 deadline.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Kaplan emailed Mooney again on August 1, asking her if Helco would sign the amendment if Sears and Great Clips consented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. Mooney responded, \"Our attorney already explained this to you.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By August 3, Helco still had not approved the proposed amendment, so KMK and Chicago Bread amended their redevelopment/lease agreement to extend the \"drop dead date\" to August 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. Kaplan told Mooney about the new deadline in an August 7 email, adding that the deadline would not be extended further and that Chicago Bread would terminate the agreement if it could not secure the OEA amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75. Mooney did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 76-77. On August 14, a representative from Sears told McHenry officials that it had approved the proposed OEA amendment, McHenry's mayor relayed this information to Kaplan, and Kaplan called Mooney and left a message on her voicemail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78. Mooney did not call back that day.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   In an August 15 phone call, Mooney told Kaplan that she would approve the proposed amendment only if Chicago Bread agreed to indemnify Helco against any claims brought by Sears against Helco due to the redevelopment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. Kaplan refused.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That day, Kaplan called Mooney's primary contact at Sears.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. The Sears contact told Kaplan that Sears was not required to consent to OEA amendments under its agreement with Helco, but said that Sears would consent if Helco reduced its rent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. Helco refused to reduce Sears's rent or to sign the amendment without Sears's approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. Sears later emailed McHenry's mayor to say that it did not \"want [McHenry] to suffer\" because the deal fell through, but that it \"was not required to sign\" and Helco did not \"need to ask [Sears] to sign\" a consent to the amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83. Sears stated that it hoped Helco would \"sign the consent form without involving\" Sears.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Kaplan emailed Mooney the next day to say that Sears did not believe it had to agree to the amendment and asking why Mooney refused to sign the amendment, but Mooney did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mooney did not approve or disapprove the amendment or provide any updates to KMK or Chicago Bread between August 16 and August 20.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88. On August 20, Chicago Bread terminated its agreement with KMK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89. On August 21, the day after the August 20 deadline, Mooney told Kaplan that Sears had consented to the amendment and asked him to \"[l]et [Helco] know the status of the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. Mooney never explained in writing why she believed her approval of the amendment was contingent on Sears's consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91. KMK alleges that Helco used Sears's unwillingness to consent as a pretext, and that Helco delayed\n   approving the proposed OEA amendment in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   KMK alleges that Helco breached Section 6.5(B) of the OEA by not approving or disapproving the amendment or justifying any disapproval in writing within thirty days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 97-129. KMK also alleges that Helco intentionally interfered with KMK's prospective economic advantage by delaying its approval in bad faith until after Chicago Bread terminated the redevelopment/lease agreement with KMK.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 130-38.

Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 97-129. According to KMK, Section 6.5(B) reasonably can be read \"to apply in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   situations where a party has been asked to give 'a formal sanction to' a request under the OEA,\" including a request to agree to a proposed OEA amendment. Doc. 28 at 11 (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Approve\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)). Thus, KMK argues, a reasonable jury could find that Helco was obligated to respond to Chicago Bread's request to approve the proposed OEA amendment in the manner set forth in Section 6.5(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308442\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/1079/#p1088\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Helco responds that Section 6.8(E), not Section 6.5(B), governs requests to approve proposed OEA amendments, and therefore that it could not have breached Section 6.5(B) in connection with the request to approve the proposed amendment. Doc. 21 at 4-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Helco is correct as a matter of law: Under the general/specific canon referenced above, Section 6.5(B) does not govern requests to approve OEA amendments. As noted, Section 6.5(B) provides that if a party does not respond to a request for approval within thirty days, \"the requested party shall be deemed to have given its approval.\" Doc. 1-1 at 39. If a request to sign a proposed OEA amendment were governed by Section 6.5(B), then an Approving Party that did not respond to such a request would be deemed to have approved the amendment. Section 6.8(E), however, provides that the OEA can be amended \"by, and\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   by, a written agreement signed by all of the then current Approving Parties.\" Doc. 1-1 at 40 (emphasis added). Therefore, Section 6.5(B) contemplates a general method of approval (silence) that Section 6.8(E) precludes in the specific context of proposed OEA amendments. For that reason, Section 6.8(E), not Section 6.5(B), applies to requests to approve amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aeroground\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694590\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/810/#p816\">\n    738 F.3d at 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the plaintiff was required under a specific contract provision to pay for \"floor repairs\" even though a more general provision required the defendant to pay for \"damage\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   KMK cites no authority to counter Helco's invocation (Doc. 121 at 8) of the general/specific canon to resolve whatever tension exists between Sections 6.5(B) and 6.8(E), thereby forfeiting any such argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.G.

KMK instead questions the premise underlying Helco's invocation of the canon by arguing that there is in fact no tension to resolve between Section 6.5(B) and Section 6.8(E). According to KMK, the OEA contemplates a two-step amendment process: The Approving Parties first must approve the proposed amendment under Section 6.5(B), and then must \"final[ize]\" the amendment by drawing up and signing a written agreement under Section 6.8(E). Doc. 28 at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   KMK's interpretation of the OEA cannot be reconciled with its text. The reason is simple: By providing that the OEA \"may be amended by, and only by, a written agreement signed by all of the then current Approving Parties,\" Doc. 1-1 at 40, Section 6.8(E) plainly conveys that a written agreement signed by the Approving\n   Parties is not only necessary, but also sufficient, to effectuate an amendment. Section 6.8(E) thus leaves no role for Section 6.5(B) to play in the amendment approval process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Nor is KMK's reading a \"natural\" or \"reasonable\" construction of Section 6.8(E) in the context of the OEA as a whole.\n   <em>\n    Land of Lincoln\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180189\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/673/#p679\">\n    762 F.3d at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . KMK does not explain, and the court cannot imagine, what function the supposed Section 6.5(B) pre-amendment approval process would serve that an amendment signed under Section 6.8(E) would not. Would an Approving Party be bound by a pre-amendment approval under Section 6.5(B), even if the Approving Party were deemed to have approved only because it failed to respond within thirty days to a request for approval? If not, then the supposed pre-amendment approval process would be superfluous to the process under Section 6.8(E). If so, the supposed pre-amendment approval process would frustrate the purpose of Section 6.8(E), which is to ensure that no Approving Party is bound by an amendment without agreeing to it in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   KMK also argues that because Section 6.8(E) provides that a proposed amendment can go into effect only with the agreement of the \"Approving Parties,\" requests to approve proposed amendments must be governed by Section 6.5(B). Doc. 28 at 12. That argument fails to persuade. Section 6.5(B) does not use the term \"Approving Parties,\" a fact that itself defeats KMK's submission that Section 6.8(E)'s reference to \"Approving Parties\" necessarily refers back to Section 6.5(B). The OEA uses the term \"Approving Party\" not to invoke Section 6.5(B), but simply to identify precisely who must agree to a proposed amendment: the representative from the Target Tract (currently, Indiana Realty) and the representative from the Developer Tract (currently, Helco), as distinct from all \"Parties\" to the OEA. In some circumstances, such as under Section 6.8(E), the Approving Parties' role is to decide whether to approve something, while in others, the Approving Parties have no authority to approve or disapprove the action in question.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 1-1 at 13 (\"[E]ach Party\n   <em>\n    reserves the right\n   </em>\n   to create a temporary staging and/or storage area in the Common Area on its Tract .... [A] Party shall give the Approving Parties at least thirty (30) days prior notice of the proposed location of such staging and/or storage area ....\") (emphasis added). Thus, by providing that a proposed amendment requires the approval of the two Approving Parties, Section 6.8(E) simply identifies which Parties' approval is required for a proposed amendment; it does not subject requests to approve a proposed amendment to the Section 6.5(B) process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, KMK argues that Helco violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to respond reasonably or without delay to KMK's requests to amend.

KMK has the better of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, KMK pleads facts allowing a reasonable inference that Helco's refusal to agree to the proposed OEA amendment in a timely manner was \"without justification,\"\n   <em>\n    Delloma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509873\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/168/#p171\">\n    996 F.2d at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , serving as a pretext for its tortious conduct. KMK alleges that the proposed OEA amendment-which would have allowed an operational restaurant to replace a defunct one and to post signs and maintain parking spaces-were minor and would not have negatively affected the shopping center's other stores. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 57-59. KMK also alleges that Sears repeatedly stated that it was not opposed to the amendment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69 (alleging that Chicago Bread told Mooney that it had learned that Sears had \"no issue and would welcome Panera to the center\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78 (alleging that Sears told McHenry officials that it approved of the amendment);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83 (alleging that Sears told McHenry's mayor that it hoped Helco would agree to the amendment without involving Sears), and that Helco did not need to secure Sears's consent to agree to the amendment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80-83. One could infer from these facts that the proposed OEA amendment would not have created a meaningful risk of liability to Helco and that Helco was not obligated secure Sears's consent before agreeing to it. If so, then one could reasonably infer that Helco's purported justification for not agreeing to the amendment was no justification at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

Specific allegations in the complaint buttress the point. Helco was slow and unresponsive through every step of the amendment process despite Chicago Bread's repeated reminders that time was of the essence, while the other parcel owners were willing and able to approve the amendment well before the deadline. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64-68, 76-78, 86-88. Helco's dilatory approach lends support to KMK's theory that the delay was intentional. Moreover, when confronted by Chicago Bread, Helco did not even attempt to explain why it insisted on getting Sears's consent despite the allegedly minimal litigation risk and comments from Sears that arguably should have allayed any remaining concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 71, 86-87. It is reasonable to infer that Helco did not answer Chicago Bread's questions because it could not provide a reasoned justification, which in turn supports an inference that Helco's proffered justification was a pretext. Finally, Helco was suddenly and inexplicably able to secure a satisfactory consent from Sears the\n   <em>\n    day after\n   </em>\n   Chicago\n   Bread terminated its agreement with KMK, a feat it supposedly was unable to accomplish in all the weeks and months before.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 93. It is reasonable to infer that whatever Helco did to resolve its concerns with the proposed OEA amendment could have been done at least twenty-four hours, if not days or weeks, sooner. Considered along with the general allegations of bad faith, these factual allegations are sufficient to plead intentional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because a reasonable jury could infer from the allegations in KMK's complaint that Helco delayed intentionally and without justification, KMK has met its burden to allege malice and thus to overcome Helco's asserted privilege at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Helco also argues that an independent source of privilege arises from various OEA provisions reserving the right of parcel owners to make business judgments even if those judgments are not objectively reasonable. Doc. 21 at 13-14; Doc. 30 at 12. Because Helco cites no authority for the proposition that a contract provision can itself give rise to a privilege defense to an intentional interference claim, the argument is forfeited for purposes of this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.G. Skinner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176068\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/313/#p321\">\n    845 F.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, even if an OEA contract provision privileged Helco's conduct, privilege can be overcome by showing that the defendant acted maliciously, as Helco is alleged to have done.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delloma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509873\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/168/#p171\">\n    996 F.2d at 171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Helco's intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage claim therefore survives dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Helco's motion to dismiss is granted as to KMK's contract claim and denied as to its intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim. The contract claim is dismissed without prejudice to KMK filing an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. &amp; Nw. Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190984\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/510/#p519\">\n    786 F.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (7th Cir. 2015) (\"Ordinarily, ... a plaintiff whose original complaint has been dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) should be given at least one opportunity to try to amend her complaint before the entire action is dismissed.\"). KMK has until May 28, 2019 to file an amended complaint. If it does not do so, the dismissal of the contract claim will convert automatically to a dismissal with prejudice. If KMK repleads, Helco will have until June 18, 2019 to respond to the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
