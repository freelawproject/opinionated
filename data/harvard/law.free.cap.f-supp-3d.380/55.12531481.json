Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 138. On December 19, 2013, the SCC tribunal found that Kazakhstan violated its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty, and it issued an award in favor of the Stati Parties in the amount of $ 497,685,101.00, which included $ 199 million for the LPG plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kazakhstan attempted to nullify the SCC award by instituting proceedings before the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm. Compl. \u00b6 183. It argued, among other things, that the SCC award was procured by fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185. The alleged fraud concerned the value of the LPG plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. According to plaintiff, prior to the initiation of the arbitral proceedings, the Stati Parties \"created a number of illegitimate contractual documents with related parties for the purpose of artificially inflating the construction costs of the LPG [p]lant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. These falsified construction costs, Kazakhstan alleges, were included in financial statements, which were in turn used to fraudulently induce companies, including the state-owned oil and gas company,\n   KazMunaiGas (\"KMG\"), into bidding $ 199 million for the LPG plant in 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 116, 130-31. Thus, Kazakhstan charges that the Stati Parties misrepresented the value of the LPG plant during the SCC arbitration when they proffered \"the fraudulently procured bids,\" the \"falsified financial statements,\" \"false testimony regarding the amount of the investment in the LPG [p]lant,\" and \"expert reports\" that restated those figures as evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152. According to Kazakhstan, based upon this \"false evidence\" the arbitral panel awarded the Stati Parties $ 199 million in compensation for the LPG plant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite what Kazakhstan characterizes as its \"detailed and specific allegations regarding [d]efendants' fraudulent scheme,\" the Svea Court of Appeal affirmed the arbitral award on December 9, 2016.

Kazakhstan then filed a motion to the Swedish Supreme Court seeking to quash the Svea Court of Appeal's judgment due to \"grave procedural errors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 190. That legal challenge also failed.

This suit, for alleged RICO violations, is the latest chapter. In its 93-page complaint, plaintiff accuses defendants of engaging in a \"sophisticated and wide-ranging illegal pattern of racketeering,\" based upon its efforts to fraudulently inflate the value of the LPG plant, both prior to and during the SCC arbitration, and its ongoing litigation activities to enforce and collect on the SCC award.
