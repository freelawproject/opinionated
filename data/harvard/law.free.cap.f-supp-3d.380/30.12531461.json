INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case concerns the degree to which the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   can shield an enforcement action from judicial review by invoking its discretion to bring that action in the first place. Plaintiffs, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (\"CREW\") and Noah Bookbinder, CREW's executive director, initiated this action against the FEC under the Federal Election Campaign Act (\"FECA\"). They argue that the FEC improperly dismissed their administrative complaint against New Models, a non-profit entity based in Washington, D.C. According to Plaintiffs, New Models failed to register and report as a \"political committee\" in 2012, in violation of FECA, yet the FEC declined to investigate that violation. The FEC Commissioners charged with explaining the dismissal justified the FEC's action with a lengthy analysis of statutory text and case law. They also, however, stated that dismissal was appropriate because pursing an investigation of New Models would not be an appropriate use of the FEC's limited resources. In other words, they invoked the FEC's \"prosecutorial discretion\" to decline enforcing FECA against New Models.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' ripe cross-motions for summary judgment. The FEC argues, relying heavily on a recent D.C. Circuit decision, that because the Commissioners exercised prosecutorial discretion to dismiss Plaintiffs' administrative complaint, this Court is barred from reviewing any portion of that dismissal. Plaintiffs resist the application of that \"magic words\" standard, and the Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs' concerns. However, having reviewed the relevant case law and the parties' briefing, the Court concludes that, at least in this case, it cannot review the FEC's invocation of its unreviewable discretion. Thus, for the reasons stated more fully below, the FEC's motion for summary judgment is granted and Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The FEC's OGC reviewed the complaint and New Models's response, and determined that \"it reasonably appears that New Models made over $ 1,000 in expenditures in 2012 and had the major purpose of nominating or electing federal candidates.\" AR065. The OGC thus recommended that the Commissioners find \"reason to believe\" that New Models was a political committee. AR066. Nevertheless, in late-2017, the Commissioners deadlocked 2-to-2 on whether to further investigate New Models.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR087.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the deadlock, the Commissioners voted 4-to-0 to dismiss Plaintiffs' administrative complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR088.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As required, the Controlling Commissioners-the two Commissioners who voted to halt the investigation-issued a statement of reasons explaining their conclusion that there was no \"reason to believe\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   that New Models was an unregistered political committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR091-122. The statement of reasons undertook a robust discussion of New Models's activities, public statements, revenue, and spending; FECA's statutory definition of a political committee; and the evolution of the \"Major Purpose Test\" established by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR091-108. Given that framework, the Controlling Commissioners provided three reasons why dismissal was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the Controlling Commissioners concluded that New Models fell outside the statutory definition of a political committee; it \"was a contributor, not a political committee.\" AR110. More specifically, the Controlling Commissioners determined that New Models did not receive \"contributions\" or make \"expenditures\" of more than $ 1,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR108-10. The Controlling Commissioners grounded this determination on the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   . They stated that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   \"circumscribed\" the statutory definition of \"expenditure\" to reach \"spending that is unambiguously related to the campaign of a particular federal candidate.\" AR109 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). And New Models did not make \"any independent expenditures of its own expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It only donated money to other political committees, which \"made expenditures independent of candidates and political parties.\" AR110. In other words, the Controlling Commissioners concluded that because New Models itself did not advocate for the election of any candidate or earmark money for particular campaigns, it did not make expenditures under FECA. And because New Models did not make expenditures it could not receive contributions, which the Controlling Commissioners interpreted, under FECA and\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , to be donations \"earmarked for political purposes.\" AR109 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=424%20U.S.%201\">\n    424 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   23 n.24, 78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n    96 S.Ct. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the Controlling Commissioners concluded that New Models's major purpose was not the nomination or election of candidates for federal elections, as\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   requires for political committee status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR121. In reaching this conclusion, the Controlling Commissioners \"compare[d] New Models's isolated contributions [in 2012] with other activities both in 2012 and during its lifetime.\" AR111. The Controlling Commissioners acknowledged that a substantial portion of New Models's spending in 2012 consisted of donations to other political committees, indicating that \"nominating or defeating a federal candidate may have been\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   purpose of the organization in 2012.\" AR117 (emphasis in original). The Controlling Commissioners noted, however, that New Models spent little to no money on political committees in any other year, both before and after 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR095-96; AR116-18. They also surveyed New Models's public statements, organizational documents, and tax filings made over its lifetime, and could not find evidence to suggest that the organization ever advocated the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR111-114. The Controlling Commissioners acknowledged the possibility that New Models's purpose could have shifted in 2012, from an issues focus to a campaign focus,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR117 &amp; n.123, but they discounted that possibility given the organization's messaging and spending practices after 2012,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Controlling Commissioners concluded that New Models was an \"issue discussion organization, not a political committee having the major purpose of nominating or electing candidates.\" AR121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, the Controlling Commissioners concluded that \"proceeding further would not be an appropriate use of Commission resources.\" AR121 n.139. They noted that\n   New Models \"appear[ed] no longer active.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20S.%20Ct.%20612\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR97 &amp; n.32 (noting that New Models \"liquidated, terminated, dissolved, or otherwise ceased operations\" in 2015). They also noted \"the age of the activity\" at issue; the alleged expenditures occurred more than five years before the Controlling Commissioners' decision. AR121 n.139. Given these factors, the Controlling Commissioners \"exercise[d] [their] prosecutorial discretion\" to dismiss Plaintiffs' administrative complaint. AR121.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Commission acted contrary to law in two ways. First, Plaintiffs fault the Controlling Commissioners for applying an exceedingly narrow definition of \"expenditure,\" such that only expenditures on \"express[ ] advoca[cy]\"-and not donations to political committees-were deemed relevant to whether New Models met the statutory definition of a political committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. (\"Pls.' Mem.\") at 29, ECF No. 12. Second, Plaintiffs characterize the Controlling Commissioners' statement of reasons as applying a \"lifetime-focused\n   test\" for determining an organization's major purpose; a test that Plaintiffs claim has \"been struck down as contrary to law by a judge in this district,\" and that otherwise has no basis in case law or FECA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The FEC contests Plaintiffs' arguments on their merits, but it first raises a threshold challenge to this Court's review. It notes that the Controlling Commissioners expressly relied on prosecutorial discretion as \"an independent basis\" for dismissing Plaintiffs' administrative complaint. FEC's Mem. Supp. Mot. (\"FEC's Mem.\") at 15, ECF No. 13-1. And it argues that a recent D.C. Circuit opinion-\n   <em>\n    CREW v.

Plaintiffs' theory appears to be two-pronged: either (1) in dismissing Plaintiffs' complaint the Controlling Commissioners adopted a bright-line rule \"refus[ing] to apply the FECA's political committee laws to any group that qualifies under the statute as a result of its contributions to other political committees, or as the result of an analysis of less than its lifetime of spending\"; or (2) the Commission has \" 'consciously and expressly adopted a general policy' of nonenforcement\" of FECA.

While the Controlling Commissioners' interpretation of \"expenditure\" under FECA may be overly narrow, it is the interpretation of only two Commissioners.
