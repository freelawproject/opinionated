Kendall, United States District Judge\n   David and Annette Garber sued Amazon.com, Inc. (\"Amazon\") and Shenzhen Gangshen Technology Company Ltd. (\"Shenzhen\") for property damage to their home caused by a fire ignited by a defective hoverboard the Garbers purchased through Amazon's online marketplace, Amazon.com. Plaintiffs sued in state court alleging one count of strict liability and one count of negligence. Amazon removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and now moves for summary judgment on both counts. For the following reasons, Amazon's Motion for Summary Judgment [Dkt. 39] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court draws the relevant facts from the parties' Local Rule (\"LR\") 56.1 statements of undisputed material facts and supporting exhibits: Amazon's Rule 56.1(a) Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Dkt. 40), Plaintiffs' Rule 56.1(b) Response Statement of Disputed Material Facts (Dkt. 42), and Defendant Amazon.com, Inc.'s Reply to Plaintiffs' LR 56.1(b) Response and Response to Plaintiff's Additional Facts (Dkt. 45). The facts set forth below are supported by the record and, except where otherwise noted, are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court must begin by addressing the parties' Local Rule 56.1 statements. In many instances, the Garbers dispute or deny Amazon's material facts but fail to cite any evidence in the record supporting their disagreements. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 22.) Facts that are denied without evidentiary support are undisputed for purposes of summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.R. 56.1(a), (b)(3)(B) (non-movant's disagreements with moving party's facts \"shall contain ... specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9245985\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/809/#p817\">\n    368 F.3d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"[W]here a non-moving party denies a factual allegation by the [moving party], that denial must include a specific reference to the affidavit or other part of the record that supports such a denial\"). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) similarly provides that if the nonmoving party \"fails to properly address another party's assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may ... consider the fact undisputed for the purposes of the motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2). Where the Garbers deny Amazon's facts but do not support their denials with evidentiary support, Amazon's facts are deemed admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In other instances, the Garbers \"deny that competent evidence has been submitted to substantiate\" Amazon's facts, (Dkt. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11-21), but they offer no evidence beyond this conclusory statement that refutes the admissible facts set forth by the sworn declaration of Damon Jones, Amazon's then-Manager of Product Safety and Recalls (Dkt. 40-1), which Amazon relies on extensively. Competent evidence includes facts set forth by affidavit or declaration. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). As long as a competent declarant makes statements based upon personal knowledge, as Mr. Jones has here, the declaration can support a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Where the Garbers dispute Amazon's material facts solely on the ground that Amazon's facts are not supported by competent evidence, the Court deems those facts to be admitted. And of course, where the Garbers cite evidence in the record that does not actually controvert Amazon's facts, or respond to Amazon's facts with legal argument, those facts have been deemed admitted as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L.R. 56.1 (b)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Finally, the Court notes that the Garbers set forth many facts and cite many exhibits in their brief opposing summary judgment that are nowhere to be found in their Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(C) statement of facts. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43 at 1-12; Dkt. 42.) Those facts have been disregarded.

Facts Not Subject to Genuine Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Amazon operates an online marketplace at www.amazon.com, where users across the world can access the site to view and purchase products offered for sale. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 22.) The marketplace is an information service that Amazon provides to facilitate commerce between buyers and sellers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 22.) Amazon sells some of its own products on its marketplace, but more than a million third-party sellers sell their own products through the marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Amazon's Business Solutions Agreement and \"A-to-Z Guarantee\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Amazon requires all third-party sellers using its marketplace to assent to its \"Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement\" (\"BSA\"), which Defendant Shenzhen did. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 1.) The BSA requires third-party sellers like Shenzhen to adhere to Amazon's policies covering many aspects of sales on the online marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The BSA requires that third-party sellers \"source, offer, sell and fulfill\" the products they sell on the online marketplace. (Dkt. 40-1 at 13 \u00a7 S-2.1.) Third-party sellers must \"maintain price parity\" between products they sell on the Amazon online marketplace and products they sell through other sales channels by ensuring\n   that the price and offer terms (including shipping charges, rebates, discounts, terms of cancellation, and return and refund policies) are \"at least as favorable\" for Amazon customers as the \"most favorable terms\" are for customers of other sales channels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 \u00a7 S-4.) The BSA also requires third-party sellers to provide Amazon customers with customer service that is \"at least as responsive and available and offers at least the same level of support as the most favorable customer services\" offered through third-party sellers' other sales channels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The way the agreement works in relevant part is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1.) The seller decides what to sell and sources the product from the manufacturer or upstream distributor. The Terms state that the seller will \"source, offer, sell and fulfill [its] Seller-Fulfilled Products.\" (Jones Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. B at \u00a7 S-2.1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2.) The seller is \"responsible for any non-conformity or defect in, or any public or private recall of, any of [its] Products.\" (Jones Decl., Ex. B at \u00a7 S-3.1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3.) The seller provides the product description displayed to the buyer. Sellers must provide \"accurate and complete Required Product Information for each product or service that [it] offer[s] through any Amazon Site and promptly update that information as necessary to ensure it at all times remains accurate and complete.\" (Jones Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. B at \u00a7 S-11)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4.) The seller sets the price.(SF\u00b6 18; Jones Decl. \u00b6 1 2)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5.) The seller is responsible for ensuring the product is properly packaged and complies with all applicable laws. The seller must \"ensure that [its] Materials, [its] Products (including packaging) and [its] offer and subsequent sale of any of the same on any Amazon Site comply with all applicable Laws (including all minimum age, marking and labeling requirements) and do not contain any sexually explicit (except to the extent expressly permitted under [Amazon's] applicable Program Policies), defamatory or obscene materials.\" (Jones Decl. \u00b6 12, Ex. B at \u00a7 S-1.1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   6.) Unless the seller participates in the Fulfillment by Amazon program (\"FBA\"), the seller holds its own inventory. The seller decides the means and price of shipping, packages the product for shipment, and ships the product to the buyer. (The FBA service involves logistics services in which third-party sellers pay to store their inventory in an Amazon fulfillment center. This service is not relevant here because Shenzhen sold and shipped the hoverboard directly to Mrs.Garber.) (Jones Decl. \u00b6 12)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   7.) The seller offers any warranty of its choosing. Amazon does not warrant third-party products sold on the marketplace. (Jones Decl. \u00b6 12)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   8.) Amazon processes payment. It charges the payment instrument designated in the buyer's account, and remits the purchase price to the third-party seller minus the service fees the seller agreed to in the BSA. (Jones Decl. \u00b6 18).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The BSA requires third-party sellers to comply with Amazon's applicable policies and procedures for packaging, labeling, and shipping products; determining shipping and handling charges; providing order status, shipping, and tracking information; and providing certain tax information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 \u00a7 S-1.3; 2.1.) The BSA also requires third-party sellers to communicate with Amazon customers using tools and methods Amazon designates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 \u00a7 14.) Amazon's return and refund policies apply to products third-party sellers offer on the online marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 \u00a7 S-2.2.) Through the BSA, Amazon maintains the right to require third-party sellers to\n   obtain, at their expense, \"commercial general, umbrella, or excess liability insurance\" naming Amazon and its assignees as additional insureds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 \u00a7 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third-party sales through Amazon's online marketplace are covered by Amazon's \"A-to-Z Guarantee\" program. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 8.) Amazon's description of the \"A-to-Z Guarantee\" on its website states that Amazon \"guarantee[s] purchases from third party sellers when payment is made via the Amazon.com website ...\" and that \"[t]he condition of the item [a customer] buy[s] and its timely delivery are guaranteed under the Amazon A-to-Z Guarantee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 43-3 at 11:11-12:18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Garbers' Purchase\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant Shenzhen was a third-party seller with its principal place of business in China who listed and sold products on Amazon's online marketplace. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10.) Shenzhen entered into and assented to the terms of Amazon's BSA. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 1.) Shenzhen sold products on Amazon's online marketplace under the name \"Libert00.\" (Dkt. 40 \u00b6 10.) Amazon earned a sales commission on products Shenzhen sold through the online marketplace. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 5.) The commission was 15% of the costs imposed on the customer for a particular sales transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 6, 2015, Annette Garber purchased a hoverboard through the Amazon online marketplace. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6 11.) The order detail documents and final invoice associated with the purchase list that the hoverboard was \"sold by\" and \"fulfilled by\" the entity \"Libert00,\" a name used by Shenzhen, and that Shenzhen was the \"seller of record.\" (Dkt. 40-1 at 9; Dkt. 40-3 at 6; Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11.) Amazon processed all the money for the transaction. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 6.) Amazon did not package or label the hoverboard Annette Garber purchased. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6 16.) Libert00 shipped the hoverboard to Annette Garber. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Amazon did not design, manufacture, inspect, maintain, repair, install, or modify the hoverboard Annette Garber purchased, and never possessed it. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 17.) Libert00 sourced the hoverboard from the manufacturer or upstream distributors (or assembled it from parts that it sourced), owned the hoverboard, set the price for it, and transferred title to it to Annette Garber. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Libert00, or others upstream in the distribution chain, decided on the warnings, instructions, packaging, and labeling that came with the hoverboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Amazon made no statements or representations about the hoverboard on the product page through which Annette Garber placed the order, nor did it write or develop the product detail page content for the hoverboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Garbers deny that they bought the hoverboard from Shenzhen or Libert00 and assert that they believe they bought it from Amazon, because they purchased it through Amazon's online marketplace at www.amazon.com. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 \u00b6 19.) However, they offer no evidence to support this contention beyond unsubstantiated speculation and subjective belief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3531224\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/500/962/#p966\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Garbers allege that on June 29, 2016, the hoverboard spontaneously self-ignited and started a fire that caused extensive damage to their home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 4,7; Dkt. 43 at 1.) The parties do not dispute that the hoverboard was defective in design, that it self-ignited, or that it damaged the Garbers' home. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Amazon's 2015 Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Amazon had a product safety team whose job responsibilities included monitoring the media and other sources for dangerous products. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 11.) In the second half of November 2015, Amazon's\n   product safety team began a \"deep dive\" investigation into the safety of hoverboards following media coverage of hoverboard fires. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; Dkt. 43-5 at 118:7-20.) As a result of its investigation, Amazon was concerned that the reports of hoverboard fires and explosions \"might be indicative of a safety issue of [hoverboards] across Chinese manufacturing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13; Dkt. 43-12.) Amazon was concerned that the entire hoverboard product category was \"bad\" and that product safety issues were \"spread across so many manufacturers, so many brands, [and] so many different components.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14; Dkt. 43-5 at 135:21-136:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As of December 10, 2015, Amazon believed that a \"significant number\" of the 245,000 hoverboards purchased through its marketplace in the preceding days were purchased as holiday gifts and were thus not in use yet, but would be soon. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Dkt. 43-5 at 242:10-245:15.) Amazon expected to see more fire, smoke, and overheating-related complaints from hoverboards in the coming days. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 43-8 at 310-313.) At a December 10, 2015 meeting, Amazon discussed \"contingency planning\" and ensuring that it was properly staffed and able to monitor any such reports \"coming in after Christmas.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 43-5 at 242:24-243:7.) On December 12, 2015, Amazon posted a warning on its website informing customers who had purchased hoverboards of the fire and explosion hazards associated with them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Amazon maintained the right to require third-party sellers to provide proof of compliance with certain design and performance standards before they could list products for sale on the online marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 \u00b6 9; Dkt. 43-3 at 64:18-65:8.) Beginning sometime in December 2015, Amazon ceased all listings and sales of hoverboards until third-party sellers showed proof of compliance with various safety and performance standards. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 6, 2016, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that certain brands and manufacturers were recalling hoverboards due to potential fire hazards. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17; Dkt. 43-17.) The recall notices listed that the recalled hoverboards were \"sold at ... Amazon.com\" and other retailers. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Garbers argue that Amazon and Shenzhen were \"co-sellers\" of the hoverboard that damaged their home. Based on their co-seller theory, the Garbers argue that Amazon should be strictly liable for selling the hoverboard in an unreasonably dangerous condition (Count I) and that it failed to exercise due care at the time of sale (Count II). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 11-13). The Garbers' negligence claim is pleaded as one involving the parties' negligence at the time of sale (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6 11), but in opposition to summary judgment, they argue negligence based on a theory of Amazon's post-sale duty to warn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 43 at 9-12, 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Amazon argues that it did not design, manufacture, sell, or touch the hoverboard, but merely provided an online marketplace for third-party sellers like Shenzhen to list and sell their products. Amazon argues that as an online marketplace provider, it cannot be held liable under Illinois law, either under strict liability or negligence, for defective products sold by third parties. Alternatively, Amazon argues that a provision of the Communications Decency Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), bars the Garbers' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

The Garbers allege generally that Amazon\n   \"designed, prepared, manufactured, advertised, marketed, distributed, supplied and/or sold\" the hoverboard. (Dkt. 1-1 \u00b6 4.) But the Garbers made no specific allegations that Amazon manufactured, supplied, or distributed the hoverboard and provided no facts or evidence to support those contentions, so they cannot proceed on those theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That leaves the question of whether Amazon \"sold\" the hoverboard. Amazon argues that in order to survive summary judgment, the Garbers must create a genuine dispute over whether Amazon was a \"seller\" of the hoverboard. The Court finds that the Garbers did not create such a dispute and that Amazon did not sell the defective hoverboard. But, as explained further in Section III.a.ii below, that does not end the Court's strict-liability inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Amazon argues that it is not a seller under Illinois law because Shenzhen, not Amazon, \"did all the acts associated with selling.\" (Dkt. 39-1 at 8.) It is undisputed that Shenzhen sourced the hoverboard from the manufacturer or upstream distributor, owned the hoverboard, developed the content of the product offer, set the price, transferred the title to Annette Garber, and shipped the hoverboard directly to her. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18, 20-21.) It is also undisputed that documents associated with the purchase repeatedly stated that the hoverboard was \"sold by\" and \"fulfilled by\" Libert00 or Shenzhen. (Dkt. 40-1 at 9; Dkt. 40-3 at 6; Dkt. 40 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Garbers, in turn, argue that Amazon and Shenzhen were \"co-sellers\" and point to the undisputed facts that Amazon profited from the sale of the hoverboard through a sales commission, that the BSA included a provision requiring third-party sellers to provide Amazon customers with price and sale terms as favorable as those offered in other sales channels (which the Garbers repeatedly characterize as Amazon exercising \"price control\"), and that the hoverboard was covered by Amazon's A-to-Z Guarantee. (Dkt. 43 at 15-16.) According to the Garbers, Amazon \"dominat[es] all aspects of the sales transactions\" so that a customer believes they are purchasing a product from Amazon, not a third party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Illinois courts have not precisely defined what it means to be a \"seller\" for purposes of strict products liability. Nor does Section 402A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crowe v. Public Bldg.

Under Illinois law, a sale \"consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price.\" 810 ILCS 5/2-106(1). It is undisputed here that the title to the hoverboard passed directly from Shenzhen to Annette Garber. But the Illinois Supreme Court has never limited its inquiry of whether a party is a \"seller\" for strict liability purposes solely to the transfer of title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   , the Illinois Supreme Court briefly addressed the question.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Ill.%20Dec.%20350\">\n    73 Ill.Dec. 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20N.E.2d%20210\">\n    454 N.E.2d at 216-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the defendant was a wholly-owned subsidiary of a British asbestos producer and was incorporated to be a contact point for the British company's North American customers. The defendant argued that it was not a \"seller\" under Section 402A because it never had control over the asbestos and merely served as a broker, facilitating and servicing its British parent company's sales contracts. The Illinois Supreme Court disagreed and found that evidence of the defendant's \"role in marketing the asbestos\" was sufficient for a jury finding of strict liability. The Court pointed to the facts that the defendant \"agreed to sell and deliver\" asbestos to a customer\n   and that the defendant represented to the customer that it was the only entity authorized to offer certain types of asbestos produced by its British parent company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20N.E.2d%20210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Though the Court's analysis of the defendant's role as a \"seller\" and its \"role in marketing\" the defective product is brief, it cites two facts supporting its finding-the direct sales agreement between the customer and the defendant and the defendant's statements about exclusivity-that are not present here. The Garbers have not presented any evidence that Amazon purported to be the exclusive seller of Shenzhen hoverboards or that Amazon had an agreement with the Garbers to sell the hoverboard to them. To the contrary, the facts before the Court reveal that Shenzhen, not Amazon, owned the hoverboard, sourced it and listed it for sale on Amazon's marketplace, and sold and shipped it directly to the Garbers. That is not the sort of relationship the Supreme Court considered when extending strict liability to the defendant as a \"seller\" in\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   . It is true that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   , like Amazon here, earned a commission for sales of the defective product. But the Illinois Supreme Court did not mention the sales commission in its analysis of whether the defendant was a \"seller,\" so this Court does not find that fact to be determinative on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A more recent decision of an Illinois appellate court is also instructive.

The defendant argued that its role in the sale \"was clerical and passive,\" like that of an escrow agent or title service, and that because it was merely a \"paper shuffler\" and \"facilitator\" of the sale, and never possessed the truck, it was not a \"true seller\" and could not be held strictly liable as part of the distributive chain.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=921%20N.E.2d%201222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20Ill.%20Dec.%2084\">\n    337 Ill.Dec. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=921%20N.E.2d%201222\">\n    921 N.E.2d at 1224-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A manufacturer's representative attempted to sell the employer a new mill and the employer declined, indicating that it wanted to buy a particular brand of used mill instead. The\n   representative did not sell that particular brand but learned of such a mill for sale by another party and alerted the employer to the sale.

Amazon is clearly not as far removed from the sale as those kinds of service providers.

It is undisputed that Amazon did not manufacture the hoverboard. (Dkt. 40 \u00b6 14.) It is also undisputed that Amazon did not make any statements or representations about the hoverboard on the product page, nor did it develop and of the product detail page content, nor did it play any role in the packaging or labeling of the hoverboard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) The Garbers have not directed the Court to any evidence that Amazon otherwise played a role in marketing the hoverboard. The Garbers similarly have not pointed to any evidence that Amazon \"distributed\" the hoverboard-indeed, it is undisputed that Libert00 shipped it directly to the Garbers, that Amazon never owned or possessed it, and that title passed directly from Libert00 to Annette Garber. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18.) The second\n   <em>\n    Hebel\n   </em>\n   policy factor-deriving an economic benefit from placing the unsafe product in the stream of commerce-cuts against Amazon. It is undisputed that Amazon earned a sales commission from the sale of the hoverboard. (Dkt. 42 \u00b6 5.) But the Garbers fail on the third factor as well. The facts that Amazon had the right to require third-party sellers to meet certain safety requirements in order to list their products on the marketplace (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 \u00b6 9), and that Amazon stopped allowing third-party sellers to list hoverboards on the marketplace in December 2015 unless they showed proof of compliance with safety standards (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18), do not establish that Amazon \"was in a position to eliminate the unsafe character\" of the product. More than one million third-party sellers offer products on Amazon's\n   marketplace (Dkt. 40 \u00b6 9), and Amazon cannot be expected to judge the quality of every product for sale by third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because the Garbers cannot establish each of the policy factors articulated in\n   <em>\n    Hebel\n   </em>\n   , the Court predicts that the Illinois Supreme Court would not extend strict liability to Amazon as a marketplace provider outside of the distributive chain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joiner v.

The sales representative moved for summary judgment and argued that it was not part of the distributive chain, and thus not subject to strict liability, because it merely acted as a liaison between the \"manufacturer/seller\" and the buyer. The Illinois appellate court rejected this argument and held that the sales representative, regardless of its role within the distributive chain, was strictly liable because it was bound by an exclusive sales contract with the manufacturer to promote the sale of the manufacturer's products and because it derived an economic benefit from the relationship through commissions from the manufacturer's sales made in its territory.

They rely on\n   <em>\n    Jablonski\n   </em>\n   , which recognizes such a duty in situations where \"a design defect is present at the time of sale.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20Ill.%20Dec.%20327\">\n    353 Ill.Dec. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n    955 N.E.2d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In those cases, a \"\n   <em>\n    manufacturer\n   </em>\n   has a duty to a take reasonable steps to warn at least the purchaser of the risk as soon as the manufacturer learns or should have learned of the risk created by its fault.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added.) \"Nevertheless, a manufacturer is under no duty to issue postsale warnings or to retrofit its products to remedy defects first discovered after a product has left its control.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   First, the duty to warn recognized in\n   <em>\n    Jablonski\n   </em>\n   is clearly limited to manufacturers. The Garbers do not acknowledge this limitation or otherwise try to argue why the duty to warn should extend to Amazon, who did not manufacture the hoverboard. Second, even if a continuing duty did extend to Amazon, the Garbers present no evidence to support their contention that the design defect was present at the time of sale or any evidence about when the Amazon discovered the defect. It is undisputed that the hoverboard was defective (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 42 \u00b6 21), but the Garbers have presented no evidence beyond that to support a continuing duty to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Garbers also argue that Amazon voluntarily undertook a duty to warn. \"Under a voluntary undertaking theory of liability, the duty of care to be imposed upon a defendant is limited to the extent of the undertaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Jablonski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20Ill.%20Dec.%20327\">\n    353 Ill.Dec. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n    955 N.E.2d at 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The theory is narrowly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the Garbers, \"Amazon voluntarily undertook the responsibility to warn its customers including the Garbers about what it knew and the results of its investigation and specifically the risks of fire and explosion of the hoverboards,\" and failed to do so reasonably. (Dkt. 43 at 19.) The Garbers do not actually cite a single fact in the record to support this assertion and do not otherwise offer any evidence that Amazon voluntarily undertook a duty to warn them or other customers, or that Amazon did so unreasonably. Conclusory claims without evidentiary support cannot create a triable issue of fact. The Garbers have not established that Amazon owed them a duty, which is a necessary element of their negligence claim. Amazon is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because Amazon is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Garbers' claims, the Court need not reach the immunity provision in the Communications Decency Act. For the reasons stated here, Amazon's motion for summary judgment [Dkt. 39] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 402A (1965), provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n    (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    court also found that \"it appear[ed]\" that the defendant would be strictly liable under a plain reading of Section 402A, because it was undisputed that the defendant sold the truck to the plaintiff's employer and that it reached the employer \"without a substantial change in the condition in which it was sold.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20N.E.2d%201138\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20Ill.%20Dec.%2084\">\n     337 Ill.Dec. 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=921%20N.E.2d%201222\">\n     921 N.E.2d at 1228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
