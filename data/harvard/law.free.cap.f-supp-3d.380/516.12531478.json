Following this amendment, \"[c]ourts have not settled on a clear standard for determining bad faith\" in the Section 1446(c)(1) context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several district courts in the Fifth Circuit have equated the Section 1446(c)(1) bad faith standard with the Fifth Circuit's equitable tolling standard recognized in\n   <em>\n    Tedford.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other courts that have considered the issue have likewise focused on whether a plaintiff's conduct demonstrates manipulation of the removal rules in order to prevent a defendant's removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, the burden of showing that plaintiffs acted in bad faith to prevent removal lies with the removing defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that James River was precluded from removing this case because James River failed to remove the action within a year of the commencement of these proceedings in state court or within 30 days of the dismissal of the non-diverse defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, James River argues that it removed the case within 30 days of receipt of notice that the non-diverse defendant was dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   James River further argues that Plaintiff's failure to serve or notify James River of the dismissal of the non-diverse defendant amounts to bad faith under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) and should prevent remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, James River asserts that equitable considerations justify tolling the one-year removal limitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 1446(b)(1) permits removal \"30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties do not dispute that this case was not initially removable because Plaintiff initially brought claims against Trinidad, a non-diverse defendant. Pursuant to Section 1446(b)(3), \"if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,\" a defendant can also remove \"within 30 days after receipt...of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit recently addressed this standard in the context\n   of a federal officer removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, the defendants first learned that the case was removable under the federal officer removal statute during a deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court held that the 30-day clock began to run on the date of the relevant deposition testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Fifth Circuit reversed this determination, holding that \" Section 1446(b)(3)'s removal clock begins ticking upon receipt of the deposition transcript\" because the deposition transcript is \"other paper\" under Section 1446(b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In this case, the state trial court issued an order dismissing Plaintiff's claims against the non-diverse defendant on June 6, 2013. Pursuant to Section 1446(b)(3), James River had 30 days after receipt of as a copy of the Order dismissing the non-diverse defendant to remove the case. However, James River asserts that it never received a copy of the June 6, 2019 Order, and that it was not aware of the dismissal until November 19, 2018, when its counsel noticed the dismissal while checking the state court record online.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, even assuming that James River removed the case within 30 days of notice of the dismissal, James River removed the case almost 13 months after it was filed in state court. Considering that James River removed the case more than one year after the action commenced in state court, James River must show that Plaintiff acted in bad faith to prevent removal\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that equitable considerations justify tolling of the removal period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In support of its assertion that Plaintiff acted in bad faith to prevent removal, James River argues that under Louisiana law all pleadings must be served on all counsel of record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, James River argues that Plaintiff was not relieved of his obligation to notify James River of the motion simply because Plaintiff's counsel did not prepare the motion, as it is clear from the filing that the motion was made on behalf of Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, James River presents no evidence that Plaintiff acted in bad faith. Instead, James River argues that Plaintiff failed to inform James River that the non-diverse defendant was dismissed from the case. Even assuming that James River was not served with notice that the non-diverse defendant was dismissed from the case, the Order dismissing the non-diverse defendant was filed in the state court record. James River admits that its counsel discovered that the non-diverse defendant was dismissed while reviewing the electronic record. Furthermore, Plaintiff has presented evidence showing that the motion to dismiss was filed by the non-diverse defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it appears reasonable that Plaintiff's counsel assumed that the attorney\n   who prepared the motion and submitted it to the state court also served the motion on the other parties as required by Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure article 1313. Therefore, the Court finds that James River failed to meet its burden of establishing that Plaintiff acted in bad faith in order to prevent James River from removing the action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   James River also has not shown that Plaintiff engaged in forum manipulation to justify equitable tolling of the one-year period. James River does not argue that Plaintiff's claims against the non-diverse defendant was brought for the sole purpose of preventing removal. Plaintiff ultimately settled those claims, and the non-diverse defendant was dismissed from the lawsuit. James River then waited over six months to remove the case to this Court. Although it is unclear from the record whether James River ever received actual notice of the dismissal, the Order of Dismissal was filed into the record and readily accessible to counsel for James River. It is clear that this is not a case where Plaintiff sought to manipulate the rules to prevent removal. Therefore, James River has not shown that equitable tolling is warranted here because it has not established that Plaintiff attempted to \"manipulate the statutory rules for federal removal jurisdiction, thereby preventing [James River] from exercising its rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the removal of this case was untimely in that the case was removed more than one year after the case was filed in state court. Moreover, James River has not met its burden of showing Plaintiff acted in bad faith to prevent removal. Furthermore, James River has not shown that equitable tolling is warranted. Therefore, this case does not fall into an exception allowing removal more than a year after the suit was filed in state court. Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's \"Motion to Remand\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and this matter is remanded to the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Rec.
