Israel in his individual capacity (\"Israel\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Dkt. No. 1).)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14.) Before the Court is Defendants' Motion To Dismiss (the \"Motion\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Not. of Mot. (\"Defs.'

(Compl. \u00b6 2.) On October 27, 2015, Plaintiff began working at Westchester Medical Center (\"WMC\"), which is operated by Defendant WCHCC, as a compliance coordinator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's duties included compliance oversight for three \"Bon Secours\" acute care hospitals, three nursing homes, and one assisted living facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) In December 2016, Plaintiff received a performance\n   review, which concluded that her performance \"meets expectations,\" and described Plaintiff as \"a pleasure to work with and ... a very vital member of [the] team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the evening of June 19, 2017, while at home, Plaintiff logged onto Facebook on her personal computer and saw a weather report on a local news organization's Facebook page that discussed a \"funnel cloud\" projected to affect the village of Kiryas Joel, \"a predominantly Hasidic community in Orange County.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the public comment section of the weather report, Plaintiff wrote, \"[t]oo bad it didn't suck them all away!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13; Compl. Ex. 1 (\"Facebook Post\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, Kim Herkeler (\"Herkeler\"), a human resources manager, informed Plaintiff that Defendant Israel had decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment because of \"an anti-Semitic online post,\" noting that \"someone had called the Hospital to complain about Plaintiff's Facebook comment.\" (Compl. \u00b6 14.) Plaintiff contacted Valerie Campbell (\"Campbell\"), regional senior director of compliance for WMC, who told Plaintiff \"that she was fired over the Facebook post and not her job performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff asserts that her message was \"not intend[ed] to convey an anti-Semitic message ... [or] to offend anyone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Plaintiff states that she has been unable to find comparable employment since her termination, and has \"endured emotional pain and suffering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff contends that her Facebook post was protected by the First Amendment because, as \"off-duty speech,\" it \"could not reasonably have been interpreted as disrupting the workplace.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff also asserts that as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and President of WMC, Israel \"is a municipal policymaker on personnel-related matters,\" and that his actions are therefore attributable to WCHCC \"for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement to her position of employment \"or to a comparable position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed her Complaint on February 14, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) On March 14, 2018, Defendants filed a letter requesting a pre-motion conference in anticipation of filing a motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 11.) The Court held a pre-motion conference on May 3, 2018, at which the Court set a briefing schedule for Defendants' Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. (minute entry for May 3, 2019); Motion Scheduling Order (Dkt. No. 15).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants filed the instant Motion To Dismiss and accompanying papers on June 15, 2018.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Mot. To Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") (Dkt. No. 21).) On August 17, 2018, Defendants filed a reply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Defendants' Motion To Dismiss Plaintiff's claim against WCHCC is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3. Qualified Immunity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants argue that even if Plaintiff successfully stated a First\n   Amendment retaliation claim, Israel is entitled to qualified immunity. (Defs. Mem. 16-17.) Defendants fail to meaningfully apply the qualified immunity analysis to the facts of this case, and cite no case in support of their conclusory assertion that \"Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that Mr. Israel violated a clearly established statutory or constitutional right.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In light of the Second Circuit's statement in\n   <em>\n    Locurto\n   </em>\n   that it is \"sensible\" to \"treat off-duty, non-work-related speech as presumptively entitled to First Amendment protection regardless of whether, as a threshold matter, it may be characterized as speech on a matter of public concern,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5857566\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/159/#p175\">\n    447 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the fact that Defendants fail to meaningfully engage with the analysis, the Court denies Defendants' Motion To Dismiss claims against Israel in his individual capacity based on qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Motion To Dismiss is denied. The Court will hold a conference on April 10, 2019 at 2:30 p.m. to discuss the status of the case.
