ECF No. 3. On October 24, 2018, Diaz-Martinez filed his Motion (ECF No. 18). The parties briefed the Motion, and, on November 27, 2018, the Court received evidence and heard oral argument on it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 27 Hr'g Tr. (hereinafter \"Hr'g Tr.\") (ECF No. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the conclusion of the November 27 hearing, the Court ordered supplemental briefing on several issues that arose at the hearing.

At some point in or around August 1996 (when he was 16-years-old), Diaz-Martinez entered the United States illegally. ECF No. 19 at 1. He encountered U.S. Border Patrol on or around August 17, 1996 and was assigned an alien file number ending in \"669.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Hr'g Tr. at 55 (ECF No. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the November 27 evidentiary hearing, Diaz-Martinez's uncle, Santos Lemus (\"Lemus\") testified that, following Diaz-Martinez's encounter with immigration officials in August 1996, he (Lemus) received a phone call informing him of his nephew's situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 9, 36.

Among other things, the paperwork that Lemus received from immigration officials required Lemus to take Diaz-Martinez to all immigration court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ECF No. 19 at 1-2; Gov't Ex. 1. Further, this Show Cause Order informed Diaz-Martinez that if he were ordered removed, he would have certain administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 19 at 2; Gov't Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 5, 1996, Diaz-Martinez received an \"Order of Release on Recognizance\" and was released to the custody of his uncle, Lemus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 18 at 2; ECF No. 19 at 2; Gov't Ex. 2. The form was in English, but Diaz-Martinez signed the portion of the form indicating that it had been explained to him in Spanish. Gov't Ex. 2. Neither the Show Cause Order nor the Order of Release on Recognizance informed Diaz-Martinez of when his immigration hearing would be held. ECF No. 18 at 2. After this paperwork was sorted out, Diaz-Martinez went to live with Lemus at the Heritage Park apartment. Hr'g Tr. at 8-10, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 18, 1997, a \"Notice to Appear\" (\"NTA\") was allegedly mailed by immigration officials to Diaz-Martinez at the Heritage Park address.

The NTA was sent by regular mail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The NTA did not set a date and time for Diaz-Martinez's immigration hearing; rather, it stated that the hearing would be at a date and time \"to be set.\" ECF No. 18 at 2; ECF No. 19 at 2; Hr'g Tr. at 64; Gov't Ex. 3. Then, on July 11, 1997, the immigration court allegedly mailed a \"Notice of Hearing\" (\"NOH\") to Diaz-Martinez at the Heritage Park address stating that his immigration hearing would be held on August 13, 1997 at 1:30 p.m. at a specific address in Arlington, Virginia.

ECF No. 18 at 2-3; Gov't Ex. 5. Diaz-Martinez did not testify to this himself, and his evidence on the lack of receipt of these documents comes only from Lemus' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lemus testified that he and Diaz-Martinez lived at the Heritage Park address for all of 1997 and that he (Lemus) never received any mail at that address (addressed either to Diaz-Martinez or addressed to Lemus) informing Diaz-Martinez of his immigration court proceedings. Hr'g Tr. at 28-29, 33, 42, 44-45. Lemus further testified that he was the only person who had a key to his mailbox,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that Diaz-Martinez never checked the mail for him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, he testified that, on several occasions, the mail carrier put mail in the wrong mailbox, causing Lemus to miss paperwork from his car insurer on about five occasions, Christmas cards from his employer on about seven occasions, and his legal permanent residence card.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 30-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Diaz-Martinez asserts that he did not receive this document either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Then, on October 31, 1997, immigration officials mailed (by certified mail) to Diaz-Martinez at Heritage Park a Form I-166 informing him that: (1) he had been found deportable; (2) there was no relief available to him;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) his deportation would be\n   enforced; and (4) he was to turn himself in on December 4, 1997 for deportation.

Alternatively, he argues that he is excused from Section 1326(d)(1) and (d)(2) because he was affirmatively misadvised of the remedies available to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44 at 20 (summarizing Diaz-Martinez's position).

The Court sought the parties' views on whether Diaz-Martinez could demonstrate that he had overcome the presumption of mail delivery and prove (some 20 years later) that he did not receive notice of his immigration hearing. The parties briefing analyzed cases such as the ones above dealing with motions to reopen. Given the apparent paucity of authority\n   on how, in a Section 1326 prosecution, a court is to assess a claim of non-receipt, the Court finds it prudent to follow the general mailbox rule and the mail presumption in motion to reopen cases, set out above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Application To The Evidence In This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Applying the foregoing framework to the evidence presented in this case, Diaz-Martinez has satisfied his burden to demonstrate that he never received notice of his 1997 immigration hearing. The Court notes that this is a close case, and is based only on the evidence that the Court has before it in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To begin, it is important that the Government did not introduce testimony of the sort that usually animates the presumption. However, the Government introduced both the NTA and the NOH (Gov't Exs. 3 and 4) that were properly addressed to the Heritage Park address. There is no dispute that, at all relevant times during 1997 (when these notices were allegedly mailed), Diaz-Martinez lived with Lemus at the Heritage Park address in Fredericksburg.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hr'g Tr. 28-29; Gov't Ex. 6 (certified mail receipt from October 1997 signed for by Diaz-Martinez at the Heritage Park address). Both the NTA and the NOH have \"certificates of service\" indicating that they were served by regular mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 3 (signed by Immigration Officer William Jones); Gov't Ex. 4 (indicating service by mail but the signature is illegible).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   And, the Government's witness, Deportation Officer Richard Tine, testified about his general knowledge of how notices (like the NTA and NOH) are served. Hr'g Tr. at 62-68. He first testified to the address that an NTA would be sent to,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64, and then (after a question by the Court about whether the certificate of service indicated that the NOH was served \"in the usual course of things\"), he testified that the certificate of service on the Notice of Hearing \"indicated...it was mailed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67-68. Tine did not testify about the process by which immigration notices were put into envelopes and actually sent in the mail. Nor did he have personal knowledge of the procedures in place in 1997 because he testified that he has been an deportation officer for \"[e]ight and a half years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. On cross-examination, Tine also testified that, in other alien files from around the time of Diaz-Martinez's deportation, he had \"seen...copies of the mail that was sent, and it remains in that alien file.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114. No such evidence was contained in Diaz-Martinez's file. The Government did not present evidence from immigration officials who were working at the time of Diaz-Martinez's removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While the evidence that the Government mailed the NOA or NOH to Diaz-Martinez is weak, the Court concludes that it is sufficient to raise the presumption of proper delivery and thus receipt by Diaz-Martinez. The following evidence suffices to raise the presumption here: (1) that the correct address for Diaz-Martinez was listed on the NTA and NOH; (2) that the NTA and NOH contained certificates of service indicating service by \"regular mail\"; and (3) that Officer Tine provided general testimony about the process of serving notices. That is sufficient where, as here, the issue rears its head some twenty-years after the fact. Accordingly, Diaz-Martinez must put forward evidence that he did not receive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   So the next issue is whether Diaz-Martinez has rebutted the presumption that a regular mail letter is presumed to be delivered and received. Diaz-Martinez's evidence on this point comes from Lemus. Although the best evidence that Diaz-Martinez did not receive notice of his removal hearings is testimony or an affidavit from Diaz-Martinez that he did not receive notice, the evidence in this case is nonetheless sufficient to overcome the presumption of delivery and receipt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In 1997, Diaz-Martinez was a minor and Lemus was responsible for taking him to his immigration proceedings. Hr'g Tr. at 8, 27-28, 33. Lemus testified that he never received any mail for Diaz-Martinez, either addressed to Diaz-Martinez or addressed to Lemus, informing Diaz-Martinez of his immigration court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29, 33, 42, 44-45. Lemus explained how the mail was delivered to Heritage Park: all the mail for the entire apartment complex was delivered to a bank of about 100 mailboxes located at the building entrance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30. The mail carrier would open the front panel of the mail box and put mail into the box for individual apartments, like T2, where Diaz-Martinez and Lemus lived.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Lemus testified to issues he had receiving mail on several occasions due to mistakes by the mail carrier in putting mail in the wrong apartment's mailbox.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-33. Specifically, Lemus failed to receive Christmas cards on about seven occasions, car insurance paperwork on about five occasions, and Lemus' own legal permanent residence card.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lemus also testified that he (Lemus) was the only person who had a key to his mailbox,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31, and he never gave the mailbox key to anyone else (including Diaz-Martinez) to check the mail for him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 40. Indeed, Diaz-Martinez and Lemus were the only ones living at the Heritage Park address during the period in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In sum, Lemus' testimony establishes that, if he (Lemus) did not receive the notices, no one else would have because no one else had the ability to check the mail for the apartment in which he and Diaz-Martinez lived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, Lemus testified that he was unaware that Diaz-Martinez had received certified mail informing him that he had been deported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   There is, of course, evidence on the other side. Lemus did receive paperwork in the mail at the Heritage Park address from immigration officials in 1996 when he took responsibility for Diaz-Martinez. Hr'g Tr. at 9, 13, 27-28, 37. And, Lemus had trouble recalling some details about his time at Heritage Park and when he last\n   saw his nephew.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9-10, 29, 31-32, 35, 43-44. Lemus also did not reach out to immigration officials to inquire about the status of his nephew's proceedings. However, on the evidence before the Court, the Court concludes that Diaz-Martinez has put forward enough evidence to rebut the presumption of delivery and receipt of notices of his immigration hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Weighing all the evidence in the record, including the testimony given by Lemus, the Court concludes that Diaz-Martinez did not receive notice of his 1997 immigration hearing. Lemus presented as a credible, law-abiding witness. He entered the United States on a work permit, and testified that he has always maintained legal status (he became a legal permanent resident in 2002). Hr'g Tr. at 4-6. He has been a church pastor, has worked other jobs, and has no criminal convictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because Diaz-Martinez was a minor, Lemus was his custodial officer and testified that he would have brought Diaz-Martinez to immigration proceedings had he received notice of when to appear. He testified unequivocally that he did not receive any such notice. And, he was the only one who would have because he had the mailbox key.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is of some concern that Diaz-Martinez did not offer testimony denying receipt of the NTA and the NOH. In many, if not most, cases, the absence of testimony from the defendant on this point would be fatal to a motion of the sort made by Diaz-Martinez. As discussed previously, several decisions teach that sworn evidence from the defendant can overcome the presumption. However, none of those decisions held that testimony from the defendant was necessary to overcome the presumption. On this record, there is independent evidence that supports Diaz-Martinez's position. And, taking the testimony of Lemus in perspective of the weak evidence presented by the Government to prove that the NTA and NOH were actually mailed, the Court concludes that Diaz-Martinez did not have notice of his removal hearing in 1997. It is now necessary to determine the effect of that finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Diaz Martinez Can Satisfy Section 1326(d) (1), (d) (2) And Show A Due Process Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   , Diaz-Martinez argues that failure to receive the NTA and the NOH (notice of the removal hearing) excuses him from exhausting administrative remedies and demonstrating a deprivation of judicial review, thereby satisfying Section 1326(d) (1) and (d) (2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    434 F.3d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, he argues that the same evidence and its attendant finding establishes a due process violation, which satisfies the first part of Section 1326(d) (3), the \"fundamental unfairness\" prong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As the Government points out, the factual backgrounds of\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   and this case are different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47 at 10-11. El Shami testified that he never received notice and the Government conceded that there was no evidence in the record that immigration officials sent him notice as required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    434 F.3d at 663-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   clearly showed that notice of removal was not provided, whereas here the Government contests that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While there is not uncontradicted evidence in the record that immigration officials failed to send Diaz-Martinez notice of his hearing, Diaz-Martinez has presented enough evidence for the Court to conclude\n   that\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   applies to this case. It is true that the addresses on the NTA and NOH were correct and there was a certificate of service indicating service by regular mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramos-Delcid\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:18-cr-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205833081\">\n    2018 WL 5833081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *6-7 (W.D.

It is also true, however, that the Court has before it weak evidence that the NTA or NOH were actually mailed by immigration officials. That is, there is no testimony from anyone with personal knowledge at the relevant time tending to show how, in the normal course of business, regular mail notices were mailed in 1997. And, the Court has credible testimony from Diaz-Martinez's custodian that the notices were never received. Further, the Court has evidence that, had the notices been received, Lemus would have brought Diaz-Martinez to his immigration hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Accordingly, on the record in this case, the rule in\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   applies. Because Diaz-Martinez did not have notice of his removal hearing, he did not appear and was thus not properly advised of his rights to administrative and judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    434 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Diaz-Martinez is excused from compliance with Section 1326(d) (1) and (d) (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court also concludes that, by showing that he did not have notice of his removal hearing, Diaz-Martinez has established a due process violation. As\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   held: \"due process requires an alien who faces [removal] be provided (1) notice of the charges against him, (2) a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal, and (3) a fair opportunity to be heard.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    434 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, Diaz-Martinez's assertion that he would have applied for voluntary departure comes through his brief, not through any evidence in the record. Diaz-Martinez did not testify or put forward an affidavit that he would have applied for voluntary departure (nor did Lemus mention this in his testimony). In a Section 1326 prosecution, it is the alien's burden to demonstrate that he satisfies all three requirements of Section 1326(d). The Court cannot rely on the argument of counsel rather than evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, there is evidence in the record that Diaz-Martinez did not have a felony on his record, Hr'g Tr. at 118, that his uncle lived in the United States (Lemus), and that he had not had prior encounters with immigration officials. However, the record is also clear that Diaz-Martinez had been in the United States for less than one year and the Court has no evidence of other family Diaz-Martinez had in the United States (other than Lemus).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The fact that Diaz-Martinez had been in the United States for a short period of time and that there were minimal family ties (on the record before the Court) would have cut against an immigration judge granting voluntary departure.

While the parties agree that this fact would not have prevented Diaz-Martinez from receiving voluntary departure, the Court has no evidence that Diaz-Martinez would have been willing and able to voluntarily depart. Though the BIA has said that the alien need not establish that he has \"the financial means to depart the United States\" to qualify for pre-conclusion voluntary departure,\n   <em>\n    In re Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N.

Jurisdiction Of The Immigration Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Diaz-Martinez's second argument is that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to hear his case in 1997; and therefore, that the removal order was invalid.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18 at 12-19; ECF No. 20 at 1-8. The argument proceeds as follows: (1) the immigration court is vested with jurisdiction by the filing of a charging document; (2) one such charging document is an NTA; (3) in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

R. Civ. P. 83(a) (1), but which in no way affect the federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the best reading of section 1003.14 (a) is that although it imposes a procedural requirement on immigration authorities' initiation of removal proceedings, that requirement is not \"jurisdictional\" in the formal sense, and a defect in a notice to appear does not necessarily render a resulting deportation order void ab initio.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   , 355 F.Supp.3d at 439.
