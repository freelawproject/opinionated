Maloney, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Wells Fargo foreclosed the mortgage on Plaintiff Melissa Hebeler's property. By statute, if the property sold at a foreclosure sale was used for agricultural purposes, the redemption period is one year. Hebeler asserts that because she sold some agricultural products that she grew on her property, she is entitled to the one-year redemption period. This is an issue of first impression. The statute provides no guidance for determining when property is used for agricultural purposes and no court appears to have considered the question. Based on the statutory scheme and the evidence in the record, the Court has no difficulty concluding that Hebeler's property was not used for agricultural purposes, as that phrase is used in Michigan's foreclosure-by-advertisement statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Melissa Hebeler filed a motion for partial summary judgment.

Orlans Associates, on behalf of Defendant, sent Hebeler a letter informing her that her mortgage loan was in default. (ECF No. 24-14.) The original mortgage amount was $ 187,200.00 and Hebeler owed almost $ 223,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.310-11.) Orlans Associates then began publishing weekly notices of the default and the foreclosure sale in the local paper. (ECF No. 1-1 PageID.12.) Orlans Associates also posted a notice of the default and foreclosure sale on some conspicuous place on Hebeler's property. (ECF Nos. 1-1 Posted Notice PageID.11.) Hebeler, however, never saw the posted notice. (ECF No. 21-21 Hebeler Dep. at 28 PageID.156.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hebeler's property was sold at a foreclosure sale on July 5, 2017.

In her prayer for relief, she requests a declaration that the foreclosure sale was void.

The record also establishes that the weekly adjournments of the foreclosure sale were properly posted. The sole evidence in the record weighing in Hebeler's favor is her assertion that she did not see the posted notice. But, her assertion does not undermine the evidence submitted by Wells Fargo that the notice was so posted. Both statements could be true. The notice was posted and Hebeler did not see the notice.

In a letter dated December 29, 2016, the specialist acknowledged receipt of documents supporting Hebeler's request for mortgage assistance. (ECF No. 21-23.) In this letter, the specialist stated that \"[i]f your loan has been referred to foreclosure and you have submitted all required documentation, we will not conduct a foreclosure sale on this loan while your documents\n   are being reviewed and if allowed by state law and/or investor guidelines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.169.)

As required by the statute, a presumption arises that the foreclosed property was not used for agricultural purposes and Hebeler must produce evidence to rebut the presumption. Notably, the filing of a schedule F does not resolve the issue. Even if Hebeler had filed a schedule F in 2015, Defendant could have challenged the presumption that the property was used for agricultural purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Three factors weigh against concluding that the property was used for agricultural purposes. None are dispositive. First, the record contains evidence that Hebeler used the property for residential purposes. At her deposition, Hebeler conceded that she has lived at this address since 1998. (ECF No. 21-21 Hebeler Dep. at 6 PageID.153.) In the first paragraph of the complaint, Hebeler states that she is \"the owner of, and is a resident of,\" the disputed parcel of property. (ECF No. 1-1 Compl. \u00b6 1 PageID.4.) In the affidavit she filed with the Clinton County Register of Deeds concerning her 2016 schedule F, Hebeler states that she \"resides\" on the disputed parcel. (PageID.22.) Hebeler's 2015 federal tax return (PageID.30) and her 2016 federal tax return (PageID.301) both list the disputed property has her home address. And, all of the correspondence from Defendant to Hebeler was sent to the same address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the record contains no evidence that agricultural use was a consideration by either party when the mortgage was issued. Hebeler has not demonstrated that the loan was for the purpose of acquiring agricultural land. Hebeler has not demonstrated that the mortgagee considered agricultural uses when valuing the land. The record contains no evidence about how the land was zoned when the mortgage was granted. And, without such evidence, one party should not be able to assert agricultural use as a consideration when the mortgage is foreclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, the evidence in the record demonstrates that value of Hebeler's economic enterprise is de minimis when compared to the value of the mortgaged property. There is evidence in the record that Hebeler has sold agricultural products. Hebeler testified that she has been growing produce for sale since 1999. (ECF No. 21-21 Hebeler Dep. at 75 PageID.165.) In 2015, 2016, and 2017, Hebeler sold some trees, shrubs and vegetables that she grew on her property. Hebeler has also sought to establish herself as a seller of agricultural products. In 2017, Hebeler sought a business license and permit to sell products and a farmer's market. In June 2017, Hebeler applied to sell agricultural products at the Village Farmer's Market in Traverse City. (ECF No. 1-1 PageID.27.) In September 2017, Hebeler submitted articles of incorporation to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs for \"Maple Flow Farm, LLC.\" (ECF No. 24-12 PageID.305.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The only evidence in the record about the agricultural enterprise prior to the foreclosure proceedings shows that Hebeler\n   claimed approximately $ 700 in income from the sale of trees and shrubs. (ECF No. 1-1 2015 Federal Income Tax PageID.30-33; ECF No. 1-1 Income Statement PageID.34.) Her agricultural enterprise expanded very modestly in 2016 and she declared a gross income of $ 3,349 on her schedule F. The initial loan on the property was for $ 187,000 and she owed more than $ 220,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   When deciding which redemption period applies, the Court must keep in mind that property can be used for multiple purposes, and sometime those uses will occur at the same time. Contrary to the Hebeler's proposed interpretation, Subsection (11) cannot be read in isolation. The Court must also consider the presumptions and burden identified in subsection (16) and the other categories of property usage set forth in subsection (7) through (10). For the purpose of a foreclosure sale redemption period, selling (after the commencement of foreclosure) a few thousand dollars of trees and vegetables grown in a backyard does not transform a primary residence into property used for agricultural purposes within the meaning of the statute. The property's value and the mortgage loan have only a de minimis relationship to the expenses and income associated with Hebeler's agricultural enterprise. When read in context, subsection (11) does not indicate that the one-year redemption period applies when property is used for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   agricultural purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court has also considered the purpose of the subsection (11). Agricultural products, typically crops, take time to grow before they can be harvested and sold. The time from soil preparation, to planting, to harvesting can exceed six months. The income stream from land used for agriculture might not be realized before a six month redemption period expires. Accordingly, the Legislature opted to increase the redemption period for foreclosures on land used for agricultural purposes. Nothing in the statute suggests the Legislature intended the same protections for individuals who grow vegetables in their yard and sell them on the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To be clear, the Court resolves the redemption period dispute as an issue of statutory interpretation, a legal issue. The parties do not disagree about the facts; there are no genuine disputes. The parties disagree how those facts fit within the statutory scheme. And, because of how the Court has interpreted the statute, the facts establish that the foreclosed property was residential and the redemption period is six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, on the redemption period issue, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment and the Court will deny Hebeler's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As an issue of first impression, the Court finds that selling produce grown in the yard of your residence does not entitle the foreclosed property owner to the one-year redemption period afforded to foreclosures of property used for agricultural purposes. In context of the foreclosure-by-advertisement statute, the agricultural enterprise must have more than a de minimis relationship to the mortgage and to the value of the property. Accordingly, Hebeler had six months, not one year, to redeem her property after the foreclosure sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons provided in the accompanying Opinion, Defendant Wells Fargo's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 23) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiff Melissa Hebeler's motion for partial summary judgment (ECF No. 19) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The\n   claims in the complaint are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In her brief in support, Hebeler limits her motion to the issue of the proper redemption period, although she explains that the complaint also asserts that the foreclosure sale is void because of the lack of notice. (ECF No. 21 at 13 PageID.107.) Defendant did move for summary judgment on the issue of the required notice. Although Hebeler discusses the notices in her response, she does not address the statute or cite any legal authority for her claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Inferring from the documents in the record, Hebeler likely sent a profit and loss statement for \"Hebeler Farms / Services,\" which she described as a business for \"produce, trees, shrubs, decorative items, jewelry.\" (ECF No. 21-18 PageID.147.) The specialist asked Hebeler to submit forms that distinguished between the produce and trees business and the decorative items and jewelry business. Hebeler communicated with the specialist to explain why she (Hebeler) could not provide a profit and loss statement for her tree and produce business. (ECF No. 21-24.) The specialist also asked for additional information about Hebeler's decorative items and jewelry business. Hebeler apparently sent multiple profit and loss statements, so the specialist also asked Hebeler to explain and reconcile the inconsistencies between the multiple statements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    In her brief in support, Hebeler states that she is not seeking summary judgment on the claim. \"Whether the sale is void because of bad faith is not an issue which the Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on at this time.\" (ECF No. 21 at 13 PageID.107.) Defendant did seek summary judgment on any claim arising from the bad faith allegations. In her response, Hebeler again asserts her allegations of bad faith, but does not identify any legal authority that identifies a cause of action based on those claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The full provision reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    (8) Subject to subsections (9) to (11) and section 3238, for a mortgage executed on or after January 1, 1965, of residential property not exceeding 4 units, if the amount claimed to be due on the mortgage at the date of the notice of foreclosure is more than 66-2/3% of the original indebtedness secured by the mortgage, the redemption period is six months.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20600.3240\">\n     Mich.
