PAUL OETKEN, United States District Judge\n   In these five related cases, one of which is a putative derivative and class action, a collective total of over 500 offshore investors (\"Plaintiffs\") who acquired shares in the Lifetrade Fund, B.V. (\"Lifetrade\") and two related funds (collectively, the \"Lifetrade Funds\") seek relief for the evaporation of their investments. According to Plaintiffs, Defendant Roy G. Smith, Lifetrade's founder and chief executive officer (\"CEO\"); Defendant John Marcum, Lifetrade's chief marketing officer; and Defendant S &amp; P Global, Inc. (\"S &amp; P\"), a ratings agency, successfully courted investment in the Lifetrade Funds notwithstanding the fact that Lifetrade was secretly funneling investor cash into other Smith- and Marcum-linked enterprises such as Defendant Portsmouth Settlement Company I, LLC (\"Portsmouth\"). When this loose spending left Lifetrade cash-strapped, Plaintiffs allege, Lifetrade entered into a credit deal with a predecessor to Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\"), which ultimately ended in the transfer of all of Lifetrade's assets to a Wells Fargo subsidiary for far less than they were worth-and without Plaintiffs seeing a dime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Understandably miffed, Plaintiffs filed these suits against nineteen defendants-including Smith, Marcum, Portsmouth, S\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   &amp; P, and several Wells Fargo entities-alleging misrepresentation, fraudulent conveyance, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1968, and other assorted malfeasance. Portsmouth, Smith, Marcum, S &amp; P, and the Wells Fargo entities now move to dismiss all claims against them. (Dkt. Nos. 86, 88, 91.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) For the reasons that follow, the motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because the operative complaints in these related cases are largely identical, the Court draws its factual recitation from the Second Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Aviles v. S &amp; P Global, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 2987 (Dkt. No. 77 (\"Compl.\") )-along with any documents attached to or incorporated by reference into that complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiFolco v.

For present purposes, the Court assumes the truth of Plaintiffs' allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787826\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/104/#p111\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787826\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/104/#p111\">\n    at 110-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   These cases center on the loss of millions of dollars Plaintiffs invested between 2006 and 2011 in three formally distinct funds alleged to have been \"operated as a single enterprise\" with Defendants Roy G. Smith and John Marcum at the helm. (Compl. \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2 &amp; n.2, 33-34.) The Court first describes the Lifetrade Funds and their efforts to court investment. The Court next explains the alleged undisclosed factors that made investment in the Lifetrade Funds a losing proposition. Finally, the Court turns to the events that led to the transfer of Lifetrade's assets to Defendant ATC Realty Fifteen, Inc. (\"ATC Realty\"), a Wells Fargo subsidiary, and Lifetrade's subsequent efforts to conceal what had taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Lifetrade Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Lifetrade Funds built their business model around a type of transaction known as the \"life settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Eli Martin Lazarus,\n   <em>\n    Viatical and Life Settlement Securitization: Risks and Proposed Regulation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Yale%20L.%20%26%20Pol%27y%20Rev.%20253\">\n    29 Yale L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Ordinarily, a life insurance policyholder pays premiums to an insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to pay specified proceeds to a designated beneficiary after the policyholder's death. Sometimes, though, a policyholder's changing circumstances conspire to make immediate cash in hand more attractive than the promise of a postmortem payout to a chosen beneficiary. (Compl. \u00b6 41.) Such scenarios have created a market for the \"life settlement,\" a transaction in which a third party known as a \"settlement provider\" makes a lump-sum payment to a policyholder,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"life insured\"; takes responsibility thereafter for paying the policy premiums; and, in return, receives the policy proceeds upon the life insured's death. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.) If the value of the proceeds exceeds the amount the settlement provider has paid the life insured, plus the amount the settlement provider has paid in premiums and other administrative and overhead costs, then the settlement provider will turn a profit. (Compl. \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant Lifetrade, the so-called \"master fund\" here, was a Netherlands Antilles mutual fund that invested exclusively in life insurance policies initially issued to United States citizens but later taken up\n   by third-party settlement providers. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40.) The other two Lifetrade Funds, LTrade Plus Ltd. and LTrade Fixed Capital (BVI) Ltd. (together, the \"Feeder Funds\"), were British Virgin Islands funds that invested exclusively in securities issued by Lifetrade. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.) Investment in any of the Lifetrade Funds was by application only and was limited to \"a select group\" of non-United States investors recruited through investment advisors based in Argentina, Japan, and Korea. (Compl. \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Lifetrade Funds Court Investment with S &amp; P's Help\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the first few years after its 2004 launch, Lifetrade was only \"moderately successful\" in raising capital. (Compl. \u00b6 75.) Thus, in 2006, in an effort to boost investment, Defendant Smith, Lifetrade's founder and CEO, retained Defendant S &amp; P, the self-professed \"world's leading provider of credit ratings\" (Compl. \u00b6 77), to provide Lifetrade with investment ratings in exchange for fees that ranged from $2,500 to $100,000 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 72, 75, 96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   S &amp; P obliged. From June 2006 to April 2011, S &amp; P published monthly investor-facing statements out of its New York office that stamped Lifetrade with an investment-grade rating of \"Af\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72, 76), thereby indicating that the fund's \"portfolio holdings provide[d] strong protection against losses from credit defaults\" (Dkt. No. 77-8 at 4). Plaintiffs allege that these statements, which included charts and graphs painting a rosy picture of Lifetrade's past and future performance, \"w[ere] intended to, and did, promote [Lifetrade] as a desirable investment, with limited risk.\" (Compl. \u00b6 73.) And Lifetrade, in turn, was keen to foster that impression. On August 31, 2006, just months after the ratings had begun, Lifetrade represented to investors that S &amp; P's ratings demonstrated Lifetrade's \"certified quality\" (Dkt. No. 77-23 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 80), and that they had been derived from \"an audit of all aspects of [Lifetrade's] operations and ... management, including physical visits and interviews,\" followed by \"qualitative and quantitative analysis\" (Dkt. No. 77-23 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, Plaintiffs maintain, the S &amp; P ratings were \"a tremendous marketing tool\" for the Lifetrade Funds. (Compl. \u00b6 82.) From August 31, 2006, just after S &amp; P began to rate Lifetrade, to December 31, 2007, Lifetrade's assets doubled in value-and by December 31, 2010, they had doubled in value again, allegedly reflecting investors' confidence in S &amp; P's ratings. (Compl. \u00b6 81.) Thanks in part to S &amp; P, then, the Lifetrade Funds ultimately managed to pull in a grand total of $685,835,000 from investors during its lifetime. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 95, 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Undisclosed Bugs in the System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Investors' confidence in the Lifetrade Funds was allegedly misplaced in light of at least three undisclosed considerations. First, the credentials of Lifetrade's leadership were less than sterling. Second, Lifetrade was overpaying for the life insurance policies it purchased. And third, conflicts of interest motivated Lifetrade to put investor money to dubious use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Smith's Tarnished Past\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   From the outset, Plaintiffs allege, investment in Lifetrade was a risky proposition given the spotty track record of the man at the top, Defendant Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On paper, it appeared as though Lifetrade's management rested in capable hands. For example, Lifetrade's June 14, 2006 prospectus reported that Smith had worked as the CEO of a Malaysian investment bank until 2005, at which point the position \"was relinquished ... to allow him to focus full time on developing [Lifetrade].\" (Compl. \u00b6 100.) The prospectus also emphasized Smith's prior experience with \"found[ing] his own fund management group and personally develop[ing] and operat[ing] a currency-trading program\" that managed over $400 million. (Compl. \u00b6 101.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, though, that the prospectus omitted salient aspects of Smith's biography. For example, the prospectus did not mention that Smith had once been temporarily barred from acting as a company director in the United Kingdom, his country of citizenship, due to his earlier, unlawful decision to direct a company while in a state of undischarged bankruptcy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 101.) And the prospectus noted neither that Smith had supposedly received his position at the Malaysian bank only because Lifetrade agreed to pay the bank around $20,000 per month to serve as its investment manager, nor that Smith was allegedly terminated only after the bank determined that the arrangement posed an unacceptable liability risk. (Compl. \u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Lifetrade's Overvalued Investments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A leader with a spotted past alone, of course, does not necessarily mean that a company will do wrong by its investors. Here, though, the complaint goes on to allege that Smith's poor judgment seeped into Lifetrade's business decisions-and, specifically, that Smith knowingly led Lifetrade to overpay for the life insurance policies in which it invested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ultimately, the value of any given life settlement depends on both the amount of policy proceeds at issue-a number typically fixed by the underlying insurance policy-and the life expectancy of the life insured. (Compl. \u00b6 44.) According to the complaint, the insured's life expectancy is \"[t]he single most important factor\" in pricing a life settlement (Compl. \u00b6 46), because, put bluntly, the sooner the insured dies, the sooner the settlement provider reaps the policy proceeds-and the less it pays in premiums before doing so (Compl. \u00b6 45). As a result, settlement providers typically retain underwriters to provide life expectancy projections, hopefully based on \"sound, objective, and consistent professional judgment.\" (Compl. \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, Lifetrade is alleged to have invested almost exclusively in life settlements arranged by a single Georgia-based provider, Defendant Portsmouth. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 50.) Portsmouth's exclusive underwriter through August 2012, ITM Twentyfirst, LLC (\"21st Services\") (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 54), in turn, was allegedly \"widely known among insiders in the life settlement industry as early as 2004 to have been accused\" in an earlier, unrelated lawsuit \"of systematically and significantly understating its [life expectancy] evaluations\" (Compl. \u00b6 51;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 77-5). For example, whereas 21st Services' model predicted that the policies Lifetrade bought from Portsmouth would pull in a total of almost $77 million in 2011, a model used by AVS, a competing underwriter, predicted returns of only around $42 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59(a), 60.) Indeed, the complaint alleges, on a policy-by-policy basis, 21st Services' life expectancy predictions were shorter than AVS's in every known instance, \"a consistent, wide-ranging and material discrepanc[y]\" that \"could not have been the product of chance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because of this pattern of understatement, the complaint alleges, entities like Lifetrade that invested in life insurance policies that had been appraised by 21st Services stood at risk of major losses. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.) Although \"it may be of small significance if a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   insured dies on a\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   date,\" the complaint maintains, \"life settlement funds, by their nature and design, rely upon the pooling of many insurance policies as a way of mitigating risk and assuring the relative stability of the fund,\" with the consequence that systematically inaccurate life expectancies distort a fund's expectations of profitability. (Compl. \u00b6 63;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Far from suspecting that Lifetrade was putting their money at risk, though, Plaintiffs maintain that they were led to believe that all was well. S &amp; P repeatedly gave Lifetrade positive investment ratings without suggesting that the life expectancy estimates upon which those ratings relied were too optimistic. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) And S &amp; P's monthly statements-as well as the Lifetrade Funds' own annual statements-contained performance charts depicting Lifetrade's historical net asset value (\"NAV\") price per share in favorable comparison to the returns investors could expect from other investment opportunities. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83, 86, 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But these glowing reports, Plaintiffs maintain, left much unsaid. For one thing, the NAV figures promoted by S &amp; P and the Lifetrade Funds had allegedly been generated using a valuation method that Smith himself had devised and that relied on assumptions described by one former Lifetrade actuary as \" 'absurd,' 'ridiculously bad' and 'not reasonable by any actuarial standard.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 85;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 87.) For another thing, S &amp; P itself allegedly had reason to doubt the figures it was parroting. In an October 13, 2009 report made available only to paying subscribers, S &amp; P opined that investment in life settlement transactions carried numerous risks, including unsound actuarial assumptions, shaky life expectancy projections, and the potential for fraud. (Compl. \u00b6 90;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 92; Dkt. No. 77-4.) Despite these privately voiced concerns, however-none of which S &amp; P shared with Lifetrade's investors-S &amp; P would continue to rate Lifetrade favorably until it \"silently ceas[ed]\" its ratings in April 2011 \"without explaining why.\" (Compl. \u00b6 94;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 90-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As a consequence, the complaint alleges, when the Lifetrade Funds told investors in May 2012 that Lifetrade's portfolio of life insurance policies was then valued at over $450 million, Plaintiffs would have had no reason to suspect that a third party's independent valuation had set the figure at a far more modest $302 million. (Compl. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Smith and Marcum's Self-Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It was not mere ineptitude that led Lifetrade to invest almost exclusively in Portsmouth's overvalued insurance policies. Rather, the complaint alleges, this poor business decision arose out of Smith and Marcum's desire for self-enrichment. As it happened, Smith held indirect ownership over Portsmouth during the period in which he was acting as Lifetrade's primary investment manager. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 56.) And Marcum was acting as the Chairman of Portsmouth's Board while simultaneously heading up Lifetrade's investor communications. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34, 50.) Plaintiffs, though, were not told of these facts at the\n   time they opted to invest in the Lifetrade Funds. (Compl. \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, despite allegedly knowing as early as 2004 that Portsmouth was overvaluing its life insurance policies, Smith kept up the relationship between Lifetrade and Portsmouth. (Compl. \u00b6 56.) In the process, Smith, personally and through his various companies, pocketed somewhere around 25% of the sums Lifetrade paid Portsmouth for the purchase of life settlements. (Compl. \u00b6 56 &amp; n.8.) For example, in connection with one transaction involving an insurance policy valued-indeed, likely\n   <em>\n    over\n   </em>\n   valued-by 21st Services at $770,000, Lifetrade paid Portsmouth fees, commissions, and overhead charges that totaled a cool $104,201.75. (Compl. \u00b6 57.) What is worse, Plaintiffs go on, this self-dealing did not stop with Portsmouth; in connection with that same transaction, Lifetrade allegedly forked out an additional $90,000 in fees to another of Smith's enterprises-an enterprise that conveniently happened to serve as Lifetrade's investment manager from 2008 to 2010 and managing director from 2008 to 2017. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Meanwhile, the Lifetrade Funds' investors had no knowledge of these self-dealing arrangements. For example, Lifetrade's 2006 prospectus never divulged that Lifetrade would be incurring fees of 20-25% when purchasing life insurance policies from Portsmouth. (Compl. \u00b6 103.) And although the prospectus mentioned some annual fees, it never disclosed certain additional currency-hedging fees that were being paid to a Smith-controlled company in connection with Lifetrade's Japanese assets. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 35, 102.) Finally, while telling investors that Lifetrade would pay no undisclosed \"commission or other payment ... in respect of application for Shares,\" the prospectus failed to mention that the Lifetrade Funds were in fact paying out a 10% commission on all sums invested. (Compl. \u00b6 104;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   All told, between the inflated amounts Lifetrade was paying to Portsmouth for insurance policies and the sums it was otherwise coughing up in \"undisclosed fees, commissions and overhead charges,\" Smith and his entities are alleged to have appropriated at least $133 million, and perhaps as much as $239 million, when all was said and done. (Compl. \u00b6 56 n.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Lifetrade Funds Meet Their Downfall\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With investors' cash being squandered on overvalued assets and hidden fees, it was only a matter of time until the Lifetrade Funds ran into money trouble. As was the case with so many creative investment ventures, the 2007-2008 financial crisis marked the beginning of the end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Outwardly, all was made to seem well. As the national economy fell into turmoil, Smith reassured investors that Lifetrade was \"robust and strong enough to weather the storm\" (Compl. \u00b6 107; Dkt. No. 77-6 at 7) and that Lifetrade \"continue[d] to be a stable performer\" (Compl. \u00b6 109 (emphasis omitted) ) as a result of its ability to \"cherry pick ... the best [life insurance] policies at the best price\" (Compl. \u00b6 110 (omission in original) ). The reality, though, was less sanguine. Because the individuals insured under the life insurance policies that Lifetrade had acquired from Portsmouth were inconveniently outliving 21st Services' predictions, Lifetrade was not drawing in cash at the rate investors might have hoped. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 111.) And because Lifetrade was siphoning what liquid funds it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have into the pockets of Smith and his entities, Lifetrade needed to find another source of liquidity so that it could continue to satisfy investors' requests to redeem their shares for cash as those requests arose. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Yale%20L.%20%26%20Pol%27y%20Rev.%20253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Enter Wells Fargo. On June 25, 2008, Wells Fargo and Lifetrade entered into a loan and security agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") that, as amended, assured Lifetrade a $500 million credit line, secured by Lifetrade's assets-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its portfolio of life insurance policies-with all advances to be repaid to Wells Fargo by June 15, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 114.) Although this credit line was reduced to $225 million in 2009 and again to $200 million in 2011 (Compl. \u00b6 115), the arrangement provided Lifetrade with the ready cash it needed to stay afloat for a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Despite affording a temporary reprieve, though, the Loan Agreement did nothing to shore up Lifetrade's underlying weaknesses. As the June 15, 2012 repayment date neared, Lifetrade needed to pull together the roughly $205 million it owed to Wells Fargo. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 143.) But although Lifetrade told its investors that the value of its insurance policy portfolio around this time was roughly $450 million-and although Wells Fargo's own valuation put the portfolio's value at around $302 million (Compl. \u00b6 56)-the value of the portfolio could not be immediately translated into cash that could be used to pay off the loan (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 131 &amp; n.21). As a result, in March 2012, Lifetrade informed investors that it was suspending redemptions in light of the need to renegotiate the credit arrangement. (Compl. \u00b6 127; Dkt. No. 77-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Following the suspension of redemptions, Lifetrade called a May 17, 2012 shareholder meeting in the Dutch Antilles for purposes of voting on what to do about the expiring credit line. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 128-29; Dkt. No. 77-10.) Voters were given a choice of three options: surrendering Lifetrade's insurance policies to Wells Fargo to satisfy the debt, seeking a one-year extension of the credit line on unfavorable terms, or negotiating a long-term refinancing plan. (Compl. \u00b6 128.) Smith and Marcum promoted the surrender option, falsely suggesting that investors could be personally liable to Wells Fargo if Lifetrade's debt ultimately went unsatisfied. (Compl. \u00b6 128 &amp; n.19.) Voters at the meeting, though, rejected Smith and Marcum's preferred surrender option in favor of pursuing long-term refinancing. (Compl. \u00b6 129; Dkt. No. 77-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But Wells Fargo had other plans. According to the complaint, Wells Fargo, despite claiming that it was \"looking to exit the life settlement market\" (Compl. \u00b6 120), had long been hoping to capitalize on Lifetrade's liquidity woes, seize the life insurance policies Lifetrade had put up as collateral, and start its own life settlement business. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 116, 121 &amp; n.15, 123.) Wells Fargo, in other words, believed that Lifetrade's portfolio was worth more than the amount that Lifetrade owed under the Loan Agreement and that an opportunity to take over the portfolio would present itself once Lifetrade inevitably proved unable to pay off its debt. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-25.) As evidence of this scheme, Plaintiffs note that in 2010 Wells Fargo ignored a New York investment bank's offer to buy all of\n   its life settlement loans, including those that had been extended to Lifetrade, in exchange for the full value owed under the loans. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 122-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Wells Fargo's plan worked brilliantly. After Lifetrade proved unable to secure funding from other lenders prior to the June 15, 2012 maturity date of its loans, Wells Fargo announced its intention to foreclose on Lifetrade's assets. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 131-32.) But rather than foreclosing under the Loan Agreement, which would have entitled Lifetrade to collect most of the difference between the value of its portfolio and the value of its unpaid debt, Wells Fargo exploited Smith and Marcum's fear that they could be personally liable for Lifetrade's debt under Cura\u00e7ao law in order to negotiate a new, August 14, 2012 agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\"), pursuant to which Lifetrade agreed to transfer its entire portfolio to ATC Realty, a Wells Fargo subsidiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 133-34, 140.) Under the Settlement Agreement, Lifetrade's investors were to have no \"further interest or claim in and to the Foreclosed Assets or to the proceeds and profits that may be derived therefrom\" (Dkt. No. 77-2 at 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 136), and with those magic words, Plaintiffs' investments in the Lifetrade Funds were fully wiped out (Compl. \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the time Lifetrade entered into the Settlement Agreement, Smith and Marcum gave investors no notice of the deal. (Compl. \u00b6 139.) And the Settlement Agreement itself contained a confidentiality provision that barred Lifetrade from making \"any statements to investors in the Lifetrade [Funds], or any other Persons, whether privately or publicly, relating to the settlement contemplated by th[e] Agreement,\" beyond \"the mere fact ... that the settlement and foreclosure occurred.\" (Dkt. No. 77-2 at 48;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 153.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Consistent with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Lifetrade did notify its investors that the settlement had occurred, updating its website with a link to a notice that one of its related entities had filed to inform the Irish Stock Exchange that \"a consensual foreclosure process ha[d] been agreed in respect of the various rights and obligations arising under\" the Loan Agreement. (Compl. \u00b6 159;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 160.) But, referring to a provision in the Settlement Agreement that granted Lifetrade a three-and-a-half-month window in which it could reacquire the portfolio upon repayment of the outstanding debt (Compl. \u00b6 138),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lifetrade's website represented that its directors hoped to \"remove Wells Fargo from the position of collateral owner\" and were \"still working to achieve a satisfactory outcome for investors\" (Compl. \u00b6 160 (emphases omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even after that refinancing window closed on November 30, 2012, though, Lifetrade's management continued to suggest that all was not lost. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 160, 162.) For example, in letters dated February 20, 2013, and August 9, 2013, Smith told shareholders that refinancing efforts remained underway. (Dkt. No. 77-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 162.) And on January 7, 2014, Smith wrote that he \"expected that a final version\" of a refinancing option\n   \"w[ould] be circulated for final approval ... and signed by all parties by January 30th, 2014.\" (Dkt. No. 77-30 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 165.) Meanwhile, Marcum was also telling investors that \"efforts were being made to set up a new credit facility\" with a French bank, and he managed to draw in fresh outlays of roughly $15 million from Lifetrade investors to finance those supposed efforts. (Compl. \u00b6 167.) All the while, Lifetrade sent its investors no annual reports. (Compl. \u00b6 172.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It was not until November 21, 2016, that investors began to learn the truth. (Compl. \u00b6 170.) On that day, several investors received undated letters from Lifetrade that indicated, among other things, that \"[t]he Lifetrade Fund holds no assets\" (Dkt. No. 77-14 at 3) and that investors had suffered \"a total loss of the capital contributed to date\" (Dkt. No. 77-14 at 4). With the cat now out of the bag, the director of one of Lifetrade's related entities circulated to investors a February 22, 2017 notice that, at long last, contained annual reports for the years 2012 through 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 172.) These newly disclosed reports, much to investors' dismay, indicated that Lifetrade had suffered a $472 million loss in 2012 and that its investors' equity had thereafter disappeared completely as early as 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Soon after those disclosures, this litigation began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On April 24, 2017, a group of more than fifty individuals and entities that had invested in the Lifetrade Funds filed an initial complaint in a suit captioned\n   <em>\n    Aviles v. S &amp; P Global, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 2987. (Dkt. No. 5.) Four plaintiffs sought relief on their own behalves, on behalf of a putative class consisting of all offshore persons with unredeemed investments in the Lifetrade Funds, and derivatively on behalf of the Lifetrade Funds. (Dkt. No. 5 at 2.) The remaining plaintiffs asserted individual claims on their own behalves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the following months, additional class members joined the\n   <em>\n    Aviles\n   </em>\n   action to assert their individual claims (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 77 \u00b6 18), and still more class members filed their individual claims in a total of four additional actions:\n   <em>\n    Benedetto v. ATC Realty Fifteen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 6087, which was filed on August 11, 2017;\n   <em>\n    Acebedo v.

Rule 12(b)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To start with, the Wells Fargo Defendants contend that one of the plaintiffs, the Japanese company Plaza Asset Management (\"Plaza\"), lacks standing to bring its claims. (Dkt. No. 89 at 38-39.) Plaza is not alleged to have invested in any of the Lifetrade Funds but instead is alleged only to be the \"assignee of all rights, claims and causes of action\" of investor Nomura Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (\"Nomura\"). (\n   <em>\n    Benedetto\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 6087, Dkt. No. 48 \u00b6 18(d).) While it would seem that, as assignee, Plaza could invoke Nomura's claims here, the Wells Fargo Defendants maintain that Japanese law allows an assignee to assert a claim against a defendant \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if the assignor has given notice to the defendant or the defendant ... has acknowledged the assignment.\" (Dkt. No. 90-26 \u00b6 17.) Because Plaza has not alleged such notice or acknowledgment, the Wells Fargo Defendants contend, it has not shown that it has standing to raise the claims that Nomura has allegedly assigned it. (Dkt. No. 89 at 38-39.) And even had Plaza properly alleged an assignment, the Wells Fargo Defendants further argue, Plaza has failed to adequately allege that the instant claims fall within the assignment's scope. (Dkt. No. 110 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded. Plaintiffs have represented that the notice of assignment required under Japanese law \"can be sent at any time after the assignment\" (Dkt. No. 103-1 \u00b6 7), including in the midst of a pending lawsuit (Dkt. No. 103-1 \u00b6 8). Given that Defendants here are now on notice of the purported assignment, Plaintiffs have, at a minimum, established a dispute as to the validity of the assignment under Japanese law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor is the Court convinced by the Wells Fargo Defendants' attempt to rely on\n   <em>\n    Cortlandt Street Recovery Corp. v.

No. 48 \u00b6 18(d) ), which clearly encompasses the causes of action asserted here.

First, they argue that the Lifetrade Movants have consented to submit to this Court's jurisdiction by virtue of forum-selection clauses in the Loan and Settlement Agreements. (Dkt. No. 106 at 12-19.) Alternately, Plaintiffs argue, New York's long-arm statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    N.Y.

Although none of the Lifetrade Movants were themselves party to these contracts, Plaintiffs point out that each movant was closely affiliated with a Lifetrade party and that each movant signed the Loan Agreement, an amendment to the Loan Agreement, or the Settlement Agreement in a representative capacity on such a party's behalf.

No. 92 \u00b6 4), and Plaintiffs never argue that Smith personally transacted any relevant business in New York. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that Lifetrade's own New York contacts may be imputed to Smith on an agency or alter ego theory and that Lifetrade, for its part, conducted business through New York banks. (Compl. \u00b6 14; Dkt. No. 106 at 19-21.) For example, Lifetrade relied on a New York bank to verify the insurance policies it hoped to buy (Compl. \u00b6 14(4); Dkt. No. 107-8) and to hold the policies in escrow after purchase (Compl. \u00b6 14(5); Dkt. Nos. 107-10, 107-11). And Lifetrade used New York banks to channel investors' funds into its own offshore bank account and then to channel funds from that bank account into the offshore bank accounts of other Lifetrade and Portsmouth entities, sometimes in the form of purportedly improper commissions and fees. (Compl. \u00b6 14(9); Dkt. Nos. 107-13 through 107-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Nor, likely, could he.

First, he contends,\n   Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to permit the plausible inference that Lifetrade's New York contacts can be imputed to him on an agency or alter-ego theory. (Dkt.

Although Portsmouth is alleged to have engaged in \"extensive life settlement business in the State of New York\" and to have filed a lawsuit in New York (Compl. \u00b6 29), the complaint fails to allege that any of Portsmouth's New York activities bear a direct relationship with the specific events that have given rise to the instant suit. Significantly, Plaintiffs have neither alleged (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 14) nor produced evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23) that Portsmouth (as distinct from Portsmouth Securities Limited, a Malaysian company (Compl. \u00b6 30) ) was involved in the banking activity that supports jurisdiction over Smith. Thus, even if Portsmouth can be said to transact business in New York as a general matter, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of making out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the particular claims they assert here \"aris[e] from\" that business.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%20302\">\n    N.Y.

In an effort to get around this defect, Plaintiffs point to their allegation that Portsmouth was Smith's alter ego (Compl. \u00b6 29) and\n   urge this Court to employ transitive reasoning: because Lifetrade's in-state contacts can be imputed to Smith on an agency theory, and because Smith's contacts can be imputed to Portsmouth on an alter ego theory, the argument runs, Lifetrade's contacts can be imputed to Portsmouth (Dkt. No. 106 at 24). This proposed syllogism, though, fails at the second step. Just as the complaint fails to plausibly allege that Portsmouth was Lifetrade's alter ego, it also-for essentially the same reasons-fails to plausibly allege that Portsmouth was Smith's alter ego.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have failed to make out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that New York's long-arm statute provides authority for this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Portsmouth here, Portsmouth's motion to dismiss all claims against it pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

And Smith and Marcum make no argument that the Court's constitutional analysis here should differ from its statutory analysis. Indeed, the only distinct point Smith and Marcum raise in connection with the Due Process Clause is that much of the conduct at issue occurred outside the United States, suggesting, perhaps, that an exercise of personal jurisdiction here would be unreasonable. (Dkt. No. 95 at 24.) But the extraterritorial aspects of Plaintiffs' claims would not bar, for example, Marcum's home state of Connecticut from taking personal jurisdiction over him (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

If the mere existence of a fraud suit brought by a single plaintiff somewhere in the world were enough to bar a different set of plaintiffs from pursuing a lawsuit in the United States on the basis of the same fraud, those accused of transnational fraud would virtually never face suit here.

Plaintiffs' claims fall into four categories: (1) claims under the federal RICO statute; (2) claims under New York's fraudulent conveyance statute; (3) New York common-law claims; and (4) foreign-law claims.

RICO prohibits \"any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in ... interstate\n   or foreign commerce\" from \"conduct[ing] or participat[ing], directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), or from conspiring to do so,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1962(d).

Thus, Plaintiffs conclude, the RICO Defendants conspired to conduct-and in fact did conduct-their business together as an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.

First, they argue that RICO does not provide Plaintiffs a cause of action to seek redress for their injuries because those injuries occurred abroad. (Dkt. No. 89 at 10; Dkt. No. 95 at 12-14.) Next, they argue that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege a course of conduct that violated RICO. (Dkt. No. 89 at 11-15; Dkt. No. 95 at 14-16.) Finally, they argue that any RICO claims are time-barred. (Dkt. No. 89 at 15-16; Dkt.

First, they argue that the Settlement Agreement contains a choice-of-law provision that calls for the application of New York law to their fraudulent-conveyance claims. (Dkt. No. 102 at 10-12.) Second, they argue that the applicable conflict-of-laws principles should lead this Court to apply New York's substantive law over Delaware's. (Dkt. No. 102 at 12-15.)

In other words, while it is clear from the foreclosure notice's language that the parties foresaw that New York law might be invoked in connection with the Settlement Agreement, nothing suggests a contractual agreement that such an invocation would be valid.

Here, the Wells Fargo Defendants argue that there is a material conflict between New York's and Delaware's fraudulent-conveyance laws.

Nor do they make any argument that their fraudulent-conveyance claims would be timely even if Delaware's substantive law were to apply.

Because S &amp; P makes no argument that Plaintiffs' claims are untimely under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they accrued (Dkt.

Apr. 11, 2011) (describing the accrual date of a plaintiff's fraud claim as the date she invested in two tax shelter partnerships that failed to generate promised revenues and tax deductions). Here, S &amp; P argues, because it is alleged to have ceased rating Lifetrade in April 2011 (Compl. \u00b6 72), the\n   <em>\n    latest\n   </em>\n   an investor could have invested in reliance on its ratings was April 2011, more than six years prior to the filing of the instant actions (Dkt. No. 87 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   S &amp; P's argument, however, contains an artful elision. Even though S &amp; P's reports about Lifetrade ceased in April 2011, a fraud claim accrues-as S &amp; P itself recognizes (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   )-when a plaintiff takes detrimental action in reliance on a fraudulent statement, and not at the time the statement is made,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Varga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302177\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/147/480/\">\n    48 N.Y.S.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of course, the length of time that passes between an allegedly fraudulent statement and a plaintiff's act of supposed reliance may be probative of the reasonableness of that reliance or of whether the plaintiff's action was, as a factual matter, actually taken in reliance on the statement. But those issues go to the merits of a fraud claim and not to its timeliness. Given that, as S &amp; P admits (Dkt. No. 87 at 5), numerous plaintiffs invested in the Lifetrade Funds within six years of the first-filed of the instant suits-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after April 24, 2011 (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 77-1)-those plaintiffs' fraud claims are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Of course, Plaintiffs urge the Court to go further. In their view,\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's fraud claims fall within the six-year statutory window, regardless of investment date. According to Plaintiffs, because \"a tort cause of action cannot accrue until an injury is sustained,\"\n   <em>\n    Kronos, Inc. v. AVX Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4429418\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/81/90/#p94\">\n    81 N.Y.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20N.Y.S.2d%20931\">\n    595 N.Y.S.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20N.E.2d%20289\">\n    612 N.E.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), their claims against S &amp; P did not accrue until their investments caused them economic loss-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , until, at the earliest, Lifetrade transferred its assets to ATC Realty in 2012 and thereby rendered Plaintiffs' shares worthless (Dkt. No. 104 at 17-20). Indeed, Plaintiffs further argue, because \"a fraud action cannot be maintained where the damages attributable to the fraud are speculative or undeterminable,\"\n   <em>\n    Abernathy-Thomas Eng'g Co. v. Pall Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11210683\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/103/582/#p599\">\n    103 F.Supp.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (E.D.N.Y. 2000), their claims might not even have accrued until 2016, when it finally became clear that refinancing efforts had failed (Dkt. No. 104 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Plaintiffs, though, misapply these principles of New York law. After all, Plaintiffs suffered ascertainable injury due to S &amp; P's alleged fraud as soon as they invested in \"securities [that] were worth less than their price at the time of purchase,\"\n   <em>\n    Varga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12302177\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/147/480/\">\n    48 N.Y.S.3d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , even if further damages lay in wait down the line. Put another way, a driver who is misled into buying a jalopy at a hotrod price need not wait until she is stranded by the side of the road to seek relief. To be sure, Plaintiffs point out that Lifetrade \"appeared to be doing well\" in its early years. (Dkt. No. 104 at 19.) But while that initial success might be relevant to the question of when Plaintiffs should have discovered that they had been fleeced, it does not change the fact that Plaintiffs' own theory of fraud is that S &amp; P tricked them into investing in funds that were \"too risky to rate\" (Compl. \u00b6 99)-an injury that was complete as soon as the money changed hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Thus, although those plaintiffs who invested in the Lifetrade Funds on or after April 24, 2011, have timely filed their fraud claims, the same cannot necessarily be said for those plaintiffs who invested earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

All that separated them from the 2009 report that revealed S &amp; P's alleged duplicity was a $600 paywall fee. (Compl. \u00b6 174.) Indeed, Plaintiffs found the report just months after realizing, allegedly for the first time, in November 2016 that the value of their investments had \"irreversibly and entirely diminished.\" (Compl. \u00b6 171;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 174.) An investigation, too, would have revealed that-as S &amp; P has represented without rebuttal-some financial news outlets, including the\n   <em>\n    Financial Times\n   </em>\n   , made contemporaneous reference to the 2009 report (Dkt. No. 87 at 6-7) and that S &amp; P had ceased rating Lifetrade in 2011 (Compl. \u00b6 94), a decision\n   that Lifetrade's own management publicly admitted in 2014 stemmed from \"concern[ ] about the asset class\" (Dkt. No. 77-13 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The critical question, then, is whether the facts of which Plaintiffs were or should have been aware by April 24, 2015, were sufficient as a matter of law to put Plaintiffs on notice of the need to undertake the investigation that would have revealed this evidence. They were. As early as 2012, Lifetrade suspended redemptions (Compl. \u00b6 127), stopped sending annual reports to investors (Compl. \u00b6 172), and updated its website with a link to a notice that Wells Fargo had effected foreclosure (Compl. \u00b6 160). Armed with this information, at least one investor was moved to file a fraud suit in Cura\u00e7ao in December 2012, alleging in part that Smith and Marcum had undersold Lifetrade's fiscal woes. (Dkt. No. 94-2 \u00b6 16.) Plaintiffs too, then, might have been more curious as to whether Lifetrade in fact represented the safe, stable investment that S &amp; P had supposedly marketed-just as they were years later, in 2016, when they realized that Lifetrade was not just in distress but entirely sunk. Of course, Plaintiffs allege that they had been warned at the time of investment that \"they should not expect 'for their investment to be liquid' and that [Lifetrade] '[was] not suitable for persons who require[d] regular income from their investments.' \" (Compl. \u00b6 150 (quoting Dkt. No. 77-26 at 2, 9).) But even if reasonable investors might have believed that Lifetrade's variable liquidity would sometimes cause it to suspend redemptions in the ordinary course of business, it strains credulity to believe that reasonable investors would have been similarly nonplussed by a liquidity shortage so severe that it led Lifetrade to fall into default and foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Nor does it change the analysis that Smith and Marcum allegedly took pains to downplay the suspicious developments of 2012, periodically promising investors that refinancing efforts were underway and that Lifetrade might be able to reclaim its assets. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 162, 165-67.) After all, \"reassuring statements will prevent the emergence of a duty to inquire or dissipate such a duty only if an investor of ordinary intelligence would reasonably rely on the statements to allay the investor's concern.\"\n   <em>\n    LC Capital Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9334052\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/148/#p156\">\n    318 F.3d at 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And by April 24, 2015, Plaintiffs had been hearing Smith and Marcum's reassuring words for over two years without any indication that Lifetrade had actually locked down any new funding source or had come any nearer to reclaiming the assets upon which Wells Fargo had long ago foreclosed. Indeed, these very reassurances acknowledged that the foreclosure posed a \"challenge[ ]\" and that Lifetrade's leadership was \"hard at work trying to find the best possible solution.\" (Dkt. No. 77-12 at 2.) This admission that all was not well reinforces the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs had cause prior to April 24, 2015, to ask whether Lifetrade had been a good investment from the outset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Ultimately, this is not a case in which Plaintiffs had no reason beyond publicly available press reports and court filings to inquire into S &amp; P's ratings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Staehr v.

Rather, this is a case in which Plaintiffs claim they were misled into believing that they were making a safe investment but then failed to make any inquiry once clear signs emerged of the\n   very risks they allege had not been disclosed. The 2012 foreclosure, in other words, \"relate[d] ... directly to the ... omissions the Plaintiffs later allege[d] in their action against [S &amp; P]\" and so, taken in combination with the other circumstances alleged, was sufficient to put Plaintiffs on inquiry notice prior to April 24, 2015, as to the integrity of S &amp; P's ratings.\n   <em>\n    Staehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052118\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/406/#p426\">\n    547 F.3d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Newman v.

Plaintiffs, though, maintain that S &amp; P's monthly reports were misleading both on their face and in light of S &amp; P's failure to mention the concerns about life settlements that it disclosed in its non-public 2009 research report.

While acknowledging that the 2009 report doubts the safety of investing in bonds composed of \"pool[ed] and repackag[ed] cash flows from a pool of life insurance policies\" (Dkt. No. 77-4 at 2), S &amp; P maintains that its rating of Lifetrade took no view on whether the fund represented a\n   good investment, but rather spoke only to \"the strong credit quality of the [fund's] eligible investments and counterparties\" (Dkt. No. 77-8 at 3) or, put another way, to \"the likelihood that the insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies\" Lifetrade purchased \"would pay the policy benefits when they became due\" (Dkt. No. 87 at 13). In other words, in S &amp; P's view, the 2009 report simply \"does not speak to the same subject as S &amp; P's fund credit rating\" and so offers no indication that S &amp; P had doubts about its credit rating at the time it was issued. (Dkt. No. 109 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Plaintiffs offer no real rebuttal. They do not, for example, offer an alternative reading of S &amp; P's \"Af\" rating that would suggest that it was intended to assess Lifetrade's overall integrity, as opposed to the reliability of the insurers that issued the policies Lifetrade held as assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 77-8 at 4 (describing the ratings as \"assessments of the overall credit quality of a fund's portfolio\" and noting that they are \"not recommendations to purchase, sell, or hold a security\").) Nor have Plaintiffs alleged that S &amp; P doubted-or had reason to doubt-that these insurers could indeed be trusted to pay out policy proceeds as needed. Certainly, Plaintiffs allege that\n   <em>\n    Lifetrade\n   </em>\n   represented that S &amp; P's ratings were suggestive of Lifetrade's overall investment quality (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 74, 80), but Plaintiffs offer no basis for imputing these alleged misrepresentations to\n   <em>\n    S &amp; P. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eurycleia Partners, LP v. Seward &amp; Kissel, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039187\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/46/400/\">\n    46 A.D.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4039187\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/46/400/\">\n    849 N.Y.S.2d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512-13 (1st Dep't 2007) (\"[I]n the absence of a fiduciary relationship with plaintiffs, [a defendant] [is] not required to correct a misstatement that it did not make.\"). Plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to plausibly allege that the \"Af\" ratings themselves were false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   This conclusion, though, does not end the ballgame. S &amp; P's ratings did not appear in a vacuum but, rather, were embedded in monthly reports alongside other information. And Plaintiffs allege that this other information-life expectancy projections provided by 21st Services and NAV figures concocted by Lifetrade-was deeply flawed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61, 85.) Unlike the \"Af\" rating itself, moreover, the life expectancy figures-which suggested the rate at which Lifetrade would be able to accumulate cash holdings-and the figures related to the value of Lifetrade's assets spoke to the fund's overall financial health and not to the narrow question of whether the insurers backing the policies Lifetrade held could be trusted to pay proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Critically, S &amp; P never disputes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the NAV and life expectancy figures were misleading. Instead, S &amp; P merely points out that \"there is no allegation that S &amp; P either knew or believed that any factual information in the reports was inaccurate.\" (Dkt. No. 87 at 14.) But that argument speaks to whether Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that S &amp; P acted with the requisite mental state-an issue to which the Court turns below,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.a.i.b.II-and not to whether the information S &amp; P chose to convey was in fact false or misleading. While an expression of\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   is considered to be true if the speaker believes the expression,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3927821\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/714/#p722\">\n    950 F.Supp.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , S &amp; P never disputes that the NAV and life expectancy figures it published in the reports that accompanied its ratings were fact-based representations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   S &amp; P's mental state is\n   thus irrelevant to the truth or falsity of those figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   So, while Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that S &amp; P's credit ratings constituted actionable misrepresentations in and of themselves, Plaintiffs have made out a plausible case at the pleading stage that the monthly reports within which those ratings were embedded contained false data that sent the misleading impression that investment in Lifetrade was a sound prospect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

But Plaintiffs have not alleged that S &amp; P knew the NAV and life expectancy figures it published were false. Although the complaint alleges that \"insiders in the life settlement industry\" knew \"as early as 2004\" that 21st Services \"ha[d] been accused of systematically and significantly understanding its [life expectancy] evaluations\" (Compl. \u00b6 51), it never alleges that S &amp; P was among those insiders.

S &amp; P's October 2009 report identified exactly those risks that made investment in Lifetrade a dubious proposition. For example, the report cautioned that the incentives of underwriters like 21st Services were \"not necessarily in alignment with investors' interests\" and that the potential for \"underwriting errors\" could \"have dramatic effects on cash flows.\" (Dkt. No. 77-4 at 3.) And, the report went on, \"life settlement originators\" like Portsmouth \"ha[d] either limited or no track record\" and faced an incentive \"to focus more on their [own] growth than on potential underwriting problems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That S &amp; P doubted the integrity of settlement providers and their underwriters as early as October\n   2009 raises a strong inference that S &amp; P ignored known risks when it decided to publish the life expectancy figures it received from 21st Services and the NAV figures it received from Lifetrade without subjecting those figures to scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   S &amp; P makes two attempts to underplay the significance of the 2009 report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   First, S &amp; P argues that the 2009 report addressed\n   <em>\n    securitizations\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , life settlements packaged together in bonds-and not the sort of\n   <em>\n    mutual funds\n   </em>\n   in which Plaintiffs invested. (Dkt. No. 87 at 16-17.) This distinction, however, is scarcely relevant, because the specific risks identified in the 2009 report apply just as readily to life settlements pooled in funds as they do to life settlements pooled in bonds. Indeed, the very sort of \"underwriting errors\" that the 2009 report contemplated (Dkt. No. 77-4 at 3) were among the alleged reasons that the life expectancy and NAV figures published in S &amp; P's monthly ratings reports were misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Second, S &amp; P argues that Plaintiffs have failed to raise a strong inference that the S &amp; P employees who issued the ratings reports were aware of the 2009 report or the risks it identified. (Dkt. No. 109 at 14-15.) Thus, S &amp; P contends, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege \"that someone whose intent could be imputed to [S &amp; P] acted with the requisite scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    Silvercreek Mgmt. v.

But beyond alleging that Lifetrade put its investors through an unelaborated \"application process\" (Compl. \u00b6 38), the complaint says nothing about Plaintiffs' sophistication. Moreover, S &amp; P's lone basis for arguing that Plaintiffs might have doubted S &amp; P's reports is that 21st Services had been accused in 2004 of distorting its life expectancy figures. (Dkt. No. 87 at 19-20.) The Court has already explained why those earlier accusations were insufficient to require S &amp; P to question the integrity of 21st Services' predictions.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.a.i.b.II. For the same reasons, the Court likewise has no basis for concluding that those accusations were sufficient to put Plaintiffs on notice of the alleged flaws in 21st Services' figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Second, S &amp; P argues that because it did not rate either of the Feeder Funds, investors in those funds could not have reasonably relied on its ratings of Lifetrade. (Dkt. No. 87 at 18.) But Plaintiffs have alleged that the Feeder Funds invested exclusively in Lifetrade. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) It therefore stands to reason that any false statements that could have led a reasonable investor to believe that direct investment in Lifetrade was a winning proposition could likewise have produced reasonable reliance in the Feeder Funds' investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the reliance required to state a viable fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV. Loss Causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Finally, S &amp; P argues that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege that its credit reports caused their economic injury. (Dkt. No. 87 at 20-21.) Under New York law, a fraud claim requires a \"nexus between [a defendant's] alleged misrepresentations and plaintiff's losses.\"\n   <em>\n    Laub v.

Even if an investor pleads that it \"would not have invested\n   <em>\n    but for\n   </em>\n   [a given] misrepresentation,\" it cannot recover on a fraud claim if it \"lost [its] money for\n   <em>\n    wholly unrelated reasons\n   </em>\n   (say, the market crashing).\"\n   <em>\n    Loreley Fin.

No. 87 at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   S &amp; P's argument relies on a narrow interpretation of Plaintiffs' fraud claim that this Court has already rejected. Put simply, S &amp; P points out that the \"Af\" credit ratings it awarded Lifetrade assessed the credit quality of the insurers that issued the life insurance policies Lifetrade held as assets and argues that Plaintiffs have not alleged that their injury was attributable to the failure of those insurers. But while S &amp; P is correct that Plaintiffs cannot claim any injury based on the \"Af\" credit ratings themselves,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.a.i.b.I, Plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that the NAV and life expectancy figures in S &amp; P's monthly reports gave a misleading impression of\n   Lifetrade's liquidity and profitability,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   Given that S &amp; P itself acknowledges that Lifetrade's \"liquidity crisis\" prompted Plaintiffs' losses (Dkt.

The Lifetrade Movants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The Court turns next to the four common-law claims that Plaintiffs have asserted against the Lifetrade Movants. In two fraud counts, Plaintiffs allege that the Lifetrade Movants made knowing misrepresentations to induce investment in the Lifetrade Funds (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 224-30) and, similarly, conspired with 21st Services to do the same (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314-17). The remaining two counts charge the Lifetrade Movants with negligent misrepresentation (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 231-37) and fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 238-41). The Court addresses the fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and fiduciary breach claims in that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Fraud (Counts Nine and Twenty)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Plaintiffs assert two counts of fraud against the Lifetrade Defendants. One count alleges that the Lifetrade Defendants induced Plaintiffs' investments by misrepresenting, among other things, Smith's history, the value of Lifetrade's assets, and the consequences of the Settlement Agreement. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 224-30.) The other count, similarly, alleges that the Lifetrade Defendants conspired with 21st Services to induce investment by presenting false life expectancy projections to potential investors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 314-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   From the outset, the Court is able to narrow the scope of these claims in two ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   First, the Court agrees with the Lifetrade Movants that it need consider only those alleged misrepresentations that predate the March 2012 suspension of redemptions. (Dkt. No. 95 at 34-35.) Under New York law, a plaintiff \"cannot sustain a cause of action for fraud if defendant's misrepresentation did not form the basis of reliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Sec. Inv'r\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prot. Corp. v. BDO Seidman, L.L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189213\" index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/702/#p709\">\n    95 N.Y.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189213\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/702/#p709\">\n    723 N.Y.S.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189213\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/702/#p709\">\n    746 N.E.2d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). But after redemptions were suspended, Plaintiffs were locked in to their investments regardless of anything the Lifetrade Movants said or failed to say. And while Plaintiffs identify their choice not to file suit earlier as the detrimental action that was induced by the Lifetrade Movants' post-March 2012 misrepresentations (Dkt. No. 106 at 34), that argument gives the game away: if the Lifetrade Movants' post-suspension statements operated to prevent Plaintiffs from asserting fraud claims they would have asserted but for those statements, the statements themselves can hardly be said to form a basis for the claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Second, as the Lifetrade Movants argue (Dkt. No. 95 at 32-34), many plaintiffs' claims are untimely. As explained above,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.C.3.a.i.a, the claims of those plaintiffs who invested prior to April 24, 2011-outside the relevant statute of limitations-are time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fighting this conclusion, Plaintiffs make two arguments for why, in their view, their fraud claims against the Lifetrade Movants should be considered timely. (Dkt. No. 106 at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Plaintiffs first invoke the \"continuing violation\" doctrine, which \"is usually employed where there is a series of continuing wrongs and [which] serves to toll the running of a period of limitations to the date of the commission of the last wrongful act.\"\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

But even if the Lifetrade Movants' post-settlement reassurances might have prevented Plaintiffs from challenging the settlement itself, Plaintiffs offer no reason why those reassurances should have led them to refrain from investigating and\n   challenging the allegedly fraudulent acts that led to the liquidity shortfall that triggered the suspension of redemptions and ensuing Settlement Agreement in the first place. And, as the Court has just explained, those pre-suspension acts are the only alleged acts that could plausibly have produced the reliance necessary for Plaintiffs' fraud claims.

First, they argue that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement. (Dkt. No. 95 at 27-31). Second, they argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an actionable misrepresentation insofar as their claims rely on S &amp; P's ratings and 21st Services' life expectancy figures. (Dkt. No. 95 at 31-32.) And third, they argue that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead that their financial injury was caused by any of the misrepresentations alleged. (Dkt.

The Lifetrade Movants argue that the complaint here fails to comply with Rule 9(b) because it \"do[es] not identify any specific statements that were fraudulent\" and does not identify which of the Lifetrade Defendants was responsible for each statement. (Dkt. No. 95 at 28.) Moreover, the Lifetrade Movants continue, the complaint does not specify which plaintiffs viewed which statements, when those plaintiffs did so, or what detrimental action those plaintiffs took in reliance.

To start with, the complaint does identify specific statements alleged to have been false or misleading. These statements include Lifetrade prospectuses that omitted mention of Smith's checkered past or certain self-dealing fee arrangements (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 100-04); financial statements that displayed 21st Services' flawed life expectancy projections and Lifetrade's flawed NAV figures (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 85, 105-06); and Investment Consultant Reports aimed at falsely convincing investors of Lifetrade's financial stability between 2008 and 2011 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 107-11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   And while Plaintiffs do not in every instance ascribe a particular speaker to each of these statements, the Lifetrade Movants are wrong to suggest that Rule 9(b) necessarily requires that Plaintiffs do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 111 at 13-14.) Rather, if an alleged misrepresentation appears in \"official materials produced in connection\n   with the sale of securities,\" Rule 9(b) does not require a plaintiff to \"disaggregate\" a set of allegedly responsible defendants as long as \"the complaint gives grounds for attributing the statements to the group.\"\n   <em>\n    Loreley Fin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330802\" index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/160/#p177\">\n    797 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Parmalat Sec.

(Dkt. No. 95 at 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   As for the S &amp; P ratings, the Court rejects the Lifetrade Movants' argument that the ratings are, as opinions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 95 at 32),\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   incapable of supporting a fraud claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3927821\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/950/714/#p722\">\n    950 F.Supp.2d at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that credit ratings may be actionable if the speaker \"did not believe\" them at the time they were communicated). But, as the Court has explained, Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that S &amp; P's ratings here were in fact misleading.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.a.i.b.I. Thus, while the Lifetrade Movants'\n   <em>\n    characterizations\n   </em>\n   of S &amp; P's ratings (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 74) might be actionable if found to be misleading, the Lifetrade Movants' mere repetition of the ratings themselves cannot form a basis for liability in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   As for the life expectancy figures, the Lifetrade Movants offer two reasons why they are not actionable. First, the Lifetrade Movants point out that the figures are \"prediction[s] of a future event\" and so, supposedly, cannot be misleading. (Dkt. No. 95 at 31.) But predictions are not insulated from liability. Rather, \"where one party ... ha[s] superior knowledge, the expression of an opinion [regarding future events] implies that the\n   declarant knows facts which support that opinion and that he knows nothing which contradicts the statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Probulk Carriers Ltd. v.

Here, the complaint alleges that life expectancy underwriters are trusted to employ \"sound actuarial principles and reasonably anticipated mortality and morbidity experience\" (Compl. \u00b6 47), but that 21st Services instead \"knowingly issued falsely short life expectancy evaluations\" in connection with the policies at issue here (Compl. \u00b6 69). If Plaintiffs can indeed show that 21st Services' predictions were unmoored from the analytical standards that industry participants expect from underwriters, then those predictions may be considered misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Second, the Lifetrade Movants point out that Plaintiffs have not alleged that any one life expectancy prediction in fact proved to be inaccurate. (Dkt. No. 95 at 31.) But this argument is a\n   <em>\n    non sequitur.\n   </em>\n   The question here is whether Plaintiffs' claim that 21st Services \"issued falsely short life expectancy evaluations\" as a matter of course (Compl. \u00b6 69) is plausible. Alleging that those evaluations failed to predict the life expectancies of specific individuals is of course one way to establish plausibility, but so too is alleging, as Plaintiffs have, that the evaluations both underestimated the revenue Lifetrade ended up collecting on the policies and unfailingly undershot the projections of a competing underwriter. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) The Court has little trouble concluding that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the graphic depictions Lifetrade sent investors to illustrate the spread of life expectancies across its portfolio holdings (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 66; Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 95 at 35-36.) Under New York law, a fraud plaintiff \"must show both that defendant's misrepresentation induced [her] to engage in the transaction in question (transaction causation) and that the misrepresentation directly caused the loss about which [she] complains (loss causation).\"\n   <em>\n    Levy v.

But because the rating did not in fact represent an overall assessment of the wisdom of investing in Lifetrade,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.a.i.b.I, the Lifetrade Movants argue that Plaintiffs' own misunderstanding caused them to invest (Dkt.

But far from being \"\n   <em>\n    wholly unrelated\n   </em>\n   \" to the self-dealing transactions the Lifetrade Movants are alleged to have hidden, and the distorted life expectancy and NAV figures the Lifetrade Movants are alleged to have promoted,\n   <em>\n    Loreley Fin.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056121\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/misc-3d/42/858/\">\n    978 N.Y.S.2d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the liquidity crisis that culminated in Plaintiffs' losses is plausibly alleged to have arisen out of those very factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Plaintiffs have therefore plausibly alleged transaction and loss causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   To summarize, the Court grants the Lifetrade Movants' motion to dismiss Counts Nine and Twenty for failure to state a claim, but only with respect to those plaintiffs who invested in the Lifetrade Funds prior to April 24, 2011, and with respect to any alleged misrepresentations made after March 2012.

Accordingly, Count Ten meets the same fate as Counts Nine and Twenty: it is dismissed, except with respect to those plaintiffs who invested in the Lifetrade Funds on or after April 24, 2011, and with respect to any alleged misrepresentations made after March 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 238-41.) According to Plaintiffs, Smith and Marcum committed a fiduciary breach by engaging in undisclosed self-dealing transactions, promoting 21st Services' flawed life expectancy figures, overstating the value of Lifetrade's assets, and transferring Lifetrade's portfolio to ATC Realty via the Settlement Agreement without notice and against investors' wishes.

(Dkt. No. 89 at 22-23.) Because Plaintiffs have made no effort to rebut this argument (Dkt. No. 102\n   at 20 n.24), the Court treats these five claims as purely derivative.

In challenging these claims, Wells Fargo argues that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege, with the specificity required by Rule 9(b), that (1) Wells Fargo made misleading statements or omissions (Dkt.

Here, there is no allegation that Wells Fargo fell short in any way with respect to its duties under the various escrow agreements it held with Lifetrade.

The Court has already concluded that Plaintiffs' fiduciary breach claim against Smith and Marcum survives the Lifetrade Movants' motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.3.b.iii, and the Wells Fargo Defendants make no independent argument that the complaint fails to state a fiduciary breach claim against Smith and Marcum (Dkt. No. 89 at 35). Furthermore, the Wells Fargo Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs are alleged to have suffered damages as a result of that breach. The Court, then, asks only whether the complaint adequately alleges that the Wells Fargo Defendants knowingly participated in the breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   New York courts have explained that the participation element of an aiding and abetting claim requires that \"the alleged aider and abettor rendered substantial assistance to the fiduciary in the course of effecting the alleged breach of duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanford/Kissena Owners Corp. v.

The Wells Fargo Defendants maintain that the complaint falls short under this standard in two respects. First, they argue that the complaint does not adequately plead that they had knowledge of the alleged breach. (Dkt. No. 89 at 36.) Second, they argue that the complaint does not allege facts from which it is plausible to infer that they substantially assisted the breach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court, however, disagrees on both points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   As for knowledge, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Wells Fargo Defendants knew that Smith and Marcum had abandoned their fiduciary roles. In particular, the complaint alleges that, under the Loan Agreement, Lifetrade was entitled to a foreclosure that would have required the Wells Fargo Defendants \"to return to Lifetrade any excess sums remaining after payment of the outstanding debt.\" (Compl. \u00b6 133.) But instead of demanding such a foreclosure, Smith and Marcum-whom the Wells Fargo Defendants knew to be \"deeply concerned about their potential [legal] exposure\" (Compl. \u00b6 248)-acceded to Wells Fargo's alleged demands that they enter into a new agreement that represented a much worse deal for Lifetrade (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 254-55, 257). And, to top it all off, the Wells Fargo Defendants specifically required that Smith and Marcum agree to conceal certain aspects of the Settlement Agreement from investors. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 258-59.) These allegations are sufficient to raise a plausible inference that the Wells Fargo Defendants well knew that Smith and Marcum were doing wrong by Lifetrade's investors and yet decided to steam ahead with the Settlement Agreement nonetheless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   As for substantial assistance, the Wells Fargo Defendants argue only that their exercise of a contractual foreclosure right cannot, as a matter of law, constitute substantial assistance of a fiduciary breach. (Dkt. No. 89 at 36.) To be sure, the \"mere demand for the repayment of a bona fide debt does not constitute a corrupt inducement to establish aiding and abetting liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnet v. Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund LP\n   </em>\n   , No. 14 Civ. 1376,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204393320\">\n    2014 WL 4393320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2014). But, again, the Wells Fargo Defendants are alleged to have done more than make a demand for repayment. According to the complaint-which the Court must for present purposes take to be true-had the Wells Fargo Defendants simply wanted to collect what they were owed, they could have invoked the foreclosure procedures in the preexisting Loan Agreement. Instead, though, they are alleged to have exploited Smith and Marcum's personal concerns in order to wring yet more out of Lifetrade. While the evidence might in the end show this narrative to be fanciful, of course, the Court must assume its truth for now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   The Court denies the Wells Fargo Defendants' motion to dismiss Count Thirteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Foreign-Law Claims (Counts Twelve, Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three, and Twenty-Four)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   Plaintiffs' final set of claims consists of four counts arising under foreign law. One count charges the Lifetrade Defendants with violations of Cura\u00e7ao law (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 242-46), one count charges all defendants except Wells Fargo with violations of Argentina's consumer-protection statute (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 324-26; Dkt. No. 102 at 24 n.30), one count charges all defendants with violations of Argentina's tort law (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 327-30), and one count-brought on behalf of the Japanese plaintiffs only-charges all defendants with violations of Japanese law (\n   <em>\n    Benedetto\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 6087, Dkt. No. 48 \u00b6\u00b6 331-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   For the most part, the moving defendants' arguments in favor of dismissing these foreign-law claims are identical to their arguments in favor of dismissing Plaintiffs' common-law claims.

And Plaintiffs themselves identify no meaningful distinctions between New York law and the laws of the various jurisdictions they invoke. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 102 at 24 n.30.) Rather, Plaintiffs explain that \"[t]he foreign law counts simply provide notice of additional laws, in addition to those of New York, under which Plaintiffs believe they would be entitled to relief based upon the facts alleged in the body of the complaint if the Court's choice-of-law analysis determines that the laws of those jurisdictions are applicable.\" (Dkt. No. 106 at 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   The Court reiterates that New York's substantive law applies to this action in the absence of a conflict between New York law and the law of another relevant jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5251159\" index=\"551\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/410/#p415\">\n    471 F.3d at 422-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because none of the defendants' opening briefs argued for dismissal of Plaintiffs' foreign-law claims on the grounds that they are duplicative, the Court will allow these claims to remain in the case for now.

As the Court has noted, though,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.C.3.a.i.b.III, this presumption applies to claims under the federal securities laws and is not typically recognized in cases applying New York common law.\n    <em>\n     See Sec.

(Dkt. No. 95 at 34.) As the Court has explained, an investor that put money into the Lifetrade Funds after that date might have relied on statements made prior to that date when deciding to do so-and the reasonableness of any such reliance is a question of fact that requires a more developed record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-406\">\n    In addition, Plaintiffs identify allegedly false statements that Smith and Marcum made in the lead-up to the Settlement Agreement in an effort to convince investors to support the surrender of Lifetrade's assets. (Compl. \u00b6 128 &amp; n.19.) And Plaintiffs also identify several false statements that Smith and Marcum allegedly made after the execution of the Settlement Agreement in the hopes of dissuading investors from comprehending the extent of their losses. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 165-66.) Because these statements were made after the March 2012 suspension of redemptions, though, they cannot form the basis for a fraud claim for the reasons already given.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-407\">\n    Because the Court has concluded that the allegedly fraudulent communications issued to investors in connection with the Settlement Agreement are not actionable as a result of Plaintiffs' failure to plausibly allege detrimental reliance,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.C.3.b.i, the Court need not consider whether Plaintiffs' failure to attribute each of these less formal communications to a specific defendant would otherwise bar Plaintiffs from relying on them as a basis for their common-law fraud claims. And because the Court has dismissed all claims against Portsmouth,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.B.2.a.iii, it need not consider whether Plaintiffs have offered a plausible basis for inferring Portsmouth's role in the challenged communications.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-408\">\n    As above,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 30, the Court has not been asked to decide whether Plaintiffs' fraud claims fail to the extent that Plaintiffs themselves-as opposed to their investment advisors-are not alleged to have received the allegedly fraudulent communications. The Court therefore takes no view on the matter at present.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-409\">\n    The Lifetrade Movants also argue that reliance on these life expectancy graphics would not have been reasonable because Lifetrade's financial statements warned that the underlying life insurance policies \"might not mature within the expected time period[,] exposing [Lifetrade] to additional risk.\" (Dkt. No. 77-6 at 23;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 95 at 32.) The Lifetrade Movants, however, offer no authority for the idea that this single disclaimer made it unreasonable as a matter of law for Plaintiffs to expect that the life expectancy figures Lifetrade chose to publish would at least be methodologically sound.\n    <em>\n     Cf., e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master) v.
