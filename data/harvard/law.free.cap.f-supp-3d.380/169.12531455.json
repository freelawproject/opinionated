Defendants also ask the Court to narrow the scope of its previous ruling, for example, by defining \"government officials\" and \"public space.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees that a declaratory judgment is sufficient to give effect to the Court's ruling but declines the request to narrow the holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should enter a declaratory judgment that fixes the bounds of constitutionally permissible conduct rather than issue an injunction. They contend that a declaratory judgment is a less drastic, non-coercive remedy that will have the same practical effect as an injunction and will better comport with the principles of federalism and comity. They also argue for various provisions not contained in the Court's December 10 order, including: (1) a definition of \"public space\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   as \"a traditional or designated public forum\"; a more robust definition of \"government official\"; and an affirmative declaration that Section 99 is still enforceable against a person who surreptitiously records the communications of someone other than a \"government official.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Declaratory Judgment or Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first question is whether the Court should issue a declaratory judgment rather than an injunction.

Because there is room for disagreement about whether a restriction is reasonable, the threat of contempt for violation of the injunction is too blunt and coercive an enforcement mechanism in situations where decision-making is necessarily split second. Second, the Court has not defined the meaning of \"public space\" or \"government official.\" The issuance of an injunction could effectively implicate a judicial second-guessing of the policing function to determine whether the order was violated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Badger Catholic, Inc. v.

As evidence, they point to the fact that Defendants continued to enforce Section 99 for eight years following the First Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Glik v. Cunniffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/#p83\">\n    655 F.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (1st Cir. 2011), \"that the First Amendment protects the filming of government officials in public spaces.\" Further, they contend Defendants enforced Section 99 one time during the pendency of this litigation, even after the Court denied their motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that Defendants will not comply with its decision going forward. The Court has interpreted\n   <em>\n    Glik\n   </em>\n   \"as standing for the proposition that the First Amendment protects the right to record audio and video of government officials, including law enforcement officers, performing their duties in public, subject only to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828414\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/78/#p83\">\n    at 97-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
