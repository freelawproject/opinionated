Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20-25. Because genuine issues of fact exist as to when each Plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of damages to their land, summary judgment is inappropriate on Defendant's statute of limitations defense to Plaintiffs' negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    III. Unjust Enrichment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim for unjust enrichment because (1) Plaintiffs have adequate remedies at law in their claims for nuisance and negligence, (2) the undisputed facts do not support a claim for unjust enrichment, and (3) the statute of limitations has run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 54-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Regarding Defendant's first argument, Plaintiffs object that they may pursue their unjust enrichment claim as an alternative theory of recovery under Oklahoma and Tenth Circuit law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. at 54-55. The Court agrees that Oklahoma law permits plaintiffs to pursue both legal and equitable alternative claims, provided that plaintiffs do not receive double recovery for the same injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry.

App. Div. 1996) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to Defendant's second argument, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs have \"no evidence\" establishing the elements of an unjust enrichment claim, which include that there be an enrichment to another, coupled with a resulting injustice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 54-55 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Tulsa v.
