Rather than treating entire email chains as a \"record,\" defendants took a narrower approach and defined a \"record\" to be each individual email in the chain \"based on whether the author was an official at one of the agencies.\" Defs.' Reply at 3. The practical effect of this approach is that when an agency employee replied to an email emanating from Congress and the previous exchanges were included in the response, defendants redacted from the thread any email that was authored by Congress on the grounds that it was a \"non-responsive record.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 3 to Pl.'s Cross-Mot. [Dkt. # 16-6] (\"HHS FOIA Production\"); Ex. 4 to Pl.'s Cross-Mot. [Dkt. # 16-7] (\"OMB FOIA Production\"). Defendants insist that their approach is justified because plaintiff's request \"sought only emails from\n   <em>\n    the agencies\n   </em>\n   , not emails from Congress or back-and-forth exchanges between Congress and the agencies,\" therefore, \"[e]mails from Congress ... were not responsive to the requests, and the agencies did not produce them.\" Defs.'

According to defendants, the request is\n   limited on its face to emails authored by agency personnel. Defs.' Mem. at 11. Plaintiff insists that a plain interpretation of the request requires the agencies to produce anything that was sent or contained in an email from the agencies, including the prior exchanges that prompted the particular email at the top of the chain. Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 5. Plaintiff points out that if the agencies wished to reply to Congress without including prior communications, they could have easily composed a brand new email or changed their email settings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 7-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court finds defendants' approach to be unduly literal and stingy, and it agrees that plaintiff's position is more consistent with the day-to-day reality of electronic communication as well as the general legal principles to be applied in FOIA cases. While plaintiff could have been more clear in framing its request, it is commonly understood that an email chain operates as a single record. The very nature of a \"reply\" - as opposed to a \"new message\" - necessarily implies that the communication is responsive to the message that came before, and therefore it incorporates what came before, and the two form a unified exchange.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, in many instances, a reply email (\"I agree.\" \"No.\" or \"LOL\") simply cannot be understood without reference to the previous message. Thus, the prior messages received from Congress not only appear physically within the agencies' outgoing emails, but they were incorporated into the agencies' communications. Whether that was a conscious or subconscious choice is irrelevant; what matters is that the emails sent by agency personnel did in fact contain the prior exchanges with Congressional staff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court finds that the FOIA request covers the redacted information so long as it was included as in-line text in the agencies' sent emails, regardless of whether the agency authored each email in the chain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The redacted emails do not qualify as \"intra-agency\" communications under Exemption 5.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, plaintiff challenges defendants' reliance on Exemption 5 to withhold responsive records on the ground that they are protected under the deliberative process privilege. Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 18-40.

The HHS declarant avers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   HHS personnel discussed potential options with congressional staff for how HHS might implement its new authority if Congress were to pass healthcare legislation. These predecisional discussions were part of a broader decision-making process at HHS by which agency staff evaluated how Congress might view or react to future HHS administrative or regulatory action regarding health care reform. In addition, hearing potential ideas from members of Congress and congressional staff working to enact healthcare reform was important to the former Secretary and influenced decisions at HHS by helping the agency understand broader congressional perspectives about how healthcare reform might be implemented in terms of administrative action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Decl. of Sarah Arbes [Dkt. # 14-3] (\"Arbes Decl.\") \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Similarly, the OMB declarant avers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The record released in part is an email message exchanged between OMB staff and congressional staff. The information withheld from that email is pre-decisional because it was generated prior to agency decision-makers arriving at a final decision or taking a final action with regard to potential regulatory actions regarding health care. Specifically, the record was generated as OMB and other agencies were preparing assessments of possible regulatory actions the Administration could take, a process in which the Administration solicited and welcomed input from Congress. The withheld information in this record is deliberative because it reveals details of the process for undertaking that assessment\n   and preliminary options related to the assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Decl. of Heather Walsh [Dkt. # 14-4] (\"Walsh Decl.\") \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff contends that defendants have failed to meet Exemption 5's threshold requirement: that the material constitute \"inter-agency\" or \"intra-agency communications.\" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 18-37.

Here, putting aside the narrow legal question of whether the mere existence of some independent interest in the topic on the part of the outsider is disqualifying, the record does not support a finding that the communications with Congress \"played essentially the same part in an agency's process of deliberation as documents prepared by agency personnel.\"\n   <em>\n    Klamath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n    532 U.S. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300487\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/1/#p8\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
