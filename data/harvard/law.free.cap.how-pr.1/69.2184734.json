The plaintiffs show that there is twenty-one other causes of the same kind (being actions of trover), between the same plaintiff\u2019s and different defendants; that fifteen of said causes were noticed for trial at said November circuit, one of which was tried and a verdict rendered for defendant. Exceptions were taken by plaintiffs for the purpose of having the questions of law settled by this court or the court for the correction of errors, and the circuit judge refused to try at said circuit either of the other causes which involved the same questions of law. The defendant now moves for judgment as in case of non-suit in this and the six other causes involving the same question, which were not noticed at said November circuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-8\">M.
