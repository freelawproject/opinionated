It was stipulated that a judgment of the court might be entered on the report of the referees, in the same manner and to the same effect as if the cause were properly referable; after the referees reported, the defendant served his affidavit with a view to move to set aside the report; the plaintiff served his counter affidavit^ and the referees reported a statement of the evidence and points made before them. The cause was put on the calendar at the last May term, and was stricken therefrom because the defendant had not served the plaintiff with a copy of the papers, which it was his duty to furnish the court pursuant to the 48th Rule. Defendant objected to the allowance of any costs except for the judgment record and the fees of entering up the judgment, insisting that the reference was a submission to arbitration, and that the report of the referees was a mere award of arbitrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-7\">The court overruled the objection, and decided that costs were allowable the same as if the cause were referable; that the plaintiff had merely opposed proceedings, wffiich the defendant should not have taken.
