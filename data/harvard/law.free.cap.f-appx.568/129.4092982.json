For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">On March 10, 2011, the Pellegrinos suffered storm damage to their home, including damage to small portions of their roof and three faces of siding. Prior to this date, the Pellegrinos had obtained a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy from State Farm. This policy contained the following provision concerning coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-18\">1. Al\u2014Replacement Cost Loss Settlement\u2014Similar Construction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atj\">a. We will pay the cost to repair or replace with <em>similar </em>construction ... the damaged part of the property covered under [a previous provision], subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-19\">(1) until actual repair or replacement is completed, we will pay only the <em>actual cash value </em>at the time of the loss of <em>the damaged part of the property, </em>up to the applicable [policy] limit ..., not to exceed the cost to repair or replace <em>the damaged part of the property;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-20\">(2) when the repair or replacement is actually completed, we will pay the covered additional amount you actually and necessarily spend to repair or replace <em>the damaged part of the property </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-21\">J.A. 142 (emphasis added). At the Pelleg-rinos\u2019 request, State Farm provided an estimate for the damage. In a section titled \u201cSummary for Dwelling,\u201d the estimate lists a \u201cReplacement Cost Value\u201d of $27,105.77. This value includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the cost to replace the damaged portions of the Pellegrinos\u2019 roof and siding; it does not include the cost to replace the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>roof and siding. From this \u201cReplacement Cost Value,\u201d depreciation, general contractor overhead and profit on depreciation, and the Pellegrinos\u2019 deductible are subtracted to produce a \u201cNet Actual Cash Value Payment\u201d of $17,091.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The next section, titled \u201cMaximum Additional Amounts Available If Incurred,\u201d lists a \u201cTotal Amount of Claim if Incurred\u201d of $43,711.21. This value includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the cost to replace the Pellegrinos\u2019 entire roof and three entire faces of siding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cost of full replacement is classified as a \u201cPaid When Incurred (PWI)\u201d item. The term \u201cPaid When Incurred\u201d does not appear in the insurance policy, but is defined on this summary page as \u201citems, which may not be necessary to the repair of your property damaged by a covered loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">After receiving this estimate, the Pelleg-rinos chose not to undergo a full roof and siding replacement and seek reimbursement from State Farm. Instead, they filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, alleging that State Farm was required to pay them the cost of a full roof and siding replacement as part of the \u201cActual Cash Value Payment,\u201d regardless of whether these repairs were actually made. The complaint alleges that State Farm had determined that it was contractually obligated to replace the entire roof and the siding on three faces of the house because a partial repair could not be completed with \u201cmatching\u201d materials. Despite this determination, the Pellegrinos argued, State Farm imposed an impermissible precondition to reimbursement by designating full-replacement costs as \u201cPWI\u201d and deducting them from the \u201cActual Cash Value Payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">State Farm removed the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The Pellegrinos amended their complaint on May 15, 2012, alleging that State Farm\u2019s refusal to pay them the full actual cash value of their loss constituted a breach of contract, bad faith, and a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (\u201cUTPCPL\u201d), 73 Pa. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">On July 29, 2013, the District Court granted State Farm\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and. held that \u201cthere is no duty upon State Farm, either within the contract or derived from Pennsylvania law, to provide its insureds with matching costs on an actual cash value basis prior to repair or replacement.\u201d J.A. 15-16. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d) and 1453, and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a) and 1367. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review of a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 212, 220 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">For substantially the reasons advanced by the District Court, we agree that neither the contract nor state law imposes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>duty upon State Farm to pay the cost of full replacement of the Pellegrinos\u2019 roof and siding as part of the \u201cActual Cash Value Payment.\u201d Further, we note that because State Farm has agreed to pay the costs of these repairs once they are contracted to be completed, there is no risk that the Pellegrinos will not be made whole or be burdened with the obligation of paying for the repairs up front. <em>See Kane v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>841 A.2d 1038, 1050 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003) (allowing insurer to deduct depreciation costs from its actual cash value payment when insurer agreed to pay such costs once the repairs were contracted to be completed). We also agree that allowing the Pellegri-nos to recover the cost of replacing their entire roof and siding when they had no intention of undertaking these repairs would result in a \u201cwindfall\u201d and produce \u201cabsurd results.\u201d J.A. 15 &amp; n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed the Pelleg-rinos\u2019 breach of contract claim. Because the Pellegrinos\u2019 bad faith and UTPCPL claims require proof that State Farm breached its contract, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed these claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\">. As the District Court and State Farm note, the \"Total Amount of Claim if Incurred\u201d value does not technically include full replacement of all the shingles on the roof. Instead, it includes the cost of an alternative and costlier method of replacing the damaged shingles on the roof\u2014a method that State Farm did not predict would be necessary. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the term \u201cfull replacement\u201d of the roof to refer to this alternative method of replacing the damaged shingles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
