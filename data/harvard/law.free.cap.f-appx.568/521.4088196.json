We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">1. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Defendants\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See United States v. Chapman, </em>642 F.3d 1236, 1240 (9th Cir.2011). First, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that no relief was warranted under Rule 60(b)(2) because the purported new evidence was discovered prior to the entry of judgment. <em>See Jones v. AerolChem Corp., </em>921 F.2d 875, 878 (9th Cir.1990). Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief under Rule 60(b)(4) because the district court\u2019s amended judgment only bound Melissa Johnson in her official capacity as an officer of Defendants. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d)(2); <em>N.L.R.B. v. Sequoia Dist. Council of Carpenters, AFL-CIO, </em>568 F.2d 628, 633-34 (9th Cir.1977). Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion under Rule 60(b)(6) because, notwithstanding any representations by Defendants\u2019 attorney that the Settlement Agreement that Johnson signed was non-binding, the agreement was only 6 pages long and was expressly labeled as \u201cbinding,\u201d \u201cfinal,\u201d and \u201cenforceable.\u201d Thus, enforcement of the agreement was not manifestly unjust. <em>Latshaw v. Trainer Wortham &amp; Co., Inc., </em>452 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">2. Because we conclude that relief from the Settlement Agreement and resulting judgment is not warranted under Rule 60(b), we need .not resolve Defendants\u2019 other arguments regarding whether the district court properly (1) dismissed Defendants\u2019 counterclaims, and (2) entered a preliminary injunction against Defendants. <em>See Slaven v. Am. Trading Transp. Co., Inc., </em>146 F.3d 1066, 1070 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
