For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">Wayton, a former mine worker, suffered an on-the-job injury on April 10, 1997, that resulted in hip and back issues. Following two surgeries, Wayton returned to work in January 1998. Shortly thereafter, however, he was unable to work because of recurrent back pain, and his last day of work was April 22, 1998. After reporting that his pain was \u201cexquisitely worse in a very severe way,\u201d Wayton opted to undergo a repeat laminectomy/discectomy to address his back issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">Before he could undergo a third back surgery, Wayton visited the hospital on July 20, 2008, complaining of a loss of peripheral vision in his right eye and headaches. He also reported that he had been experiencing slurred speech with numbness in his tongue starting about two to three weeks prior to his hospital visit. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>was later diagnosed with a \u201ccerebrovascu-lar accident,\u201d more commonly known as a stroke. Thus, he was unable to undergo his scheduled back surgery. In December 1998, Wayton presented at the hospital complaining of symptoms consistent with a second stroke. He was later diagnosed with cerebral lesions that likely represented multiples strokes.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In February 1999, Wayton applied for disability benefits with the Social Security Administration (SSA), indicating a disability onset date of April 22, 1998. The SSA approved his disability claim, finding that Wayton \u201cbecame disabled under [the SSA] rules on July 1, 1998,\u201d and listed Wayton\u2019s primary diagnosis as organic mental disorders with a secondary diagnosis of \u201cMate effects of cerebrovascular disease.\u201d Additionally, the SSA determined that Wayton met Listing 12.02, i.e., for organic mental disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Wayton then applied for disability benefits through UMWA. Under the terms of the Pension Trust, disability benefits are available to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">Any Participant who (a) has less than 10 years of signatory service prior to retirement and (b) becomes totally disabled as a result of a mine accident .... A Participant shall be considered to be totally disabled only if by reason of such accident such Participant is subsequently determined to be eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance [SSDI] Benefits ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The Pension Trust\u2019s processing manual provides that a combination of injuries can result in a disability. Specifically, section 612.232 explains that a mining-related injury that is \u201caggravated or compounded\u201d by a later condition, unrelated to the mine accident, can render a claimant \u201ctotally disabled as the result of a mine accident,\u201d so long as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">1. The condition which resulted from a mine accident contributed substantially to the total disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">2. The condition which was not the result of a mine accident was a foreseeable or normal consequence of the condition which was the result of a mine accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-10\">3. The existence of the condition which resulted from a mine accident substantially increased the probability that the condition which did not result from a mine accident would occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">As such, the Pension Trust requires a causal link between a mining accident and the disabling condition. To determine whether this link exists, the Pension Trustees consider, among other things, the applicant\u2019s \u201cSSDI determinations and the correlation between the effective date of the SSDI award and the most recent mine accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">UMWA denied Wayton\u2019s claim, determining that he had failed to establish his eligibility for pension benefits because his SSDI award was based on his repeated strokes and was not related to his mining accident. Wayton appealed the denial, but the UMWA Trustees reiterated that Way-ton was \u201cnot disabled due to the mining accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">Wayton then filed suit in district court. As relevant to the instant appeal, he filed a motion to compel requesting: \u201c(1) governing documents, including procedure manuals, which were available to the Trustees when Wayton\u2019s benefit determination was made; and (2) miners\u2019 redacted pensioners files similarly situated to Wayton who were awarded disability benefits.\u201d The district court denied Wayton\u2019s motion because the court\u2019s review was limited to facts in the administrative record, and the request was overly broad and unduly burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>UMWA moved for summary judgment. In response, Wayton filed a Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion to continue or deny UMWA\u2019s summary judgment motion to allow him additional time to complete discovery. The district court, in turn, granted UMWA summary judgment on the basis that Way-ton failed to establish that a mining accident caused his disability. Additionally, the court denied Wayton\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion for the same reasons it denied his earlier motion to compel. The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards that bound the district court. <em>Callahan v. Point Clear Holdings, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir.2009). A district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance of a summary judgment motion in order to conduct discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Burks v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>212 F.3d 1333, 1336 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">ERISA itself does not provide a standard for courts to review the benefits determinations of plan administrators or fiduciaries. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). With <em>Firestone </em>and <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Company v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008), as guides, however, this Circuit has formulated a multi-step framework for courts reviewing an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s benefits decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">(1) Apply the <em>de novo </em>standard to determine whether the claim administrator\u2019s benefits-denial decision is \u201cwrong\u201d (i.e., the court disagrees with the administrator\u2019s decision); if it is not, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">(2) If the administrator\u2019s decision in fact is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong,\u201d then determine whether he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial inquiry and reverse the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">(3) If the administrator\u2019s decision is <em>\u201cde novo </em>wrong\u201d and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims, then determine whether \u201creasonable\u201d grounds supported it (hence, review his decision under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-11\">(4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry and reverse the administrator\u2019s decision; if reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he operated under a conflict of interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\">(5) If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-13\">(6) If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a factor for the court to take into account when determining whether an administrator\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-14\"><em>Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2011). Under this multi-step framework, the claimant bears the burden of proving that he is disabled and that the administrator\u2019s decision was wrong. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-16\">After review, we conclude that UMWA\u2019s decision was <em>de novo </em>correct, and thus survives scrutiny under either a <em>de novo </em>or arbitrary or capricious standard. In this case, there is no dispute that Wayton suffered a mining accident and that he was totally disabled. Under the terms of the Pension Trust, however, Way-ton had to show that his mining accident was the cause of his disability, or combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>with a later condition to cause his disability. Wayton failed to meet his burden. Although Wayton applied for SSDI benefits based on his back pain and strokes, the SSA awarded him benefits starting on July 1, 1998, following the onset of symptoms related solely to his cerebrovascular condition. This was approximately fifteen months after his mining accident in April 1997. Wayton places great emphasis on the fact that the SSA set his disability onset date as July 1, 1998, which preceded his first hospital visit related to his strokes on July 20, 1998. Wayton, however, fails to acknowledge that by his own admission he started exhibiting stroke-like symptoms weeks before he went to the hospital. Therefore, the SSA\u2019s disability onset date correlates with the onset of his stroke symptoms. <em>See </em>SSR 83-20 (noting that relevant factors in determining the disability onset date include a claimant\u2019s allegations, work history, and medical and other evidence related to the severity of the impairment). Moreover, Wayton failed to present any evidence to suggest that his back injury contributed to his stroke symptoms or factored into the SSA\u2019s disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Wayton relies on a November 1, 2000, letter from his treating physician, Dr. Gay-lon Rogers, to show that his back condition was substantially responsible for his disability. Dr. Rogers, however, never rendered such an opinion. Rather, Dr. Rogers broadly explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">[Wayton\u2019s] real issue is about a restriction on obtaining apparently his employer\u2019s permanent disability plan and reimbursement due to his injury.... I have explained to him that it seems to me that this is a problem outside of my expertise; however, I certainly, with this note, could validate the fact that he had a significant lumbar spine problem which in all likelihood would have prevented him from returning to work and heavy labor underground regardless of the presence or absence of cardiovascular difficulties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">As highlighted by the district court, however, this letter is inconsistent with Dr. Rogers\u2019s earlier treatment notes explaining that Wayton intended to undergo additional back surgeries in order to return to work prior to the onset of his strokes. For example, in February 1999, Dr. Gaylon stated that a \u201cproposed spinal stabilization might or might not let [Way-ton] return to work in the mines, but as a practical matter, he is not able to pursue that at this point for non work-related medical reasons.\u201d Dr. Gaylon also opined that Wayton was at \u201c[maximum medical improvement] status at least for the time being with a 10-20% permanent impairment based on the back problem.\u201d As such, Dr. Gaylon seemed to view Wayton\u2019s back condition as temporary and anticipated that additional surgeries might have led to further improvement, absent the independent onset of Wayton\u2019s cerebrovascular condition in July 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Based on the administrative record available to UMWA when it made its decision, <em>see Blankenship, </em>644 F.3d at 1354 (review of benefits denial is limited to consideration of the material available to the administrator at the time it made its decision), we cannot conclude that UMWA\u2019s decision was <em>de novo </em>wrong, thus ending our inquiry under our multi-step framework. Accordingly, the district court properly granted UMWA\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">Finally, we note that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wayton\u2019s motion for additional time to conduct discovery under Rule 56(f). Although Wayton alleges that he needed access to the Pension Trust\u2019s \u201cinterpretive Q &amp; As\u201d and the redacted files of similarly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>situated pensioners, he fails to indicate how this information would have aided him in establishing the necessary causal connection between his work-related injuries and his disability. <em>See Barfield v. Brier-ton, </em>883 F.2d 923, 931 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe nonmovant may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts, but must show the court how the stay will operate to permit him to rebut, through discovery, the movant\u2019s contentions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\">. Cox replaced Wayton in the instant action after Wayton\u2019s death in 2012. For the sake of consistency and clarity, we continue to refer to the Appellant as Wayton.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
