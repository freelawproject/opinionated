Straus, denying as a matter of discretion his application to adjust status. <em>In re Edward Maciejowski, </em>No. A099 158 685 (B.I.A. Apr. 5, 2013), <em>aff'g </em>No. A099 158 685 (Immig. Ct. Hartford June 14, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We have considered both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of completeness.\u201d <em>Zaman v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 233, 237 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion to deny Maciejowski\u2019s application to adjust status. <em>See Guyadin v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 465, 468-69 (2d Cir. 2006). We do retain jurisdiction to review <em>de novo </em>\u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Pierre v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 767, 772 (2d Cir.2009). However, \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to review any legal argument that is so insubstantial and frivolous as to be inadequate to invoke federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 40 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Maciejowski\u2019s arguments are not color-able. First, contrary to his main contention, the IJ and BIA did not rely solely on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019 determination that he married to obtain immigration benefits: the IJ afforded Maciejowski the opportunity to supplement the record with evidence relevant to the bona fide nature of his marriage. Second, probative record evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that his marriage was fraudulent and entered into for the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Since Maciejowski fails to raise a color-able constitutional claim or question of law, we are without jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Guyad-in, </em>449 F.3d at 468-69; <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
