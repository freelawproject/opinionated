(\u201cFIP\u201d), a private security company that provided security services for the Magic Outlet Mall in Orlando, appeals the final judgment against it on the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims for false detention. FIP challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law, contending that it cannot be held liable for false detention because the plaintiffs\u2019 brief detention by the Orange County Sheriffs Department was not unlawful and, in any event, it did nothing more than accurately report the commission of a crime. FIP also challenges the denial of its motion for a new trial, which impugned the district court for failing to disclose a jury question on damages and for issuing a response that materially altered the jury instructions on compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b852-18\">Darryel \u201cWhite Folks\u201d Woodson, a black writer, entertainer, and self-styled \u201cplayer,\u201d has published two books and produced a series of popular YouTube videos, which have amassed an online following of some 300,000 viewers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the help and financial backing of T.D. Bryson, Woodson assembled an all-black film crew to travel from Atlanta, Georgia, to Orlando, Florida, during the weekend of November 22, 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>to shoot some footage during the annual Florida Classic football game. In addition to Woodson and Bryson, the group consisted of Charles Wilson, Jr., Calvin Ivory, Monica Bartley, Neisha Higgs, Edrichus Sykes, and Kevin Wallace. Wallace, a Georgia police officer, and Sykes, an unlicensed private security guard, were hired to provide security for the film crew and to enhance Woodson\u2019s cultivated image as an important entertainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In the early evening hours of November 22, 2008, the six men and two women huddled into a rented stretch limousine and made a brief stop at the Magic Outlet Mall in Orlando so that Wallace, who was ill-prepared for the unexpectedly cold night, could buy a long-sleeve shirt. Wallace, the off-duty Georgia police officer, was carrying a concealed weapon. Sykes, his fellow bodyguard, wore a dark-colored battle dress uniform and bullet-proof vest with no identifying insignia, patches, or other markings, and was openly carrying a .380 semi-automatic handgun in his hip holster. He assumed that his Georgia firearm permit, which covered both concealed and open carry, allowed him to tote an exposed firearm in Florida as well. Unbeknownst to Sykes, Florida\u2019s reciprocity with Georgia did not extend to openly carrying a firearm; instead, that act qualified as a second-degree misdemeanor under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 790.053.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">After the group pulled into the mail\u2019s parking lot, Wallace headed straight into the mall while the others momentarily lingered outside the limousine. An FIP security guard slowly drove past, spotted Sykes, and called in a report to his colleagues of a man in a battle dress uniform openly carrying a firearm. Five or six mall security guards, including FIP Chief David Hesselink, arrived in their marked security cars, got out with their guns drawn, and trained their weapons on the group. With his hands in the air, Sykes approached Hesselink, voluntarily produced his Georgia identification card and firearm permit, and informed Hesselink that he and Wallace were providing security for the rest of the group while they filmed around Orlando. Sykes also told Hesselink that Wallace, who had already entered the mall, was a Georgia police officer and was carrying a concealed firearm. Although Hesselink knew that it was a second-degree misdemeanor in Florida to openly carry a firearm, he neglected to mention that fact to Sykes and allowed him to enter the mall with his exposed handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Once Hesselink released the group, Bartley, Higgs, Woodson, and Ivory overheard him say into his radio that everything was \u201call clear\u201d and that the group members were just a bunch of \u201c \u201cwannabe\u2019 rappers.\u201d Taking umbrage at that final remark, Ivory shot back, \u201cJust like you a \u2018wannabe\u2019 cop.\u201d Hesselink replied, \u2018We\u2019ll see about that.\u201d After the remaining group members entered the mall, Hessel-ink promptly placed a 911 call to the Orange County Sheriffs Department, reporting \u201ctwo individuals, signal zero, inside [the] mall,\u201d one of whom was \u201csupposedly a Georgia police officer\u201d and the other who was working \u201cprotection,\u201d sporting a battle dress uniform with an exposed firearm, and had produced a Georgia firearm permit when stopped outside the mall. A \u201csignal zero\u201d denotes either armed, use caution, or armed threat, and it automatically triggers an urgent \u201ccode three\u201d police response with \u201clights and sirens.\u201d Hessel-ink also told the 911 operator that his security guards were themselves \u201csignal zero,\u201d suggesting that he understood that signal to simply mean armed, and that they were going to \u201cblock off the entrances\u201d to the mall and \u201ctry to contain [the two men] or at least know where they are once your deputies get here.\u201d Hessel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>ink did not mention anyone but Sykes and Wallace, nor did he expressly request any particular police response.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">While the plaintiffs insist that a \u201csignal zero\u201d unambiguously signifies a single thing\u2014an armed threat\u2014the record does not support that limited interpretation. At trial, both the 911 operator and the 911 dispatcher testified that it can mean either armed person or armed threat; that it is an appropriate signal to use when someone is openly carrying a firearm; and that they would have converted Hesselink\u2019s 911 call into a \u201csignal zero\u201d had he simply reported a man carrying an exposed firearm. Even the plaintiffs\u2019 own security expert, Donald Schultz, conceded that a \u201csignal zero\u201d can signify \u201carmed and caution\u201d or \u201carmed and dangerous,\u201d and the parties\u2019 final joint pretrial statement indicated that it is \u201cpolice language for an armed person/threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Within minutes of dialing 911 (and while he was still on the phone), Hesselink could hear a police helicopter circling overhead and patrol units \u201ccoming code three,\u201d facts which he relayed to the 911 operator. Nearly a dozen police officers, which included an emergency response team clad in tactical uniforms and equipped with automatic weapons, arrived on the scene. When the film crew eventually exited the mall together, they were confronted by the full contingent of armed officers yelling \u201cwatch out for crossfire\u201d and commanding them to lay face down on the ground with their hands behind their backs. The officers handcuffed and frisked some of the group members, briefly questioned them, and then released each and every one of them without charge or arrest. Bartley overheard one of the police officers say, \u201csecurity lied to us.\u201d Once the entire incident had blown over, a number of FIP security personnel, including Chief Hessel-ink, openly laughed about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">In July 2010, Bartley, Higgs, Woodson, Bryson, Wallace, Ivory, and Sykes filed a civil suit in Florida against FIP and the Sheriff of Orange County, alleging claims under state and federal law for unlawful detention, illegal search, assault and battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the case was removed to federal court, Wilson joined the suit and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. That complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages against FIP under Florida law for (1) false detention or imprisonment; (2) illegal search, seizure, and battery; and (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress. The crux of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against FIP was that \u201c[a]s a direct and proximate result of ... Chief Hesselink\u2019s 911 call to the [police], [they were] physically stopped, forcibly assaulted, detained and forced at gunpoint to lay face first on the ground by the [police] as [they attempted] to leave the Magic Outlet Mall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">FIP moved for summary judgment on each and every claim against it, asserting that the undisputed facts showed that Sykes was openly carrying a firearm in violation of Florida law, which provided probable cause to lawfully detain all of the plaintiffs. The district court granted the motion as to Sykes\u2019 claims given the clear probable cause to detain him for illegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>carrying an exposed firearm. But the court denied the motion as to the claims of the seven remaining plaintiffs, observing that FIP had offered no argument or authority to support its \u201cimplicit proposition\u201d that the probable cause to detain Sykes \u201cextended to the other Plaintiffs in this case who are not accused of openly carrying a weapon or committing any other violation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Soon after, FIP filed a second motion for summary judgment on the claims of the seven remaining plaintiffs, which the court again granted in part and denied in part. The court granted summary judgment to FIP on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for illegal search, seizure, and battery. But it denied summary judgment on the claims for false detention and intentional infliction of emotional distress, finding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether FIP \u201cdirectly or indirectly procured\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 detention by the police, whether Hesselink\u2019s 911 call \u201cwent beyond merely providing information\u201d and \u201cwas made in good faith,\u201d and whether his \u201cconduct in calling 911 in the absence of any cognizable threat was reckless, if not intentional, because [ ] of the predicable response of local law enforcement officers.\u201d Before trial, the remaining plaintiffs reached a settlement with the Sheriff of Orange County and dismissed their claims against him. The case thus proceeded to trial on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against FIP for false detention and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 theory at trial, which they presented to the jury during opening and closing arguments, was that FIP was liable for false detention because Hesselink intentionally instigated, with malice and in bad faith, the events that culminated in their detention by needlessly calling 911 and then effectively lying to the police when he reported a \u201csignal zero\u201d in the absence of any actual or perceived threat. Critically, the plaintiffs did not contend that the police had acted unlawfully in briefly detaining them in order to investigate the 911 call. To the contrary, the plaintiffs, their attorney, and their own expert witness repeatedly conceded during the course of the trial that the police had acted appropriately under the circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For that very reason, FIP moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case and again at the close of all the evidence. The district court granted the motion as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but took the remaining portions of FIP\u2019s motion under advisement and submitted the surviving claims of false detention to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The court instructed the jury that in order to hold FIP liable for false detention, it had to find that the private security company intentionally caused the plaintiffs\u2019 restraint and that the restraint was unreasonable, unwarranted, and \u201cwithout lawful authority,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe Orange County Sheriffs Department did not act under color of or claim of lawful authority.\u201d In accordance with Florida\u2019s recognized \u201cprivilege of private citizens to provide, without fear of subsequent tort liability, information about suspected criminal activities to law enforcement officials,\u201d the court also admonished the jury that \u201c[i]f the private citizen makes an honest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>good faith mistake in reporting an incident, the mere fact that his communication to an officer may have caused the victim\u2019s restraint does not make him liable when he did not in fact request any detention.\u201d <em>See Pokorny v. First Fed. Savs. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n of Largo, </em>382 So.2d 678, 682 (Fla. 1980). And on the issue of compensatory damages, the court instructed the jury that if it found FIP guilty of procuring a false detention, it should award a sum that would \u201cfairly and adequately compensate\u201d each plaintiff for his or her \u201cmental anguish, inconvenience, humiliation and loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life.\u201d It cautioned, however, that \u201c[tjhere is no exact standard for measuring such damage,\u201d only that the measure of damages \u201cshould be fair and just in light of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">During its deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the court about damages: \u201cIf we were to find for the plaintiffs [sic], what monetary guidelines or limits do we have regarding compensatory or/and punitive damages[?]\u201d Without disclosing the jury\u2019s question to either party or giving them an opportunity to object to any proposed response, the court reiterated that \u201cthere is no exact standard for measuring [compensatory damages]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he amount should be fair and just in light of the evidence.\u201d Unlike its response to the punitive damages portion of the jury\u2019s question, which specifically directed the jury to \u201creview ... the punitive damages instruction,\u201d the court did not expressly refer the jury to the remainder of its original instructions on compensatory damages, including those limiting such damages to the mental anguish, inconvenience, humiliation, and loss of capacity for enjoyment of life suffered by each plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on their false detention claims, specifically finding that FIP \u201cparticipate[d], directly or indirectly by procurement, in the [plaintiffs\u2019] restraint\u201d and that the restraint was \u201cunreasonable, unwarranted and without legal authority.\u201d It awarded each of the seven remaining plaintiffs $50,000 in compensatory damages, for a total of $350,000, and awarded $2 million in punitive damages, which was later reduced by the court to $1,050,000, the maximum authorized by Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.73(l)(a) (providing that \u201can award of punitive damages may not exceed the greater of ... [t]hree times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each claimant\u201d or \u201c[t]he sum of $500,000.\u201d). After the jury issued its verdict, the district court denied FIP\u2019s outstanding motion for judgment as a matter of law on the false detention claims and entered judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">FIP later filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. FIP contended that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiffs\u2019 false detention claims for two independent reasons: (1) the undisputed testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert witness established that the police detention was lawful, which necessarily negated any claim for false detention; and (2) Hesselink\u2019s 911 call accurately informed the police about the commission of a crime and did not request any particular police response, which meant that FIP could not be held liable for procuring the plaintiffs\u2019 detention. FIP alternatively argued that it was entitled to a new trial because the district court failed to disclose the jury\u2019s question on damages and its response, by quoting \u201conly a limited portion\u201d of the instruction on compensatory damages, materially altered those instructions. The plaintiffs did not dispute FIP\u2019s assertion that their detention at the hands of the police was lawful; instead, they argued that Hesselink had \u201cmaliciously\u201d and \u201cwithout good faith\u201d set the whole incident in motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Although the district court agreed that a claim for false detention under Florida law requires proof of an unlawful detention, it nevertheless denied FIP\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 trial testimony \u201c[fell] short of undisputed testimony that [the police] detention of Plaintiffs was lawful,\u201d that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence before the jury to support a finding that Plaintiffs\u2019 restraint by [the police] was unlawful,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he jury was free ... to come to its own conclusion about the lawfulness of the detention by [the police].\u201d The court also denied FIP\u2019s request for a new trial, observing that it was not required to \u201cassemble the attorneys to go over\u201d the jury\u2019s question on damages, particularly given that the question was \u201crather simple,\u201d and that its response to the jury\u2019s question did not alter the given instructions on compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">FIP challenges the district court\u2019s denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, contending that the challenged detention by the Orange County Sheriffs Department was not unlawful and, in any event, that it cannot be held liable for procuring that detention based solely on Hesselink\u2019s 911 call, which accurately reported that Sykes was illegally carrying an exposed firearm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs do not directly respond to the contention that their police detention was lawful; instead, they assert that FIP\u2019s position \u201cbegs\u201d the \u201cdispositive\u201d question of whether Hesselink\u2019s actions in calling 911 and reporting a \u201csignal zero\u201d were motivated by malice. From that premise, they argue that FIP is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the jury reasonably could have found that Hesselink, after determining that Sykes did not pose an imminent threat and after letting him enter the mall, should never have called 911, effectively lied to the police by reporting a \u201csignal zero,\u201d and did so in bad faith and in retaliation for Ivory\u2019s comment that he was a \u201c \u2018wannabe\u2019 cop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, which \u201cmay be granted only if after examining all evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party ... there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party\u201d on a controlling legal issue. <em>Myers v. TooJay\u2019s Mgmt. Corp., </em>640 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). If the \u201cfacts are sufficiently clear that the law requires a particular result,\u201d the court should remove the case or certain issues from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Weisgram v. Marley Co., </em>528 U.S. 440, 448, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">We agree with FIP that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiffs\u2019 false detention claims because the plaintiffs did not, and could not, establish an essential element of those claims\u2014 that their brief detention at the hands of the Orange County Sheriffs Department was unlawful.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In Florida, the largely syn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>onymous torts of false arrest, false detention, and false imprisonment are \u201cdefined as \u2018the <em>unlawful restraint </em>of a person against his will, the gist of which action is the <em>unlawful detention </em>of the plaintiff and the deprivation of his liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Escambia Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. Bragg, </em>680 So.2d 571, 572 (Fla. 1st DCA 1996) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Weiner, </em>155 Fla. 169, 19 So.2d 699, 700 (1944)) (emphasis added); <em>see also Mathis v. Coats, </em>24 So.3d 1284, 1289 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010) (\u201cThe essential elements of a cause of action for false imprisonment include: (1) the <em>unlawful detention </em>and deprivation of liberty of a person; (2) against that person\u2019s will; (3) <em>without legal authority </em>or \u2018color of authority^ and (4) which is unreasonable and unwarranted under the circumstances.\u201d) (emphasis added). At a bare minimum, a plaintiff asserting a Florida claim for false detention must establish detention \u201ccontrary to his will and the unlawfulness of the detention.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers, Inc., </em>437 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Rivers v. Dillards Dep\u2019t Store, Inc., </em>698 So.2d 1328, 1331 (Fla. 1st DCA 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Tracking the definition <em>of </em>a false detention, the district court instructed the jury that FIP could not be held liable unless the police had acted \u201cwithout lawful authority\u201d in detaining the plaintiffs. Yet the plaintiffs, their attorney, and their own expert witness conceded throughout every phase of the trial, including in opening and closing arguments, that the police had \u201cacted appropriately\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d in detaining them. Those concessions, coupled with the plaintiffs\u2019 complete failure to even suggest to the jury that the police detention was unlawful, fatally undermined their claims for false detention. <em>Cf. N. Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Chatham Cnty., Ga., </em>547 U.S. 189, 195, 126 S.Ct. 1689, 1694, 164 L.Ed.2d 367 (2006) (finding a defendant\u2019s concession below that it was not entitled to sovereign immunity to be dispositive on that question); <em>Ross v. Jefferson Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>701 F.3d 655, 661 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that the plaintiffs deposition testimony that she did not feel \u201clike her termination had anything to do with her race\u201d was sufficient to warrant summary judgment in the employer\u2019s favor on her racial discrimination claim) (brackets and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 unflagging contention that the lawfulness of the police detention is irrelevant because Hesselink\u2019s actions in calling 911 were motivated by malice and born of bad faith is sharply at odds with Florida law, the district court\u2019s jury instructions, and the very nature of the claim that they chose to bring. <em>See, e.g., Johnson, </em>19 So.2d at 700; <em>St. Petersburg v. Austrino, </em>898 So.2d 955, 957 (Fla. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>DCA 2005) (\u201cThe gravamen of the tort of false arrest is the unlawful restraint of a person against that person\u2019s will.\u201d); <em>Es-cambia Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>680 So.2d at 572. As the Florida Supreme Court has explained, if the challenged detention or \u201cimprisonment is under legal authority it may be malicious but it cannot be false.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>19 So.2d at 700. In other words, the subjective motives skulking behind a detention are irrelevant if that detention is lawful. <em>Cf. Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872-73, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (emphasizing that \u201cthe subjective motivations of the individual officers,\u201d including whether they acted maliciously or in bad faith, have \u201cno bearing on whether a particular seizure is \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment\u201d). Indeed, if Hesselink\u2019s allegedly malicious motives in calling 911 were enough to sustain liability on a false detention claim, it is difficult to see why the district court granted summary judgment in favor of FIP on Sykes\u2019 false detention claim; it was the same call, made for the same purpose, with the same motive that led to the detention of the entire film crew as they exited the mall together.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Even without the plaintiffs\u2019 concessions and fundamentally flawed theory of liability, the probable cause to detain Sykes for illegally carrying an exposed firearm authorized the police to briefly detain the plaintiffs\u2014all of whom accompanied Sykes as he exited the mall\u2014to ensure officer safety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[F]or safety reasons, officers may ... briefly detain individuals about whom they have no individualized reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in the course of conducting a valid [investigatory] stop as to other related individuals,\u201d particularly when the officers are\u2014as they were here\u2014operating in \u201cthe known presence of firearms.\u201d <em>United States v.

State, </em>640 So.2d 1206, 1208 (Fla. 2d DCA 1994) (holding that an officer who had probable cause to arrest a fleeing car occupant could briefly detain the other occupants while he gave chase because it was \u201ca reasonable and necessary response to the exigent circumstances confronting the deputy that demanded immediate action\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In denying FIP\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 trial testimony \u201c[fell] short of undisputed testimony that [the police] detention of Plaintiffs was lawful,\u201d that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence before the jury to support a finding that Plaintiffs\u2019 restraint by [the police] was unlawful,\u201d and that the \u201cjury was free to ... come to its own conclusion about the lawfulness of the detention.\u201d The court emphasized that the video of the police detention \u201cdepicted the [Sheriffs Department] detaining everybody in the group, male and female, even though they were not accused of openly carrying a weapon or committing any other violation of law.\u201d Each of the court\u2019s underlying premises, stated or unstated, is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">First, the district court\u2019s assessment of the plaintiffs\u2019 trial testimony wholly ignored the fact that their entire theory of liability, as presented to the jury and reiterated on appeal, is contrary to Florida law and the court\u2019s own jury instructions, both of which required a showing that the police detention was false or unlawful. Second, the court erroneously surmised that the lawfulness of a detention is ultimately a factual question for a jury to decide, not a legal question to be resolved by a court. <em>See Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Mancusi, </em>632 So.2d 1352, 1357 (Fla. 1994) (\u201cWhen the facts relied on to show probable cause are in dispute, their existence is a question of fact for the determination of the jury; <em>but their legal effect, </em>when found or admitted to be true, <em>is for the court to decide as a question of law.\u201d) </em>(quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). In the context of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, where the evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>question of whether a particular detention was lawful is a \u201cpure issue of law.\u201d <em>Cf. Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1486 n. 3 (11th Cir.1996) (\u201cIn determining the facts for summary judgment purposes, we, like the district court, are required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. When that is done, a pure issue of law is created.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Finally, the court also mistakenly assumed that the Sheriffs Department could detain the plaintiffs only if it had individualized suspicion that they themselves had committed a crime. But as we have explained, \u201cindividualized suspicion is not an absolute prerequisite\u201d for every lawful detention, including where\u2014as here\u2014the police briefly detain members of a group while they investigate suspected criminal activity of a nearby associate. <em>See Lewis, </em>674 F.3d at 1305, 1308 (\u201cOnce the officers had [reasonable suspicion of criminal activity], they were not obliged to let three of the four associated individuals walk about freely while they investigated McRae, in light of the officers\u2019 powerful concern for their own safety.\u201d); <em>see also Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 855 n. 4, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2201 n. 4, 165 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006) (\u201cThe touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, not individualized suspicion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In sum, even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, there was no legally sufficient basis to conclude that they had been unlawfully detained by the police, an essential element of their claims for false detention. <em>See Myers, </em>640 F.3d at 1287. The plaintiffs simply cannot prevail on a false detention claim absent a false detention. Contrary to the district court\u2019s decision, FIP is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiffs\u2019 sole remaining claims for false detention, including the compensatory and punitive damages awarded on those claims. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s denial of FIP 7Ds renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and remand with instructions that the court enter judgment for FIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-11\">. Because FIP is challenging the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law, the facts are presented in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>See Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters, Inc., </em>711 F.3d 1299, 1312 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\">. FIP also asserted claims, either in state or federal court, against Kim's Enterprise of Orlando, Inc., the owner of the Magic Outlet Mall, and Chom Kim, the last known member-manager of Magic Mall, LLC. The district court ultimately entered defaults against both defendants; Kim\u2019s Enterprise of Orlando for failing to respond to the plaintiffs' amended complaint, and Chom Kim for failing to comply with the court's case management order. Neither defendant is a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. During opening and closing arguments, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer frankly acknowledged that the police had \u201cacted appropriately\u201d and \"didn't do anything wrong.\u201d When Bartley, Higgs, and Wallace were asked on cross-examination whether the police had acted lawfully or appropriately in response to Hesselink\u2019s 911 call, each one answered in the affirmative. The plaintiffs' expert witness likewise acknowledged before the jury that the police had acted appropriately for \"the type of call\u201d that they had received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b857-7\">. For identical reasons, FIP also challenges the district court's partial denials of its two motions for summary judgment. A party may not, however, appeal an order denying summary judgment after there has been a full trial on the merits. <em>Ortiz v. Jordan, </em>562 U.S. 180, 131 S.Ct. 884, 888-89, 178 L.Ed.2d 703 (2011); <em>see also Pensacola Motor Sales Inc. v. E. Shore Toyota, LLC, </em>684 F.3d 1211, 1219 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b857-13\">. Given the clear absence of a false or unlawful detention, we need not address FIP\u2019s alternative argument that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Hesselink\u2019s actions in calling 911 cannot serve as a basis for imposing tort liability. We also agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>with FIP that the district court erred in responding to the jury's question on damages without first notifying the parties of its contents and affording them an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Rogers v. United States, </em>422 U.S. 35, 39, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 2095, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (\"[T]he jury\u2019s message should have been answered in open court and [the] petitioner\u2019s counsel should have been given an opportunity to be heard before the trial judge responded.\u201d); <em>Fillippon v. Albion Vein Slate Co., </em>250 U.S. 76, 81, 39 S.Ct. 435, 436, 63 L.Ed. 853 (1919) (\"In this case the trial court erred in giving a supplementary instruction to the jury in the absence of the parties and without affording them an opportunity either to be present or to make timely objection to the instruction.\u201d); <em>United States v. McDuffie, </em>542 F.2d 236, 241 (5th Cir.1976) (\"When a communication is received from the jury, counsel should be informed of its substance and afforded an opportunity to be heard before a supplemental charge is given.\u201d). But FIP\u2019s entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on the plaintiffs' sole surviving claims for false detention obviates any need for us to consider whether that error was harmless. <em>See McDuffie, </em>542 F.2d at 241 (recognizing that judicial errors of this kind are subject to \u2022 harmless error review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">. Although FIP, in moving for judgment as a matter of law, did not specifically argue\u2014as it does on appeal\u2014that the police were entitled to detain the plaintiffs to ensure officer and public safety, it did make the broader claim that the challenged detention was lawful. Having preserved that broader claim in the district court, FIP is not precluded from raising new arguments in support of that claim on appeal. <em>See Yee v. City of Escondido, </em>503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 1532, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992) (\"Once a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\"); <em>Pugliese v. Pukka Dev., Inc., </em>550 F.3d 1299, 1304 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008) (\"Although new claims or issues may not be raised [for the first time on appeal], new <em>arguments </em>relating to preserved claims may be reviewed on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b860-5\">. The police were also authorized to briefly detain the plaintiffs without individualized suspicion of wrongdoing under the exigent circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s usual requirements, which permits law enforcement to conduct a suspicion-less search or seizure when confronted with an emergency situation that, among other things, requires immediate action for the protection or preservation of life. <em>See Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 2413, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978) (\"We do not question the right of the police to respond to emergency situations----The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Seibert v. State, </em>923 So.2d 460, 468 (Fla.2006) (\u201d[P]olice may enter a residence without a warrant if an objectively reasonable basis exists for the officer to believe that there is an immediate need for police assistance for the protection of life or substantial property interests.\u201d); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>477 So.2d 1068, 1070 (Fla. 2d DCA 1985) (\"The preservation of human life is paramount to the right of privacy protected by search and seizure laws....\u201d). In light of Hesselink\u2019s 911 call reporting two \"signal zeros\u201d in the mall, one of whom was openly carrying a firearm and wearing a battle dress uniform, the police officers had an objectively reasonable basis for concluding that they were facing a potentially life-threatening emergency, which justified the brief detention of Sykes and his companions until the officers could investigate the situation and allay any fears of a possible threat. <em>See In re J.B., </em>621 So.2d 489, 491 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993) (\"A 911 call is a cry to the authorities for help. And until the investigating officer is reasonably satisfied that no emergency exists, he is within his legal duty to investigate such calls in a manner consistent with their emergency nature.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
