He asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Setser v. United States, </em>-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012), demonstrates that such authority existed and that he is entitled to relief. Focusing as we must on the law as it existed at the time of sentencing, we conclude that defense counsel was not ineffective and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">As we write principally for the benefit of the parties, we recite only the essential facts and procedural history. In the summer of 2005, Hopkins was serving a sentence at the Dauphin County Work Release Center. At some point, he left the facility and did not return as required. A few months later, Hopkins and a friend drove to the Center to retrieve Hopkins\u2019s personal belongings. The friend went inside while Hopkins waited in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-19\">A probation officer saw Hopkins sitting in the car and approached him. Hopkins pulled out a .22 caliber pistol and shot at the officer, grazing him in the back. Officers arrested Hopkins and took him to the Dauphin County Prison. During a routine search, prison officials found 8.6 grams of crack cocaine in Hopkins\u2019s underwear. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Hopkins was thereafter charged with federal and state offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On the federal side, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Hopkins with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in \u25a0violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Hopkins pled guilty to the drug count and the firearms charge was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">On the state side, a Pennsylvania jury convicted Hopkins of two counts of aggravated assault upon the probation officer, carrying a firearm without a license, possession of a firearm by a felon, recklessly endangering another person, and providing false identification to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The District Court imposed its sentence first. During the sentencing hearing, Hopkins\u2019s attorney noted that Hopkins would be sentenced in state court in the future but never argued that the federal sentence should run concurrent with the future state sentence. To the contrary, defense counsel asserted that the sentences must run consecutively. JA 55-56 (\u201cBecause we\u2019re proceeding with sentencing prior to any disposition in terms of sentence in state court, he\u2019s a state prisoner, he can\u2019t get any concurrent sentence despite what the presentence report indicates.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The District Court sentenced Hopkins to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment but made no statements regarding whether the sentence should run concurrent with or consecutive to the yet-to-be imposed state sentence. Several weeks later, the state court imposed an aggregate sentence of 150 to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered that the state sentence run consecutive to the federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Hopkins\u2019s federal sentence was based on his designation as a career offender, but this designation was vacated in light of <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). <em>Hopkins v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 1132, 129 S.Ct. 995, 173 L.Ed.2d 285 (2009). On remand, we held that Hopkins was not a career offender, but that \u201c[t]his conclusion [did] not require any change in Hopkins\u2019[s] sentence\u201d because Hopkins\u2019s assault on the officer triggered application of the official victim enhancement, which resulted in the same sentence. <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>577 F.3d 507, 515 (3d Cir.2009). We therefore affirmed the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Hopkins\u2019s sentence was later reduced to 92 months\u2019 imprisonment due to the amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines relating to crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Hopkins thereafter filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255, claiming, among other things, that his counsel was ineffective under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), for failing to request a concurrent sentence. Hopkins sought to amend his motion to assert that he is entitled to resen-tencing under <em>Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012), which he contends simply restates existing law that gave sentencing judges the discretion to order that their sentences run concurrent with or consecutive to a yet-to-be imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">The District Court found that because <em>\u201cSetser </em>had not yet been decided and [Hopkins\u2019s] counsel did not believe that his federal sentence could be imposed concurrently with his state sentence,\u201d the ineffective assistance claim was meritless. JA 12. The District Court also denied the request to amend the motion based upon <em>Setser </em>because it concluded that <em>Setser </em>announced a new rule of law that did not apply retroactively under <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 306, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), and therefore could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>not provide Hopkins a basis for relief. The District Court granted certificates of appealability on both issues. For the reasons set forth, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Ill<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court provided the standard for judging ineffective assistance of counsel claims. 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To succeed on his claim, Hopkins must show \u201c(1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) that he was prejudiced by it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lilly, </em>536 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We first address whether Hopkins has shown \u201cthat his counsel\u2019s representation \u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). \u201cA court \u2018deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, <em>viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Davies, </em>394 F.3d 182, 189 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and adding emphasis).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">To determine whether Hopkins\u2019s counsel was ineffective at sentencing, we must assess the state of the law at the time of Hopkins\u2019s sentencing with respect to a federal court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence to run concurrent with the yet to be imposed state sentence. <em>Davies, </em>394 F.3d at 189. At the time of sentencing, this Court had made statements on this subject only in eases that predated the Sentencing Reform Act. In <em>United States ex rel. Lester v. Parker, </em>404 F.2d 40, 41 (3d Cir.1968) (per curiam), this Court held that a federal sentence ordered to run consecutive to a future state sentence was sufficiently definite to satisfy due process. Thus, <em>Lester </em>provided authority for a sentencing court to impose a sentence to run <em>consecutive </em>to a future sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The language used in the then-existing precedent addressing the authority of a federal sentencing judge to order the federal sentence to run <em>concurrent </em>with a yet-to-be-imposed state sentence was different. For instance, in <em>Barden v. Keohane, </em>921 F.2d 476 (3d Cir.1990), this Court, in holding that only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to decide whether a state prison should be designated as the defendant\u2019s place of federal confinement, and thereby allow the federal sentence to be served concurrent with the state sentence, specifically stated (without explanation) that the district court was \u201cpowerless\u201d to order that a sentence run concurrent with a future sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 483. <em>Barden </em>relied upon <em>Gomori v. Arnold, </em>533 F.2d 871 (3d Cir.1976), in which this Court also stated (again without explanation) that a \u201cfederal court has no power to direct that a federal sentence shall run concurrently with a state sentence,\u201d and that it only had the ability to \u201crecommend to the Attorney General that he designate a state institution as the place of service of a federal sentence in order to make it concurrent with a state sentence being served at that institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>While each of these cases involved review of the statutory authority that vested the Attorney General with the discretion to designate a state institution as the place at which a federal sentence could be served, this Court as well as at least one other relied on this statutory authority to say that a district court was powerless to order that its sentence run concurrent to or consecutive with a future sentence. <em>Setser, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1468 n. 2. Although some of this statutory authority had been repealed by the time Hopkins was sentenced, and even though none of the eases addressed the authority granted under the Sentencing Reform Act, the language in this precedent was unequivocal and counsel reasonably relied on it. Furthermore, as a result of this strong language, it was also reasonable for defense counsel not to bring to the sentencing court\u2019s attention cases from other circuits that had held there was authority to impose a federal sentence to run concurrent with a yet to be imposed state sentence. <em>Cf. Jansen v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 237, 243-44 (3d Cir.2004) (counsel\u2019s performance deficient where he failed to cite favorable out of circuit cases that were readily available). Thus, counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Even if counsel\u2019s failure to advocate for a concurrent sentence was ineffective, Hopkins has not shown prejudice, that is, that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In the sentencing context, Hopkins must show there was a reasonable probability that \u201cthe deficient performance affected [his] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hankerson, </em>496 F.3d 303, 310 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Glover v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 198, 203-04, 121 S.Ct. 696, 148 L.Ed.2d 604 (2001)). A \u201ctotally speculative\u201d harm, <em>Baker v. Barbo, </em>177 F.3d 149, 154 (3d Cir.1999), or the \u201cmere possibility\u201d of receiving a concurrent sentence, <em>see Prewitt v. United States, </em>83 F.3d 812, 818-19 (7th Cir.1996), does not demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Here, we cannot say that there exists a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the District Court would have imposed a concurrent sentence even if counsel had asked for it. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. While the violent nature of the conduct underlying the state offenses enhanced Hopkins\u2019s federal sentence, the state and the federal convictions were for entirely different crimes. The state convictions related to the shooting and Hopkins\u2019s possession of the firearm, whereas the federal conviction related only to the crack cocaine. Because it is likely that a federal sentencing court would have wanted to ensure that Hopkins was separately punished for these separate offenses, it is likely that the court would have ordered its sentence to run consecutive to the future state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Moreover, a sentencing court would likely have found a consecutive sentence appropriate here in light of the nature of Hopkins\u2019s conduct and criminal history. As the sentencing court noted, Hopkins\u2019s crimes were violent, he had previously escaped from the Work Release Center, he had been undeterred by previous punishments, and he presented a serious risk of recidivism. Thus, Hopkins would have likely received a consecutive sentence even without counsel\u2019s alleged error and he cannot show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request a concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">For all of these reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 2255. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We exercise plenary review over a district court's legal conclusions and apply a clear error standard to the court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>United States v. Lilly, </em>536 F.3d 190, 195 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">. Even though <em>Lester </em>only addressed consecutive sentences, <em>Setser </em>cited <em>Lester </em>for the proposition that appellate courts have recognized that federal sentencing courts have traditionally had discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will run either concurrent with or consecutive to future state sentences. <em>Setser, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b171-5\">. Hopkins\u2019s reliance on <em>Setser </em>is misplaced. <em>Setser </em>announced a new rule that does not apply retroactively and hence it does not provide Hopkins with a basis for relief. In <em>Teag-ue </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), the Supreme Court addressed whether a federal court could grant habeas corpus relief to a prisoner based on a rule of criminal procedure announced by the Supreme Court after the prisoner's conviction became final. In resolving this issue, the <em>Teague </em>Court articulated a framework that divided the world into \"old rules\" and \u201cnew rules.\u201d A rule is new if it \u201c 'was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 1107, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013) (quoting <em>Teag-ue, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060). A \"holding is not so dictated ... unless it would have been apparent to all reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Thus, whether a rule is an \"old rule\u201d depends on whether all \"reasonable jurists\u201d would agree that the rule was <em>\"dictated\" </em>by existing precedent. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, a historically-rooted rule may still be \"new\u201d for <em>Teague </em>puiposes so long as \"reasonable jurists\u201d would have disagreed on how (or whether) the rule applied to changed circumstances or new contexts. <em>See id. </em>at 1108-10 (holding that a case applying the traditional <em>Strickland </em>standard to new context announced a new rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\"><em>Setser </em>articulated such a rule. The issue in <em>Setser </em>was not whether federal district courts traditionally possessed broad sentencing discretion, but whether that traditional discretion was cabined by changed circumstances\u2014namely, the Sentencing Reform Act. <em>Setser </em>held that it was not. This holding, however, was not \"apparent to all reasonable jurists.\u201d <em>Chaidez, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1107. Before <em>Setser, </em>a federal sentencing court may have (correctly) determined that neither the Sentencing Reform Act \u201cnor any other statute ... authorized] a federal judge to <em>declare </em>that his sentence must run consecutively [or concurrently] to some sentence that may be imposed in the future.\u201d <em>Romandine v. United States, </em>206 F.3d 731, 737 (7th Cir.2000). In fact, <em>pre-Setser, </em>at least five Circuit courts reasoned that since no statute authorizes a federal judge to order its sentence to run concurrently or consecutively with a future state sentence, the court lacked the authority in the absence of statutory authorization. <em>See United States v. Donoso, </em>521 F.3d 144, 146-49 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>472 F.3d 222, 225-27 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Romandine, </em>206 F.3d at 737-39; <em>United States v. Quintero, </em>157 F.3d 1038, 1039-40 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>927 F.2d 491, 492 (9th Cir.1991). For these reasons, the rule in <em>Setser </em>was not <em>\"dictated\" </em>by existing precedent that recognized a federal sentencing court\u2019s traditional discretion. <em>See Caspari v. Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 393-95, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994) (examining the \u201cexperience of the lower courts\u201d when analyzing whether a rule was a development over which reasonable jurists could disagree). Accordingly, the rule is \"new\u201d for <em>Teague </em>purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Because <em>Setser </em>establishes a new rule, Hopkins may only invoke the rule on collateral attack if: (1) the new rule places certain kinds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of criminal conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe; or (2) the new rule is a \"watershed rule[] of criminal procedure\u201d that \"alter[s] our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements </em>that must be found to vitiate the fairness of a particular conviction.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Setser </em>plainly falls outside of the first exception as it dealt solely with a district court\u2019s sentencing discretion. As for the second exception, \u201d[t]o say that this exception is extremely narrow is to understate the issue.\u201d <em>Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 614 (3d Cir.2005). To meet the exception, Hopkins must show that <em>Setser </em>\"requires the observance of \u2018those procedures that ... are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 307, 109 S.Ct. 1060. The rule from <em>Setser, </em>which is not constitutionally derived, does not meet this high bar. Accordingly, the rule from <em>Setser </em>is not retroactive and Hopkins may not rely on it for relief under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
