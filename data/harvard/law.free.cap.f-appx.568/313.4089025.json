California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Covey has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make a fair evaluation of Covey\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Isgar, </em>739 F.3d 829, 841 (5th Cir.2014). Nor is the record sufficiently developed for us to address Covey\u2019s contention that his guilty plea was coerced. <em>See United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1984). We therefore decline to consider these claims without prejudice to Covey\u2019s right, if any, to seek collateral review. <em>See Isgar, </em>739 F.3d at 841; <em>Corbett, </em>742 F.2d at 178 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Covey\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
