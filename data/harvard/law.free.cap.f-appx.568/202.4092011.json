For the reasons discussed below, we dismiss the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (2012), we lack jurisdiction, except as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2012), to review the final order of removal of an alien who is removable for having been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, for each of which a sentence of a year or longer may be imposed. <em>See Planes v. Holder, </em>652 F.3d 991, 998 (9th Cir.2011). Under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we retain jurisdiction \u201cto review factual determinations that trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision, such as whether [Hmamouch] [i]s an alien and whether [ ]he has been convicted of [qualifying crimes involving moral turpitude].\u201d <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002). Once we confirm these two factual determinations, then, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), we can only consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Turkson v. Holder, </em>667 F.3d 523, 527 (4th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Our review of the record reveals that Hmamouch has conceded that he is a nafive and citizen of Morocco and that he has been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. Because these crimes clearly did not arise out of a common criminal scheme and they each carried a potential sentence of more than one year, we find that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) divests us of jurisdiction.* <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>We therefore grant the Attorney General\u2019s pending motion to dismiss the petition for review in No. 13-2108 and dismiss both petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\n<em>PETITIONS DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> Hmamouch does not raise any colorable constitutional issues or questions of law that would fall within the exception set forth in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Although his challenge to the agency\u2019s determination that his conviction for unlawful wounding constituted a crime of violence would typically be a question of law over which we would retain jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we lack jurisdiction on the ground that Hmamouch failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2012); <em>Massis v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 631, 638-40 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
