Gallo appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims concerning his placement in administrative and disciplinary segregation. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and may affirm on any ground supported by the record, <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2008). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-22\">The district court properly dismissed Gallo\u2019s retaliation claims concerning his placement in segregation and his inability to get the proper grievance forms because Gallo failed to allege facts showing that defendants acted with retaliatory intent to chill his exercise of protected conduct, or that their actions and policies did not advance valid correctional goals. <em>See Rhodes v. Robinson, </em>408 F.3d 559, 567-68 (9th Cir.2005) (setting forth elements of retaliation claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-23\">The district court properly dismissed Gallo\u2019s due process claims because, even assuming that Gallo\u2019s placement in administrative or disciplinary segregation implicated a protected liberty interest because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>it accompanied at loss of privileges and the brief confiscation of his appliances, Gallo admitted that he received all the process he was due. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-67, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (where liberty interest is implicated, prison officials must provide advance written notice of the claimed violation; a written statement as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken; and a limited right for inmates to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in their defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Dismissal of Gallo\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment claims was proper because Gallo failed to allege facts showing that his placement in administrative or disciplinary segregation posed a substantial risk of serious harm to his health or safety, or denied him \u201cthe minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 347, 101 S.Ct. 2392, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <em>see also Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994) (for Eighth Amendment claim, plaintiff must allege that defendants deliberately ignored a substantial risk of serious harm to his health or safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The district court properly dismissed Gallo\u2019s equal protection claims because Gallo failed to allege facts showing that defendants\u2019 policy regarding \u201cconvenience bed moves\u201d resulted in treating him differently from others similarly situated without a rational basis or discriminated against him based on his membership in a protected class. <em>See Village of Willow-brook v. Olech, </em>528 U.S. 562, 564,120 S.Ct. 1073,145 L.Ed.2d 1060 (2000) (per curiam) (standard for \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim); <em>Serrano v. Francis, </em>345 F.3d 1071, 1082 (9th Cir.2003) (requirements for \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim based on membership in protected class).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gallo\u2019s request for further leave to amend his claims because such relief would have been futile. <em>See Mirmehdi v. United States, </em>689 F.3d 975, 985 (9th Cir.2012) (a party is not entitled to amend its complaint if amendment would be futile); <em>Chodos v. West Publ\u2019g Co., </em>292 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth standard of review, and noting that the court\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend is particularly broad where plaintiff has previously amended the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Defendants\u2019 motion to strike a portion of the reply brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b540-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
