These claims alleged a variety of constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>tional violations stemming from Fludd\u2019s long-term confinement in administrative segregation. On December 8, 2012, this Court dismissed the bulk of Fludd\u2019s appeal but allowed him to proceed with his challenge to the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his due process claims concerning his administrative segregation after March 2008. On appeal, Fludd argues that the District Court erred in (1) concluding that collateral estoppel bars his due process claim with respect to an April 2008 hearing and determination to place him in administrative segregation, and (2) dismissing his due process claim with respect to the defendants\u2019 failure to provide periodic and meaningful reviews of his administrative segregation status. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We review decisions granting both motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment <em>de novo. Aegis Ins. Servs., Inc. v. 7 World Trade Co., </em>737 F.3d 166, 176 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201cNew York courts apply collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, \u2018if the issue in the second action is identical to an issue which was raised, necessarily decided and material in the first action, and the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier action.\u2019\u201d <em>LaFleur v. Whitman, </em>300 F.3d 256, 271 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Parker v. Blauvelt Volunteer Fire Co., </em>93 N.Y.2d 343, 349, 690 N.Y.S.2d 478, 712 N.E.2d 647 (1999)). The burden of proof on the \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d requirement rests with the party opposing collateral estoppel. <em>See Schwartz v. Pub. Adm\u2019r of Cnty. of Bronx, </em>24 N.Y.2d 65, 73, 298 N.Y.S.2d 955, 246 N.E.2d 725 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the District Court properly determined that collateral estoppel bars Fludd\u2019s claim that the April 2008 hearing and determination to place him in administrative segregation violated his due process rights. The issues underlying this due process challenge were raised, necessarily resolved against Fludd, and material in a previous Article 78 proceeding. <em>See Fludd v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Corr. Sens., </em>62 A.D.3d 1149, 879 N.Y.S.2d 606, 609-10 (3rd Dep\u2019t 2009). And we discern no procedural deficiencies in either the Article 78 proceeding or the April 2008 hearing that \u201cproduced some significant effect on\u201d the review of these issues or otherwise prevented Fludd from fully litigating them in the Article 78 proceeding. <em>See Giakoume-los v. Coughlin, </em>88 F.3d 56, 59-60 (2d Cir.1996); see also <em>Parker, </em>93 N.Y.2d at 350, 690 N.Y.S.2d 478, 712 N.E.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We turn next to Fludd\u2019s claims concerning the defendants\u2019 failure to conduct periodic and meaningful reviews of his administrative segregation status. An inmate has a liberty interest protected by procedural due process when his \u201cconfinement subject[s][him] to \u2018atypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colon v. Howard, </em>215 F.3d 227, 230 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)). Depending on its duration and conditions, administrative segregation can constitute \u201catypical and significant hardship.\u201d <em>See Palmer v. Richards, </em>364 F.3d 60, 64-66 (2d Cir.2004). Although our cases consistently decline to establish bright-line rules in this area, we have previously determined that, even under \u201cnormal\u201d conditions, solitary confinement for 305 days constitutes \u201ca sufficient departure from the ordinary incidents of prison life to require due process protections.\u201d <em>Colon, </em>215 F.3d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>For the purpose of establishing a liberty interest, a district court should consider the entire \u201csustained period of confinement.\u201d <em>Giano v. Selsky, </em>288 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2001). Fludd\u2019s complaint alleges that he spent more than two and a half years in continuous solitary confinement after the April 2008 hearing before the filing of this complaint. This unbroken stretch, substantially longer than 305 days, is sufficiently \u201catypical and significant\u201d to establish a liberty interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Colon, </em>215 F.3d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We therefore vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment as it pertains to Fludd\u2019s periodic-review claim. On remand, the District Court may determine, in the first instance, whether the failure to conduct regular status reviews violated constitutional due process, and whether the defendants are entitled, at the pleadings stage, to qualified immunity. We affirm the judgment of the District Court, however, insofar as it concluded that Fludd\u2019s allegations are insufficient to state a plausible claim that the status reviews which did take place did not satisfy the minimum requirements of the Due Process Clause. <em>See Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 472, 477 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (stating that prison officials need \u201cengage only in an informal, nonadversary review of the information supporting [the inmate\u2019s] administrative confinement,\u201d without necessarily permitting \u201cthe submission of any additional evidence or statements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We have considered Fludd\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Because the duration of Fludd\u2019s confinement alone establishes a liberty interest, we do not address the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the conditions of Fludd\u2019s confinement were not atypical and significant in relation to general prison conditions. <em>Cf. Palmer, </em>364 F.3d at 64-65 (district courts are in the usual case expected to engage in a \"fact-intensive inquiry\u201d regarding the conditions of confinement when the plaintiff was segregated from the general prison population for a substantial length of time).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
