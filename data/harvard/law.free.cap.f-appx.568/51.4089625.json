We assume familiarity with the factual and procedural history of the case and repeat only those details necessary to the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Aerotel entered into a settlement agreement (the \u201cContract\u201d) with IDT, a telecommunications provider and distributor of prepaid calling cards, to resolve an earlier dispute. The Contract required IDT to provide Aerotel with $15 million in prepaid calling cards\u2014$5 million in domestic cards, and $10 million in international cards\u2014and imposed certain obligations on IDT with respect to these cards. The Contract is \u201cgoverned by New York law\u201d and contains a valid arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Aerotel commenced an arbitration claiming that IDT breached several material provisions of the Contract. The panel, in a 86-page interim award, found that IDT materially breached with respect to certain provisions in the Contract, and concluded that Aerotel had properly terminated the Contract based on these material breaches. With regard to remedies, the panel denied Aerotel restitution on the basis that, despite the breach, the record did not demonstrate the IDT had effectively repudiated the contract or denied Aerotel all or substantially all benefits of the Contract. The panel awarded Aerotel $5,891,529 in lost profits with respect to the international cards, but concluded that lost profits with respect to the domestic cards were too speculative. Specifically, because Aer-otel had not sold any domestic cards, any award would be based on presumed future sales and would consist of \u201cspeculation and guesswork.\u201d The panel declined to order specific performance on the grounds that (1) Aerotel had not requested that remedy; (2) awarding damages for one part of the Contract and specific performance for another would be inappropriate; and (3) the Contract implied that compensatory damages were the preferred remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">Aerotel filed a motion to clarify, which was, in substance, a motion to reconsider, and which the panel denied. Aerotel then commenced this lawsuit seeking vacatur of the arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-18\">On appeal from a district court\u2019s decision confirming an arbitral award we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Duferco Int\u2019l Steel Trading v. T. Klaveness Shipping A/S, </em>333 F.3d 383, 388 (2d Cir.2003). The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) authorizes, in relevant part, vacatur \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4). The Second Circuit also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>permits vacatur when arbitral awards are made in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d that is \u201cplainly evident from the arbitration record.\u201d <em>Duferco, </em>333 F.3d at 388. Manifest disregard is not \u201cmere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law,\u201d but \u201cmay be found if the arbitrator understood and correctly stated the law but proceeded to ignore it.\u201d <em>Willemijn Houdstermaatschappij, BV v. Standard Microsystems Corp., </em>103 F.3d 9, 12 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The District Court, in a thorough oral ruling, concluded that \u201cthe panel\u2019s interim and final awards ... reflect admirable care and attention, both to the law and the facts.\u201d Specifically, with regard to restitution, the panel looked at the applicable law and concluded that \u201cthe necessary preconditions for restitution\u201d were not met because \u201cIDT\u2019s breaches did not effectively deny Aerotel all, or substantially all, of the benefits of the 2009 agreement. Nor did IDT\u2019s actions constitute anything resembling a repudiation.\u201d With regard to damages for the domestic cards, the panel concluded that Aerotel had not met its burden of showing that IDT\u2019s breaches caused any damages suffered with respect to the domestic cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The District Court properly concluded that while another panel might have reached a different conclusion, the panel in this case, whether correctly or not, was unquestionably applying the governing law. The District Court also noted that \u201cNew York law gives arbitrators substantial power to fashion remedies,\u201d SPA 22 (citing <em>Sperry Int\u2019l Trade, Inc. v. Gov\u2019t of Israel, </em>689 F.2d 301, 306 (2d Cir.1982)), and, accordingly, the decision to deny specific performance and instead grant lost profit damages was not in excess of its powers under the FAA. We agree. Accordingly, there are no grounds for vacating the arbitral award.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">For the reasons set out above and in the July 18, 2013 oral decision of the District Court, we AFFIRM the July 22, 2013 judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
