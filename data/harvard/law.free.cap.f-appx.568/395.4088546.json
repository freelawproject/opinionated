Maloney, Chief United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b420-6\">KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Dr. Mukunda Mukherjee\u2014often with his feet on his desk\u2014wrote prescriptions for the crowds of patients in his office each day. He almost never examined these patients: the exam table in his office was piled with paperwork and boxes. But for a fee of just 45 dollars, patients could leave with prescriptions for Vicodin, Morphine, Codeine, Zoloft, and more. Mukherjee was eventually indicted for this practice. After refusing numerous plea deals, he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and 44 counts of distribution of the same, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and (D), and 841(b)(3). The district court sentenced him to over 300 years in prison, and we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Mukherjee, </em>289 Fed.Appx. 107 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Mukherjee then brought this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, claiming that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he rejected the government\u2019s plea offers. The district court rejected that claim. We reject it as well, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">During a typical visit to Mukherjee\u2019s office, \u201cpatients\u201d waited for hours to see the doctor. (They could shorten their wait if they tipped the receptionist.) Mukher-jee\u2019s office included an exam bed, but his patients\u2014often three to four crowded in at a time\u2014never used it. As one informant put it, \u201cPhysically there was\u2014there was no contact whatsoever. There was just talking.\u201d Yet Mukherjee still prescribed Vicodin, Morphine, OxyContin, Oxycodone, Codeine cough syrup, medication to treat schizophrenia, and many other controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">In July 2004, an indictment charged Mukherjee with conspiracy and 53 counts of illegal distribution of controlled prescription drugs. Mukherjee was then 63 years old. He hired William Brisbois as his attorney. Brisbois advised Mukherjee of the maximum penalties for each of the 54 counts against him, and warned Muk-herjee that a consecutive sentence on each of the counts might amount to life imprisonment. In September 2004, Brisbois informed Mukherjee that the government had made him a plea offer. Brisbois tried to persuade Mukherjee to accept the offer, but Mukherjee refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">In December 2004, Brisbois withdrew. Mukherjee then retained two new attorneys: R. Vincent Green and Robert Hack-ett. Green and Hackett received at least two additional plea offers and discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>them with Mukherjee, advising him that he could face decades in prison. When Hackett received the government\u2019s final plea offer, he mailed it to Mukherjee with a cover letter that stated in part, \u201cI would advise you to reconsider your position and seriously consider accepting this deal ... I would strongly recommend you accept this most recent offer by the government.\u201d Under the offer\u2019s terms, Mukherjee would serve six to seven years, or, as Hackett emphasized, only a little over two years in addition to his time served. \u201cThink about it! An additional 27 months is a lot better than a possible 20 years.\u201d Mukherjee rejected his attorneys\u2019 advice and the plea offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Five days before trial\u2014and after the last plea offer had expired\u2014the government revealed that it was going to introduce evidence at trial that Mukherjee had illegally distributed controlled prescription drugs to numerous people beyond those listed in the indictment. These new prescriptions greatly increased Mukherjee\u2019s potential Guidelines range. Mukherjee was convicted, and the district court sentenced him to 328 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Mukherjee thereafter retained a new attorney, who filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate Mukherjee\u2019s sentence on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the motion be granted. But the district court disagreed and denied the motion to vacate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings in denying a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Guerrero v. United States, </em>383 F.3d 409, 414 (6th Cir.2004). This is true even where, as here, the district court did not conduct the evidentiary hearing and therefore did not observe the witnesses first hand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Mukherjee argues that Hackett gave him erroneous advice during plea negotiations, thereby violating his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Mukherjee must show that Hackett\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d. 674 (1984). In addition, Mukherjee must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Hackett\u2019s representation: that is, there was a reasonable probability that, but for Hackett\u2019s putative errors, the result of Mukherjee\u2019s proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">For the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s exemplary opinion in this case, Mukherjee cannot satisfy either of the <em>Strickland </em>prongs. We add only a few points in response to Mukherjee\u2019s arguments on appeal. First, as to performance: contrary to Mukherjee\u2019s suggestion on appeal, the magistrate judge nowhere found that Hackett and Brisbois were not credible when they testified that they told Mukherjee about his maximum potential sentence. The district court was within its rights to find that testimony credible; and, as the court noted, Brisbois and Green each advised Mukherjee that he potentially faced hundreds of years in prison if convicted at trial. Nor did Hackett provide ineffective representation when he referred to a potential 20-year sentence in his discussions with Mukherjee; at that point, the government had not yet disclosed the relevant conduct that made Mukherjee\u2019s Guidelines range a multiple of 20 years. Thus, at every step during the plea-bargaining stage, Mukherjee\u2019s attorneys advised him of his potential sentencing exposure and that he should take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>government\u2019s deal. Mukherjee simply refused to follow their advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Second, Mukherjee experienced no prejudice because of his attorneys\u2019 representation. Mukherjee admitted on cross examination that he knew full well that, if he lost at trial, he would face a sentence of up to 30 years. And in this case, as a practical matter, there was little difference between sentences of 30 and 300 years, since the former would have kept Mukherjee behind bars until his mid-90s. And yet Mukherjee says that, had he only known he might remain in prison even longer, he would have certainly accepted the plea deal. The district court had good reason to find that testimony not only self-serving, but incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The reality here is that Mukherjee chose to take his chances at trial, and lost. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
