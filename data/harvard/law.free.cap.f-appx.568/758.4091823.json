When the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issues a general duty clause citation, an employer may contest it\u2014ordinarily with a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.61. If the ALJ finds in favor of OSHA, the employer may seek review by the full Commission. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.91(b). However, such review is dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>cretionary. <em>Id. </em>If the Commission declines to review the AL J\u2019s decision as it did here, the ALJ\u2019s decision becomes a final order of the Commission. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.90(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">We review the Commission\u2019s factual findings\u2014and its determination of a serious violation based on those findings\u2014to ensure they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Daniel Int\u2019l Corp. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>683 F.2d 361, 363-64 (11th Cir.1982). Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance. <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987). It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York v. N.L.R.B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) (citations omitted); <em>see also Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)(quotations omitted). Thus, even if the evidence appears to weigh against the decision of the Commission, we must affirm if a reasonable mind might accept its conclusions. <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). We review legal determinations by the Commission to determine if they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706; <em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In this case, Roberts Sand Company contests a general duty clause citation that the OSHA issued after falling clay crushed a Robert Sand\u2019s employee working in a \u201cborrow pit.\u201d The general duty clause provides that each employer \u201cshall furnish to his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1). OSHA can only issue general duty clause citations where it has not promulgated a regulation covering a particular situation at an employer\u2019s worksite. Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1); <em>see also Reich v. Arcadian Corp., </em>110 F.3d 1192, 1199 (5th Cir.1997) (citations omitted) (noting that \u201ccourts have consistently held that standards are the preferred enforcement mechanism and that the General Duty Clause serves as an enforcement tool of last resort\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In order to establish an employer\u2019s violation of the general duty clause, OSHA bears the burden to prove four elements. <em>Waldon Healthcare Ctr., </em>16 BNA OSHC 1052, 1058 (No. 89-2804, 1993). Those four elements are: (1) that a condition or activity in the employer\u2019s workplace presented a hazard to employees; (2) that the cited employer or the employer\u2019s industry recognized the hazard; (3) that the hazard was causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm; and (4) that feasible means existed to ehminate or materially reduce the hazard. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The parties here dispute only one element: whether there were feasible means to eliminate the hazard or to materially reduce it. (Petitioner\u2019s Initial Br. at 22); <em>see also Champlin Petroleum Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>593 F.2d 637, 640 (5th Cir.1979) (discussing the four factors OSHA must demonstrate to establish a violation of the general duty clause). In other words, was it \u201cfeasibly preventable\u201d? \u201cThough resistant to precise definition, the criterion of preventability draws content from the informed judgment of safety experts.\u201d <em>National Realty and Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>489 F.2d 1257, 1266 (D.C.Cir.1973). A proposed abatement measure is not feasible if \u201cconscientious experts, familiar with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>the industry, would not take it into account in prescribing a safety program.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We hold that here, even though no evidence in the record shows that any other borrow pits have adopted OSHA\u2019s proposed abatement methods, conscientious experts, familiar with the industry, would clearly take the proposed abatement method of sloping the walls of the excavation into account in prescribing a safety program. (R. at 36,176, 229).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Petitioner, though, states the standard slightly differently. It says that in order for a proposed abatement method to be feasible, the proposed method must be recognized by \u201cknowledgeable persons familiar with the industry as <em>necessary and valuable </em>steps for a sound safety program in the particular circumstances existing at the employer\u2019s worksite.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s Initial Br. at 24) (citing <em>Secretary of Labor v. Cerro Metal Prods. Div., Marmon Grp., Inc., </em>12 BNA OSHC 1821 (No. 78-5159, 1986) (citing <em>National Realty and Construction Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>489 F.2d 1257, 1266 (D.C.Cir.1973)) (emphasis added)). By its terms, the \u201cnecessary and valuable\u201d standard put forth by the Commission is a different and more stringent standard than the \u201ctake into account\u201d standard put forth by the D.C. Circuit. <em>Compare Cerro Metal Prods. Div., </em>12 BNA OSHC at 1823 <em>with National Realty, </em>489 F.2d at 1266. Yet the Respondent treats the two standards as equivalents. <em>See </em>Respondent\u2019s Br. at 18. And the Commission often does the same. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Secretary of Labor v. Pegasus Tower, Inc., </em>21 BNA OSHC 1406 (No. 04-1612, 2005). Thus, the standard the Commission applied in this case was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>See Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Rice, </em>85 F.3d 535, 541 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining the highly deferential nature of arbitrary and capricious review).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Substantial evidence in the record supports the Commission\u2019s finding. The president of the Roberts Sand Company himself admitted that OSHA\u2019s proposed abatement method\u2014sloping the wall\u2014was one method for making the borrow-pit worksite safer. (R. at 176). Roberts Sand\u2019s safety trainer also agreed that the proposed abatement method was one possibility for making the pit safer. (R. at 229). And MHSA Inspector Owens also agreed that sloping the pit wall could be done at this worksite. (R. at 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Based on the record, OSHA presented substantial evidence that its proposed abatement measure would materially reduce the hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Accordingly, we deny Roberts Sand Company\u2019s petition, and affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision which was the Final Order of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">DENIED AND AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
