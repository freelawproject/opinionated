The BIA upheld the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of Carrasco\u2019s application for deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Carrasco is more likely than not to be tortured in Mexico for having received a reduced sentence on her 2007 drug conviction. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cWe must uphold the BIA\u2019s determination unless \u2018the evidence not only supports, but <em>compels </em>the conclusion that the ... decision was incorrect.\u2019 \u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), 1208.17(a) (requiring applicant for deferral of removal to prove that torture is more likely than not). Nor does the record compel the conclusion that any such torture would be accomplished with the consent or acquiescence of someone acting in an official capacity. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(1). The record of Carrasco\u2019s sentencing does not indicate that she was given a reduced sentence because she cooperated with prosecutors, but rather because of a potential disparity with her co-defendant\u2019s sentence. Carras-co presented no specific evidence to the IJ that anyone in Mexico has threatened her or is even aware of the fact that she. received a reduced sentence. Without nonspeculative evidence of a risk of torture, Carrasco did not satisfy her burden to prove that she is more likely than not to be tortured. <em>See Matter of M-B-A-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 474, 479-80 (BIA 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
