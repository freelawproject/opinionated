(\u201cPDS\u201d), alleging numerous violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a judgment entered March 1, 2013, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), holding that the claim was time-barred. In a Memorandum and Order entered August 5, 2013, the District Court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and motion to amend the complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, including \u201clegal conclusions\u201d concerning the court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>See City of Pontiac Gen. Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys. v. MBIA, Inc., </em>637 F.3d 169, 173 (2d Cir.2011). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the complaint must include \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Although all allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678,129 S.Ct. 1937. We review denial of motions for reconsideration and for leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Univ. of Rochester Med. Ctr., </em>642 F.3d 121, 125 (2d Cir.2011) (denial of Rule 60(b) motion for reconsideration); <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 108 (2d Cir.2007) (denial of leave to amend).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">Upon a review of the record, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusions, for substantially the reasons stated in its thorough and well-reasoned orders. Accordingly, the judgment and order of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">We DENY Daniel DePasquale\u2019s request for sanctions on the merits, and also as improperly raised in his appellate brief rather than in a separately filed motion as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38. <em>See Great Am. Ins. Co. v. M/V Handy Laker, </em>348 F.3d 352, 354 (2d Cir.2003) (denying request for Rule 38 sanctions raised in appellee\u2019s brief where no separately filed motion had been submitted). We generally impose such sanctions only in cases of blatant frivolity, bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>faith, or repetitive frivolous filings. <em>See, e.g., 60 E. 80th St. Equities, Inc. v. Sapir (In re 60 E. 80th St. Equities, Inc.), </em>218 F.3d 109, 119-20 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Moore v. Time, Inc., </em>180 F.3d 463, 463-64 (2d Cir.1999). While Vincent DePasquale\u2019s appeal is without merit, it does not warrant sanctions under this standard.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-12\">. Vincent DePasquale was represented by counsel in the District Court, and counsel filed his appellate brief. He terminated counsel before filing his reply brief and presently proceeds <em>pro se.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
