Following oral argument and a review of the record, we affirm, and address only those arguments that merit discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">First, considered as a whole, the district court\u2019s jury instruction for the aggravated identity theft charge under \u00a7 1028A adequately conveyed the government\u2019s burden of proof, and did not constitute error, plain or otherwise. The district court instructed the jury that Mr. Kaba could be found guilty of violating \u00a7 1028A \u201conly if all of the following facts are proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and then told the jury that, among other things, \u201cthe government must also prove that the defendant knew that the means of identification ... belonged to a real person and not a fictitious person.\u201d Even under <em>de novo </em>review, <em>see United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1270 (11th Cir.2000), we conclude that this instruction would have been understood by a reasonable jury to mean that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kaba knew that the means of identification belonged to a real person, as required by <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Second, exercising plenary review, <em>see United States v. Feliciano, </em>747 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2014), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find Mr. Kaba guilty of violating \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Starting with the conviction under \u00a7 1029(a)(3), Mr. Kaba argues that the government did not prove that 15 or more access devices were functional. The record, however, shows otherwise. Mr. Kaba possessed several dozen credit, debit, or gift cards issued by various credit card companies. All of these cards had account numbers encoded on their magnetic strips\u2014strips which could be reencoded\u2014 and those numbers did not match the account numbers embossed on the cards. These cards were \u201caccess devices\u201d because they could be used, \u201calone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money, goods, services, or any other thing of value[.]\u201d \u00a7 1029(e)(1). <em>See United States v. Sepulveda, </em>115 F.3d 882, 887 (11th Cir.1997). They were also \u201ccounterfeit access devices\u201d (i.e., access devices that are \u201ccounterfeit, fictitious, altered, or forged, or an identifiable component of an access device,\u201d \u00a7 1029(e)(2)) and/or \u201cunauthorized access devices\u201d (i.e., access devices which are \u201clost, stolen, expired, revoked, canceled, or obtained with intent to defraud,\u201d \u00a7 1029(e)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">The possession of these cards\u2014together with, among other things, the possession of a credit-card encoder, the possession of blank credit cards, the possession of computer files containing additional credit card numbers, and the use of B.R.\u2019s card number\u2014also sufficed to permit the jury to find that Mr. Kaba acted with intent to defraud. Contrary to Mr. Kaba\u2019s suggestion, the government did not have to prove with direct evidence that the access de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>vices were capable of immediate use to obtain something of value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Turning to the conviction under \u00a7 1029(a)(4), we reject Mr. Kaba\u2019s argument that the government had to prove that the credit-card encoder found in his apartment actually worked. For starters, such a requirement is not found in the statutory language. To the extent that Mr. Kaba contends that intent to defraud cannot be inferred \u201cfrom the mere possession of a non-functional piece of device-making equipment,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 36, he ignores the fact that software for the encoder was installed on two computers in his apartment. The encoder was \u201cdevice-making equipment\u201d under \u00a7 1029(e)(6) because it was \u201cdesigned or primarily used for making an access device or a counterfeit access device.\u201d The jury had ample evidence, including the evidence described above in the discussion relating to \u00a7 1029(a)(3), to find that Mr. Kaba had the requisite <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-8\">. At oral argument, Mr. Kaba suggested that he had challenged, as impermissible double-counting, the sentencing enhancement for his possession of the encoder. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(ll)(A)(i). Our review of his brief, however, indicates that no double-counting argument was asserted, and his counsel have confirmed that in a post-argument letter brief. The only argument Mr. Kaba raised as to this enhancement was that it could not be applied because there was insufficient evidence that the encoder was functional. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41. We therefore do not address the double-counting issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">. Mr. Kaba\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s loss calculation is dependent on the contention that the district court erred in finding that there were 49 access devices. <em>See </em>Appellant's Br. at 40-41; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 10 n. 2. Because we have rejected Mr. Kaba\u2019s contention with respect to what constitutes an access device, the sentencing challenge based on that contention fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
