Karen A. Drago, Schenectady County Court Judge. In his proposed third amended complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wisoff alleged that Judge Drago deprived him of procedural due process by dismissing, without notice and an opportunity to be heard, his appeal of his conviction and fine for city code violations, and that the City improperly benefitted by collecting the fine. Wisoff sought an order vacating the dismissal of his appeal, reinstating a stay on his payment of the fine, and directing the City to reimburse him for the fine. The District Court dismissed the action. The issues on appeal are whether judicial immunity and/or the so-called <em>\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>\u201d doctrine barred Wisoffs claims against Judge Drago, and whether Wisoff failed to state a claim against the City pursuant to <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">In reviewing the dismissal of Wisoffs complaint, we apply the familiar standards of review. \u201cWhen reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Close v. New York, </em>125 F.3d 31, 35-36 (2d Cir.1997). Dismissal of a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) is proper \u201cwhen the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\u201d <em>Makarova v. United States, </em>201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">We similarly \u201creview <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2009). We accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>The complaint \u201cmust plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d 184, 188 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-13\">Upon such review, we see no error in the dismissal of Wisoffs claim against Judge Drago for substantially the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s order\u2014 namely, that Wisoff failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction in light of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine and, in the alternative, that Judge Drago is entitled to judicial immunity. We also conclude that the District Court did not err in dismissing Wisoffs due process claim against the City pursuant to <em>Monell </em>for failure for failure to allege a municipal \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201ccustom\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that caused Wisoffs alleged injury. <em>See Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 403, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997) (citing <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We have considered all of the arguments raised by Wisoff on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s May 7, 2013 judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\">. Because Wisoff sought leave to file a third amended complaint while defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was pending, the District Court considered the merits of defendants\u2019 motion in light of the allegations contained in this most recent complaint, which names only the City and Judge Drago as defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b54-15\">. Because die City moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), not 12(b)(6), the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Wisoff\u2019s due process claim against the City for failure to adequately allege <em>Monell </em>liability was a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal. A district court may dismiss an action <em>sua sponte </em>for failure to state a claim so long as the plaintiff is given notice of the grounds for dismissal and an opportunity to be heard. <em>Thomas v. Scully, </em>943 F.2d 259, 260 (2d Cir.1991). Here, although the City moved to dismiss under the wrong Rule, its motion was entirely premised on Wisoff's failure to allege the existence of a municipal policy, practice, or custom that caused the alleged violation of his constitutional rights. As such, Wisoff had the required notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
