He was sentenced to a 70-month term of imprisonment. On appeal, he argues that the district court committed reversible plain error by assessing one criminal history point for his prior conviction of simple criminal damage to property. He contends that the prior conviction should have been excluded from the criminal history calculation pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-20\">To show plain error, an appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Gonzales-Manzanares has not met that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>standard because he has not shown that the district court\u2019s inclusion of the criminal history point constituted clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
