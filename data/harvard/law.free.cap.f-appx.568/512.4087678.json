The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) did not abuse its discretion in affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Avtar Singh had engaged in marriage fraud. Immigration fraud is a proper consideration in a discretionary denial of asylum. <em>Hosseini v. Gonzales, </em>471 F.3d 953, 957 (9th Cir.2006). The BIA properly weighed this adverse factor alongside all other relevant considerations, including favorable factors such as family reunification. <em>See Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.2004). The denial is thus neither \u201cmanifestly contrary to the law [nor] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">2. Singh\u2019s Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim is moot. The BIA granted Singh withholding of removal, the broadest relief that would be available to him under CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
