We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to grant a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, employing the same standard as when deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim. \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We construe all factual allegations in the complaint as true and \u201cdraw[] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir.2007). In its review, the Court is entitled to consider facts alleged in the complaint and documents attached to it or incorporated in it by reference, documents \u201cintegral\u201d to the complaint and relied upon in it, and facts of which judicial notice may properly be taken under Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>See, e.g., Rothman v. Gregor, </em>220 F.3d 81, 88 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Audiotext Network, Inc. v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>62 F.3d 69, 72 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-15\">\u201c[I]t is the usual practice upon granting a motion to dismiss to allow leave to re-plead[.]\u201d <em>Cortee Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding, L.P., </em>949 F.2d 42, 50 (2d Cir.1991). The amendment process has its limits, of course, so it is for the district court to decide in the first instance whether to grant leave to amend, and we generally review only for abuse of discretion. <em>Hutchison v. Deutsche Bank Sec., Inc., </em>647 F.3d 479, 490 (2d Cir.2011). However, if \u201cthe denial of leave to amend is based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>legal interpretation, ... [we] conduct[ ] a <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">This action arises out of a decision by the Town of Hempstead Building Department to declare Heckman\u2019s residence \u201cunfit for human occupancy\u201d without providing him notice and an opportunity to be heard in advance. The facts recounted here are drawn from the allegations of Heckman\u2019s pleadings and are assumed to be true for present purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Heckman is a disabled veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. He experiences disordered thinking, insomnia, and an inability to concentrate on and complete even basic tasks. He depends on his sister to manage his personal and financial affairs. Moreover, these mental disabilities allegedly contribute to Heck-man\u2019s \u201clack of fine motor skills\u201d and an aversion to \u201cparting] with certain objects.\u201d Proposed 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37. As a result, Heckman alleges he has \u201cdifficulty\u201d \u201cmaintaining his home[,]\u201d which appears \u201ccluttered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In short, he is a hoarder.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On December 20, 2007, Heckman arrived home to find it being boarded up by officials of the Town of Hempstead (\u201cthe Town\u201d) and its various public safety agencies (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). Defendants had been called to the residence by police officers who, in the course of investigating a reported shooting in the neighborhood, supposedly \u201csmelled gas coming from Mr. Heekmann\u2019s [sic] property.\u201d 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28. The officials did not permit Heckman to enter his house for any reason: neither to retrieve his money from his home; nor to retrieve his medication from his home; nor to \u201crescue his cat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b646, 48. Apparently fearing arrest if he continued to protest the boarding of his house, Heckman traveled three hours to the Veteran\u2019s Administration to obtain an emergency supply of his medication, and passed the night in a motel. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55, 57, 58. The next day, Heckman went to the Town\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Buildings,\u201d where \u201cRaymond Shwarz [sic],\u201d the Town\u2019s Supervisor of Inspection services, gave Heckman a \u201chandwritten list of vague alleged problems to be corrected within the house,\u201d and returned Heckman\u2019s house keys. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 59, 60, 65. Returning to his house, Heckman discovered the cat inside; however the gas, heat, electricity and water were not turned back on. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 69, 70. \u201cTo date, the \u2018unfit for human occupancy\u2019 designation has not been lifted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">I. Heckman\u2019s Claim under the ADA</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">As to Heckman\u2019s claim under Title II of the ADA: \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADA, Heckman \u201cmust demonstrate (1) that [ ]he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that the defendants are subject to [the ADA]; and (3) that []he was denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from defendants\u2019 services, programs, or activities, or was otherwise discriminated against by defendants, by reason of her disability.\u201d <em>Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 73-74 (2d Cir.2009). None of Heckman\u2019s numerous pleadings (including the Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Proposed Second Amended Complaint, and Second Amended Complaint) or any supporting submissions filed here and below, alleges facts that give rise to a plausible inference that any of the defendants intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Heckman alleges that, when Defendants entered his home to investigate the suspected gas leak, they \u201ccursorily observed the [home\u2019s] clutter, and concluded that the plaintiff was mentally incompetent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 3; <em>accord </em>Proposed 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35, 49. He further alleges that, \u201c[a]fter concluding that the defendant was mentally incompetent, defendants further concluded that the plaintiff would not be able to comply with any proposed plan for remediation of any perceived defects in [his] home.\u201d Proposed 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">These allegations do not suggest a plausible inference that any defendant knew or believed, at the relevant time, that Heck-man suffered from a disability. Allegations that Defendants knew of Heckman\u2019s alleged disability because they had \u201cconcluded\u201d as much based on the \u201cclutter\u201d are of a purely \u201cconclusory nature,\u201d which \u201cdisentitles them to the presumption of truth.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 681, 129 S.Ct. 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Accordingly, and finding no merit in Heckman\u2019s other arguments regarding his disability, we conclude that Heckman has failed to state a claim under the ADA. In light of Heckman\u2019s various opportunities to replead and the district court\u2019s careful analysis of the pleadings, proposed pleadings, and non-pleading submissions, the decision to deny as futile leave to amend was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">II. Heckman\u2019s Procedural Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from \u201cdepriving] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Due process requires that before state actors deprive a person of property, they offer a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>See Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965). In an emergency situation \u201ca state may satisfy the requirements of procedural due process merely by making available \u2018some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the State\u2019s action at some time after the initial taking.\u2019 \u201d <em>WWBITV, Inc. v. Vill. of Rouses Point, </em>589 F.3d 46, 50 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Par-ratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 539, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981)). \u201cWhere there is an emergency requiring quick action and where meaningful pre-deprivation process would be impractical, the government is relieved of its usual obligation to provide a hearing, as long as there is an adequate procedure in place to assess the propriety of the deprivation afterwards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">At the pleading stage, then, a plaintiff must provide factual allegations that permit a plausible inference that (1) the relevant official(s) lacked \u201ccompetent evidence ... to reasonably believe\u201d that an emergency existed; or (2) that an official\u2019s decision to invoke an emergency procedure was \u201carbitrary or amounted] to an abuse of discretion\u201d; or (3) that a state\u2019s post-deprivation remedies are somehow inadequate. <em>Catanzaro v. Weiden, </em>188 F.3d 56, 63 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see also WWBITV, Inc., </em>589 F.3d at 50. Bound as we are at this stage in the litigation to \u201cdraw[ ] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor,\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>493 F.3d at 98, we conclude that Heckman has alleged two plausible grounds on which he might maintain a procedural due process claim going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">A. Emergency</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Heckman\u2019s pleadings sufficiently raise the inference \u201cthat no emergency existed at the time of [] [Defendants\u2019 declaration that [his] home was unfit for human occupation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation on this issue with respect to the Second Amended Complaint (which was accepted by the district court in its entirety), reiterated the conclusions of the first Report and Recommendation, which noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">[The First Amended Complaint] suggests that there were <em>indicia </em>that emergency action on the part of the Town may have been necessary: the detection of a possible gas leak by the police officers, various possible building code violations, and the plaintiffs own acknowledgment regarding his inability to part with items and the resulting \u2018cluttered\u2019 appearance of his home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Heckman v. Town of Hempstead, </em>No. 10-5455(SJF)(GRB), Report &amp; Recommendation of Magistrate Judge (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2013), at *7 (citation omitted). The Magistrate\u2019s Report found that \u201c[t]he only substantive changes in the current incarnation of the complaint\u201d referred to \u201cbest practice procedures for gas leaks[,]\u201d and concluded that these were insufficient to cure any deficiencies in Heckman\u2019s prior pleadings. <em>Id. </em>at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The Magistrate\u2019s characterization of the Second Amended Complaint is incorrect. Heckman\u2019s Second Amended Complaint adds two allegations: that Schwartz conceded to Heckman\u2019s sister, Barbara Eaton, on January 7, 2008, that \u201cthe Town could have sent a letter giving [Heckman] a specific time within which to comply with the demands of the Town\u201d; and that Schwartz conceded that \u201cTown employees would not have taken the action that they did if they believed that the house had been occupied.\u201d <em>Compare </em>2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 76 (pri- or notice), <em>and id. </em>\u00b6 78 (house unoccupied), <em>with </em>1st Am. Compl. \u00b6 83 (noting only a December 21, 2007 phone call between Schwartz and Eaton).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u25a0 These two additional allegations, if true, plausibly allege that the relevant Defendants did not \u201creasonably believe\u201d that an emergency situation obtained at the time that Defendants boarded up Heckman\u2019s house. Schwartz\u2019s first statement to Eaton literally concedes as much, and had the procedure described by Schwartz been followed it might have put the Town in compliance with its obligations regarding vacating dangerous structures. And Schwartz\u2019s second statement, implying that the Town only began boarding up the house on the assumption that it was uninhabited, read in the light most favorable to Heckman, suggests that concerns other than an emergency posed by the structure to Heckman or others motivated the decision to board up Heckman\u2019s residence. The Town and the Defendants will have the opportunity at later stages in this proceeding to adduce evidence attesting to whatever imminently dangerous emergency conditions they believed justified boarding up Heckman\u2019s house without notice, and causing all utilities to the house to be discontinued indefinitely. <em>See </em>Building Code \u00a7 90-1 (listing dangerous conditions which include, <em>inter alia, </em>various structural deficiencies or buildings that are a \u201cnuisance to the general public.\u201d); Building Code \u00a7 90-15 (allowing a building inspector to order the immediate vacation of a building \u201cwhere it reasonably appears that there is imminent danger to the life or safety of any person\u201d); <em>see also Catanza-ro, </em>188 F.3d at 63-64 (concluding that, at summary judgment, the \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d of structural damage to a building as a result of a car accident, combined with the short time frame in which the defendant town officials ordered its demolition, supported the conclusion that defendants were entitled to summary judgment as to plaintiffs due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">B. Post-Deprivation Process</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">In his challenge to the post-deprivation procedure, Heckman alleges that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>was provided only a note, handwritten on a piece of scrap paper, stating in a perfunctory manner some purported violations of the Town\u2019s Housing and Rehabilitation Code. Moreover, he alleges that he was never informed of his right under the Code to request a hearing to contest those alleged violations. <em>See </em>Building Code \u00a7 88-3(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Defendants disclaim any statutory or constitutional obligation to \u201cinform every citizen of their rights under the publicly available [ ] Code.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 37. The Code, however, does impose such an obligation on the Manager of the Building Department. <em>See </em>Building Code \u00a7 88-3(A) (requiring that notice of any violations of the Code \u201cshall ... [s]et forth the procedure rights [for contesting the allegations by hearing] as outlined in \u00a7 88-3(B)\u201d). While remedial action may be ordered without notice or hearing in an emergency, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 88-3(E), Heckman\u2019s allegations raise a plausible inference that the violations that he was ultimately ordered to remedy were not sufficiently relevant to an ongoing emergency (i.e., the Town\u2019s remedial action on December 20, 2007 was sufficient to neutralize the emergency).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If that were proven, the Town might be held to its self-imposed notice requirements\u2014particularly in light of Heckman\u2019s allegations that he repeatedly expressed specific objections to the alleged Code violations to housing authorities in the days and weeks following the condemnation of his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby AFFIRM the dismissal with prejudice of Heckman\u2019s ADA claim, but VACATE the dismissal of his due process claim. Accordingly, we REMAND to the district court for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">. Indeed, the housing authorities are alleged to have allowed Heckman to return to and sleep in his home notwithstanding its status as \"unfit for human occupancy.\u201d Appellant's Reply Br. 11. Moreover, he was given a significant amount of time to fix the alleged Code violations, suggesting at least that the Town\u2019s actions had ended the emergency such that formal notice of his post-deprivation remedies could be provided. <em>Compare </em>Building Code \u00a7 88-3(E) (\"Any party to whom [an emergency] order is directed shall comply therewith immediately. If such party is not available or does not respond with sufficient promptness to meet the emergency, then the Manager of the Building Department shall have the power to correct the emergency[J\u201d), <em>with </em>Building Code \u00a7 88\u20143(A)(3), (4) (providing, in non-emergency situations, for service of formal notice on an owner, \"[a]llow[ing] a reasonable time for the performance of any act it requires\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
