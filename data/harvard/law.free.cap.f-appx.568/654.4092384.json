McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b678-18\">Petitioner Antone Knox, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certif\u00edcate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas petition. In his habeas petition, Petitioner challenged the state parole board\u2019s denial of his request for parole. The district court concluded Petitioner was not enti-tied to habeas relief because Oklahoma\u2019s parole system is discretionary and therefore does not give rise to a protected liberty interest. <em>See Malek v. Haun, </em>26 F.3d 1013, 1015 (10th Cir.1994); <em>see also Shabazz v. Keating, </em>977 P.2d 1089, 1093 (Okla.1999). The district court further concluded that the second claim in the petition, which was based on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, could not be brought in a habeas proceeding and should therefore be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-23\">After thoroughly reviewing Petitioner\u2019s filings and the record on appeal, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s resolution of this case. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We therefore DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Petitioner has filed a motion for sanctions, in which he asks this court to inform him if any of the documents he mailed to the court are missing as a result of prison officials\u2019 alleged tampering with his legal mail, and, if so, to impose sanctions on Defendant. We have received and reviewed all pertinent documents, and we accordingly DENY the motion for sanctions. Petitioner\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-19\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
