He was sentenced to serve 240 months on each count, to run concurrently, and to be followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in finding that he was subject to an enhanced sentencing range on the basis of a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-22\">A conviction for distribution or receipt of child pornography ordinarily carries a mandatory minimum term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ment of five years and maximum sentence of 20 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). However, if the defendant \u201chas a prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,\u201d the statute requires a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years and a maximum sentence of 40 years. <em>Id. </em>We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, as well as with the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Salvatore contends that the district court erred in finding that his youthful offender adjudication for violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 130.50 triggered the sentencing enhancement set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). The district court concluded that, under our decision in <em>United States v. Sampson, </em>385 F.3d 183 (2d Cir.2004), Salvatore\u2019s youthful offender adjudication was a \u201cconviction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2252A(b)(l), and that therefore Salvatore was subject to the provision\u2019s sentencing enhancement. In so finding, the district court did not inquire into the particularities of Salvatore\u2019s youthful offender adjudication or sentence, but instead determined that youthful offender adjudications are, categorically, convictions under \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). On appeal, Salvatore argues that this determination was erroneous because, in his view, <em>Sampson </em>and related precedent require an examination of the substantive consequences of a youthful offender adjudication to determine whether it counts as a conviction under federal law. The government agrees that <em>Sampson </em>applies, but argues that <em>Sampson </em>does not require an individualized inquiry into the substantive consequences of the youthful offender adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Salvatore has presented substantial arguments to support his view that <em>Sampson </em>requires a court to examine the substantive consequences of a youthful offender adjudication to determine whether it constitutes a conviction within the meaning of \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). <em>See Sampson, </em>385 F.3d at 195; <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>504 F.3d 250, 253 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we need not decide whether <em>Sampson </em>requires individualized or merely categorical inquiry because, in either case, Salvatore\u2019s youthful offender adjudication would be considered a conviction under \u00a7 2252A(b)(l). When conducting an individualized inquiry, we have held that \u201c[tjhere is no set formula for determining \u2018the substantive consequence of the criminal proceeding underlying the youthful offender adjudication.\u2019\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>504 F.3d at 253 (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>415 F.3d 256, 264 (2d Cir.2005)). However, we have considered factors including whether the defendant was tried in adult court, how the adjudication is characterized by the relevant state law, and whether any sentence was served in an adult prison. <em>See, e.g., Jackson, </em>504 F.3d at 253; <em>Sampson, </em>385 F.3d at 195. Salvatore was tried in an adult court and, as described in <em>Sampson, </em>he incurred a conviction that was subsequently replaced by the youthful offender adjudication at issue in this appeal. <em>Id. </em>Although Salvatore did not serve time for his offense,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>that factor is not alone dispositive. Moreover, other aspects of the record make it clear that his youthful offender adjudication should be treated as an adult conviction: he was only a few months shy of his eighteenth birthday when he committed the offense described in the criminal complaint, and he was eighteen when he pleaded guilty to the predicate offense, which was a Class B felony. Based on these undisputed facts, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we are required to analyze the substantive consequences of his youthful offender adjudication, we conclude that it would be a \u201cconviction\u201d under \u00a7 2252A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-13\">. There appears to be a discrepancy in the judgment, which indicates that Salvatore pleaded guilty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2)(A) and every other document in the record, which indicate that Salvatore was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A). We assume that this was a scrivener\u2019s error in the judgment and remand for the sole purpose of correcting the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">. Because both parties argue that \"conviction\" is defined by reference to federal law, we assume without deciding that \"conviction\u201d in this statute is defined by federal rather than state law. <em>But see United States v. Bruns, </em>641 F.3d 555, 557 (D.C.Cir.2011) (assuming, without deciding, \"that Congress intended state law to determine whether a person has a prior conviction\u201d under \u00a7 2252A(b)); S.Rep. No. 104-358, at 7-8 (explaining that the legislation containing the enhanced penalty provision was intended to bring federal law \"in line with the penalties for such conduct established by most States\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">. He was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, which was discharged after four years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
