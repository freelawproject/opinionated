The district court denied restitution under the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d), the discretionary counterpart to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d). The VWPA provides that the court \u201cmay order\u201d defendants convicted of certain offenses to \u201cmake restitution to any victim of such offense[s].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a). The VWPA further provides that the court \u201cmay decline\u201d to order restitution \u201c[t]o the extent the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution under this section outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u201cThe language of the [VWPA] exemption provision gives the district court a certain amount of discretion in determining whether to consider additional evidence in assessing restitution.\u201d <em>United States v. Dupre, </em>117 F.3d 810, 824 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Cienfuegos, </em>462 F.3d 1160, 1167-68 (9th Cir.2006) (distinguishing between the MVRA and the VWPA). Although courts have used this balancing exemption infrequently, courts have exercised their discretion to invoke this exemption in cases involving \u201cdifficult issues of causation and speculative loss.\u201d <em>Dupre, </em>117 F.3d at 824; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Fountain, </em>768 F.2d 790, 802 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In considering the record before us, and mindful of the mandamus posture of this matter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that Petitioners have not shown that the district court clearly and indisputably erred in finding that \u201cthe complication and prolongation of the sentencing process\u201d involved in fashioning a restitution order for lifetime medical monitoring outweighed the need for such restitution in this case. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii); <em>In re Allen, </em>701 F.3d 734, 735 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>In re Dean, </em>527 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir.2008)). In reaching this finding, the court held hearings, received over 800 victim impact statements, heard expert testimony from Cit-go\u2019s and the Government\u2019s experts, heard oral testimony from over 90 members of the community, allowed the parties and victims extensive briefing on restitution, and issued a twenty-page written opinion. The court found that Petitioners and the Government \u201cfailed to show, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that medical monitoring is necessary based on their increased risk of future latent disease due to Tanks 116 and 117.\u201d In reaching this conclusion (as well as its other tandem restitution denial rulings), the court found there to be insufficient evidence on the issues of causation and cost calculation, including insufficient evidence as to the levels of exposure to emissions from Tanks 116 and 117, and as to the particular long-term health risks proximately caused by exposure to those levels of emissions. The court further found there to be insufficient evidence as to the types of tests medically appropriate to test for the particular health risks posed, and the costs for those tests. Finally, the court found that, considering the state of the evidence and the time already devoted to evaluating restitution, determining restitution would unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>complicate and prolong the sentencing process. We cannot say that the district court clearly and indisputably erred in this regard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We further find no clear and indisputable right, amenable to and warranting mandamus relief, based on the district court\u2019s issuance of a final written order declining restitution pursuant to the above exemption provision of the VWPA. To be sure, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the court does not order restitution ... the court shall include in the statement the reason therefor.\u201d Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5), however, expressly allows a court a deferment period \u201cnot to exceed 90 days after sentencing\u201d to make a restitution determination if \u201cthe victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable\u201d prior to sentencing (as well as a 60 day period for victims to petition the court to amend a restitution order after discovering \u201cfurther losses\u201d). Here, the district court held a sentencing hearing, heard testimony from victims, and received victim impact statements. The court then, consistent with the \u00a7 3553(c) imperative cited by Petitioners, announced that it would not order restitution at sentencing, stating in open court as its reason that victim losses were not ascertainable due to their complexity. Petitioners provide no authority demonstrating a clear and indisputable right, amenable to and warranting mandamus relief under \u00a7 3771(d)(3), or indeed appropriate for supervisory mandamus intercession, to have such a final restitution determination\u2014deferred pursuant to \u00a7 3664(d)(5), and then declined pursuant to \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u2014 announced in open court after the defendant\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">For the reasons above, IT IS ORDERED that the petition for writ of mandamus is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioners\u2019 motion to waive the requirement for a 72 hour ruling on this matter, or alternatively to consolidate the petition with the related appeal, is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Dr. Melissa L. Jarrell\u2019s motion for leave to file an amicus curiae brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Lawrence Jordan, Rosie Porter, and Rose Alvarez\u2019s motion for leave to intervene is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioners\u2019 motion for leave to file a reply is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-10\">.

Although we hold that Petitioners have not shown a clear and indisputable right to relief through the writ of mandamus, we express no opinion as to the proper outcome under the standards of review applicable under any direct review process. <em>Compare United States v.
