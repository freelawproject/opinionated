MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b581-24\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">On September 23, 2013, Appellant Raymond Duane Sanchez filed a <em>pro se </em>pleading styled \u201cPetition for Redress of Grievance.\u201d Relying on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), Sanchez collaterally challenged the mandatory minimum sentence he received for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>But see In re Payne, </em>733 F.3d 1027,1029-30 (10th Cir.2013) (holding <em>Alleyne </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review). The district court concluded Sanchez\u2019s claim must be brought in a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because it implicated the validity of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1148 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is one claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States ... or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The court, however, declined to recharacterize Sanchez\u2019s petition as a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255, in part, because it would likely be barred by the one-year statute of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) (setting forth a one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7 2255 motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The district court concluded there was no jurisdictional basis for Sanchez\u2019s petition other than \u00a7 2255 and denied it for that reason. The court, however, then proceeded to examine Sanchez\u2019s <em>Alleyne </em>claim and concluded it lacked merit. It relied on this conclusion as an alternate basis to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">On appeal, Sanchez challenges the denial of his petition, arguing the district court erred by recharacterizing it as a \u00a7 2255 motion and, alternatively, that the jurisdictional basis of his petition lies in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On his first point, Sanchez is simply incorrect. The district court specifically refused to recharacterize his motion as one brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because Sanchez\u2019s conviction became final many years before he filed the instant petition, the claim he seeks to raise would likely be untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). Thus, the district court\u2019s decision to not recharacterize the petition was not an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Valadez-Camarena, </em>402 F.3d 1259, 1261 (10th Cir.2005) (holding district court did not err by refusing to recharacterize defendant\u2019s motion as one pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because \u201csuch a motion would, at least facially, be barred as untimely\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">As to Sanchez\u2019s second argument, this court reviews jurisdictional issues <em>de novo. Full Life Hospice, LLC v. Sebelius, </em>709 F.3d 1012, 1016 (10th Cir.2013). It is well-settled that \u201c[t]he exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a [federal] judgment and sentence, unless it is inadequate or ineffective, is that provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir.1999) (quotation omitted). Thus, Sanchez\u2019s assertion that jurisdiction over his petition arises under the Petition Clause of the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ment can be quickly rejected. The AED-PA provides a prisoner with a reasonably adequate opportunity to pursue a post-conviction challenge to his conviction or sentence and, thus, does not violate the First Amendment\u2019s right of access to the courts. <em>Hill v. Dailey, </em>557 F.3d 437, 439 (6th Cir.2009). Because of the jurisdictional limitation imposed by the AEDPA, a federal prisoner must use \u00a7 2255 to collaterally attack his conviction or sentence unless he can show that \u00a7 2255 is either inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 439-40; <em>see also Sines v. Wilner, </em>609 F.3d 1070, 1073-74 (10th Cir.2010) (discussing the circumstances under which \u00a7 2255 could be inadequate or ineffective). Because Sanchez has failed to show that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, the district court did not err in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to consider his Petition for Redress of Grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Although we affirm the district court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling, we conclude the district court erred by addressing Sanchez\u2019s claims on the merits and denying his petition with prejudice on that alternative basis. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 93-94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\u201cThe requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter spring[s] from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the United States and is inflexible and without exception.\u201d). Accordingly, we remand the matter to the district court with instructions to vacate its order dated October 21, 2013, denying Sanchez\u2019s petition and enter a new order dismissing Sanchez\u2019s petition without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">. Sanchez pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and received a 180-month term of incarceration because he qualified as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). In his direct appeal, he argued one of the prior convictions used to support the application of the Armed Career Criminal Act was not a crime of violence. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>226 Fed.Appx. 852, 853 (10th Cir.2007). This court considered the argument but affirmed Sanchez\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 854, 226 Fed.Appx. 852.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-14\">.
