Eisai is a Japanese manufacturer of pharmaceutical drugs. Michael Keeler (\u201cRelator\u201d) was one of twenty-four sales representatives for Ei-sai\u2019s United States subsidiary, a position he held during a three-year period from sometime in 2006 through April 2009. He initiated this <em>qui tam </em>action on August 4, 2009 under the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), which allows individuals to bring private actions in the name of the Government against individuals who defraud the Government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After reviewing the pleadings and the parties\u2019 arguments, the Court concludes that although the Complaint\u2014at 189 pages\u2014recites numerous factual allegations and legal conclusions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it fails to plead key elements of fraud in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Because Relator has had ample opportunities to correct the deficiencies, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Court will now dismiss his claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Principally, Relator claims that Eisai promoted its drugs for non-approved uses and paid medical providers to use its drugs in non-approved ways, which he personally observed or became aware of while working at the company. According to Relator, service providers allegedly submitted claims for reimbursement through government-administered health care programs that were not reimbursable and with respect to which they falsely certified that they had not received a kickback in connection with the claim. Further, Relator contends that Eisai falsified drug payment information and submitted it to the Government, thereby failing to give the Government preferred rates as it was contractually obligated to do. The Complaint describes this conduct as beginning in 2006 and continuing to this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">A. Off-Label Promotion</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Relator contends that the Defendant marketed and promoted two cancer-treating drugs, Ontak and Dacogen, for off-label uses, i.e., uses that go beyond what has been approved after an exacting review process by the Food and Drug Administration. Ontak was approved to treat cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma \u201cfor patients whose malignant cells express the CD-25 component of the IL-2 receptor.\u201d (Compl-\u00b6 92.) Despite this, Eisai allegedly promoted the drug for treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, chronic lymphatic lymphoma, relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, graft versus host disease and melanoma. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 83).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dacogen is indicated solely for the treatment of myleodys-plastic syndromes, a condition in which bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells, but Eisai allegedly promoted it for treatment of acute myeloge-nous leukemia, which is a cancer affecting blood cells. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 165-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">As a sales representative for Eisai, who also attended company meetings and interacted with other employees, Relator claims to have direct and personal knowledge of the message Eisai sought to communicate to physicians. (Comply 12-14, 54.) While Eisai\u2019s official policy was that off-label studies should not be distributed during sales, he was \u201csupplied with numerous articles of dubious scientific nature, touting various off-label uses of Ontak which were to be distributed to physicians and referred to during visits to physicians.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 87, 96,125.) Apart from educating physicians about the suitability of its drugs for other indications, Eisai \u201cmarketed the spread\u201d: that is, Eisai alerted certain providers of the profit to be earned based on the difference between the discounted price of Ontak they received and the reimbursements they would recoup. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 129.) The \u201cspread\u201d was approximately $700 per dose administered and motivated doctors to prescribe the drug as much as possible. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 133.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He alleges that sales representatives were trained to use similar tactics to market Dacogen. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Eisai incentivized its representatives to act by providing \u201clucrative commissions to its marketing force\u201d and counting off-label sales toward representatives\u2019 sales quotas. (Comply 36.) The pressure was such that Relator complained to his supervisor, David Trexler, about having \u201cto achieve the company\u2019s required sales quotas which were inflated because they included a high percentage of off-label sales.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 109.) In October 2008, Eisai\u2019s oncology sales representatives compiled sales information showing that between <em>50 </em>and 70 percent of Ontak\u2019s total sales were derived from off-label sales. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In the Complaint, Relator refers to just a few instances in which Eisai engaged in this promotional conduct. For example, in November 2006, Relator was a trainee in an Ontak sales class in which he received off-label studies to use in making presentations to physicians and other similar materials. (CompLIHi 81-82, 88-90.) At an unspecified time and with no details of its contents, an Eisai District Manager distributed a paper advocating off-label use of Ontak to sales representatives. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 90.) In June 2007, Eisai\u2019s director of research wrote an e-mail to Eisai\u2019s sales managers suggesting that an unapproved off-label marketing update (which is not further described) should be shown to providers but not left with them. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 99.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At an unspecified time and without elaboration, Eisai\u2019s Vice President of Sales, Leslie Mir-ani, instructed unknown sales representatives to promote Dacogen for off-label use, to promote longer administration at more frequent intervals, and to use larger dosages. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 174.) Finally, without describing who was involved, where it occurred, or when it was said, Relator claims he \u201cwas directed to tell physicians ... that there were studies showing that CD-25 positive/negative made no difference in the treatment of patients, which was known to be untrue.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Beyond employing its sales force to deliver such sales messages, Relator alleges that Eisai engaged physicians to promote off-label uses. \u201cDr. Peter Heald was compensated by Eisai to speak and write articles on off-label uses of Ontak.\u201d (Compl.lffl 90, 154.) Additionally, Lauren Pinter-Brown, M.D. was paid $20,000 as another Ontak consultant and spoke to a group of South Florida physicians in 2008 about off-label uses of Ontak and \u201cpresenting claims to Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 154, 164, 249.) And in October 2008, Dr. Francine Foss spoke at a dinner in South Florida \u201con the use of Ontak for treating peripheral T cell lymphoma.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 153.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">According to the allegations, doctors were also paid to conduct off-label studies. Relator provides a single example of this: a doctor named Nam Dang, M.D. was paid $50,000 in consulting fees, and authored \u201cclinical studies related to the off-label use of Ontak for unapproved conditions, including B-cell lymphoma and [peripheral T-cell lymphoma].\u201d (Comply 248.) Dr. Dang was also identified as an Eisai contact to physicians, who were told to \u201ccall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>[him] directly with questions about the suitability of Ontak for off-label uses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 148,154, 248.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Additionally, Eisai funded hospitals for their role in facilitating Eisai\u2019s promotion of off-label uses of its products to doctors. In March 2007, the University of Miami Sylvester Cancer Center was given an \u201ceducational grant\u201d to allow a doctor to make a presentation on Ontak\u2019s approved uses, but which ultimately addressed the off-label use of Ontak. (Compl.lffl 148-49.) Likewise, in July 2007, the University of Arizona and a doctor received a \u201cprecep-torship\u201d grant, which was followed by that doctor presenting on Ontak\u2019s use for treatment of 8-cell lymphoma. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 150.) Relator believes that similar educational grants were given to two other facilities\u2014 the Dana Farber Cancer Center and the Lurie Cancer Center at Northwestern University. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Finally, although it is not tied to any payment, prescription, or claim submission, Relator makes much of Eisai\u2019s Oncology Reimbursement Assistance (\u201cOAR\u201d) Program, which guaranteed that prescribes would be paid at Medicare rates. As purportedly reflected in an e-mail that Relator sent to an Eisai employee in March 2007, Eisai promised to cover the price of Ontak if it was not covered in whole or in part by Medicare when a claim was submitted, regardless of whether it was ultimately approved or rejected by the Government. (Complin 189, 146.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relator alleges that this practice \u201cgreatly increase[ed] the number of drug prescriptions and, indirectly, the amount of money spent by the federal government for reimbursement of prescriptions covered by the Government Health Care Programs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 139-141.) More to the point, he alleges that this practice was a recognition by Eisai that off-label uses might not be reimbursed by the government. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 142-43.) Relator claims that unnamed Eisai sales representatives were trained at unspecified times to deliver messages that Relator loosely describes in his Complaint as \u201cessentially\u201d comprised of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An0\">Medicare could reject these claims because you\u2019re prescribing Ontak for an offlabel use. But don\u2019t worry: We\u2019ll coach you on the claims submission process to optimize reimbursement. With our tips on coding, these claims submissions will fly below the radar. Trust us. Besides, we\u2019ve got your back\u2014If Medicare or Medicaid doesn\u2019t pay you, we will ensure that you are not out of pocket!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-9\"><em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">B. Kickbacks</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Next, Relator alleges that Eisai engaged in a \u201cnationwide system\u201d of kickbacks as part of its marketing strategy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>(Comply 33.) In addition to the payments to physicians for conducting off-label studies and advocating off-label use and payments to hospitals for hosting related lectures,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Relator cites several other instances of what he takes to constitute illegal kickbacks: \u201cany money, fee, commission, credit, gift, gratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind which is provided, directly or indirectly, to any prime contractor, prime contractor employee, subcontractor or subcontractor employee, for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with a prime contract or in connection with a subcontract relating to a prime contract.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (quoting 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 52-53).)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">However, there few details regarding the payments these health care providers received from Eisai. For example, Relator contends that at an unidentified Tampa resort at some point in 2007, one unnamed physician received $3,000 in accommodations relating to his attendance at a lecture \u201cfocus[ing] on Ontak\u2019s use for Tcell lymphoma and other cancers.\u201d (Comply 157.) In July 2007, unspecified \u201c[m]onies\u201d were paid to a \u201cDr. Miller\u201d for making a \u201cpresentation regarding use of Ontak for B cell lymphoma.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 150.) And without elaboration, Relator claims that \u201c[ojther physicians promoting off-label use of On-tak who received very substantial compensation from Eisai were Dr. Nam Dang, Nevada Cancer Center, Dr. Pinter-Brown, UCLA, Dr. Timothy Kuzel with Northwestern, and Dr. Peter Heald, a dermatology professor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 154.) \u201c[Similar educational grants were paid in return for off-label presentation access to such well-known cancer treatment centers as: the Dana Farber Cancer Center in Boston, Lurie Cancer Center at Northwestern University in Chicago, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">C. Submission of False Claims for Reimbursement</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Relator alleges that any claim for reimbursement resulting from Eisai\u2019s off-label promotion or payment of kickbacks is fraudulent, unreimbursable, and constitutes a \u201cfalse claim\u201d within the meaning of the FCA. (Compl.^ 135, 219, 229.) Providers can receive payment by submitting claims through three government-funded programs: Medicare, which provides health services for individuals 65 and older (Comply 2); Medicaid, which provides health services to low-income individuals, and is paid for by states that are reimbursed to some degree by the federal government <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 3); and TRICARE, which provides health services to military personnel and their dependents. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">With respect to kickbacks, providers seeking Medicare coverage agree that their claims are \u201cconditioned upon the claim and the underlying transaction complying with [Medicare] laws, regulations, and program instructions (including, but not limited to, the Federal anti-kickback statute and Stark law, and on the [provider\u2019s] compliance with all applicable conditions of participation in Medicare.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 224.) Similar language is contained in certifications accompanying cost reports they must submit. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 225-226.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>dividual state statutes control Medicaid reimbursements, but they generally provide that payment may be withheld for fraud or misrepresentation, concealment of a material fact, or receipt of a kickback in connection with furnishing treatment. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 280-237.) According to Relator, kickbacks run afoul of the FCA because Medicare participants must certify compliance with the Anti-Kickback Act to receive payments for prescriptions given to their Medicare patients. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b623.) Alternatively, because the Government would not have paid the claims had it known of the violation of a law, they are false under an \u201cimplied certification\u201d theory. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">However, there are few details to support a conclusion that any hospital or doctor that received payments from Eisai as described above\u2014assuming they constitute kickbacks\u2014submitted a claim for reimbursement. As best the Court can tell, Dr. Foss, whose role is otherwise described as a speaker and director of off-label studies, \u201cprescribe[ed] Ontak off-label and ma[de] false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d (Comply 256(a).) The Dana Farber Cancer Center and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center appear on a company report as having purchased Ontak, a purchase for which Relator believes they sought reimbursement. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 240.) Dr. Pinter-Brown was paid for serving as a consultant; at one point in the Complaint, Relator refers to the fact that she \u201cmade off-label Ontak claims to Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 249.) Finally, the Complaint suggests that the most frequent lecturers were also the top off-label prescribers. (Compl.W 156, 163). As discussed below, without more, these conclusory allegations are insufficient to assert that claims were actually submitted to the Government for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Similarly, with regard to off-label promotion\u2014assuming this activity can render a claim false\u2014there are few allegations to support Relator\u2019s assertion that doctors who were persuaded by Eisai to prescribe medication off-label submitted claims to the Government. With respect to the three doctors who were paid for speeches regarding Ontak as described above-Drs. Heald, Pinter-Brown, and Foss\u2014the Complaint is conspicuously silent as to whether any prescribing doctor was in attendance or whether any speaker caused any particular off-label claim to be submitted. The same is true of Dr. Dang, who was alleged<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ly hired as Eisai\u2019s consultant and to conduct off-label studies, and the hospitals that were paid to host off-label presentations. In sum, it is unclear whether any doctor who attended any of those lectures, read any of those articles or studies, or spoke to Eisai\u2019s consultants were persuaded to make off-label prescriptions and to seek reimbursement for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Nevertheless, the Complaint does provide limited discussion of submissions that resulted from Eisai other promotional activities. Over a nine month period, Eisai sales representatives made in-person sales calls to three doctors at Baptist Hospital, stating that clinical data demonstrated that Dacogen was effective for an off-label indication and leaving behind Eisai-spon-sored studies and marketing materials. (Compl.\u00b6 177.) According to the Complaint, Baptist Hospital then used Dacogen for non-approved uses. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 177.) Relator alleges that Eisai \u201cintended that [its] above-described marketing practices would result in the submission of off-label claims to Medicare and Medicaid\u201d and that they \u201ccaused [the hospital] to submit false or fraudulent claims ... which were approved and paid by Medicare and Medicaid respectively.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 178.) Relator makes verbatim allegations with respect to in-person sales calls by unspecified \u201cEisai sales representatives\u201d to two doctors at Memorial Regional Hospital, two doctors at Sylvester Cancer Center, and two doctors at Boca Raton Community Hospital. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 179-184.) Relator asserts that the promotions and other activities resulted in false claims by roughly two dozen hospitals during the two-and-a-half year timeframe of the Complaint and Relator provides approximate dollar figures based on his estimation. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 57, 59, 256.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Relator also alleges that Eisai was directly involved in falsifying submissions. Without specifying exactly who, where, when, or what statements were made, the Complaint states that Eisai hired reimbursement specialists to coach physicians, hospitals, and other medical providers on how to present off-label Ontak claims for reimbursement, including through telephone support. (Compl.1ffl 241-42.) For instance, Eisai recommended that they provide an \u201coff-label secondary diagnosis code[ ]\u201d on a Medicare claim form, such as diabetes. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 241-246.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Through this, Eisai intended and caused false claims for payment to be submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 243-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The most significant document Relator points to regarding false submissions is a GOERS report, which was provided to Ei-sai\u2019s sales representatives. This report shows the number of units of Ontak that Eisai sold to 188 named providers, and lists their addresses and reporting dates. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59, 238, 240; Compl. Ex. G.) Although the report provides little more than the provider\u2019s name and the quantity of drugs each had bought by a certain date (notably, it includes no billing information, such as dollar value of the sales and how much was reimbursed by the Government}, he alleges that he \u201cwas informed by managers that the providers listed in the GOERS report routinely bill Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 240.) Based on his own experience, Relator estimates that of his $5.5 million in sales of Ontak, twenty-five percent was later false<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>ly or fraudulently submitted to Medicare for reimbursement and two percent was submitted to Medicaid. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 255.) He further estimates that 2,000 hospitals, oncology offices, oncologists, and pharmacies submitted claims that involved off-label promotion or kickbacks. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">D. Best Price Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">While all other allegations assert that Eisai engaged in conduct that caused false claims to be filed, Relator asserts one way in which Eisai made a false claim to the Government directly\u2014falsely reporting pricing information. Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs ensure that pharmaceutical companies offer state governments reimbursement rates for drugs that are no greater than the rate charged to other entities (i.e., manufacturers must provide the Government with the \u201cBest Price\u201d). (Compile 187-88.) As part of the agreement to provide such rebates, manufacturers must make quarterly reports that disclose pricing information for covered drugs, including the best price offered to any purchaser. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 188-89, 191.) Relator contends that Eisai falsified information about its drug pricing to the Government with respect to Ontak, Dacogen, and two other drugs: Aloxi, which is used to treat nausea caused by chemotherapy, and Fragmin, which is used to treat blood clots caused by cancer or heart conditions. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 185-86.) Relator alleges that this conduct is actionable under the FCA. (ComplV 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">These drugs were highly profitable to Eisai, but also faced stiff competition from rival manufacturers making versions under their own name. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 194-96.) Accordingly, Eisai gave prospective buyers aggressive discounts, which were approved at the sales representative and management level, but not tracked centrally by Eisai. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 194, 196.) Eisai\u2019s discounts were based on volume and bundling with other drug sales. Relator was told by unnamed supervisors that Eisai\u2019s best customers were allowed volume discounts that were not included on company price lists or information sent to the Government. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 201.) At a conference in 2008, Relator and other sales representatives learned that Eisai planned to falsely report an increase in the cost of Aloxi\u2014which would increase its average sales price\u2014and obtain a higher reimbursement rate from Medicare and Medicaid. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 204-05.) In reality, because of discounts offered to physicians, the sales price was decreasing. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 205.) At a sales meeting in 2008, an Eisai sales representative named \u201cFrank\u201d told Relator that \u201c[njobody else\u201d but Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida was getting a low price on Fragmin. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 207-08.) While he did not specify a price that Jackson paid or the price Eisai reported to the Government, he mentioned that \u201c[w]e are almost giving it away.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 207.) And finally, two upper level Eisai managers launched a plan to bundle Aloxi and Dacogen in order to \u201cgain a formulary position at each institution purchasing them.\u201d <em>(Id.n </em>214-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">E. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">This case has a procedural history commensurate with the breadth and complexity of the allegations. After his initial complaint, Relator filed an amended complaint on July 8, 2010 (DE 19).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>24, 2011, the Government filed a notice declining to intervene in this action, leaving Relator to prosecute this action on its behalf.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court subsequently ordered that the complaint be unsealed and served upon the Defendant (DE 25). The First Amended Complaint was dismissed by order dated June 21, 2011 (DE 61). Relator filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 1, 2011 (DE 62) and a Third Amended Complaint on July 29, 2011. The Court had warned Relator that he \u201cwill not be afforded any more opportunities to amend his complaint.\u201d (DE 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Based on the allegations described above,. Relator essentially brings three distinct claims. Count I alleges that Defendant\u2019s promotion of off-label uses caused doctors to prescribe drugs for off-label purposes and submit false claims for reimbursement, violating the False Claims Act. Second, in that same Count, Relator alleges that Eisai failed to provide the Government with \u201cbest prices\u201d for Ontak, Dacogen and two other drugs, Aloxi and Fragmin. Finally, Count II alleges that Eisai paid prescribers to induce them to prescribe Eisai\u2019s drugs and to submit claims for reimbursement to Medicare and Medicaid, and also paid for physicians\u2019 speeches and for physicians to conduct off-label clinical trials. In so doing, Relator asserts that Eisai violated the Anti Kickback Act, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 52 <em>et seq., </em>and by extension, the FCA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because of this conduct, Relator also brings claims under various state anti-fraud statutes (Counts III-XXXII). Eisai has moved to dismiss primarily on the ground that Relator has failed to sufficiently state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to state a claim that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). The Court\u2019s consideration is limited to the allegations presented. <em>See GSW, Inc. v. Long Cnty., </em>999 F.2d 1508, 1510 (11th Cir.1993). All factual allegations are accepted as true and all reasonable inferences are drawn in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Speaker v.

Nevertheless, while a plaintiff need not provide \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d the allegations must consist of more than \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Additionally, \u201cconclusory allegations, unwarranted factual deductions or legal eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>elusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal.\u201d <em>Davila v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>326 F.3d 1183, 1185 (11th Cir. 2003). The \u201c[fjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right of relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., </em>495 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 545, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In addition to the requirements of <em>Twombly, Iqbal, </em>and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a) and 12(b)(6), claims asserted under the False Claims Act (as well as other fraud claims) are subject to the pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <em>See United States ex. rel. Clausen v. Laboratory Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1309-10 (11th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That rule provides that \u201c[i]n allegations of fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake\u201d but that \u201c[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person shall be averred generally.\u201d FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). Rule 9(b) is satisfied if the plaintiff pleads \u201c(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made, and (2) the time and place of each such statement and the person responsible for making (or, in the case of omissions, not making) same, and (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiff, and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.\u201d <em>Ziemba v. Cascade Int'l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1202 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In the context of the False Claims Act, the complaint must set forth \u201cfacts as to time, place, and substance of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud\u201d and \u201cthe details of the [defendant\u2019s] allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who engaged in them.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1309-10 (quotation omitted); <em>accord United States ex rel.

Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., </em>360 F.3d 220, 232 (1st Cir.2004). As discussed herein, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized that while these requirements of Rule 9(b) may, in practice, make it difficult for a <em>qui tarn </em>plaintiff to bring an action, they are necessary to prevent \u201c[s]peculative suits against innocent actors for fraud\u201d and charges of guilt by association. <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1308 (quoting <em>United States ex rel. Cooper v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., </em>19 F.3d 562, 566-67 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The Court previously found that Relator stated a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), but that his claims were not pleaded with the degree of particularity required by Rule 9(b). Significantly, Relator failed to describe specifically what Eisai did to cause false claims to be submitted, omitted critical details of claim presentation, and did not describe how the alleged kickbacks \u201ccrossed the line from legal conduct in compliance with federal statutes to illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>kickbacks.\u201d (DE 61.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Now, despite having greatly expanded his pleading and having crafted additional arguments to support his FCA claims, Relator\u2019s complaint\u2014however prolix\u2014fails to provide the requisite particularity to survive dismissal. The Court addresses each of Relator\u2019s claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">A. Scheme to Promote Off -Label Uses</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The bulk of Relator\u2019s complaint is focused on imposing liability under the FCA due to Eisai\u2019s scheme to promote off-label use of its pharmaceutical products.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Section (a)(1) requires that the Defendant make or cause a claim to be made; that the claim was false; that the falsity was known to the Defendant; and that payment was actually sought from the Government. Under the FCA\u2019s \u201ccause to be submitted\u201d language, a defendant may be liable notwithstanding the fact that it was not the submitter of a claim or that it was not in contractual privity with the government. <em>United States v. Taber Extrusions, LP, </em>341 F.3d 843, 845 (8th Cir.2003) (quoting, <em>inter alia, United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, </em>317 U.S. 537, 544-45, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943)). According to the Complaint, Eisai allegedly did this in four ways: (1) Eisai trained sales representatives to promote off-label uses (providing incentives to do so), gave pres-cribers materials showing off-label effectiveness, and marketed the spread; (2) Eisai paid consulting doctors to promote such uses and to conduct off-label clinical studies; (3) Eisai gave medical facilities grants and other payments for supporting Eisai\u2019s promotion; and (4) Eisai ran reimbursement programs to guarantee payment for off-label prescriptions to doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">The Court need not delve into the myriad arguments made by the parties in their extensive briefing since there are immediately apparent defects regarding the circumstances of the fraud.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>fraud\u2019s \u201cwho\u201d and \u201cwhere,\u201d although Relator specified receiving training and marketing materials advocating off-label use, he has failed to properly demonstrate Ei-sai\u2019s act of promotion. Relator has not alleged which individuals at Eisai instructed him (or other sales representatives) to fraudulently promote off-label uses, what those instructions were, which doctors sales representatives contacted and induced to prescribe Eisai\u2019s drugs, and what was said to them to cause them to do so. There are no allegations that Eisai\u2019s inducing statements themselves were expressly false with the exception of one conclusory allegation that he \u201cwas directed to tell physicians ... that there were studies showing that CD-25 positive/negative made no difference in the treatment of patients, which was known to be untrue.\u201d (ComplA 93.) He has not alleged, for instance, that off-label studies Eisai provided to physicians contained false data, that its representatives gave the impression that the drugs were reimbursable when they were in fact not, or that Eisai misrepresented the indications for which the drugs were approved. See <em>Bennett, </em>2011 WL 1231577, at *26 (\u201cImportantly, there is no allegation that the defendants concealed or misstated the limits of the FDA\u2019s approval on the use of the FlexView system.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">That same key information is lacking with respect to the speakers and lecturers who allegedly were engaged to promote Eisai\u2019s products. Notably, the Complaint is completely silent as to the substance of their remarks and whether any plan participants were present. One example states in its entirety that \u201c[i]n June 2007, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Dr. Dang gave a presentation at the University of Miami\u2019s Sylvester Cancer Center. Dr. Dang\u2019s presentation was advertised as being on Ontak\u2019s use in treating CTCL. Instead, Dr. Dang lectured on his off-label use of Ontak.\u201d (Comply 149.) Or, \u201cin October, 2008, Dr. Franine Foss, a longstanding paid speaker of Eisai, spoke in south Florida at a dinner program for physicians on the use of Ontak for treating peripheral T cell lymphoma.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 158.) The Complaint makes other passing references to unnamed physicians speaking about Eisai\u2019s products at unspecified dates and locations. These allegations fail to comply with the basic elements of pleading any fraudulent scheme. <em>See, e.g., Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc., </em>2006 WL 1064127, at *7 (\u201cPlaintiff fails to allege the who, what, when, where, and how regarding Defendant\u2019s sales representatives allegedly promoting the off-label uses of Elitek to doctors nor does he makes such allegations regarding Defendant] allegedly training its sales representatives in off-label uses of Elitek.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Franklin v. Parke-Davis, </em>147 F.Supp.2d 89, 50 (D.Mass.2001) (discussing promotion claim under Rule 9(b) where relator failed to specify who \u201cengaged in [the scheme to cause false submissions], where such conduct took place, which [of defendant\u2019s] personnel were involved, or any specific fraudulent statements made to personnel\u201d); <em>see also United States ex rel. Butler v. Magellan Health Servs., Inc., </em>74 F.Supp.2d 1201, 1216-17 (M.D.Fla.1999) (noting that the \u201ccomplaint fails to refer to specific employees who may have been involved in submitting false claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Moreover, even if there were sufficient allegations of statements made by and to physicians, Relator has failed to explain how the representations resulted in prescriptions and requests for reimbursement. For instance, the Complaint does not tie the efforts of Drs. Heald, Brown, Foss, and Dang\u2014all of whom allegedly received payment for lecturing on off-label uses or conducting off-label studies\u2014to any claim submitted by them or others. There is no allegation that a prescribing doctor who later sought reimbursement attended those lectures or considered the studies. At no point does Relator allege that any <em>particular </em>prescriber that is alleged to have submitted off-label claims was actually aware of any of Eisai\u2019s representations as communicated by these doctors. The same is true of the named hospitals and institutions that received money in exchange for research and lectures regarding Eisai\u2019s drugs. For instance, the University of Arizona is alleged to have received a grant in July 2007 (presumably for allowing a presentation on off-label use of Ontak) (Comply 150), but it is not one of the institutions that is alleged to have submitted claims. Indeed, it is not mentioned again anywhere else in the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Similarly, Relator has failed to plead with particularity that <em>any </em>claims for off-label use were in fact submitted to the Government and reimbursed as a result of the scheme, which is a requirement for an action based on off-label promotion under Section (a)(1) and which deficiency scuttled the previous iteration of his Complaint. <em>See Solvay, </em>588 F.3d at 1325 (requiring a plaintiff to link the fraudulent scheme to the submission of false claims); <em>United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, </em>470 F.3d 1350, 1359 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a plaintiff must \u201cprovide the next link in the FCA liability chain: showing that the defendants <em>actually submitted </em>reimbursement claims for the services he describes\u201d); <em>Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1013-14 (11th Cir.2005) (affirming dismissal where complaint \u201cdid not allege that a specific fraudulent claim was in fact submitted to the government\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311 (calling the submission or presentment of a claim to the government the <em>\u201csine qua non </em>\u201d of a False Claims Act violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Whether submission of the claim is sufficiently established is a different question than whether the scheme has been sufficiently pleaded. <em>See Corsello, </em>428 F.3d at 1014 (\u201cIn short, Corsello provided the \u2018who,\u2019 \u2018what,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when,\u2019 and \u2018how\" of improper practices, but he failed to allege the \u2018who,\u2019 \u201cwhat,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when,\u2019 and \u2018how' of fraudulent submissions to the government.\u201d). The presentment requirement calls on relators not only to describe details about how the schemes operated (however well that might be pleaded), but to cite specific occurrences of actual <em>fraud. Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1305, 1311-1312 &amp; n. 21. Thus, for at least some of the claims, a relator must provide the following: \u201cdetails concerning the dates of the claims, the content of the forms or bills submitted, their identification numbers, the amount of money charged to the government, the particular goods or services for which the government was billed, the individuals involved in the billing, and the length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the submission of claims based on those practices.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., </em>360 F.3d 220, 232-33 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1312 n. 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Illustrating this principle is the decision in <em>Clausen </em>(relied on for various points by both sides), which involved allegations that a medical testing company submitted claims for unnecessary tests to government programs, thereby violating the FCA. <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1303-04, 1306. Additionally, there were allegations of illegal kickback and self-referral schemes that resulted in improper billing. <em>Id. </em>at 1304. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint because the relator provided details about the preparatory scheme, but failed to submit any bill, claim, or payment; amounts charged by the defendant on what dates; or details of how the billing was fraudulent. <em>Id. </em>at 1306,1311-12. It concluded that \u201cnowhere in the blur of facts ... can one find any allegation, stated with particularity, of a false claim actually being submitted to the Government ... as to the plot\u2019s execution, Clausen merely offers conclusory statements, and does not adequately allege when\u2014or even if\u2014the schemes were brought to fruition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312. As the Fifth Circuit noted, \u201c[t]he <em>Clausen </em>court made plain its position that to plead a presentment claim, the minimum indicia of reliability required to satisfy the particularity standard are the specific contents of actually submitted claims, such as billing numbers, dates, and amounts.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Grubbs v. Kanneganti, </em>565 F.3d 180, 186, 190 <em>&amp; </em>n. 32 (5th Cir.2009) (commenting that \u201c[t]o require these details at pleading is one small step shy of requiring production of actual documentation with the complaint\u201d (citing <em>United States ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Ctrs. of Am., Inc., </em>238 F.Supp.2d 258, 269 (D.D.C.2002)).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>As applied to this case, Relator broadly alleges that Eisai engaged in \u201cendemic,\u201d \u201cnationwide,\u201d and \u201csystemati[c]\u201d fraud by causing physicians and hospitals to submit false claims for reimbursement under Medicare Part D. and Medicaid. (Compil\u00e9 53-55, 255.) He also approximates the dollar amounts that hospitals purportedly received in false claims during a time period covering three years, without any basis for his guess or reference to any actual financial data of those hospitals. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 177-84, 256). But Relator never discusses or proffers a single false claim that was made to the Government in the detail required by <em>Clausen, </em>nor has he submitted a copy of such a bill or payment. Instead, he proffers only conclusory assertions based on his own speculation that claims were submitted. For these reasons, Relator\u2019s claims based on a promotional scheme are fatally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">B. Kickback Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Relator\u2019s kickback allegations present an independent ground for an FCA violation, but also fail to meet the applicable heightened pleading standards. The Complaint alleges that as part of the promotion of its drugs, Eisai paid doctors to speak and write articles regarding off-label uses; paid doctors to conduct off-label studies; paid hospitals, through grants and other mechanisms, to use Eisai\u2019s drugs; and paid providers guaranteed revenue through Eisai\u2019s Oncology Reimbursement Program. Those payments, the Complaint contends, constitute illegal kickbacks. Relator\u2019s claim implicates the FCA because he asserts that physicians receiving those payments certified compliance \"with the anti-kickback laws on reimbursement forms. (Compl.lffl 224-226, 230-37.) For instance, Medicare requires providers to sign a provider agreement acknowledging that reimbursement is \u201cconditioned upon the claim and the underlying transaction complying with [Medicare] laws, regulations, and program instructions (including, but not limited to, the Federal anti-kickback statute and Stark law),\u201d as well as other certifications. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 224-226.) With respect to Medicaid, which is a state-run program funded by the federal government, the Complaint asserts that Eisai ultimately caused states to submit claims to the federal government for reimbursement that falsely certified that the claims were in compliance with federal law. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 264.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Courts have recognized that under an express certification theory, \u201c[fjalsely certifying compliance with the ... Anti-Kick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>back Aet[ ] in connection with a claim submitted to a federally funded insurance program is actionable under the FCA.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Wilkins v. United Health Gp., Inc., </em>659 F.3d 295, 312 (3d Cir.2011) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>see also Parke-Davis, </em>147 F.Supp.2d at 54 (stating that \u201ca violation of the federal an-tikickback provision is not a <em>per se </em>violation of the FCA\u201d and that \u201c[i]n order for the antikickback violation to be transformed into an actionable FCA claim, the government must have conditioned payment of a claim upon the claimant\u2019s certification of compliance with the antikickback provision\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Alternatively, an implied certification theory, which is also alleged, recognizes that the FCA is violated where compliance with a law, rule, or regulation is a prerequisite to payment but a claim is made when a participant has engaged in a knowing violation. Wilkins, 659 F.3d. at 313. So, for example, in <em>McNutt v. Haleyville Medical Supplies, Inc., </em>423 F.3d 1256 (11th Cir.2005), the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the denial of a motion to dismiss finding that allegations of kickbacks can create FCA liability where compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute is a prerequisite for payment. <em>Id. </em>at 1259-60. In particular, the alleged kickbacks in McNutt\u2014which the Government identified with \u201cdetailed facts\u201d as well as \u201cspecific claims\u201d that were submitted for reimbursement\u2014disqualified the defendants\u2019 medical services from reimbursement under the Medicare program, but the defendants nevertheless submitted claims for reimbursement. <em>Id. </em>at 1257-1259. The court concluded that \u201c[w]hen a violator of government regulations is ineligible to participate in a government program and that violator persists in presenting claims for payment that the violator knows the government does not owe, that violator is liable, under the [FCA], for its submission of those false claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">It is important to note, however, that as with any basis for FCA liability, such claims are subject to Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading requirements. <em>Cf. Wilkins, </em>659 F.3d. at 313 n. 20 (finding that relator stated a claim but declining to address whether it was pleaded with particularity). Thus, the Court in <em>Parke-Davis </em>held that even if kickbacks are illegal, dismissal was proper since the relator \u201cfailed to allege that physicians either expressly certified or, through their participation in a federally funded program, impliedly certified their compliance with the federal antikickback statute as a prerequisite to participating in the federal program.\u201d 147 F.Supp.2d at 55. In particular, the complaint did not assert that the defendant \u201ccaused or induced a doctor and/or pharmacist to file a false or fraudulent certification regarding compliance with the anti-kickback statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">Herein lies the problem with Relator\u2019s claims. Even assuming that the payments alleged constitute illegal kickbacks,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the allegations that participants actually received payments and falsely certified eom-pliance-like the complaint in <em>Parke-Davis </em>and in contrast to McNutt\u2014are not sufficiently pleaded. As noted above, there are scarcely any allegations that any doctor or facility that received such payments filed a claim for reimbursement\u2014and none that are pleaded with any degree of particularity. With respect to those few who did submit. claims for reimbursement, there are no submission allegations that can satisfy <em>Clausen. </em>Thus, Relator fails to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>nect the scheme to particular instances of fraud or misrepresentation. His allegations are insufficient to support claims under Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">C. Best Price Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Finally, the Court is compelled to reach the same conclusion with respect to Relator\u2019s FCA claims based on allegations of false best price submissions. As with other claims, the linchpin of these allegations is not that Eisai violated any law requiring it to provide the Government with the best price of its drugs or provided less in program rebates than what was owed, but that it falsified information provided to the Government and profited from it (although Relator confuses the two in the Complaint and in argument). Section 3729(a)(1)(B) imposes liability on \u201cany person who ... knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Before the May 2009 amendment, the statute exposed a person to damages if he or she \u201cknowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(2) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In this regard, the Complaint alleges that Eisai provided participants with discounts that presumably did not factor into best price reports?<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It also alleges that Eisai affirmatively and knowingly falsified information provided to the Government by altering its reported prices. Because of this, Eisai presumably was able to charge the Government more than it otherwise would have. Again, as with Relator\u2019s other allegations, these claims are subject to Rule 9(b). <em>See United States ex. rel. Foster v. Bristol-Myers Squibb </em>Co., 587 F.Supp.2d 805, 825 (E.D.Tex.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">Very briefly, the Complaint fails to allege with specificity what data was submitted by Eisai to the Government that was false or fraudulent. The time periods alleged are broad and often run from when Eisai acquired the rights to produce the drugs at issue until Relator ended his employment. Nevertheless, there is not one description of a single discount that was offered to a single provider. There is no discussion of any particular pricing report and any assertions that discounts were not reported are conclusory and unsupported by specific facts. None of the allegations set forth precisely what statements were made, when such statements were made, where such statements were made, and who made them. <em>See Ziemba, </em>256 F.3d at 1202 (citations omitted). Relator\u2019s best price violations thus fail to meet the 9(b) standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">D. Relaxation of the 9(b) Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Despite the infirmities of his complaint, Relator devotes the majority of his brief to arguing against a heightened pleading standard. In particular, to the extent that his Complaint is deficient, he asks the Court to apply a relaxed standard that would allow him to proceed to discovery based upon his information and belief. He contends that as an insider, he is able to proffer sufficient indicia of reliability that can excuse a lack of particularity; that because he has alleged a far-reaching scheme, general discussions of unlawful conduct are sufficient to establish his claim; and that the information needed to properly plead his claim is exclusively in the hands of the Defendant, depriving him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>of the ability to plead with particularity. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that relaxation is not warranted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">First, it is true that some courts have recognized that information based on firsthand knowledge can lend credibility to the relator\u2019s claims and propel it over pleading hurdles. For instance, in <em>Hill v. Morehouse Medical Associates, Inc., </em>No. 02-14429, 2003 WL 22019936 (11th Cir. Aug.15, 2003)a case upon which Relator heavily relies <em>(see </em>Opp\u2019n at 10-11)\u2014the Eleventh Circuit allowed an FCA claim against a medical services provider to proceed where the relator was a billing coder in the department where the fraud occurred and possessed first-hand knowledge of the fraudulent conduct (i.e., altering diagnosis codes to qualify for payment) based on her experience there. Among other things, she was able to name some of the participants in the scheme, describe the defendant\u2019s practices in detail, recount the frequency of submission of each type of claim, and identify the documents in the defendant\u2019s possession that would prove the fraud. <em>Hill, </em>2003 WL 22019936, at *4-5. However, she could not recite the names of patients or the dates that the claims were submitted, at least in part because copying private records would violate laws regarding patient confidentiality. <em>Id. </em>at *2, 4-5 &amp; n. 8. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that these were appropriate circumstances in which 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading requirements could be relaxed. Therefore, the district court\u2019s dismissal was reversed notwithstanding the fact that Hill could not point to a specific false claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">However, it is important to understand that the Court in <em>Atkins </em>later emphasized that <em>Hill </em>was not binding precedent and stated that <em>\u201cClausen </em>supercedes <em>Hill </em>to the extent that <em>Hill </em>is inconsistent with <em>Clausen.\u201d United States ex rel. Atkins v. McInteer, </em>470 F.3d 1350, 1358 n. 15 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, while the relator in <em>Atkins </em>\u201ccite[d] particular patients, dates and corresponding medical records for services that he contend[ed] were not eligible for government reimbursement,\u201d he was in the same position as the relator in <em>Clausen </em>insofar as he \u201cfail[ed] to provide the next link in the FCA liability chain: showing that the defendants <em>actually submitted </em>reimbursement claims for the services he describe[dj.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1359. As this Court has concluded previously, Relator has failed to proffer \u201cfacts as to time, place, and substance of the defendant\u2019s alleged fraud, specifically, the details of the defendants\u2019 allegedly fraudulent acts, when they occurred, and who engaged in them.\u201d <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1310 (citations and internal quotation omitted).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, Relator\u2019s claims must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Moreover, apart from the controlling decisions of <em>Clausen </em>and its progeny, the Court is not persuaded that Relator\u2019s complaint bears sufficient indicia of reliability that would warrant relaxation. Unlike the relator in <em>Hill, </em>Relator summarily states that he has \u201cboth personal and inside knowledge of Eisai\u2019s corporate endorsement of its national off-label marketing scheme of Ontak and Dacogen and other illegal conduct regarding the Subject Drugs.\u201d (Comply 14.) But the basis for his knowledge underpinning his claims is often absent. For example, there is no indication of how he knows that doctors were paid to endorse off-label uses or the amount of money paid to them. Similarly, his belief that false claims were actually submitted apparently rests on his knowledge that doctors were sold drugs (as demonstrated through the GOERS report) and that unknown people at Eisai told him that those providers participate in Government programs. He concludes from this, but provides nothing to support, that they naturally must have sought reimbursement for some or all of those prescriptions. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 240.) This gap illustrates Relator\u2019s difficulty; he was only a salesman and had no personal knowledge of what providers did after they were incentivized to prescribe Eisai\u2019s drugs, if that is true. The knowledge of that fact, however, is the crux of any FCA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Most concerning, however, is that many of the details that were required to have been pleaded and should have been known to Relator are absent from the Complaint. At the very least, as a salesman, Relator should be familiar with Eisai\u2019s drug sales and marketing program. But he is unable to plead with particularity what was told to him by Eisai employees and what he told doctors when he met with them. He states, for example, that he \u201cwas directed\u201d to make false statements about Ontak\u2019s effectiveness, but he cannot say who instructed him, when, or where. (Comply 93.) And despite the fact that the information was not protected, in contrast to <em>Hill, </em>Relator has no documentation to illustrate the false nature of the claims. As Defendant observes, \u201c[i]f Keel-er were a genuine whistleblower with information about actual fraud, it would not have been difficult for him as a disgruntled former employee to satisfy these requirements.\u201d (Reply at 7.) Consequently, in light of the paucity of details, the Court has no basis to find that Relator\u2019s claims are more likely to be rehable rather than purely speculative or as the court in <em>Clau-sen </em>warned, spurious. 290 F.3d at 1313 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">With that in mind, the remaining bases for relaxation are inapplicable. While the broad nature of a scheme may make plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ing each instance impractical, Relator has not proffered representative samples of conduct and the Court must not lose sight of the purpose underlying Rule 9(b). <em>See United States ex rel Sanchez v. Lymphatx, Inc., </em>596 F.3d 1300, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 493, 509-10 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe conclude that the concept of a false or fraudulent scheme should be construed as narrowly as is necessary to protect the policies promoted by Rule 9(b).\u201d). In other words, a relator cannot segue into discovery simply by filing prolix but unsubstantiated claims. Moreover, to rely on the assertion that the information is exclusively in the hands of the defendant requires a relator to set forth a detailed factual basis for that belief, details which are missing here. <em>See Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1314 n. 25 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">IV. REMAINING STATE CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Relator\u2019s remaining claims are brought pursuant to various states\u2019 false claims laws. Those claims are subject to the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) and based on the foregoing, are subject to dismissal. <em>See United States ex rel. Rost v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>507 F.3d 720, 723, 731 (1st Cir.2007) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of entire complaint, including counts brought under state statutes analogous to the FCA, since \u201c[t]he heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) generally applies to state law fraud claims brought in federal court\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Hopper v. Solvay Pharms., Inc., </em>590 F.Supp.2d 1352, 1363 (M.D.Fla.2008), <em>aff'd </em>588 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">In sum, Relator has failed to set forth a claim under even the minimal pleading requirements recognized by long-standing and well-established FCA precedent. While the repeated failure to cure deficiencies requires that this matter be brought to an end, the Court nevertheless emphasizes how limited its review of the alleged conduct has been and how many questions remain outstanding. <em>Clausen </em>and subsequent authority speak to a critical policy consideration of filtering out frivolous or harassing claims that are burdensome to defend against, balanced against the rights of litigants to access courts and to pursue their claims without having to prove them at the outset of litigation. Thus, we do not know if Mr. Keeler\u2019s allegations are actually true\u2014indeed, for purposes of this motion, the Court has presumed them to be so to the extent they are properly supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">It is similarly unknown whether another insider (with more knowledge of Eisai\u2019s activities) or the Government (with the benefit of claim submission records) could have pursued this case. <em>See Atkins, </em>470 F.3d at 1360 n. 17 (\u201cWe note, however, that the government already possesses the claims-false or otherwise-a potential defendant has submitted for payment. The government can, therefore, access those claims on its own and evaluate any FCA liability that it believes should attach <em>before </em>determining whether to bring suit or intervene ... when the government brings an FCA action or intervenes in a <em>qui tam </em>action, we may assume that it does not do so solely to use the discovery process as a fishing expedition for false claims.\u201d). And finally, there still may be other allegations that fall outside the FCA ambit altogether; that is not to say that Eisai may not be immune from action under other statutes by other parties. <em>See Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1311 (\u201cThe False Claims Act does not create liability merely for a health care provider\u2019s disregard of Government regulations or improper internal policies unless, as a result of such acts, the provider know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ingly asks the Government to pay amounts it does not owe.\u201d (citation omitted)). What can be said is that Mr. Keeler has had the chance to litigate his assertions of fraud but has been unable to posit a sufficient link between Eisai, doctors, and Government programs to sustain a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In light of the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-5\">(1) Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (DE 95) is GRANTED. The above-styled case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">(2) Defendant\u2019s Motion to Unseal (DE 197) is DENIED.

WILLIAMS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">Case No. 09-22302-CV-WILLIAMS</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, <em>et al., ex rel. </em>Michael Keeler, Plaintiffs, vs. EISAI, INC., Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">THIS MATTER is before the Court on Relator\u2019s Motion to Amend Order of Dismissal under Rules 60(a) and (b) and Rule 59(e) (DE 236). The motion seeks three things: (1) to clarify the Court\u2019s January 31, 2013 Order of Dismissal to state that the case is not dismissed with prejudice as to other parties in interest that might be able to make out a claim; (2) to revise that Order to state that the dismissal is without prejudice as to Mr. Keeler (since he may be able to join with others or the Government to provide missing information necessary to form a claim); and (3) to allow Relator leave to file a fourth amended complaint based on \u201crich,\u201d newly-discovered of fraud that he obtained in discovery and which \u201cadds an extremely high indicia of reliability to Relator\u2019s allegations.\u201d Essentially, the motion is one for reconsideration and to amend the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">The Court has reviewed the motion and the record and concludes that under any standard, Relator\u2019s requests must be denied. As to the first, Relator has not shown how he has been affected by the Court\u2019s order to the extent it may affect other potential plaintiffs or relators. <em>See </em>Mot. at 5 (stating that the United States \u201cshould not be prejudiced if a relator\u2019s allegations are challenged under Rule 9(b)\u201d). As to the remaining grounds\u2014 which raise similar issues\u2014Relator has not shown that dismissal with prejudice was not warranted. <em>See Corsello v. Lineare, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1008, 1014-15 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that trial court did not err in denying relator\u2019s request to file an amended complaint where there was a repeated failure to cure deficiencies in three prior complaints).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">Finally, as Mr. Keeler acknowledges in his reply, he has neither attached a proposed complaint for the Court to review in accordance with Local Rule 15.1 nor has explained how his allegations would withstand the scrutiny required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). In any event (and aside from the fact that, as Defendant sets forth, this motion is a totally inappropriate vehicle for the relief requested), allowing Mr. Keeler to use documents obtained in discovery to overcome pleading hurdles would circumvent the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Rule 9(b). <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., </em>360 F.3d 220, 229, 231 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201c[A] qui tam relator may not present general allegations in lieu of the details of actual false claims in the hope that such details will emerge through subsequent discovery.\u201d). Indeed, in <em>United States ex. rel. Clausen v. Laboratory Corp. of Am., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir.2002), the Eleventh Circuit warned of a situation where \u201ca plaintiff does not specifically plead the minimum elements of their allegation, [and is able] to learn the complaint\u2019s bare essentials through discovery and may needlessly harm a defendants\u2019 goodwill and reputation by bringing a suit that is, at best, missing some of its core underpinnings, and, at worst, are baseless allegations used to extract settlements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313 n. 24 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Relator\u2019s Motion (DE 236) is DENIED. Although Relator suggests that he may seek to re-file the motion, he is warned that having dismissed this action and denied reconsideration, the proper avenue for challenging the Court\u2019s rulings is an appeal. <em>(See </em>DE 256, at 1 (\u201c[T]he Court will need to see and evaluate Relator\u2019s additional allegations and/or evidence in order to determine if it is proper to vacate or modify its Order.\u201d) Any further filings in this action may result in the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">DONE AND ORDERED in chambers in Miami, Florida, this 1st day of April, 2013.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-13\">. More specifically, the Act imposes liability on anyone who knowingly presents \"or causes to be presented\u201d a false claim for payment to be approved by the government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) (2006). It also prohibits knowingly making, using, or causing to be used \"a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(2). The Fraud Enforcement of Recovery Act (\"FERA\u201d), Pub.L.

Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1318, 1327 n. 3 (11th Cir.2009). Nevertheless, the distinction between the old and new statutory language is immaterial for purposes of the motion and for ease of convenience, the Court refers to the superseded numbering. <em>See United States ex Rel. Nowak </em>v. <em>Medtronic, Inc., </em>806 F.Supp.2d 310, 342 nn. 19-20 (D.Mass.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-20\">.

Because of this, at least one medical institution, the University of Louisville Cancer Center, was ultimately persuaded to purchase On-tak for off-label treatment.

I understand that payment of a claim by Medicare is conditioned upon the claim and the underlying transaction complying with such laws, regulations, and program instructions (including, but not limited to, the Federal antikickback statute and Stark law), and on the [provider\u2019s] compliance with all applicable conditions of participation in Medicare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">225.

Like other allegations, this claim fails to identify who was involved, what precisely was said at what time and in which location, or whether there were any specific instances where a prescriber followed Eisai\u2019s guidance. Moreover, the Court is unsure how the statement furthers the scheme alleged. There is no allegation that using such codes reflected false diagnoses-that is, that the patient did not suffer from diabetes\u2014and there is no explanation of how listing them rendered the claims more likely to be reimbursed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. Additionally, while it does not involve the issues currently before the Court, Keeler brought an action for retaliation under Florida\u2019s Whistleblower\u2019s Protection Act in state court sometime after filing his initial complaint under seal in this case. That action was removed to federal court and re-captioned <em>Keeler v. Eisai Inc., </em>No. 10-cv-60959 (S.D.Fla.). Keeler and Eisai then reached a settlement of their claims that resulted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>dismissal of that action, with prejudice. As part of the settlement, Keeler executed a release of claims against Eisai, but failed to disclose the existence of this <em>qui tam </em>action, which was still under seal. The Court previously ruled that Keeler\u2019s <em>qui tam </em>claims can proceed because they were already pending at the time of the release and could only be dismissed with the consent of the Court and the Attorney General.

Although the United States declined to intervene in this suit, it filed a statement of interest in connection with the instant motion.

Based on the Eleventh Circuit's FCA precedent, the Court rejects Relator\u2019s suggestion that because he is pursuing a false claim and not a fraudulent claim, the pleading requirements applicable to fraud claims are not controlling. <em>(See </em>Opp\u2019n at 9.) Accordingly, Relator is incorrect that he need not provide the \u201cwho, what, where, when\u201d of fraud under that rule. (Opp'n at 9.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">. In particular, Judge Ungaro, who presided over this action until it was transferred to the undersigned on September 8, 2011 (DE 99), held that \u201cPlaintiff fails to identify with particularity a false claim that was presented to the government as a result of Defendant\u2019s conduct.

The parties' prolific briefing does not focus on the central, threshold question for the Court\u2014whether the claims properly plead the circumstances of the fraud. Rather than addressing the actual allegations of the Complaint, Plaintiff concentrates on the standard of review, arguing that this Court need not adhere to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s precedent applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) to <em>gui tarn </em>actions like this one. As noted above, the Court rejects that argument. And for the reasons explained below, the Court declines to relax the pleading requirements under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">For its part, Defendant seeks a ruling that no false claim is implicated as a matter of law because even if Eisai promoted its drugs for off-label uses and they were prescribed for an off-label use, the claims were still reimbursable. Cases recognize that while off-label promotion is an illegal act under federal law, a relator may not have standing to bring suit for it; a defendant is not subject to FCA liability unless it seeks government compensation (or causes someone else to seek compensation) for which it is not entitled. <em>See United States ex rel.

Looking at the reimbursement requirements of the government programs at issue, Defendant asserts that off-label prescriptions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>reimbursable if a physician determines that the use is medically reasonable and necessary. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(l)(A). Because of that statutory language and because the Court is not bound to accept a plaintiffs assertions regarding legal conclusions, Defendant suggests that the Court should find that the off-label allegations could never implicate a false claim. However, other courts, including the Eleventh Circuit, have declined to address this issue where, as here, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently articulate the details of the fraud. <em>See Solvay, </em>588 F.3d at 1326 (assuming <em>\"arguendo </em>that when a physician writes an off-label prescription with knowledge or intent that the cost of filling that prescription will be borne by the federal government, and when a claim is ultimately submitted to the federal government to pay for that prescription, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1) may have been violated,\u201d but dismissing the complaint for failure to link promotion to submission of false claims); <em>see also United States ex rel. Carpenter v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>723 F.Supp.2d 395, 410 (D.Mass.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">While the Court ultimately does not reach the issue of whether Defendant's theory is correct as a matter of law, it notes that it would have difficulty accepting that Relator\u2019s allegations, <em>as pleaded, </em>satisfy the FCA\u2019s falsity requirement. Relator has not developed, in pleading or in argument, how the mere act of promoting the subject drugs resulted in the submission of a claim containing a <em>false </em>representation. <em>See United States ex rel. Hess v. Sanofi-Synthelabo, Inc., </em>No. 4:05CV570MLM, 2006 WL 1064127, at *10 (E.D.Mo. Apr.21, 2006) (requiring a relator basing a claim on a promotion scheme to allege \"conduct which was designed to present <em>false </em>information\"); <em>see also Nowak, </em>806 F.Supp.2d at 345-46. For instance, he does not contend that a prescribing physician falsely represented that the treatment was for an indicated condition when seeking reimbursement from the Government. Similarly, he has not alleged that a claim for reimbursement is the equivalent of a representation that the requested service is covered, that submission of off-label claims runs afoul of any of the certifications that prescribers make, or that the Government would not have reimbursed the claim had it known of the off-label nature of the use or the fact of the promotion. See <em>United States ex rel. Polansky v. Pfizer, </em>No. 04-cv0704, 2009 WL 1456582, at *7-8 (E.D.N.Y. May 22, 2009) (citing authorities explaining the FDA\u2019s position and concluding that \"the entities to which reimbursement claims are made could hardly be understood to have operated on the assumption that the physician writing the prescription was certifying implicitly that he was prescribing [the subject drug] in a manner consistent with the Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">. Although the Fifth Circuit in <em>Grubbs </em>criticized the stringent requirements of <em>Clausen, </em>subsequent cases decided by the Eleventh Circuit emphatically reaffirms the holding as binding precedent. Indeed, in Solvay\u2014a promotion case-the relators were able to provide \"a highly-compelling statistical analysis [that] renders inescapable the conclusion that a huge number of claims for ineffective off-label uses of [the subject drug] resulted from [the defendant\u2019s illegal marketing] campaign.\u201d 588 F.3d at 1326. However, even that evidence was deficient in that it did \"not allege the existence of a single actual false claim.\u201d Id. (\"In fact, we are unable to discern from the complaint a specific person or entity that is alleged to have presented a claim of any kind, let alone a false or fraudulent claim.\"). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>To tie the promotion to false claims, relators must \"identify specific persons or entities that participated in any step of this process\u201d as well as \"dates, times, or amounts of individual false claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And in <em>Atkins, </em>the relator could point to dates of services, name the patients that received the services, and identify the records that would prove his claim, but could not show that any claims were actually submitted to the Government. 470 F.3d at 1354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">.

A line of decisions from the Eleventh Cir<em>cuit-Clausen, Corsello, Atkins, </em>and Solvay\u2014 make clear that this court has an important gatekeeping function where FCA claims are involved. Significantly, in <em>Clausen, </em>the Eleventh Circuit held that \u201c[w]e cannot make assumptions about a False Claim Act defendant's submission of actual claims to the Government without stripping all meaning from 9(b)\u2019s requirement of specificity or ignoring that the \u2018true essence of the fraud\u2019 of a False Claims Act action involves an actual claim for payment and not just a preparatory scheme.\u201d 290 F.3d at 1312-13 &amp; n. 21. It reasoned that Rule 9(b) serves not only to give defendants notice of the fraud charges, but also protects them from frivolous suits. The danger in FCA cases in particular-which gives the relator a share of any recovery obtained on behalf of the government-is that lowering the pleading requirements would allow plaintiffs without knowledge of the fraud to bring baseless actions, \u201clearn the complaint\u2019s bare essentials through discovery,\u201d and extract settlements, all while damaging the defendant\u2019s goodwill and reputation. <em>Id. </em>at 1313-14 &amp; nn. 24-25 (citations omitted). In this case, Relator has made numerous attempts to bypass the pleading requirements, even making an unusual request to defer rul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ing on Eisai's motion to dismiss until after discovery and summary judgment because of supposed discovery violations. Yet, \"[i]f Rule 9(b) is to carry any water, it must mean that an essential allegation and circumstance of fraudulent conduct cannot be alleged in such conclusory fashion.\" <em>Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1312-13 &amp; n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Indeed, the <em>Clausen </em>court was keenly aware of the hardship the decision might work upon relators given the circumstances in which such actions are brought. See <em>id. </em>at 1314. It noted that the relator-a corporate outsider-might have needed to \"work hard to learn the details of the alleged schemes\u201d if that was even possible, but that \"neither the Federal Rules nor the Act offer any special leniency under these particular circumstances to justify Clausen failing to allege with the required specificity the circumstances of the fraudulent conduct he asserts in his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Eleventh Circuit spoke more to Rule 9(b)\u2019s \"policy underpinnings\u201d again in <em>Atkins </em>(a case where the government declined to intervene). 470 F.3d at 1360. It reiterated that 9(b) prevents spurious lawsuits and counseled that courts must be principled in not giving a plaintiff a \"ticket\u201d to discovery absent a suitable basis. <em>Id. </em>at 1359-60 (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
