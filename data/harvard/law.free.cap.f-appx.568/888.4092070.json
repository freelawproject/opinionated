Hinds\u2019s petition should be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">On December 17, 2013, the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) issued a final order denying Hinds\u2019s petition for review. That same day, the Board served Mr. Hinds and his counsel with a copy of its decision via electronic mail. The court received Hinds\u2019s petition for review on March 4, 2014, 77 days after the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">Our review of a Board decision or order is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). That statute provides, in relevant part, that \u201cany petition for review shall be filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board.\u201d In order to be timely, a petition for review must be received by the court within the filing deadline. <em>Pinat v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed. Cir.1991) (petition is filed when received by this court); Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(A) (\u201cfiling is not timely unless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing\u201d). We have explained that this filing period is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">Because Hinds\u2019s appeal was filed outside of. the statutory deadline for taking an appeal to this court, we must dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">It is Ordered That:</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">(1) The appeal is dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">(2) All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
