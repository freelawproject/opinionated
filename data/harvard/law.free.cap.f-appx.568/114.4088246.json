For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-19\">Because we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with this case\u2019s extensive procedural history, we discuss that history only to the extent needed to resolve this appeal. In 2007, Gooden commenced this action by filing a pro se complaint against five corrections officials from the Atlantic County Jail (\u201cACJ\u201d) in New Jersey. Gooden alleged that, on two occasions in 2006, he was attacked by some of the defendants while housed in the ACJ as a pretrial detainee. The defendants ultimately moved the District Court for summary judgment. In 2011, the District Court granted that motion with respect to two of the defendants\u2014ACJ\u2019s warden and Sergeant Steven Iuliucci\u2014but denied the motion with respect to Officers Conrad, Keating, and Platt (\u201cAppellees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">In September 2013, Gooden\u2019s claims against Appellees were tried before a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the end of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Appellees. As a result, the District Court entered a judgment of no cause for action. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-22\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(1) requires an appellant to order, within 14 days of filing the notice of appeal, a transcript of the parts of the District Court proceedings \u201cnot already on file as the appellant considers necessary.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 10(b)(1). Our local rules also require an appellant to order such a transcript, and they provide that an appellant who cannot afford the cost of the transcript may move to have the transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>prepared at government expense pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 11.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In this case, we have no trial transcript before us. Gooden neither paid the court reporter to produce that transcript nor moved for relief under \u00a7 753(f). In fact, even after Appellees highlighted his failure to do so in their merits brief, Gooden did not file a reply or take any other action. With this in mind, we turn to his claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As best we can tell, Gooden\u2019s informal merits brief raises as many as five claims. First, he contends that the District Court erred by failing to admit certain medical records and \u201cpictures\u201d at trial. Second, he claims that his \u201cpre-trial memorandum\u201d was \u201cstolen [a]t court\u201d by \u201cSheriff or Federal Agents.\u201d Third, he alleges that the District Court conspired with Appellees\u2019 counsel. Fourth, he appears to raise some challenge to an aspect of the District Court\u2019s charge to the jury. Finally, he claims that a witness statement was improperly withheld from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Gooden\u2019s second and third claims are nothing more than bald assertions and give us no reason to disturb the District Court\u2019s judgment. As for the remaining three claims, they, too, are undeveloped. But more importantly, those three claims concern issues that cannot be resolved without reviewing the trial transcript. Because Gooden has failed to order that transcript, we are unable to review those three claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">In light of the above, we 'will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-16\">. In April 2013, the United States Magistrate Judge who was assigned to the case appointed pro bono counsel to represent Gooden. Two months later, Gooden asked that counsel be removed. The Magistrate Judge, after holding a hearing, granted that request. Goo-den proceeded pro se going forward, representing himself at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-24\">. We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. Shortly after Gooden filed his notice of appeal, he filed several letters in the District Court. One of those letters, which was addressed to the Magistrate Judge, stated, inter alia, that Gooden \"will [a]sk for Supreme Appeallate [sic] court to subpoena for ... [t]apes of trial.\u201d Even if we were to liberally construe this letter as a request for us to grant Gooden relief under \u00a7 753(f), we would deny that request because he has failed to show that any of his three transcript-dependent claims presents a substantial question. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-24\">. Although we may dismiss an appeal based on an appellant\u2019s failure to order a transcript, <em>see </em>Fed R.App. P. 3(a)(2), we decline Appellees\u2019 invitation to take that action here. <em>See Horner Equip. Int'l, Inc. v. Seascape Pool Ctr., Inc., </em>884 F.2d 89, 93 (3d Cir.1989) (explaining that \u201d[d]ismissal of an appeal for failure to comply with procedural rules is not favored\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
