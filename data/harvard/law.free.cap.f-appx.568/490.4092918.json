Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Avagyan v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Holder, </em>646 F.3d 672, 674 (9th Cir.2011). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gavrilova\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely and number-barred where the successive motion was filed more than 13 years after her removal order became final, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Gavri-lova failed to establish that any exception to the filing deadline applied, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3), or to demonstrate the due diligence required for equitable tolling of the deadline, <em>see Avagyan, </em>646 F.3d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Gavrilova\u2019s contentions that the BIA failed to consider the facts of her case and provide a reasoned explanation for its denial are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Gavrilova\u2019s contention regarding equitable estoppel because she failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA. <em>See Tijani v. Holder, </em>628 F.3d 1071, 1080 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision not to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte. <em>See Mejia-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">In light of this disposition, we do not reach Gavrilova\u2019s remaining contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
