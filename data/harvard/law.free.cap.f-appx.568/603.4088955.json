MATHESON, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">Leah Benjamin was convicted of second degree murder in Wyoming state court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>killing her abusive husband, Donald Benjamin. She seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying her petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (requiring a COA to appeal the denial of a habeas petition). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Mr. and Ms. Benjamin married in 1999. They separated in 2005 and later attempted to reconcile, but Mr. Benjamin filed for divorce in February 2009. On May 3, 2009, Ms. Benjamin shot and killed Mr. Benjamin at her home in Buffalo, Wyoming. She had called and texted him throughout the day to tell him their daughter was waiting to spend time with him, even though the daughter was not at home. When Mr. Benjamin called to say he was on his way, Ms. Benjamin told him not to come because their daughter did not want to see him. Mr. Benjamin came anyway. After they argued for about an hour, Ms. Benjamin shot her husband. Her 18-year-old son found her with Mr. Benjamin\u2019s body. She convinced him to leave town with his sister. Ms. Benjamin cleaned up the scene, attended a movie, and eventually turned herself in to the police early the next morning\u201416 hours after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">B. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">1. State Court Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Wyoming charged Ms. Benjamin with first-degree murder. During jury selection, a potential juror, Karen Blaney, acknowledged she was married to Dr. Timothy Blaney, a prosecution expert witness, and she had taught Mr. Benjamin\u2019s daughter in school. When asked whether she could be impartial if her husband testified, she said she often disagrees with her husband and is an independent thinker. Neither the Government nor Ms. Benjamin objected to Ms. Blaney\u2019s serving on the jury. At the end of jury selection, the trial court asked counsel about Ms. Blaney\u2019s relationship to Dr. Blaney. Ms. Benjamin\u2019s counsel confirmed his decision to not object, explaining he \u201ckind of like[d] her.\u201d Appx. at 195.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Blaney was empaneled on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">At trial, Ms. Benjamin testified she shot her husband in self-defense. She stated he slammed her into a shower door, shattering the glass. She ran out of the bathroom and grabbed a gun. She remembered shooting him once when he lunged for the gun. The defense\u2019s expert witness testified Ms. Benjamin suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly battered woman syndrome (\u201cBWS\u201d). Dr. Blaney did not testify. Several witnesses testified about Mr. and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s abusive relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Forensic evidence disputed Ms. Benjamin\u2019s account of the events. A bullet had shattered the shower door, Mr. Benjamin had no gun powder on his hands consistent with reaching for the gun, and he sustained three gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">During a jury instruction conference near the end of trial, Ms. Benjamin\u2019s counsel asked the court to remove Ms. Blaney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>from the jury for bias. Although Dr. Bla-ney had not testified, he had communicated with the prosecution in open court during trial and had appeared to be helping them. According to Ms. Benjamin\u2019s counsel, during the Government\u2019s cross-examination of the defense\u2019s BWS expert, Dr. Blaney \u201crushed up to the prosecutor\u2019s table\u201d in a way that \u201cwould have given the jury the impression that he had a passionate view opposite of what was being said....\u201d Appx. at 194. Ms. Benjamin argued Ms. Blaney\u2019s spousal relationship with Dr. Blaney made her biased. The trial court determined Ms. Benjamin had waived this objection when she did not object to Ms. Blaney during jury selection and her counsel had said he \u201ckind of like[d] her.\u201d Appx. at 194-95. The district court did not hold a hearing, and Ms. Blaney remained on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">After the eight-day trial, the jury acquitted Ms. Benjamin of first-degree murder but found her guilty of second-degree murder (a lesser-included offense) for killing her husband. The court sentenced her to 20-30 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. State Court Direct Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"A1H\">In her appeal to the Wyoming Supreme Court, Ms. Benjamin argued the trial court erred in (1) refusing to dismiss Ms. Bla-ney; (2) rejecting Ms. Benjamin\u2019s proposed jury instructions; and (3) denying Ms. Benjamin\u2019s post-trial motion for acquittal. She also argued (4) the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed her conviction. <em>See Benjamin v. State, </em>264 P.3d 1 (Wyo.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">3. State Court Post-Conviction Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Ms. Benjamin petitioned for post-conviction relief in the state district court. She argued (1) prosecutorial misconduct, (2) ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in failing to bring an ineffective of trial counsel claim on direct appeal. The state district court denied relief, and the Wyoming Supreme Court summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">4. Federal Habeas Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Ms. Benjamin then filed a federal habe-as petition with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. She argued the Wyoming decisions were contrary to or unreasonable applications of clearly established U.S. Supreme Court law on the following issues: (1) the trial court\u2019s failure to remove Juror Blaney; (2) prosecutorial misconduct; and (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise on direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective for (a) not objecting to Juror Blaney and (b) deficiently presenting Ms. Benjamin\u2019s BWS defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied habeas relief and a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">We present additional procedural history in our discussion of the two issues for which Ms. Benjamin seeks COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Ms. Benjamin seeks a COA and relief on the merits on the following Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ment issues: (A) the trial court erred in refusing to remove Juror Blaney and in declining to hold a hearing regarding her bias; and (B) trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in (1) not striking Juror Blaney and (2) inadequately presenting Ms. Benjamin\u2019s BWS defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When a state court has decided the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits, we \u201clook to the District Court\u2019s application of [the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d) ] to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 366, 123 S.Ct. 1029. AEDPA provides that federal courts cannot grant habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201c[S]tate-court findings of fact are to be accorded the presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>See Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 428, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985). This presumption may be rebutted only \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A. <em>Juror Blaney</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Ms. Benjamin argues the trial court\u2019s refusal to remove Juror Blaney was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">1. Additional Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">After completion of the prosecution\u2019s and defendant\u2019s cases, Ms. Benjamin moved to remove Ms. Blaney from the jury. The trial court refused because Ms. Benjamin had waived her right to object during jury selection. The trial court reminded counsel that it raised the issue at the end of jury selection, and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s counsel stated he \u201ckind of like[d] her.\u201d Appx. at 194. The trial court mentioned it would \u201cprobably have granted\u201d a motion to strike for cause during jury selection if anyone had objected. <em>Id. </em>at 195. The court \u201cwould have been more concerned had [D]r. Blaney actually testified,\u201d but determined there \u201cis not a statutory or defined issue for cause [because Ms. Bla-ney] specifically articulated [Dr. Blaney\u2019s testifying] would not be a problem for her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194-95. Ms. Benjamin\u2019s counsel did not request a hearing to determine whether Ms. Blaney had actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">On direct appeal, the Wyoming Supreme Court affirmed, agreeing that Ms. Benjamin waived her right to object to Ms. Blaney\u2019s service on the jury. As to whether changed circumstances\u2014Dr. Blaney\u2019s not testifying but instead \u201creacting] visibly during the cross examination\u201d of the defense\u2019s expert witness\u2014were enough to overcome Ms. Benjamin\u2019s waiver, the court held the trial court reasonably concluded the circumstances had not materially changed because \u201cDr. Blaney\u2019s actions during trial had less negative impact than if he had testified to his disagreement with the defense expert....\u201d <em>Benjamin, </em>264 P.3d at 10. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Ms. Benjamin\u2019s request to remove Ms. Blaney from the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">In her federal habeas petition, Ms. Benjamin argued Ms. Blaney\u2019s presence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>jury violated her Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. She contended (1) Ms. Blaney was impliedly biased because of her relationship with Dr. Blaney, and (2) the trial court failed sua sponte to grant a hearing on actual bias. The federal district court determined Ms. Benjamin failed to show the Wyoming Supreme Court\u2019s decision on this issue violated clearly established federal law or was based on an unreasonable determination of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We deny COA because reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">First, Ms. Benjamin cites no clearly established Supreme Court law contrary to the Wyoming Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that she waived any implicit bias objection. Nor does she cite any clearly established Supreme Court law that Ms. Blaney was implicitly biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Second, Ms. Benjamin again cites no clearly established law supporting her position that the trial \u201ccourt had an independent duty to take corrective action to preserve Ms. Benjamin\u2019s rights to due process and a fair trial\u201d by sua sponte holding a hearing on Ms. Blaney\u2019s actual bias. Aplt. Br. at 27-28.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, Ms. Benjamin relies on cases that concerned previously undisclosed juror information regarding potential relationship bias. <em>See Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 215, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982) (holding a hearing was warranted when information came to light that a juror applied for a job with the prosecutor\u2019s office after the defendant had been convicted); <em>Remmer v. United States, </em>847 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954) (holding that information of possible juror bribery coming to light after the jury returned its verdict warranted a hearing). In Ms. Benjamin\u2019s case, however, Ms. Blaney\u2019s spousal relationship with Dr. Blaney was disclosed early in the jury selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Third, Ms. Benjamin argues Ms. Blaney\u2019s answers to questions about actual bias could have changed because Dr. Blaney\u2019s role as a potential prosecution testifying expert changed to his actual service as a non-testifying in-court expert consultant. The trial court determined the circumstances had not changed enough to affect Ms. Blaney\u2019s impartiality. The Wyoming Supreme Court agreed. \u201c[Sjtatecourt findings of fact are to be accorded the presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>Wainwright, </em>469 U.S. at 428, 105 S.Ct. 844; <em>see Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984) (holding that a trial judge\u2019s finding that a particular venire member was not biased and therefore was properly seated was a finding of fact subject to a presumption of correctness). Ms. Benjamin has failed to rebut this factual determination\u2019s \u201cpresumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">Fourth, even if Ms. Benjamin had set forth clearly established Supreme Court law regarding a right to an impartial jury, she has not shown how the Wyoming Supreme Court\u2019s decision was an unreasonable application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>B. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Ms. Benjamin argues her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Juror Blaney and for deficiently presenting a BWS defense. Ms. Benjamin did not raise this issue on direct appeal. <em>See Benjamin, </em>264 P.3d at 4-5. Wyoming law requires defendants to bring ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann \u00a7 7-14\u2014103(a)(i); <em>Harlow v. State, </em>105 P.3d 1049, 1068 (Wyo.2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On post-conviction review, a petitioner can show appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. <em>See </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann \u00a7 7-14-103(b)(ii). Such a claim functions as a \u201cportal\u201d for review of an otherwise-barred claim of ineffective assistance at trial. <em>Schreibvogel v. State, </em>269 P.3d 1098, 1102 (Wyo.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In her state and federal collateral relief proceedings, Ms. Benjamin attempted to use this \u201cportal\u201d exception. She argued in both proceedings that her appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue her trial counsel was ineffective. The state court determined she could not establish ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because she could not establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The federal district court determined the state court\u2019s decision withstood AEDPA deference because trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In her request for COA, Ms. Benjamin argues ineffective assistance of trial counsel but says nothing about ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The district court did not address a freestanding ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, and we do not address issues that were not addressed by the district court. <em>See Ham-mon v. Ward, </em>466 F.3d 919, 926 n. 8 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cPetitioner did not raise this claim in his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, and we therefore will not consider it on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Even if we were to construe her claim as ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Ms. Benjamin fails to argue why her appellate counsel was ineffective. \u201cIt is well-settled that arguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>654 F.3d 1104, 1128 (10th Cir.2011) (quotations omitted); <em>see Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e routinely have declined to consider arguments that are not raised, or are inadequately presented, in an appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d). Ms. Benjamin has not raised or adequately presented her ineffective assistance of appellant counsel claim, and we decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny Ms. Benjamin\u2019s petition for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-16\">. This conversation was off the record and not transcribed, but the trial court recounted it when Ms. Benjamin later asked the trial court to remove Ms. Blaney from the jury. <em>See </em>Appx. at 194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\">. She did not argue ineffective assistance on direct appeal, as Wyoming state law generally requires. <em>See Schreibvogel v. State, </em>269 P.3d 1098, 1102 (Wyo.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. Although Ms. Benjamin presented her claims in her habeas petition as ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, she acknowledged and argued in the petition that these claims are not procedurally barred because <em>appellate counsel </em>was ineffective. Appx. at 77-79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">. Ms. Benjamin did not raise this issue on state post-conviction review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. She also argues the Wyoming Supreme Court did not address this issue. To the extent she contends her claim was not adjudicated on the merits, her argument fails. Although the Wyoming Supreme Court did not explicitly address whether the trial court should have sua sponte held a hearing on actual bias, \u201c[w]hen a state court rejects a federal claim without expressly addressing that claim, a federal habeas court must presume that the federal claim was adjudicated on the merits....\u201d <em>Johnson v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1088, 1096, 185 L.Ed.2d 105 (2013), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1858, 185 L.Ed.2d 858 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b633-8\">. The Wyoming Supreme Court has recognized an exception to this requirement when counsel at trial and on direct appeal are the same. <em>See Keats v. State, </em>115 P.3d 1110, 1117 (Wyo.2005) (\u201c[I]f the same attorney is used both at trial and on appeal then there is not a 'waiver' of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because there has not truly been an opportunity to previously present those claims.\u201d). This exception does not apply here because trial counsel did not represent Ms. Benjamin on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
