We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>Ferdik v. Bonzelet, </em>963 F.2d 1258, 1260 (9th Cir.1992). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The district court dismissed Johnson\u2019s action with prejudice after Johnson failed to comply with a court order directing him to include in his amended complaint a description of his previous lawsuits, including the parties, court, case number, and result. Johnson, however, provided in a supplement to his amended complaint and in his \u2022 motion to reconsider sufficient case information for the court to review his previous lawsuits. Moreover, less drastic alternative sanctions would be appropriate in this case. Thus, fewer than three out of five factors weighed in favor of dismissal. <em>See Pagtalunan v. Galaza, </em>291 F.3d 639, 642-43 (9th Cir.2002) (discussing factors for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) and affirming dismissal where three out of five factors supported it); <em>Oliva v. Sullivan, </em>958 F.2d 272, 273 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cBecause dismissal is a harsh penalty, it should be imposed as a sanction only in extreme circumstances.\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
