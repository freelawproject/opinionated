Smith also brought various territorial claims, including a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d). The District Court dismissed all of her claims and later awarded the defendants .$6,257.02 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $4,000 in costs. Smith, who is <em>pro se, </em>appealed from the District Court\u2019s award of fees and costs. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">Following the District Court\u2019s dismissal of all of Smith\u2019s claims and our affirmance of the District Court\u2019s decision, the defendants filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541(a)(6) &amp; (b) and federal law. The Magistrate Judge issued a report and recommendation ruling that the defendants\u2019 motion be granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, the Magistrate Judge recommended that attorneys\u2019 fees be denied with respect to Smith\u2019s federal claims on the grounds that the claims were not unreasonable or frivolous. The Magistrate Judge also recommended that attorneys\u2019 fees be denied with respect to all of Smith\u2019s territorial claims except for her IIED claim, which was the only territorial law claim for which she did not establish a prima facie case. After considering Smith\u2019s difficult financial situation, along with other factors, the Magistrate Judge recommended an award of $10,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and an award of $4,000 in costs, which was less than half of the roughly $8,900 in costs sought by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-17\">Smith filed several objections to this report, which the District Court overruled in part and sustained in part. The District Court agreed with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation that it had discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the defense of Smith\u2019s IIED claim. Therefore, the District Court overruled Smith\u2019s objection to this recommendation. However, the Court held that Smith\u2019s objection to the calculation of the fee award had merit. Smith had objected to the calculation of the fee award on the grounds that the award corresponded to work done by Ogle-tree Deakins, which was not performed until after Smith\u2019s IIED claim was dismissed. The District Court sustained this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>objection and re-calculated the fee award to reflect the hours of work performed by the defendants\u2019 predecessor counsel on the IIED claim. Ultimately, the District Court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in the reduced amount of $6,257.02 and costs in the full recommended amount of $4000. Smith subsequently appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with defending Smith\u2019s IIED claim. Because the defendants succeeded in obtaining the dismissal of Smith\u2019s IIED claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), they were entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541 as the prevailing parties. <em>See </em>5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541(b) (\u201c[Tjhere shall be allowed to the prevailing party in the judgment such sums as the court in its discretion may fix by way of indemnity for his attorney\u2019s fees in maintaining the action or defenses thereto .... \u201d); <em>see also Figueroa v. Buccaneer Hotel Inc., </em>188 F.3d 172, 183 (3d Cir.1999) (holding that \u00a7 541 is \u201capplicable to fees for the litigant who succeeds in pursuing Virgin Islands territorial claims\u201d). Likewise, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the defendants costs based on their status as prevailing parties on all of Smith\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1) (\u201cUnless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs\u2014other than attorney\u2019s fees\u2014should be allowed to the prevailing party.\u201d); 5 V.I.C. \u00a7 541(a) (providing that certain costs may be recovered by the prevailing party in a civil action).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On appeal, Smith asserts that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to consider her financial situation and ability to pay when awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against her. However, the Magistrate Judge explicitly considered Smith\u2019s financial status and lowered the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs on that basis, and the District Court affirmed this particular aspect of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling. <em>Smith v. V.I. Port Auth., </em>2013 WL 152178, at *4 (D.Vi. Jan.ll, 2013) (\u201cThe Magistrate Judge recognized a litigant\u2019s ability to pay is a relevant factor in making an award of fees or costs and took Smith\u2019s financial circumstances into account in fashioning an award in this case, reducing the recommended attorneys\u2019 fees from $11,291.48 to $10,000.00 and costs from $8,960.10 to $4,000.00____ Because the Magistrate Judge adequately considered and accounted for Smith\u2019s financial situation in her recommended award, this objection is - overruled.\u201d). Additionally, the amount of reduction applied by the District Court to account for Smith\u2019s financial situation was appropriate and within the Court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Smith also argues that the District Court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the defendants is tantamount to a sanction, that this fee award will deter others with civil rights claims from seeking redress, and that the defendants acted in bad faith and thus are not entitled to any award. We reject these arguments for substantially the same reasons set forth by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s award of $6,257.02 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $4,000 in costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b195-8\">. We have jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review an award of attorneys' fees and costs for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>396 F.3d 294, 299 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
