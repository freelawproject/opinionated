A dismissal under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Adkins v. Rumsfeld, </em>464 F.3d 456, 463 (4th Cir.2006), and thus should be without prejudice. <em>S. Walk at Broadlands Homeowner\u2019s Assoc., Inc. v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, </em>713 F.3d 175, 185 (4th Cir.2013). We therefore modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect that the dismissal of these counts is without prejudice, and we affirm the dismissal as modified. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (2012); <em>MM ex rel. DM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville Cnty., </em>303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]e are entitled to affirm the court\u2019s judgment on alternate grounds, if such grounds are apparent from the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">With respect to the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carmichael\u2019s remaining counts for relief, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, as to those counts, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Carmichael v. Sebelius, </em>No. 3:13-cv-00129-JAG, 2013 WL 5755618 (E.D.Va. Oct. 23, 2013). We deny Carmichael\u2019s motion to schedule oral argument and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"><em> D.C.
