Before this court, Harrison asserts several bases for his contention that this sentence is plainly unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we reject his arguments and affirm the revocation judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-25\">\u201cA district court has broad discretion when imposing a sentence upon revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>738 F.3d 638, 640 (4th Cir.2013). A revocation sentence that is both within the applicable statutory maximum and not \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d will be affirmed on appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437-38 (4th Cir.2006). In determining whether a revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable, we first assess the sentence for reasonableness, utilizing \u201cthe procedural and substantive considerations\u201d employed in evaluating an original criminal sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">A revocation sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court has considered both the policy statements contained in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2012). <em>Id. </em>at 439. The district court must also explain the chosen sentence, although this explanation \u201cneed not be as detailed or specific\u201d as is required for an original sentence. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 547 (4th Cir.2010). A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court states a proper basis for concluding that the defendant should receive the sentence imposed. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">If, after considering the above, we decide that the sentence is reasonable, we will affirm. <em>Id. </em>at 439. Only if we find the sentence to be procedurally or substantively unreasonable will we evaluate whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Against these well-established principles, we readily conclude that Harrison\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The sentence is within the two-year statutory maximum authorized for the underlying Class C felony offense that resulted in the supervised release order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3), 3583(e)(3) (2012); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(() (2012). Our review of the record confirms that the district court considered the advisory policy statement range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment, the calculation of which was not disputed in the district court and is not challenged on appeal, and heard the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the appropriate sentence to be imposed. Furthermore, the district court drew upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors enumerated in \u00a7 3583(e) in sentencing Harrison. The transcript makes clear that, despite the court\u2019s prior lenient treatment and strong admonitions, Harrison simply could not (or would not) abide by the terms of his supervised release. The court\u2019s decision to impose the statutory maximum in this case was driven by Harrison\u2019s repeated drug use, his ongoing failure to present himself for drug testing at the preassigned time and place, and his non-compliance with his drug treatment plan. We thus cannot accept Harrison\u2019s claim that his sentence is \u201cunduly punitive.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8); <em>see Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440 (holding that imposition of statutory maximum term of imprisonment was substantively reasonable, given that the district court expressly relied on defendant\u2019s \u201cadmitted pattern of violating numerous conditions of his supervised release,\u201d despite numerous extensions of leniency by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Harrison also argues that the revocation sentence is unreasonable because it \u201cdoes nothing to address the source of Harrison\u2019s problems on supervised release\u2014his drug use.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8). But this argument fails to acknowledge the court\u2019s continuous efforts to aid Harrison in overcoming his substance abuse issues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>all of which he spurned. As the district court noted, the probation office did everything within its power to help Harrison conquer his addiction, but it was incumbent upon Harrison to avail himself of the treatment options secured for and provided to him, which he would not do. By the time he last appeared in court, there simply was nothing left for the court to do in this vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Finally, Harrison suggests that the purpose of supervised release\u2014\u201cto ease a defendant\u2019s transition back into the community\u201d\u2014would have been better served by \u201c[a] much shorter sentence!)]\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 9). We reject this argument as it improperly conflates the purposes that underlie the imposition of a term of supervised release in the first instance with the purpose for penalizing the defendant\u2019s violation of those terms. The revocation sentence is designed to punish the defendant\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of his supervised release, <em>see Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438 (\u201c \u2018[T]he sentence imposed upon revocation [is] intended to sanction the violator for failing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>ch. 7, pt. A, introductory cmt. 3(b))), and the district court\u2019s comments make plain that it chose the twenty-four-month sentence to sanction Harrison\u2019s substantial breach of the trust and leniency that the court previously afforded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the revocation judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> Harrison concedes that this is the controlling standard of review in this circuit, but seeks to preserve the issue for further review by noting the existence of a circuit split as to the appropriate standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
