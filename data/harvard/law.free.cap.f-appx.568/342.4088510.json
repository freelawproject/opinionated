In Cooper\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, the jury found Juan Trevino liable in his individual capacity and awarded Cooper $30 in compensatory damages and $3,500 in punitive damages. The district court denied Cooper\u2019s motion to compel payment of the jury award because Trevino had not been served with Cooper\u2019s motion and the Attorney General\u2019s Office had not determined whether to indemnify Trevino for the amount of the jury\u2019s award and, as a result, did not have the authority to represent Trevino in a collection proceeding. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a)(3)(A), the court denied Cooper leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith because he had failed to explain why its reasons for denying the motion were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">By moving for IFP status in this court, Cooper is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117. F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R. App. P. 24(a). Cooper does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, Cooper\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision is deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Cooper has not shown that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, Cooper\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Our dismissal as frivolous of Cooper\u2019s appeal counts as a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Cooper is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three \u00a7 1915(g) strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
