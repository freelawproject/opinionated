We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the inconsistency between Liang\u2019s Mexican work visa, which was renewed in 2006, and his testimony that he fears Chinese officials in Mexico and has not returned to Mexico since 2003. <em>See id. </em>at 1046-47 (\u201cAlthough inconsistencies no longer need to go to the heart of the petitioner\u2019s claim, when an inconsistency is at the heart of the claim it doubtless is of great weight.\u201d). The agency was not compelled to accept Liang\u2019s explanation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>this inconsistency. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011). In the absence of credible testimony, Liang\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
