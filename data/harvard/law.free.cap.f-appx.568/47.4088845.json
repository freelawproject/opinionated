Dec. 13, 2012), <em>aff'g </em>No. A200 699 992 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 1, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Wala v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir.2007). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>584 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">For applications like this one, governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of her account, and inconsistencies in her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (B.I.A.2007). Analyzed under these standards, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Contrary to Chen\u2019s argument, a negative demeanor finding can properly be based on vague and unresponsive testimony. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006) (explaining that evasiveness is \u201cone of the many outward signs a fact-finder may consider in evaluating demeanor and in making an assessment of credibility\u201d); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that the IJ\u2019s assessment of a petitioner\u2019s demeanor included his unresponsive testimony). Moreover, the Court gives \u201cparticular deference\u201d to an IJ\u2019s demeanor finding, <em>see Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), especially when, as here, the IJ\u2019s assessment is supported by \u201cspecific examples of inconsistent testimony.\u201d <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006). The record supports the IJ\u2019s negative demeanor finding based on Chen\u2019s varying testimony as to when her wedding banquet was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Although Chen now argues that any inconsistency was due to her \u201clow IQ,\u201d and inability to calculate dates, she did not raise these arguments before the agency, and we decline to consider them. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007). Further, the agency was not required to credit Chen\u2019s explanation that her testimony was mistaken due to her lack of education. <em>See Ma-jidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81 (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The agency also reasonably relied on Chen\u2019s inconsistent testimony as to when she received a village committee certificate indicating that she had an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) and when the IUD was removed. Chen has not reconciled these inconsistencies or provided a compelling explanation for them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Chen has not contested the BIA\u2019s finding that she failed to corroborate her claim, or the IJ\u2019s finding that she failed to explain why the receipt for the fine she allegedly paid for violating family planning policies indicated that she had paid a \u201csocial alimony fee,\u201d and, thus, these findings provide further support for the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146-47 (2d Cir.2008). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Having reasonably found that Chen failed to establish eligibility for asylum on credibility grounds, the agency did not err in denying withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, as these claims share the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
