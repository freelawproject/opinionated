R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b512-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-22\">Al Davis entered a Burger King restaurant with a 13-week-old puppy and was denied service under the restaurant\u2019s \u201cno dogs\u201d policy. Alleging that he is disabled and that he was training the puppy to be a service animal, Davis filed a complaint making claims for disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California Unruh Civil Rights Act. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that Davis had not raised a genuine issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>of material fact about whether the puppy was a service animal, or whether a service animal could help ameliorate his disability. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Both California and federal law require a showing that an individual\u2019s disability can be ameliorated by a particular service animal. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.104; Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 54.1(b)(6)(C)(iii). In its order granting summary judgment, the district court found that Davis failed to raise a triable issue of fact about whether a service dog could ameliorate his disability. On appeal, Davis does not argue the district erred by finding he failed to raise a genuine issue of fact that his disability is capable of being ameliorated by a service dog. Davis has thus waived any objection to this finding, <em>see Indep. Towers of Wash, v. Wash., </em>350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.2003), and he cannot prevail on his disability discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Davis also argues the district court erred by dismissing his claims for racial discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Although Davis stated in his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress that \u201c[discrimination against disabled minorities ... is unusually damaging ... when the discrimination is against a person of African-American heritage,\u201d the complaint did not make an independent claim for racial discrimination. Neither did the district court err by granting summary judgment on Davis\u2019 claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. This claim was based on Davis\u2019 underlying claims of disability discrimination, and he failed to show that the defendants engaged in \u201cextreme or outrageous conduct\u201d by enforcing its \u201cno dogs\u201d policy. <em>See Hughes v. Pair, </em>46 Cal.4th 1035, 95 Cal.Rptr.3d 636, 209 P.3d 963, 976 (2009) (laying out elements of claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b512-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
