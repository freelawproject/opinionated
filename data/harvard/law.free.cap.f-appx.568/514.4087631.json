SMITH, and CHRISTEN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Marine Kanchinyan, a citizen of Armenia, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. We conclude that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. We therefore grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">First, the IJ\u2019s assumptions regarding Kanchinyan\u2019s activities in Armenia, and Kanchinyan\u2019s motives for coming to the United States, are unfounded. Contrary to the IJ\u2019s assessment, nothing in the record suggests that Kanchinyan \u201cconstructed\u201d her narrative of persecution in order to \u201cconceal an intention to come to the United States to reside permanently for reasons unrelated to past persecution in Armenia.\u201d <em>See Li v. Holder, </em>559 F.3d 1096, 1107 (9th Cir.2009) (explaining that speculation and conjecture may not form the basis of an adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Second, the inconsistencies that the IJ discerned in Kanchinyan\u2019s testimony were either illusory, or irrelevant to Kanehi-nyan\u2019s claim of persecution. Contrary to the IJ\u2019s conclusion, there is nothing inconsistent about Kanchinyan\u2019s remembering having been physically attacked from behind by one person, but believing that more people may also have been present. Likewise, Kanchinyan\u2019s testimony regarding threatening phone calls was consistent when considered in its entirety. And any inconsistencies in Kanchinyan\u2019s testimony regarding the Armenian Table Tennis Federation do not go to the heart of the claim of persecution. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir.2006). While the IJ questioned why Kanchinyan would allow her son and husband to remain in Russia, he failed to explain his rejection of Kanchinyan\u2019s plausible explanation for doing so. Thus, any perceived inconsistency in this regard does not support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Rizk v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">Third, the IJ\u2019s characterization of Kan-chinyan\u2019s demeanor while testifying about her experience of rape does not support the adverse credibility determination. An IJ\u2019s speculation about how a rape victim should behave is inadequate to support an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yan Xia Zhu v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 1034, 1039-41 (9th Cir.2008). Moreover, we have previously rejected an IJ\u2019s assumption that a rape victim \u201cwould necessarily have gone to a doctor,\u201d particularly where, as here, the victim gives a plausible explanation for her reluctance to do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">We have reviewed the administrative record, and we conclude that none of the remaining grounds underlying the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. We there-</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>fore grant the petition for review, and remand this matter for the agency to determine whether, accepting Kanchinyan\u2019s testimony as credible, she is eligible for relief. <em>See Singh, </em>439 F.3d at 1112. In view of this disposition, we need not decide whether the IJ violated due process by supporting his adverse credibility determination with information he gleaned from his own internet search.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b539-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
