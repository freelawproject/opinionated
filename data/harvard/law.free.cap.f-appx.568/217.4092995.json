Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Cooper\u2019s sentence is plainly unreasonable. Although notified of his right to do so, Cooper has not filed a supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u201cA district court has broad discretion when imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>738 F.3d 638, 640 (4th Cir.2013). \u201cWe will affirm a revocation sentence if it is within the statutory maximum and is not \u201c \u2018plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006)). \u201cIn making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally or substantively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Only if we so find, will \u201cwe ... then decide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Cooper\u2019s advisory policy statement range and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors applicable to sentencing upon revocation of supervised release. The district court also adequately explained the basis for Cooper\u2019s sentence. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Cooper, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Cooper requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Cooper. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
