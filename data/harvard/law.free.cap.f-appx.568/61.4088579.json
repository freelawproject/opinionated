PENAL LAW \u00a7 120.15. He was sentenced to \u201ctime served\u201d\u2014effectively the mandatory maximum sentence of 90 days under New York law. <em>See People v. Cortese, </em>79 A.D.3d 1281, 1284, 913 N.Y.S.2d 383 (3d Dep\u2019t 2010); <em>People v. Conley, </em>70 A.D.3d 961, 962, 897 N.Y.S.2d 135 (2d Dep\u2019t 2010); <em>People v. Marinaccio, </em>297 A.D.2d 754, 755, 747 N.Y.S.2d 555 (2d Dep\u2019t 2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Because of prior time in confinement, the sentence for Menacing put Trunov above the 180 day mark. The catch is that the sentence was later reduced. The new sentence, if counted for purposes of \u00a7 1101(f)(7), would put Trunov under the 180 day threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The BIA concluded that the sentencing modification did not affect \u00a7 1101(f)(7) and that Trunov was therefore precluded from establishing his good moral character. We GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s decision, and REMAND the cause to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">\u201cWhile the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes is generally entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference, interpretations in non-precedential unpublished BIA decisions, as in the instant case, are not so entitled.\u201d <em>Varughese v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 272, 274 (2d Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The BIA has previously encountered the issue of how to handle modified or vacated legal rulings. Sometimes immigration consequences turn on the existence of a conviction. <em>See, e.g., 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A). When a conviction is vacated \u201csolely to aid [an alien] in avoiding immigration consequences\u201d and not because of \u201cany procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction,\u201d the original conviction is still considered valid for immigration purposes. <em>Saleh v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 17, 19 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also In re Pickering, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621, 624-25 (B.I.A.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">Other times, immigration consequences turn on the sentence that was ordered. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(8), 1101(a)(43)(G). When a sentence is modified, the BIA has credited the newer sentence regardless of the motivations behind the change. <em>In re Cotar-Vargas, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 849, 850-53 (B.I.A.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">The Government argues that \u201cit is the length of confinement and not sentence length that matters\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(f)(7). Resp\u2019t\u2019s Br. 21. The validity of that argument may turn on how the BIA construes the five words in the statute after \u201cconfinement\u201d: \u201cconfine[ment], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>as a result of conviction.\u201d There is a substantial question as to whether someone can be \u201cconfined, as a result of conviction\u201d other than pursuant to a sentence. In other words, how is a sentence not a necessary component of \u00a7 1101(f)(7)?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The BIA stated that it would not credit the modification because Trunov served 90 days \u201cpursuant to a then existing lawful sentence.\u201d It is unclear how or whether this reasoning can be reconciled with <em>Cota-Vargas, supra, </em>in which there was a \u201cthen existing lawful sentence,\u201d but the BIA credited only the newer sentence nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">When dealing with a non-precedential BIA decision, we have often remanded so \u201cthe BIA [can] by published opinion interpret a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Dobrova v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 297, 300 (2d Cir.2010); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao v. BIA, </em>465 F.3d 497, 502-03 (2d Cir.2006). We will do so here. One of the many reasons for this procedure is that \u201cany effort expended by us interpreting the statute would be for nought should the BIA subsequently reach a different, yet reasonable, interpretation.\u201d <em>Jian Hui Shao, </em>465 F.3d at 502; <em>see also Yuanliang Liu v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>455 F.3d 106, 116-17 (2d Cir.2006) (setting forth numerous factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s decision, and REMAND the cause to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order. On remand, the BIA may also consider the Immigration Judge\u2019s alternative bases for denying relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\">. We need not address whether or to what extent the original sentence was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
