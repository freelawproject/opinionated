The district court sentenced Martinez to a within-guidelines sentence of 87 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Martinez argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he contends that the sentence fails to take into account his personal characteristics and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-23\">Martinez does not dispute that the sentence was imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range. Thus, a presumption of reasonableness applies to this guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-24\">Martinez\u2019s argument that the district court did not consider his personal circumstances and characteristics is not supported by the record. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>specifically referenced Martinez\u2019s young age, as well as Martinez\u2019s substance abuse problem and lack of education.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record indicates, however, that the district court was particularly disturbed by Martinez\u2019s lengthy criminal history at the age of 21. In imposing the 87-month sentence, the district court specifically referenced the factors of deterrence, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the need to provide Martinez with adequate substance abuse treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Martinez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. </em>Rodriguez, 523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). To the extent that Martinez disagrees with the sentence imposed or the district court\u2019s evaluation of various sentencing factors, he likewise has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. The district court also recognized that Martinez had not received treatment for his substance abuse problem and recommended drug treatment during his incarceration at the Bureau of Prisons. The sentencing hearing does not indicate that the district court imposed or lengthened the sentence in order to enable Martinez to complete drug treatment. <em>See Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011) (holding that a sentencing court \u201cmay not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
