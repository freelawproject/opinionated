Wood sued her former employer, the Bethlehem Area Vocational-Technical School (\u201cBAVTS\u201d), alleging that her work conditions were changed and that she was suspended without pay, then fired, in retaliation for speaking out on a matter of public concern. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Wood asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 for First and Fourteenth Amendment violations and under state tort law for wrongful termination and related wrongs. Wood also sued the three school districts that the BAVTS served and the Joint Operating Committee that managed the BAVTS, as well as the BAVTS executive director, the chair of the BAVTS Joint Operating Committee, and other BAVTS employees. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissed Wood\u2019s complaint in part, with prejudice, retaining some of the claims against two of the individual defendants. The parties stipulated to dismiss the remaining claims to permit immediate appeal. Wood appeals only the dismissal of the <em>Monell </em>claim against the BAVTS, the dismissal of the supervisory-liability claim against three of the individual defendants, and the dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim against all individual defendants. We find no basis for reversal and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The BAVTS is a public educational institution serving students in the Bethlehem, Northampton, and Saucon Valley School Districts. In October 2006, the BAVTS hired Wood as a technology assistant. Wood alleged in her complaint that in 2010, she became concerned with asbestos exposure on the BAVTS campus and in a BAVTS project home. She alleged that the asbestos exposure was a matter of public concern that attracted local news-media attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">According to Wood, the Joint Operating Committee that managed the BAVTS\u2019s day-to-day operations was responsible for \u201cprotecting the legal and Constitutional rights of individuals, including employees of BAVTS, within their respective legal jurisdictions, including ... providing pre-employment screening, training, and supervision in a manner which is not deliberately indifferent to those said rights.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 16. The BAVTS Joint Operating Committee held open meetings at which members of the public could speak about various issues. Wood spoke at these meetings about asbestos exposure at the BAVTS campus and in the project home. Wood also talked to the BAVTS staff and others to \u201ceffectuate a response to the concerns raised by the asbestos exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Wood alleged that after she spoke out at \u201cnumerous\u201d Joint Operating Committee meetings, the BAVTS initiated disciplinary action against her, the first she had received in her employment there. She was suspended without pay from February 17 to March 2, 2010. Wood alleged that when she returned to work after the suspension, her job duties were significantly altered: her access to equipment was restricted; she was assigned inferior equipment; and she was denied access to a master key that she needed to do her job. Wood believed that she was being \u201cset up to fail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In June 2010, Wood received an unsatisfactory performance evaluation. In July 2010, the BAVTS sent Wood notice of a <em>Loudermill </em>hearing. According to Wood, the <em>Loudermill </em>hearing was a sham. She alleged that she did not get documents supporting the charges against her; the BAVTS administrators involved in the hearing, Brian Williams, the BAVTS Executive Director, and Sandra Klein, the \u201cSupervisor of Lifelong Learning-Technology,\u201d could not articulate a \u201csingle instance\u201d of her misconduct; and she did not get fair notice of the reasons for her suspension. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">On August 16, 2010, Wood was again suspended without pay. Her employment was terminated on November 4, 2010, after the BAVTS Joint Operating Committee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>met. The Committee informed Wood that it acted because she had violated the BAVTS internet-use policy and her job performance was poor. Wood alleged that these reasons were pretextual and that she was disciplined, then fired, because she had raised concerns about asbestos on the BAVTS property. She alleged that the actions against her were in retaliation for her constitutionally protected speech. Wood alleged that the actions were approved by \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s high level officials and were carried out pursuant to custom and policy established with the Defendant\u2019s internal rules,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 40, and that the individual defendants acted \u201cpursuant to official policy or custom of one or more of the Institutional Defendants and with actual and or apparent authority of the said Defendants, in an overt and direct attempt to punish [Wood] for exercising her Constitutional rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Wood\u2019s complaint asserted five counts under \u00a7 1983: that all defendants violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights; that the individual defendants failed to intervene; supervisory liability as to four of the named individual defendants and the \u201cDoe\u201d defendants; <em>Monell </em>liability as to the institutional defendants; and that the individual defendants conspired to violate her rights. The remaining three counts asserted state-law claims for wrongful termination against the institutional defendants; intentional infliction of emotional distress against all defendants; and conspiracy against all the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The defendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court granted the motion in part, with prejudice, and denied it in part. The parties stipulated to the District Court dismissing the remaining claims so that Wood could appeal the dismissal of the <em>Monell </em>claim against the BAVTS; the dismissal of the supervisory-liability claim against three of the individual defendants; and the dismissal of the conspiracy claim against all defendants. We address these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over dismissals for failure to state a claim. <em>Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the \u201ccomplaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Although Wood asserted a <em>Monell </em>claim against all five institutional defendants, she \u201cdoes not appeal the dismissal of the School Districts which comprise the BAVTS, nor the dismissal of the BAVTS Authority.\u201d Blue Br. at 6. Wood appeals only the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the <em>Monell </em>claim against the BAVTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Wood alleged that the BAVTS \u201cdeveloped and maintained policies or customs exhibiting deliberate indifference to the Constitutional rights of BAVTS employees, which caused the violation of\u2019 Wood\u2019s constitutional rights. Compl. \u00b6 61. She alleged that the BAVTS had a \u201cpolicy and/or custom ... to inadequately screen during the hiring process and to inadequately train, retrain and/or supervise BAVTS employees ... thereby failing to adequately discourage Constitutional violations on the part of BAVTS employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 62. Wood also alleged that the BAVTS \u201cdid not require or demand appropriate in-ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>vice training of BAVTS employees, who were known to encourage or tolerate Constitutional violations\u201d and failed to adopt policies to prevent its supervisory employees from violating the constitutional rights of those they supervised. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 68-64. \u201cAs a result of the above described policies and customs and/or failure to adopt necessary and appropriate policies, some BAVTS employees ... believed that their actions would not be properly monitored by supervisory officials, and the Constitutional violations of the rights of individuals such as ... Wood would not be investigated or sanctioned, but, rather, would be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 65. \u201cThe above described policies and customs, and the failure to adopt necessary and appropriate policies, demonstrated a deliberate indifference on the part of the policymakers ... and were the cause of the violation of [Wood\u2019s] rights as alleged herein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The BAVTS moved to dismiss the <em>Mo-nell </em>claim on the basis that Wood had not \u201calleged that any state actor took any action pursuant to policy, practice, or custom to deny Wood a constitutional right.... [T]here [was] no allegation that any specific policymaker took action to deprive Wood of any right.\u201d App. 98. The BAVTS noted that although Wood alleged that \u201chigh level officials\u201d approved the actions against her and that they \u201cwere carried out pursuant to custom and policy,\u201d she had failed to allege any facts showing that \u201cany relevant policy-maker was implementing an official policy or practice.\u201d App. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In response, citing cases decided before <em>Twombly </em>and <em>Iqbal, </em>Wood argued that she could plead a <em>Monell </em>claim without alleging any facts showing what the official policy or custom was or identifying the policymaker or decisionmaker. She argued that it was enough for her \u201cto demonstrate circumstances from which a reasonable person could impute constructive knowledge\u201d of unconstitutional actions to a policymaker or decisionmaker. She also argued that discovery was \u201cnecessary to determine the policymaking status of the individuals involved in the Constitutional violations.\u201d App. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The District Court dismissed Wood\u2019s <em>Monell </em>claim because her complaint failed to identify any unlawful policy or custom and failed to identify any policymaker or decisionmaker responsible for the unlawful conduct alleged. Instead, the complaint made conelusory and general claims of failure to screen, train, or supervise employees to avoid constitutional violations. See <em>Wood v. Bethelehem Area Vocational Technical Sch., </em>No. 12-cv-4624, 2013 WL 2983672, at *9-10 (E.D.Pa. June 17, 2013) (citing <em>McTernan v. City of York, </em>564 F.3d 636, 658 (3d Cir.2009)). The District Court was correct in finding that Wood\u2019s complaint allegations stated the elements of the cause of action and were insufficient. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[S]imply paraphrasing] \u00a7 1983\u201d does not meet Rule 8\u2019s pleading requirements because it fails to satisfy the \u201crigorous standards of culpability and causation\u201d required to state a claim for municipal liability. Mc<em>Ternan, </em>564 F.3d at 658-59 (citing <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 405, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997)); <em>see also Santiago v. Warminster Twp., </em>629 F.3d 121, 135 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Wood argues on appeal that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the <em>Monell </em>claim against the BAVTS \u201coverlooks the crucial fact that the [unlawful] decision of\u2019 Williams and Klein \u201cwas ratified by the governing body of BAVTS, known as the \u2018Joint Operating Committee.\u2019 \u201d Blue Br. at 14. Sharon Stack signed the decision to fire Wood on the Joint Operating Committee\u2019s behalf. Wood argues that the \u201clower court [was] simply incorrect\u201d in dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the <em>Monell </em>claim because by alleging ratification by the BAVTS Joint Operating Committee, she adequately alleged both what the unconstitutional custom consisted of and who the decisionmakers were. Blue Br. at 14-15. But the complaint Wood filed in the District Court did not allege a ratification theory of <em>Monell </em>liability, and the briefs she filed with the District Court did not present this ratification argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Wood\u2019s complaint alleged that the BAVTS violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights because it had a custom of failing to screen when it hired employees and of failing to train and supervise them to avoid violating the constitutional rights of those they supervised. The complaint did not allege any of the elements necessary to plead a valid failure-to-screen claim, including a link between the failure to screen at hiring and the constitutional injury alleged. <em>See Bryan Cnty., </em>520 U.S. at 410-11, 117 S.Ct. 1382 (\u201cTo prevent municipal liability for a hiring decision from collapsing into <em>respondeat superior </em>liability, a court must [be able to] carefully test the link between the policymaker\u2019s inadequate decision and the particular injury alleged____ [The plaintiff must demonstrate that] scrutiny of an applicant\u2019s background would lead a reasonable policymaker to conclude that the plainly obvious consequence of the decision to hire the applicant would be the deprivation of a third party\u2019s federally protected right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The complaint was also deficient in alleging a claim for failure to train or supervise. The complaint did not allege facts showing any particular or specific policy or custom, or how it allowed the claimed constitutional violation to occur, identifying the policymaker or decisionmaker, or showing prior notice through a pattern of similar constitutional violations. <em>See, e.g., McTernan, </em>564 F.3d at 658; <em>see also Thomas v. Cumberland Cnty., </em>749 F.3d 217, 226 (3d Cir.2014) (\u201cLiability cannot rest only on a showing that the employees could have been better trained or that additional training was available that would have reduced the overall risk of constitutional injury. [T]he causation inquiry focuses on whether the injury [could] have been avoided had the employee been trained under a program that was not deficient in the identified respect.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Failure to train can be the basis of <em>Monell </em>liability when the municipality\u2019s \u201cfailure to train reflects deliberate indifference to constitutional rights.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 392, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989); <em>see Brown v. Muhlenberg Twp., </em>269 F.3d 205, 215 (3d Cir.2001) (holding that a failure-to-train claim must reflect a deliberate or conscious choice by a municipality as defined in Supreme Court cases); <em>Carter v. City of Philo., </em>181 F.3d 339, 357 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201c[I]n order for a municipality\u2019s failure to train or supervise to amount to deliberate indifference, it must be shown that (1) municipal policymakers know that employees will confront a particular situation; (2) the situation involves a difficult choice or a history of employees mishandling; and (3) the wrong choice by an employee will frequently cause deprivation of constitutional rights.\u201d (citations and footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In addition, the complaint did not allege any facts that could support an inference that the BAVTS was on notice of the risk of retaliation for First Amendment protected speech by employees, and that it was deliberately indifferent to this risk. While the complaint briefly mentioned one of Wood\u2019s coworkers, a man named Crosby, as one who spoke out at a meeting and was later suspended, \u201c[p]roof of a single incident of unconstitutional activity is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>sufficient to impose liability under <em>Monell, </em>unless proof of the incident includes proof that it was caused by an existing, unconstitutional [government] policy, which policy can be attributed to a ... policymaker.\u201d <em>City of Okla. City v. Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 823-24, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">When the defendants pointed to the complaint\u2019s deficiencies in the motion to dismiss, Wood did not respond with the ratification theory of liability that she asserts here. Instead, Wood argued to the District Court that she needed discovery to determine the policymaking status of those who had committed the constitutional violations. She stated that discovery was \u201cnecessary to determine the policy-making status of the individuals involved in the Constitutional violations.\u201d App. 206. But Wood did not explain why her own knowledge about the BAVTS from her years of working there did not allow her to plead with more factual specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Wood had not alleged in the complaint, and she did not argue in her brief opposing the motion to dismiss, that the BAVTS was liable under \u00a7 1983 because the Joint Operating Committee ratified the unconstitutional behavior of subordinate BAVTS employees. The District Court did not \u201csimply overlook[ ]\u201d these arguments; they were not presented. \u201cWe generally refuse to consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Newark Morning Ledger Co. v. United States, </em>539 F.2d 929, 932 (3d Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Finally, even if the complaint had alleged a ratification basis for <em>Monell </em>liability consistent with the argument Wood raises for the first time on appeal, the allegations would have been deficient. Wood\u2019s ratification theory might fill in one of the pleading deficiencies the District Court identified, the failure to identify a policymaker or decisionmaker. Wood\u2019s ratification theory does not fill in the second deficiency, the failure to plead any facts showing what the unlawful policy or custom was. <em>McTernan, </em>564 F.3d at 658. And even assuming that the Joint Committee was the relevant decisionmaker, Wood\u2019s complaint still does not allege facts required to plead <em>Monell </em>liability for failing to hire, train, or screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">We will affirm the dismissal of the <em>Mo-nell </em>claim against the BAVTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The District Court dismissed the supervisory-liability claims asserted against the individual defendants and dismissed the other claims against these defendants except Williams and Klein. <em>Wood, </em>2013 WL 2983672, at *11. Wood argues that the District Court erred in dismissing the supervisory-liability claims against Williams, Klein, and Dr. Irene Gavin. Wood, however, presents an argument only as to Williams and Klein.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Wood\u2019s complaint alleged that \u201c[o]ne or more of the Defendants acted in a supervisory capacity under circumstances, and at a time, when one or more of the subordinate Defendants violated the Plaintiffs rights as set forth herein.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 57. \u201cIn that regard, the Supervisory Defendants, now known and unknown, either directed the conduct which resulted in the violation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 federal rights as alleged; or, had actual knowledge of the subordinates violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 rights and acquiesced in said violations; or, with deliberate indifference to the consequences, established and maintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused the violation or, had a policy of maintaining no policy, where one or more policies or regulations were clearly needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court noted that the body of the complaint mentioned only two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>of the individual defendants by name\u2014 Brian Williams, the Executive Director of BAVTS, and Sandra Klein, \u201cSupervisor of Lifelong Learning\u2014Technology.\u201d <em>Wood, </em>2013 WL 2983672, at *2. Wood alleged that \u201cnone of the administrators present including [Klein and Williams] could articulate one single instance of misconduct\u201d at her <em>Loudermill </em>hearing. Compl. \u00b6 32. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss these claims against Williams and Klein but granted the motion to dismiss the supervisory-liability claims against them and granted the motion to dismiss all claims as to the other individual defendants. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">[1] f, as the complaint alleges, the hearing was insufficient to protect Wood\u2019s due process rights, and if it was used as a vehicle for her firing in retaliation for protected First Amendment activity, then Klein and Williams would have participated in a deprivation of Wood\u2019s constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>Wood, </em>2013 WL 2983672, at *6. In dismissing the claims against Sharon Stack, chair of the Joint Operating Committee, the District Court noted that the complaint failed \u201cto allege any facts whatsoever with respect to\u201d this defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We will affirm for the reasons stated by the District Court. The complaint contained no specific factual allegations fleshing out the claims of supervisory liability. <em>Id. </em>at *11. By contrast, the complaint specifically alleged that Williams and Klein were involved in providing a deficient <em>Loudermill </em>hearing, and the District Court retained these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Citing excerpts from the termination hearing, not the complaint, Wood argues on appeal that Williams and Klein had supervisory authority over her at the BAVTS and were personally involved in deciding to terminate her employment. These allegations were not in the complaint before the District Court. Given the complaint allegations and the arguments Wood made to the District Court, it was not inconsistent for that court to dismiss the supervisory liability claims against Williams and Klein for factually insufficient pleading and to deny the motion to dismiss against them for individually violating her constitutional rights by providing a deficient <em>Loudermill </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Finally, we will affirm the dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claims for the reasons the District Court stated. <em>Id. </em>The complaint contained no specific factual allegations of \u201ccombination, agreement, or understanding among all or between any of the defendants to plot, plan or conspire to carry out the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>D.R. by L.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Technical Sch., </em>972 F.2d 1364, 1377 (3d Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">Wood\u2019s arguments on appeal show no basis for reversal. The District Court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
