Butler argues that his sentence violates his equal protection and due process rights. In addition, he argues that his sentence should be reduced because the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) lowers the statutory sentencing range for his offense, which would affect the calculation of his guideline ranges as a career offender. Finally, he argues that under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), he cannot be subject to a sentence greater than the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-24\">A. Equal Protection and Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b792-25\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, we review <em>de novo </em>the scope of the district court\u2019s authority under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may not modify a term of imprisonment except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>we held that the district court was correct in declining to consider the defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>cause \u00a7 3582(c) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to consider such extraneous resentencing issues, and the defendant\u2019s claim must brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. 203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is limited to circumstances in which a defendant was sentenced based on sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, and Butler\u2019s claims of violations of his equal protection and due process rights do not fall into this category. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Butler\u2019s constitutional claims must be raised in a collateral proceeding, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">B. Fair Sentencing Act</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements if it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline provision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) <em>&amp; </em>comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a sentence reduction under the FSA because the FSA was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but a statutory amendment by Congress, and did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Furthermore, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim failed because the district court sentenced him before the FSA\u2019s enactment, and the FSA\u2019s mandatory m\u00ednimums did not retroactively apply under such circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce a sentence does not provide a basis for <em>de novo </em>resentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). Accordingly, the district court must maintain all original sentencing determinations with the sole exception of applying the relevant amended guideline range. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780-81 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Butler was not entitled to relief under the FSA because the FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, and therefore, cannot serve as the basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Furthermore, Butler was sentenced before the effective date of the act, and it is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">In addition, Butler\u2019s argument under <em>Al-leyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), fails because the determinations by the jury are not relevant to this proceeding. The drug quantity determined at Butler\u2019s original sentencing proceeding applies in his \u00a7 3582 proceeding, and furthermore, \u00a7 3582(c) does not provide a basis for relief based on a challenge to Butler\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Butler\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
