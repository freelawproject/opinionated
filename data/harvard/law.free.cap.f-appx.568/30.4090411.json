Doe pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement accompanied by a separate confidential cooperation agreement, to a charge of manufacturing marijuana plants in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Doe challenges his conviction and sentence on the basis that the District Court did not discuss his cooperation agreement at the plea colloquy or sentencing. Accordingly, he contends, his plea was not knowing and voluntary and the sentencing did not comply with the open court requirement as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">On September 24, 2012, after Foe was arrested, he entered into an agreement to plead guilty to one count of manufacturing marijuana. The plea agreement stipulated that Doe would not appeal a sentence of 240 months or below. The cooperation agreement provided that the Government would notify the Court of Doe\u2019s cooperation and, if the Government determined that he had provided \u201csubstantial assistance,\u201d it could <em>in its sole discretion </em>recommend a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">At the plea colloquy, the Court discussed the Guideline calculations and the appeal waiver, but did not discuss the cooperation agreement. On October 4, 2012, the Government moved for a one-level downward departure based on the cooperation agreement. At sentencing, the District Court calculated a Guideline range of 151-188 months, and sentenced Doe to 151 months. In its Statement of Reasons, issued later, the District Court explained that it had departed downward based in part on Doe\u2019s cooperation. Doe appealed his sentence to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Because Doe \u201cnever sought to withdraw his plea, and did not object\u201d in the District Court to the alleged Rule 11 violation or the sentence imposed we review his claims for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Tarbell, </em>728 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">At the colloquy, the District Court informed Doe of the 240-month mandatory minimum sentence, and discussed the appeal waiver. Accordingly, Doe knew of the <em>\u201cdirect </em>consequences of a guilty plea,\u201d 1. e. anything that would have a \u201cdefinite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of ... punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Youngs, </em>687 F.3d 56, 60 (2d Cir.2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Doe\u2019s claim that the failure to discuss the confidential cooperation agreement rendered his plea unknowing and, therefore, invalid mirrors arguments previously rejected by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">In <em>Tarbell </em>the district court discussed the mandatory minimum sentence under the plea agreement, but did not discuss a confidential cooperation agreement. 728 F.3d at 126-27. We held that where the cooperation agreement made clear that there was no promise of a downward departure, and the defendant was aware of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence, the failure to discuss the cooperation agreement did not render the plea unknowing or involuntary. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the \u201cdecision not to discuss the confidential cooperation agreement in open court [was] perfectly understandable\u201d and not plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 127. We noted however that \u201cthe better practice in these circumstances would have been for the District Court to use one of the various tools at its disposal [\u2014closing the courtroom during plea proceedings, sealing the transcript of such proceedings, and issuing rulings under seal\u2014] to reduce if not eliminate the risks that may arise from fulfilling its obligation to ensure that the defendant understands the range of potential penalties, rather than simply remaining completely silent about such a cooperation agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, citations and alterations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Like <em>Tarbell, </em>this case illustrates the tension that exists between the principle that all relevant aspects of the plea proceeding should be discussed, preferably in open court, and the need to preserve the confidentiality of a defendant\u2019s cooperation with the government in criminal proceedings. At a minimum, we believe that the terms of the cooperation agreement, if not the agreement itself, should be before the sentencing judge at the time the plea is accepted. In the absence of a department-wide policy, however, that tension must be resolved on a case-by-case base. Here, the tension did not result in reversible error because Doe has not shown how the failure to discuss the cooperation agreement affected his substantial rights: he does not contend that he was unaware of the terms of the cooperation agreement, which, regardless, would not necessarily have affected his sentence. Moreover, the agreement ultimately resulted in Doe receiving a <em>lower </em>sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because doe\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, the waiver of his right to appeal any sentence below 240 months is enforceable, and requires dismissal of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">For the reasons set out above, this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-11\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) provides in relevant part: \"The court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence ....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-16\">. The District Court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Tarbell </em>when sentencing Doe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">. Doe also makes a meritless ineffective assistance argument, claiming that \"defense counsel never once advocated that Doe should receive the benefit of [his] cooperation.\u201d But Doe did receive the benefit of the cooperation agreement in the form of a downward departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
