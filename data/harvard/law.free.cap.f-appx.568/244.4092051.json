On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether Smith was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Smith was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. The Government has declined to file a response brief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Following a careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Counsel questions whether Smith\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201care generally not cognizable on direct appeal ... unless it conclusively appears from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, to allow for adequate development of the record, ineffective assistance claims generally should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2012) motion. <em>See United States v. Baptiste, </em>596 F.3d 214, 216 n. 1 (4th Cir.2010). Because we conclude the record does not plainly establish that Smith\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance, we decline to consider his claim at this juncture, without prejudice to his ability to raise such a claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Smith\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Smith, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Smith requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
