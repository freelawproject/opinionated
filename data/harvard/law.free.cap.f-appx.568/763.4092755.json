At the sentencing hearing, the district court enhanced Lakes\u2019 base offense level by four points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) because Lakes \u201cused or possessed a firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d The district court found that, due to his prior drug convictions, Lakes\u2019s possession of 1.8 grams of marijuana at the same time as his possession of a firearm constituted \u201canother felony offense\u201d under the language of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). The court then imposed a 58-month sentence, which fell within the applicable guideline range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Lakes appeals the application of the four-point enhancement to his base offense level as substantively unreasonable, arguing that the resulting sentence is unduly harsh given the circumstances of this case. Lakes argues that application of the enhancement \u201cresulted in a grossly disproportional sentence in light of the actual amount of marijuana\u201d in his possession at the time of arrest. While Lakes concedes in his brief that his prior drug convictions would render him ineligible to receive misdemeanor treatment on the marijuana charge under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(4) and 844, he argues that an additional 20 months of imprisonment for possession of less than 2 grams of marijuana is patently unreasonable. Under these circumstances, Lakes argues that the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We may \u201cset aside a sentence only if we determine, after giving a full measure of deference to the sentencing judge, that the sentence imposed truly is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">The party who challenges the sentence \u201cbears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence falling within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first ensure that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable, meaning the district court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once we determine that a sentence is procedurally sound, we then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8558(a), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">At his sentencing hearing, Lakes pointed out that his applicable guideline range which would have been 37 to 46 months without the enhancement, jumped to 57 to 71 months \u201cfor such a small amount of drugs.\u201d As stated by his lawyer at sentencing: \u201cAs a practical matter I don\u2019t know that you could cover up my thumbnail with 1.8 grams of marijuana ... I am certainly not excusing any of this stuff, but it\u2019s just a small amount that\u2014and such a large enhancement, really, for such a small amount of drugs.\u201d Lakes stated that he was holding the marijuana for a friend, and not for himself. Accordingly, he argued, the application of the enhancement does not serve the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">After three prior drug convictions, Lakes was caught with a loaded firearm while in possession of three separate bags of marijuana, subjecting him to the four-level enhancement under the advisory guidelines. The record demonstrates that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the presentence investigation report, the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it pronounced its sentence. The sentence is within, and at the low end of the applicable guideline range. It is also below the statutory maximum, further lending itself to a finding of reasonableness. Thus, Lakes has not met his burden of showing that the district court abused its discretion in applying the enhancement. We affirm the district court\u2019s sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
