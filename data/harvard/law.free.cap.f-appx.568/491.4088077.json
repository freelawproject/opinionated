Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of motions to reconsider or to reopen. <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-27\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>cause Singh failed to specify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s previous decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Further, in construing Singh\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because Singh failed to support it with new, previously unavailable evidence. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also Lainez-Ortiz v. INS, </em>96 F.3d 393, 396 (9th Cir.1996). We reject Singh\u2019s contentions that the BIA ignored evidence, applied an incorrect legal standard, or otherwise improperly analyzed his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider any contentions by Singh challenging the BIA\u2019s December 21, 2011 order because the petition for review is untimely as to that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>see also Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995);</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b515-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
