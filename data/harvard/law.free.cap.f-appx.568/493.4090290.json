R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b517-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">Lijun Sun, a native and citizen of China, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1011 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on its findings regarding Sun\u2019s demeanor and responsiveness and based on Sun\u2019s inability to provide details regarding his church attendance in the United States. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under totality of circumstances, including based on unresponsive and undetailed testimony); Sing<em>h-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (giving special deference to IJ\u2019s observation of petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>er\u2019s demeanor). In light of this conclusion, we reject Sun\u2019s contentions that the agency did not give adequate weight to evidence of country conditions and erred in failing to address his claim of a pattern or practice of persecution. Accordingly, Sun\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Sun failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006). We reject Sun\u2019s contention that the agency improperly evaluated his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b517-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
