We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">The district court properly dismissed Houston\u2019s due process claim because Houston failed to allege sufficient facts to show that defendants violated his constitutional rights by placing him in administrative segregation. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (no due process violation if restraint imposed is not an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">The district court properly dismissed Houston\u2019s equal protection claim because Houston failed to allege sufficient facts to show that he has been treated differently from any other similarly situated persons without a rational basis, <em>see Engquist v. Or. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>553 U.S. 591, 601-03, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008), or that he was intentionally discriminated against on the basis of his membership in a protected class, <em>see Thornton v.
