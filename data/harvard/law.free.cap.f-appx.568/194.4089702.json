We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-22\">Aruanno is civilly confined at the Special Treatment Unit in New Jersey pursuant to the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predators Act. He is also a frequent litigator, who is currently, by our count, pressing his 45th appeal in this Court. In this action, he filed a complaint in the District Court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, asserting three claims: (1) that the defendants infringed his First Amendment right to access the courts; (2) that the defendants retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to give an interview to a television program; and (3) that the defendants violated his First Amendment right to speak on the telephone with his family and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-23\">The District Court dismissed Aruanno\u2019s complaint without prejudice to his filing an amended complaint. Aruanno then filed an amended complaint, which the District Court also dismissed. Aruanno appealed to this Court, and we vacated the District Court\u2019s judgment and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Aruanno v. John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>son, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 142 (3d Cir.2013). On remand, the District Court again dismissed the amended complaint. The Court held that while A ruanno claimed that the defendants had violated his right to access the courts by preventing him from attending a court hearing in another case, he had failed to assert that this conduct had caused the type of actual injury required to maintain an access-to-the-courts claim. The Court further concluded that Aruanno\u2019s retaliation claim failed because he had not pleaded that the defendants took adverse action against him. Aruanno then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. To state a claim for a violation of his right to access the courts, A ruanno was required to \u201callege actual injury, such as the loss or rejection of a legal claim.\u201d <em>Oliver v. Fauver, </em>118 F.3d 175, 177 (3d Cir.1997). Here, Aruanno claimed that the defendants had failed to transport him to a hearing in state court. However, as the District Court pointed out, the state court denied Aruanno\u2019s claims on the merits, for reasons that had nothing to do with Aruanno\u2019s nonattendance. <em>See State v. Aruanno, </em>Cr. A. No. 97-01-0016, 2012 WL 1948670 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div. May 31, 2012); <em>see also McTernan v. City of York, Pa., </em>577 F.3d 521, 526 (3d Cir.2009) (\u201ca court may take judicial notice of a prior judicial opinion\u201d). Aruanno has failed to allege that he was prejudiced in any way by his inability to attend the hearing, and accordingly, he failed to state a viable access-to-the-courts claim. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (prisoner must demonstrate that deprivation \u201chindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Further, we conclude that Aruanno\u2019s retaliation claim is barred by res judicata. Res judicata bars claims that were brought, or could have been brought, in a previous action; it applies where there is \u201c(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\u201d <em>In re Mullarkey, </em>536 F.3d 215, 225 (3d Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). Here, Aruan-no contends that, as a result of his exercise of his First Amendment rights, he was placed in lock-up in December 2009. In one of his previous cases involving the same defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> however, Aruanno presented a retaliation claim premised on this same punishment, and the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Aruanno v. Caldwell, </em>Civ. A. No. 09-5652, 2011 WL 2293385 (D.N.J. June 8, 2011). A district court\u2019s order dismissing a complaint on this basis constitutes a \u201cfinal judgment on the merits\u201d for th\u00e9 purposes of res judicata. <em>See Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 34, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992); <em>Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 399 n. 3, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981). Thus, Aruanno either did raise this identical retaliation claim in his previous action, or, at the least, certainly could have done so, and accordingly, res judicata prevents him from relitigating it in this action. <em>See generally Parkview Assocs. P\u2019ship v. City of Lebanon, </em>225 F.3d 321, 329 n. 2 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Finally, we conclude that Aruanno\u2019s allegations concerning his lack of phone access to friends and family fail to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We agree that prisoners maintain a First Amendment \u201cright to communicate with family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and Mends,\u201d and that the telephone can be a means of exercising this right. <em>Valdez v. </em>Rosenbaum 802 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted). However, Aruanno\u2019s allegations are entirely conclusory and fail to state a facially plausible claim. See <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclu-sory statements, do not suffice.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\">. Aruanno has added Steven Johnson as a named defendant in this case, but he has not alleged that Johnson had any role in the alleged retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-4\">. Further, given that it had previously provided Aruanno with leave to amend, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s refusal to allow Aruanno to amend the complaint an additional time. See <em>Day v. Florida, </em>743 F.3d 40, 43 (3d Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-5\">. In his appellate brief, Aruanno seems to allege that the defendants have unlawfully monitored his phone calls to his attorneys. However, he did not present this claim to the District Court, and we will not address the merits of the claim for the first time on appeal. <em>See C.H. v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist., </em>606 F.3d 59, 73 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
