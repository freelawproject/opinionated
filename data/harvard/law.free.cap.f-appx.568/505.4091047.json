Perrin appeals from two consecutive sentences of one year and a day imposed upon revocation of supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Perrin contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to explain adequately the sentences imposed. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2006), and find none. The record reflects that the court heard Perrin\u2019s arguments and imposed the consecutive sentences as a sanction for Perrin\u2019s breach of trust. <em>See id. </em>at 1182. Moreover, Perrin has not shown a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence had the district court provided a more thorough explanation of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 762 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Perrin next contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the mitigating factors, including his drug addiction, and because the district court put undue weight on the need to protect the public. The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing Perrin\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The within-Guidelines consecutive sentences are substantively reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) sentencing factors, and the totality of the circumstances, including Perrin\u2019s repeated violations of supervised release. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Gutierrez-Sanchez, </em>587 F.3d 904, 908 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe weight to be given the various factors in a particular case is for the discretion of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b530-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
