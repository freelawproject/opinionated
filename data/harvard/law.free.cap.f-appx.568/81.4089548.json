In January 2014, Knight filed a pro se motion with the District Court, asking the court to correct a \u201csimple clerical error\u201d in his judgment of sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Knight claimed that \u201cthe typist in the clerk[\u2019s] office\u201d had \u201cfail[ed] to check the correct box [i]n the State[ment] of Reasons\u201d section of the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that section, there are two boxes. The first box should have been checked if the court adopted the factual findings and guideline application in the presentence report <em>without exception. </em>The second box should have been checked if the court adopted the factual findings and guideline application in the presentence report <em>with one or more exceptions. </em>Knight\u2019s judgment of sentence has the first box checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-21\">On January 9, 2014, the District Court denied Knight\u2019s Rule 36 motion, concluding that no clerical error had been made because the court had, in fact, adopted the factual findings and guideline application in the presentenee report <em>without exception. </em>This pro se appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-22\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reason given by the District Court, we agree with the court\u2019s denial of Knight\u2019s Rule 36 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because this appeal does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s January 9, 2014 order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-16\">. Rule 36 provides that, \"[a]fter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P. 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-17\">. Knight made clear that he was <em>not </em>challenging the sentence itself or his underlying conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-23\">. Because this appeal is not challenging a final order in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Knight does not need to obtain a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-24\">. Although we have yet to articulate the standard for reviewing the denial of a Rule 36 motion, we need not do so here because this appeal fails under any available standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
