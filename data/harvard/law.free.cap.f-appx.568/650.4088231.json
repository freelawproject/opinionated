RApp. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The defendant, Adoneus Johnson, has appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. Included in the government\u2019s appellate arguments is an assertion that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In September of 2008, Johnson entered into a plea agreement with the government, which, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), stated he would receive a sentence of thirteen years. The district court accepted the agreement and sentenced Johnson to thirteen years, which equates to 156 months. On February 4, 2013, Johnson filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court issued an order denying Johnson\u2019s motion on June 14, 2013. Johnson filed a motion for reconsideration on September 20, 2013. The government objected to the motion, but did not argue the motion was untimely. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration on November 14, 2013. Eight days later, Johnson filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">In this appeal, Johnson objects only to the district court\u2019s denial of his initial motion to reduce his sentence; he does not contest the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. In its response brief, the government argues that we should dismiss this appeal as untimely because Johnson did not file his notice of appeal within fourteen days of \u201cthe entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.\u201d Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(l)(i). Although timely motions for reconsideration extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, Johnson did not file his motion for reconsideration within the time required by <em>United States v. Randall, </em>666 F.3d 1238, 1243 (10th Cir.2011). The government thus contends that this untimely motion for reconsideration did not extend the time for Johnson to appeal his initial motion. Johnson acknowledges that his motion for reconsideration was untimely, but he opposes dismissal of this appeal because Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b) is not jurisdictional, but instead is a claim-processing rule that can be waived. Johnson argues the government waived its objection to the timeliness of this appeal by failing to raise the timeliness of Johnson\u2019s motion for reconsideration before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">We reject Johnson\u2019s argument that failing to object to the timeliness of a motion for reconsideration before the district court bars the government from raising an otherwise proper timeliness objection to the notice of appeal. Although Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional, we have previously held that it \u201cmust be enforced by this court when properly invoked by the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 744 (10th Cir.2008). The question presented here is when the government must raise the issue for it to be \u201cproperly invoked.\u201d In <em>Mitchell, </em>we declined to enforce Rule 4(b) because \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>government never objected to the untimeliness of Mitchell\u2019s notice of appeal and, as a result, forfeited its opportunity to ensure enforcement of the rule.\u201d 518 F.3d at 744. Here, however, the government <em>has </em>objected to the untimeliness of Johnson\u2019s notice of appeal by raising the issue in its response brief. We conclude that is sufficient for the government to properly invoke Rule 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We DISMISS the appeal as untimely.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
