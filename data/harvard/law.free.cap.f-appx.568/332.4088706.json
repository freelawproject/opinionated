He challenges the deni-' al of his motion for suppression of the evidence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">A thirteen-year-old girl known as \u201cJane Doe\u201d (\u201cDoe\u201d) ran away from her foster home. Doe was accompanied by an eighteen-year-old female ward, known as \u201cRW.\u201d Three days later, while attempting to locate Doe, Texas police officers received information from RW leading them to believe that Doe was in a home belonging to Defendant\u2019s grandmother, Mamie Anderson (\u201cAnderson\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Officers J. Acosta (\u201cAcosta\u201d) and A. Woods (\u201cWoods\u201d) asked Anderson for permission to enter the home and search for Doe. Anderson refused the request, telling the officers that they would have to obtain a search warrant to enter. She also insisted that Doe was not in the house. After Anderson refused entry, Acosta and Woods left and called their duty supervisor, Officer C. Huerta (\u201cHuerta\u201d), to assist them. In the meantime, RW told police that Doe had engaged in sexual intercourse with the 24-year old Defendant earlier that day. In light of this information, the officers again attempted to get consent from Anderson to enter the home; she again refused. At this point, Acosta handed Anderson a portable phone and had her speak with his supervisor, Sergeant T.C. May (\u201cMay\u201d). After speaking with May, Anderson allowed the officers into her home to search for Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">The officers located Doe in a locked bedroom with Defendant, who was placed under arrest. Doe told the officers that Defendant had engaged in intercourse with her and that he had recorded it on his cellular phone. The officers sought, obtained, and executed a search warrant to return to the home and collect and search the cellular phone. Defendant was charged with Production of Child Pornography in violation of \u00a7 2251(a) and (e) and Sex Trafficking of a Minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search of Anderson\u2019s home as well as the evidence acquired from the subsequent search warrant. At the suppression hearing, there was some dispute over what exactly May said to Anderson in order to obtain her consent. Anderson\u2019s side of the conversation was recorded by officers at the home, but May\u2019s side was not recorded. He testified that he attempted to gain Anderson\u2019s consent first by advising her that she could be arrested if Doe was found in the house <em>and </em>Anderson knowingly concealed that information from the police. After Anderson still refused to consent, May appealed to Anderson as a grandmother, asking her whether she would want the police to do everything they could to find her granddaughter. According to May and Huerta, it was this appeal that led to Anderson\u2019s consent, which was corroborated by the recording reflecting her statement that \u201cof course I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>would,\u201d and then saying \u201cok, I\u2019m going to let them in and look \u2018cause I haven\u2019t seen nobody so I don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d She then stepped aside and allowed the officers to enter her house. Acosta also testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Anderson, on the other hand, testified that she only consented because May threatened to put her under arrest for refusing to consent to the search, regardless of whether she knew of Doe\u2019s whereabouts. Based on the evidence presented, the trial court found the testimony of May and Huerta to be credible and corroborated by the video evidence. It also found that Acosta\u2019s testimony supported May and Huerta\u2019s testimony. Finally, the trial court did not find Anderson to be a credible witness because the video evidence indicated that she consented as a result of May\u2019s appeal to Anderson\u2019s emotions, rather than his statements that she could be arrested for harboring Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">After the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, Defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement reserving his right to appeal the suppression ruling, to one count of production of child pornography and was sentenced. He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the evidence, asserting that the police conducted an illegal search of Anderson\u2019s home and that the government failed to turn over <em>Brady </em>information related to Acosta\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">A. Voluntariness of the Consent</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The district court found that Anderson\u2019s consent was given voluntarily and that, in the alternative, exigent circumstances existed to enter Anderson\u2019s home given RW\u2019s indication that Defendant was engaging in sexual intercourse with a minor, Doe. In reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress the evidence, we review factual findings, including credibility choices, for clear error. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 435 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cA factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Warrantless searches are not considered per se unreasonable when the search is conducted pursuant to consent. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Whether the consent was voluntary is a question of fact to be determined by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041. Defendant challenges the voluntariness of Anderson\u2019s consent, arguing that the police procedures were coercive because May threatened to arrest Anderson if she refused consent. However, the district court found that May told Anderson she would be arrested only if she <em>knew </em>Doe was in her house; the district court also explicitly rejected Anderson\u2019s testimony that May threatened to arrest her regardless of her knowledge. There was no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination since it was a plausible credibility determination in light of the evidence. <em>See Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d at 427. Furthermore, the evidence supports the district court\u2019s determination that Anderson\u2019s will was not overborne by May\u2019s statement that she could be arrested if she was knowingly concealing Doe because Anderson continued to refuse consent until May appealed to her emotions. Because there is no clear error, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Anderson\u2019s consent was voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>B. <em>Brady </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Before the suppression hearing, the government received potential <em>Brady </em>evidence regarding Acosta\u2019s credibility. This information was submitted to the district court at the suppression hearing, and after assessing the information <em>in camera, </em>the district court concluded that the government had no disclosure obligations. Defendant has requested that we independently review the sealed materials to determine whether the district court clearly erred in finding no disclosure obligations. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>485 F.3d 824, 836 (5th Cir.2007) (conducting an independent review of information that the district court reviewed <em>in camera </em>for <em>Brady </em>information). We review a district court\u2019s ruling that potential <em>Brady </em>material reviewed <em>in camera </em>is not discoverable only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>650 F.3d 581, 589 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">To prevail, Defendant would need to show that the district court clearly erred in concluding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the undisclosed evidence was material. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cEvidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Rector v. Johnson, </em>120 F.3d 551, 562 (5th Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Even if the evidence under seal affected Acosta\u2019s credibility generally, it would not have changed the district court\u2019s ruling because Acosta\u2019s testimony, which did not address the contents of the critical May\u2014Anderson conversation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, played no material role in determining whether Anderson voluntarily consented. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, the record shows that Acosta\u2019s testimony did nothing more than corroborate the testimony provided by Huerta and May, whom the court found independently credible, and was corroborated by the videotape evidence. Therefore, Defendant\u2019s ability to undermine Acosta\u2019s credibility in general would not have changed the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See id. </em>The district court did not clearly err in determining that the prosecution was under no obligation to disclose the information. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
