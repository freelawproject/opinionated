In 2003, Moore was sentenced to 189 months\u2019 imprisonment after he was convicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Moore\u2019s sentence was enhanced pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) because he had three prior violent felony convictions, including, <em>inter alia, </em>carrying a concealed firearm. In his instant \u00a7 2241 petition, Moore argued that he was actually innocent of his \u00a7 924(e) conviction and sentence, in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). He contended that his Florida conviction for carrying a concealed firearm no longer qualified as a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d and his claim fell within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He further asserted that settled precedent had effectively deprived him of any reasonable opportunity to obtain a reliable determination of this issue. The District Court dismissed Moore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>petition and subsequent motion for reconsideration, finding that the savings clause did not apply and the court thus had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">On appeal, Moore argues <em>pro se </em>that his sentence was improperly enhanced under the ACCA. Moreover, he asserts that he may utilize the savings clause to challenge his sentence in light of <em>Begay. </em>The Government concedes that the District Court should not have used Moore\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm to determine his status as an armed career criminal, but highlights that Moore had four other convictions for offenses that we have previously held to be ACCA-qualifying. Moore replies that, under <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Oct. 7, 2013) (No. 12-10831), the Government cannot argue for the first time on appeal that his other prior convictions supported an enhanced sentence. Thus, this case presents the issues of: (1) whether the District Court properly dismissed Moore\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition on the basis that the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) did not apply; and (2) if the savings clause applies, whether the Government in response may argue for the first time on appeal that Moore\u2019s other convictions are violent felonies that satisfy the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241, and \u201cmay affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court.\u201d <em>Turner v. Warden, </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2873, 186 L.Ed.2d 923 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Our recent decision in <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), supplies the analysis and the answer to whether Moore falls within the ambit of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Bryant </em>held that for \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause to apply, a petitioner must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-11\">(1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had specifically addressed [petitioner\u2019s] distinct prior state conviction that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed [petitioner\u2019s] \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a); (2) subsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay, </em>as extended by this Court to [petitioner\u2019s] distinct prior conviction, overturned our Circuit precedent that had squarely foreclosed [petitioner\u2019s] \u00a7 924(e) claim; (3) the new rule announced in <em>Begay </em>applies retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of [petitioner\u2019s] new rule being retroactive, [petitioner\u2019s] current sentence exceeds the 10-year statutory maximum authorized by Congress in \u00a7 924(a); and (5) the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reaches his pure \u00a7 924(e) <em>Begay </em>error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1274. Moore can establish all five requirements, and, as such, \u00a7 2255(e) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">First, throughout Moore\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our precedent squarely foreclosed his claim that carrying a concealed firearm did not qualify as \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>77 F.3d 398, 401 (11th Cir.1996) (concluding that carrying a concealed weapon qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA). Second, <em>Hall </em>was overturned after Moore filed his first \u00a7 2255 petition. <em>See United States v. Can</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>ty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[Carrying a concealed weapon is not a violent felony that may be used as a predicate conviction to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under the ACCA.\u201d). Third, we held in <em>Bryant </em>that \u201cthe new rule announced in <em>Begay </em>applies retroactively for purposes of a first \u00a7 2255 motion and the \u00a7 2241 petition [a petitioner] seeks to bring under \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1277. Fourth, Moore\u2019s current sentence of 189 months exceeds the 10-year statutory maximum sentence authorized by Congress in \u00a7 924(a). And finally, <em>Bryant </em>concluded that \u201c \u00a7 2255(e) reaches [a] pure \u00a7 <em>924(e)-Begay </em>claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Because Moore satisfies all five requisites laid out in <em>Bryant, </em>\u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d and thus he can proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The Government contends the record establishes that, in addition to the three convictions the District Court relied on to trigger the enhanced sentence, Moore was convicted of additional felonies that would qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. In <em>Bryant, </em>we held the Government may not for the first time on appeal substitute another felony to reach the three felonies required to trigger the ACCA. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1279. As in <em>Bryant, </em>here the Government never suggested to the District Court that Moore\u2019s other felony convictions could serve as ACCA-qualifying felonies. Because it failed to raise the argument below, the Government is foreclosed from raising the argument on appeal. <em>Cf. Canty, </em>570 F.3d at 1257 (\u201cThe Government is entitled to an opportunity to offer evidence and seek rulings from the sentencing court in support of an enhanced sentence. But, the Government is entitled to only one such opportunity, and it had that opportunity at the sentencing hearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Moore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is VACATED. This case is REMANDED with instructions that the District Court grant Moore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 relief and enter an order stating that Moore\u2019s sentence for his \u00a7 922(g) conviction is reduced to the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\">. A <em>pure-Begay </em>claim is one where a petitioner claims \"error[] in the application of the 'violent felony\u2019 enhancement, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), resulting in a higher statutory minimum and maximum sentence under \u00a7 924(e).\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 n. 20 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
