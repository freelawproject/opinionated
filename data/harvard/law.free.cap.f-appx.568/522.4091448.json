We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we grant the petition with respect to asylum and cancellation of removal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Contrary to the government\u2019s contention, Barragan\u2019s removability, asylum, and cancellation of removal claims have been exhausted. \u201c[Wlhen the BIA cites <em>Burbano </em>in its decision, all issues presented before the IJ are deemed to have been presented to the BIA.\u201d <em>Arreguin-Moreno v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 1229, 1232 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040-41 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc)). Here, Barragan raised his challenge to removability and his asylum and cancellation of removal claims before the IJ, and the BIA cited <em>Burbano. </em>All issues are therefore exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The IJ properly determined that Barragan was removable. Our precedent establishes that California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11379(a) is overbroad and divisible. <em>Coronado v. Holder, </em>747 F.3d 662, 2014 WL 983621, at *4 n. 3 (9th Cir.2014); <em>S-Yong v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1028, 1034 n. 5 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Hernandez-Aguilar v. Holder, </em>594 F.3d 1069, 1073 (9th Cir.2010). Thus, the IJ correctly used the modified categorical approach to determine whether the substance involved in Barragan\u2019s conviction was a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2284-85, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013); <em>Hemandez-Aguilar, </em>594 F.3d at 1073. Because Barragan\u2019s permissible conviction record established that the substance was methamphetamine, which is a controlled substance under the Act, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 scheds. 11(c), 111(a)(3), Barragan was removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The IJ based her determination that Barragan\u2019s proposed social groups were not legally cognizable on case law that predated and has been distinguished and overruled by our recent opinion in <em>Henri-quez-Rivas v. Holder, </em>707 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir.2013) (en banc), and by the BIA\u2019s recent opinions in <em>Matter of W-G-R-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 208 (BIA 2014), and <em>Matter of M-E-V-G-, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 227 (BIA 2014). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for consideration of Barra-gan\u2019s proposed social groups of government informants and individuals who resist gang recruitment under <em>Henriquez-Rivas, Matter of W-G-R-, </em>and <em>Matter of M-EV-G-.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Although we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary \u201cjudgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), we retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Barragan argues that the IJ failed to consider certain factors and the record as a whole in making her discretionary determination, we have jurisdiction to hear his claim. <em>Vilchez v. Holder, </em>682 F.3d 1195, 1200-01 (9th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>The IJ committed legal error in making her discretionary determination that Bar-ragan did not warrant cancellation of removal. The IJ considered impermissible evidence of Barragan\u2019s criminal history, failed to consider all relevant factors in relation to his criminal history, failed to comprehensively consider his family ties and character, and failed to consider his substantial service to the community as a DEA informant, all of which were relevant to this case. <em>Xiao Fei Zheng v. Holder, </em>644 F.3d 829, 833-34 (9th Cir.2011). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for consideration of all relevant factors and all record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We need not, and do not, reach any other issues urged by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Each party shall bear their own costs for this petition review.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">PETITION DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
