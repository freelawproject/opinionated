We assume familiarity with the facts and underlying proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint. <em>See Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001). Upon such review, we conclude, substantially for the reasons stated by the district court, that Annis\u2019s complaint about defendants\u2019 failure to prosecute persons tracking his thoughts through a mind-reading device \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). It was therefore properly dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>under <em>Neitzke v. Williams. </em>Even when read with the \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d due <em>pro se </em>pleadings, <em>Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted), Annis\u2019s allegations cannot support a plausible claim for relief in light of established precedent, <em>see Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992) (approving dismissal of complaint based on \u201cirrational or wholly incredible\u201d allegations); <em>accord Livingston v. Adirondack Beverage Co., </em>141 F.3d 434, 437 (2d Cir.1998) (explaining that dismissal is proper where complaint\u2019s factual allegations are the \u201cproduct of delusion or fanta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>sy\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). In addition, \u201ca private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.\u201d <em>Linda R. S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S. Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). Moreover, because there is no reason to think that a valid claim might be stated, the district court\u2019s denial of further leave to amend was appropriate. <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We have considered Annis\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
