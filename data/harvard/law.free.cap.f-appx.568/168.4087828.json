For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">In 2005, the District Court sentenced Schwartz to 225 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered that he pay over $1.3 million in restitution following his conviction for a host of fraud-related offenses. We affirmed that judgment on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Schwartz, </em>315 Fed.Appx. 412, 415, 420 (3d Cir.2009), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Thereafter, Schwartz moved the District Court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied \u00a7 2255 relief, and we subsequently denied Schwartz\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>C.A. No. 13-2131. He then moved this Court to (1) extend the time to file a petition for rehearing in that case, and (2) enter a stay in that case pending our en banc decision in <em>United States v. Flores-Mejia, </em>C.A. No. 12-3149, 531 Fed.Appx. 222. We granted those two requests in January 2014, and that case remains stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">On or about April 16, 2014, Schwartz sent a letter to the District Court, seeking an ex parte telephone hearing \u201cto assist in the [cjourt\u2019s obtaining custody and control of [certain] documentary evidence\u201d relating to his criminal case that allegedly was never turned over by the Government. Schwartz maintained that \u201c[w]e need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>get this evidence in the custody and control of the [c]ourt and then sort out the various acts of obstruction of justice and <em>Brady </em>violations once the evidence is secured.\u201d On April 22, 2014, the District Court, construing this latest request \u201cas a new application for permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion,\u201d denied that request without prejudice to Schwartz\u2019s ability to seek such permission in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Schwartz now petitions this Court for a writ of mandamus, arguing that the District Court\u2019s April 22, 2014 order \u201cis fraught with legal error,\u201d and that the District Court should be directed \u201cto convene a prompt hearing and take all steps necessary to take custody and control of [the aforementioned] evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">A writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy that is available in extraordinary circumstances only. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). To obtain mandamus relief, a petitioner must establish that \u201c(1) no other adequate means exist to attain the relief he desires, (2) the party\u2019s right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable, and (3) the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </em>558 U.S. 183, 190, 130 S.Ct. 705, 175 L.Ed.2d 657 (2010) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks \u2022 omitted). Mandamus is not a substitute for an appeal, and \u201ca writ of mandamus may not issue if a petitioner can obtain relief by appeal.\u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 77 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Schwartz\u2019s mandamus petition effectively argues that the District Court should have held the ex parte hearing that he requested instead of treating his request as seeking permission to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. But an appeal from the District Court\u2019s April 22, 2014 order provides an adequate means of potentially obtaining relief on that argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, although Schwartz claims that the alleged evidence at issue here \u201cface[s] spoliation,\u201d he does not provide support for that claim. In short, we cannot conclude that this case presents extraordinary circumstances warranting mandamus relief. Accordingly, we will deny Schwartz\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. In making this statement, we in no way decide whether that argument would, in fact, prevail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
