The order dismissed his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for withholding of removal and relief under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s legal determinations de novo, and factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Younes has not shown that he was persecuted in the past and does not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.1999). Younes has failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted were he to return to Tunisia. <em>Id.; </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). Likewise, Younes has failed to bring evidence showing that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured should he return to Tunisia. <em>Lanza v.
