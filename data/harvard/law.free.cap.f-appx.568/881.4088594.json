She contends: (1) that the district court erred in remanding this diversity case to the De-Kalb County Superior Court based upon defects in the removal procedure; and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees ($2,240.00) to First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company (the Plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">As to the first issue, a three judge panel of this court has entered an order dismissing this appeal of the remand order because this court lacks jurisdiction to review the order. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (\u201cAn order remanding a case to the State Court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal.\u201d). While this panel has the right to alter, amend or vacate this order under 11th Cir. R. 27-l(g), we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">As to the second issue, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in the fee award pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) because the court did not err in the conclusion that the removal was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The appeal of the remand order stands DISMISSED for lack of our jurisdiction to review it. The award of attorneys\u2019 fees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
