We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Newman pled guilty in 1997 to possession of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (1998), and was sentenced to 180 months in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When he was sentenced, the offense was punishable by not more than twenty years in prison, making it a Class C felony. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (1998). Upon revocation of release, Newman was subject to a term of imprisonment of not more than two years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1998). Following passage of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA), the offense became a Class A misdemeanor punishable by not more than one year in prison. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2012); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(6) (2012). A defendant convicted of a Class A misdemeanor whose supervised release is revoked is subject to a revocation sentence of not more than one year in prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Newman claims that he is entitled to benefit from the FSA, and his eighteen-month revocation sentence is illegal. When reviewing a revocation sentence, we consider whether it is within the statutory limits and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">We hold that Newman was properly sentenced under the law in effect at the time he was sentenced. First, the imposition of a new sentence upon revocation of supervised release relates back to the first offense for which the defendant was convicted, and the revocation sentence is limited \u201cto the duration of the term of supervised release originally imposed.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 701, 712, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Second, we have held that the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants originally sentenced prior to August 3, 2010. <em>United States v. Bullard, </em>645 F.3d 237, 248 (4th Cir.2011).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under these authorities, Newman\u2019s eighteen-month revocation sentence falls within the relevant statutory range.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">We therefore affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">. The sentence was reduced in 2008 to 150 months and in 2011 to sixty months based on amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Newman was released from prison in 2011 and subsequently violated terms of his release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-19\"><em>. Bullard, </em>is unaffected by <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). <em>Dorsey </em>applies to defendants who committed their offenses prior to, but were sentenced after, the effective date of the FSA. <em>Id. </em>at 2328-29. Newman committed his original offense and was sentenced before that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
