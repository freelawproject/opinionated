We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the incidents Luna-Ramirez experienced, including death threats, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2005) (record did not compel the finding that the incidents of harm petitioner suffered constituted past persecution). We reject Luna-Ramirez\u2019s contentions that the agency failed to consider evidence relevant to her claim of persecution. Further, as Luna-Ramirez has not established past persecution, she is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <em>See Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002). As Luna-Ramirez does not otherwise contend she has shown a well-founded fear of persecution, her asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-25\">In light of these conclusions, we do not reach Luna-Ramirez\u2019s other contentions or her request for judicial notice relating to her ability to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-26\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b519-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
