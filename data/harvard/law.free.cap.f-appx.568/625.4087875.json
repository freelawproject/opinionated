BALDOCK, United States Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b649-26\">Larry Don Wesley Maynard, an Oklahoma state prisoner appearing pro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court dismissed Maynard\u2019s petition as time-barred and denied his request for a certif\u00edcate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Although Maynard never filed a COA application with us, we construe his notice of appeal as a request for a COA. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 22(b)(2); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (No appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court\u201d unless the petitioner first obtains a COA.); <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 869 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 2253(c)(l)(A)\u2019s requirements apply when a state habeas petitioner is proceeding under \u00a7 2241). Because Maynard\u2019s appeal is clearly time-barred, we deny his application for a COA, and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In 1991, an Oklahoma jury convicted Maynard of \u201cShooting with Intent to Kill, After Former Conviction of Two Felonies,\u201d leading to a life sentence. <em>See Maynard v. Boone, </em>468 F.3d 665, 667-68 (10th Cir.2006). Maynard\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, which he filed in January 2013, argues the retroactive application of the 1998 amendment to Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 332.7, violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause and his right to due process. Maynard argues that prior to this amendment, parole consideration was annual, but under the amended version of \u00a7 332.7, he is considered for parole only every three years. He also claims his right to due process is being violated because he cannot address Oklahoma\u2019s Pardon and Parole Board personally. The district court denied Maynard\u2019s petition as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). This statute provides a 1-year statute of limitation, which began running in this case from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Maynard alleges in his habeas petition that he had his first parole review under the amended \u00a7 332.7, in violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, in April 1998. But Maynard did not file this petition until January 2013, almost 15 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Maynard raises three arguments for why his petition is nevertheless timely. All three arguments fail. First, Maynard argues \u201cthere should not be a statute of limitations on [his] habeas petition\u201d because he alleges an ongoing violation that occurs every time he is denied an annual parole review. Twenty-eight U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), however, does not contain any \u201congoing harm\u201d exception. Moreover, even if it could be said that a new claim for relief accrues every times Maynard is denied an annual parole hearing, Congress did not tie the statute of limitations in \u00a7 2244(d)(1) to the point at which a claim accrues. <em>Cf. Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1962, 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014) (interpreting 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(b), which provides for a three year statute of limitations from the date on which \u201cthe claim accrued\u201d). Rather, Congress tied the statute of limitations at issue to \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Here, Maynard knew or easily could have discovered the factual predicate of his claim\u2014that his parole consideration was now governed under the amended \u00a7 332.7\u2014after his first parole review under the amended \u00a7 332.7 in April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>1998. Even were we to say Maynard could not have discovered that the frequency of his parole reviews had changed until April 1999, after a year had gone by without another parole review, at most, this would have given Maynard until April 2000 to bring this petition under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Maynard next states in one conclusory sentence that he suffers \u201cfrom Mental Illness that is a legal disability.\u201d We take this as an argument that he is entitled to equitable tolling because he suffers from a mental illness. As the district court pointed out, however, we have applied equitable tolling to \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s statute of limitations \u201conly in rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>York v. Galetka, </em>314 F.3d 522, 527 (10th Cir.2003). Indeed, \u201c[e]quitable tolling of a limitations period based on mental incapacity is warranted only in \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 that may include an adjudication of incompetence, institutionalization for mental incapacity, or evidence that the individual is not \u2018capable of pursuing his own claim\u2019 because of mental incapacity.\u201d <em>Reupert v. Workman, </em>45 Fed.Appx. 852, 854 (10th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (quoting <em>Biester v. Midwest Health Serv., Inc., </em>77 F.3d 1264, 1268 (10th Cir.1996)). After careful review, the district court found below that \u201calthough [Maynard] was found incompetent to stand trial in 1988, he has provided no evidence, except his conclusory allegations, that his mental illness prevented him from filing a timely habeas petition. Therefore, equitable tolling is not justified.\u201d We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Finally, Maynard argues that \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d justifies tolling the statute of limitations. He claims he has evidence to show that Oklahoma authorities knew the amended \u00a7 332.7 violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause, and that these authorities conspired to hide this information from inmates and the public. The claim is utterly belied by our holding, over a decade ago, that the amended \u00a7 332.7 does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. <em>See Henderson v. Scott, </em>260 F.3d 1213, 1217 (10th Cir.2001); <em>see also Maynard v. Fallin, </em>564 Fed.Appx. 943, 2014 WL 1677982 (Apr. 29, 2014) (unpublished) (affirming the denial of Maynard\u2019s related 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim because \u00a7 332.7 does not violate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause and stating \u201cOur agreement with the district court\u2019s finding of no constitutional violation leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Mr. Maynard\u2019s \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim is not viable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">For the reasons set forth above, Maynard\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-5\">.
