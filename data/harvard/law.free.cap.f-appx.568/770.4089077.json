We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue of whether Connolly received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel allegedly forced him to enter a guilty plea. On appeal, Connolly argues that his attorney coerced him into pleading guilty by making \u201cthreats\u201d that he would receive a life sentence and never see his wife and child again if he did not plead guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2008). <em>Pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-20\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must establish two things: (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d meaning it \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To satisfy the deficient-performance prong, the defendant must show that counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. The defendant must rebut the strong presumption that his counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. A defendant may satisfy the prejudice prong by showing \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The Supreme Court has determined that a defendant\u2019s representations at a plea hearing \u201cconstitute a formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings.\u201d <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 1629, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977). This is because \u201c[sjolemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity. The subsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal, as are contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 97 S.Ct. at 1629. We have concluded that \u201c[w]hen a defendant pleads guilty relying upon his counsel\u2019s best professional judgment, he cannot later argue that his plea was due to coercion by counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Lagrone, </em>727 F.2d 1037, 1038 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Connolly\u2019s conclusory allegations of coercion by his attorney have failed to rebut the strong presumptions that his attorney\u2019s advice fell within the range of reasonable professional conduct and that Connolly\u2019s sworn statements in his plea agreement and at his change-of-plea hearing were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-17\">. Connolly also contends that the district court abused its discretion in summarily denying his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without an evidentiary hearing, but we decline to reach that issue because it is outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
