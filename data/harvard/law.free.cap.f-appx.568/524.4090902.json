We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and review for substantial evidence. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.2010). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-24\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the agency\u2019s discretionary holding that Lin\u2019s son will not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if Lin is removed to China. <em>De Mercado v. Mukasey, </em>566 F.3d 810, 815-16 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-25\">Lin waived any challenge to the agency\u2019s holding that her asylum application was untimely by not raising the issue in her brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-26\">Contrary to Lin\u2019s assertion, the adverse credibility finding is supported by the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ord. The agency\u2019s findings that Lin gave inconsistent, non-responsive testimony that lacked detail regarding the alleged instances of past persecution are supported by the record. The agency reasonably concluded that Lin would have mentioned her \u201cmost serious allegation of mistreatment,\u201d a forced abortion without anesthesia, in her first application. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 963 (9th Cir.2004). The record does not compel a contrary conclusion that Lin was credible. Nor does any other evidence compel the conclusion that Lin more likely than not will be persecuted or tortured if returned to China. <em>Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1039, 1048-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
