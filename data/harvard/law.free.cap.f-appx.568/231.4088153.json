We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Njogu devotes most of his appellate brief to the Board\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s July 18, 2013 decision denying relief and ordering him removed. We note that Njogu did not file a timely petition for review from the July 18, 2013 order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2012); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to review this order. We further note that Njogu does not attempt to challenge that part of the Board\u2019s September 27, 2013 order denying reconsideration. Accordingly, review is waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004) (failure to challenge the denial of relief results in abandoning review).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Insofar as Njogu challenges the denial of reopening, we have reviewed the record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that Njogu failed to present newly available evidence that would warrant reopening. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2013). We also find no error with the Board\u2019s disposition of Njogu\u2019s belated request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
