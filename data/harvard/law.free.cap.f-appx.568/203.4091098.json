We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">We review whether a district court erred in granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party. <em>Martin v. Lloyd, </em>700 F.3d 132, 135 (4th Cir.2012). A court must enter summary judgment \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">\u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe nonmoving party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact through mere speculation or the building of one inference upon another,\u201d <em>Othentec Ltd. v. Phelan, </em>526 F.3d 135, 140 (4th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotations omitted), and he cannot defeat summary judgment with merely a scintilla of evidence, <em>Am. Arms Int\u2019l v. Herbert, </em>563 F.3d 78, 82 (4th Cir.2009). Rather, he \u201cmust produce some evidence (more than a scintilla) upon which a jury could properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it, upon whom the onus of proof is imposed.\u201d <em>Othentec Ltd., </em>526 F.3d at 140 (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">\u201cSection 1981 guarantees to all persons in the United States \u2018the same right ... to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spriggs v. Diamond Auto. Glass, </em>165 F.3d 1015, 1017 (4th Cir.1999) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(a)). Section 1981 \u201ccan be violated only by purposeful discrimination,\u201d <em>Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass\u2019n v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982), and \u201cmust be founded on purposeful, racially discriminatory actions,\u201d <em>Spriggs, </em>165 F.3d at 1018. \u201c[T]o make out a claim for individual liability under \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff must demonstrate some affirmative link to causally connect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the actor with the discriminatory action,\u201d and the claim \u201cmust be predicated on the actor\u2019s personal involvement.\u201d <em>Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties, Inc., </em>223 F.3d 62, 75 (2d Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Defendants. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Hawthorne v. Va. State Univ., </em>No. 3:12-cv-00620-JAG-MHL (E.D.Va. Aug. 9, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-11\"> The district court previously dismissed Hawthorne\u2019s claims against Virginia State University based on sovereign immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
