King and Ta-han shared the Operations Manager position from August 2007 until they were terminated in the fall of 2009. King was pregnant at the time of her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The District Court assumed without deciding that King and Tahan established a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender and pregnancy discrimination. Ferguson proffered eight legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for King and Tahan\u2019s terminations, including: (1) the economic downturn affected its business and required labor cuts; (2) its Atlanta HVAC branch was too small in size and sales to pay King and Tahan\u2019s combined $75,000 salary; (3) King and Ta-han\u2019s supervisor, Jon Wallace, reasonably believed the job share role hindered productivity and continuity; (4) Wallace\u2019s supervisor, Ron Bullington, told Wallace that the Atlanta HVAC branch did not need someone performing operations tasks full-time, but needed a full-time person who could perform operations and sales; (5) King and Tahan were not interested in full-time employment; (6) King and Tahan did not have HVAC industry or product knowledge; (7) King and Tahan demonstrated that they did not have an interest in learning about the HVAC industry; and (8) King and Tahan\u2019s replacement, Chris Bair, had significant HVAC product knowledge and sales experience, was willing to work full-time for less pay, and had significant operational knowledge. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Ferguson because King and Tahan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>failed to show that Ferguson\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">On appeal, King and Tahan argue that they made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender and pregnancy discrimination. They argue that they have shown that each of Ferguson\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. Finally, they assert that they can survive summary judgment under <em>Smith v. Lockheed-Martin, </em>644 F.3d 1321 (11th Cir.2011), because they have presented a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by Ferguson. We are not persuaded and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We review the District Court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. <em>Burton v. City of Belle Glade, </em>178 F.3d 1175, 1187 (11th Cir.1999). In reviewing a summary judgment, we resolve all reasonable doubts relating to the facts in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, Fla., </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Title VII prohibits certain employees from \u201cdischarging] any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). The term \u201cbecause of sex\u201d in Title VII includes \u201cbecause of or on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k). We use the same analysis for claims of discrimination based on pregnancy as for claims of discrimination based on gender. <em>Armstrong v. Flowers Hosp., Inc., </em>33 F.3d 1308, 1312-13 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Where, as here, an employee bases her discrimination claim on circumstantial evidence, we generally apply the burden-shifting framework under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir.2008). Under this framework, the employee must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Id. </em>If the employee establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <em>Id. </em>If the employer does so, the employee must then show that the employer\u2019s stated reasons are a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>If the employer offers more than one legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, the plaintiff must rebut each reason. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1037 (11th Cir.2000). An employer\u2019s subjective reason for its business decision can also be a legally sufficient, legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <em>Id. </em>at 1033-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Rebuttal requires significant probative evidence of pretext; conclusory allegations alone are insufficient. <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996). The plaintiff can show pretext \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The plaintiff must identify \u201cweaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s rationale.\u201d <em>Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1055-56 (11th Cir.2012) (quotation omitted). However, we will not second guess the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>business judgment, and the employee cannot prevail by quarreling with the wisdom of a reason that might motivate a reasonable employer. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. The plaintiff must show that a proffered reason\u2014to amount to pretext\u2014is false, and that discrimination was the real reason for the adverse action. <em>Brooks v. Cnty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cnty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006). A plaintiff can do this by using the evidence relied on to establish the <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Holland, </em>677 F.3d at 1055-56. At this stage, the plaintiffs burden \u201cmerges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the plaintiff has been the victim of intentional discrimination.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1326 (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As an initial matter, the District Court assumed without deciding that King and Tahan had established a <em>prima facie </em>case and granted summary judgment in favor of Ferguson because King and Tahan failed to show pretext. Thus, although King and Tahan argue at length that they established a <em>prima facie </em>case, we assume that King and Tahan met this requirement. <em>See Chapter 7 Trustee v. Gate Gourmet, Inc., </em>683 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that, because it did not matter to the result, we will assume, as the district court did, that the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Here, Ferguson presented eight legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating King and Tahan, and although King and Tahan provided evidence to call into question some of Ferguson\u2019s proffered reasons, they failed to show that each of Ferguson\u2019s reasons were pretextual. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1037.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">King and Tahan assert that their evidence, taken together, and viewed in the light most favorable to them shows that they were terminated based on their gender and King\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework does not always apply in discrimination cases, and a plaintiff will survive summary judgment if she \u201cpresents circumstantial evidence that creates a triable issue concerning the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>644 F.3d at 1328. \u201cA triable issue of fact exists if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, presents a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by the decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Here, the District Court' concluded that <em>Smith </em>only provides an alternative way to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case rather than an alternative analytical framework to <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>but assumed without deciding that King and Tahan had established a <em>prima facie </em>case. Putting aside the question of whether this determination was correct, King and Tahan have failed to present a convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to infer intentional discrimination by Ferguson.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">. King and Tahan waived their argument that Ferguson\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual because they were \"concocted\u201d after the threat of litigation by not adequately raising this argument before the District Court. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., </em>43 F.3d 587, 598-99 (11th Cir.1995) (declining to consider an argument not raised at the district court level because it was not fairly presented to the district court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
