The district court dismissed the complaint, filed in July 2013, on the ground that her claims were barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the TILA one-year statute of limitations. On appeal, Barnes argues that the district court erred in using as the limitations period commencement date the date of the loan application, as opposed to the date of the consummation of the loan. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute of limitations. <em>Baker v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., </em>581 F.3d 1336, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). Dismissal on statute of limitations grounds is appropriate \u201cif it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time-barred.\u201d <em>La Grasta v. First Union Sec., Inc., </em>358 F.3d 840, 845 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">TILA requires that certain disclosures be provided to a consumer \u201cat the time the creditor distributes an application to establish an account.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637a(b)(l)(A). These disclosures include: (1) an example (based on a $10,000 principal balance) showing how long it will take to repay a loan if only the minimum payments are made, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637a(a)(9); and (2) and a pamphlet, or its equivalent, prepared by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, containing general information about home equity loans, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637a(e). TILA further provides that an action under it may be brought \u201cwithin one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">As a general rule, the statute of limitations clock begins to tick when the plaintiff first has a complete and present cause of action. <em>See Gabelli v. S.E.C., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1216, 1220, 185 L.Ed.2d 297 (2013) (\u201cThus the \u2018standard rule\u2019 is that a claim accrues \u2018when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 604, 610, 187 L.Ed.2d 529 (2013) (\u201cRecognizing that Congress generally sets statutory limitations periods to begin when their associated causes of action accrue, this Court has often construed statutes of limitations to commence when the plaintiff is permitted to file suit.\u201d). In other contexts, we\u2019ve discussed the \u201cdelayed discovery rule,\u201d which \u201cprevents a cause of action from accruing until the plaintiff either knows or reasonably should know of the act giving rise to the cause of action.\u201d <em>Trustmark Ins. Co. v. ESLU, Inc., </em>299 F.3d 1265, 1271 (11th Cir.2002). We\u2019ve also said, however, that \u201c[t]his discovery rule, which might be applicable to statutes of limitations in state tort actions, has no place in a proceeding to enforce a civil penalty under a federal statute. The statute of limitations begins with the violation itself\u2014it is upon violation, and not upon discovery of harm, that the claim is complete and the clock is ticking.\u201d <em>Trawinski v. United Tech., </em>313 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">Here, it is undisputed that Compass distributed an application to Barnes on June 6, 2012. The statute provides that Compass should have provided all necessary disclosures to Barnes on that date. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637a(b)(l)(A). Barnes alleges that Compass failed to give her two of those disclosures. Because Congress tied the \u00a7 1637a disclosures to the distribution of the loan application, and because Compass allegedly failed to distribute all necessary disclosures at that time, it seems clear to us that the statute of limitations should begin to run from the date of the credit application, which is also the date of Compass\u2019s violation. Moreover, even if we were to consider applying the delayed discovery rule, it would have no application here\u2014Barnes knew or reasonably should have known about the missing disclosures at the time she received the loan application, since this is not a situation in which Barnes had no means of knowing that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>had not received the disclosures. Barnes has also failed to make any showing that she is entitled to equitable tolling for her TILA claims. <em>See Ellis v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>160 F.3d 703, 706-08 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that equitable tolling is available for stale TILA claims but only if the plaintiff was prevented from bringing suit on those claims \u201cdue to inequitable circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Barnes relies on <em>Goldman v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago, </em>532 F.2d 10 (7th Cir.1976), to argue that the limitations period for open-ended lines of credit should be calculated \u201cfrom the date of the imposition of the first finance charge,\u201d and not from the date of the credit application. Specifically, <em>Goldman </em>held that when \u201cthere has been an incomplete, inaccurate or misleading disclosure, the limitations period should not be measured from the date the disclosure was required by law to be made, but instead by the date on which a finance charge was first imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\"><em>Goldman </em>does not apply here. Among other things, <em>Goldman </em>was expressly concerned with open-ended lines of credit and \u201cincomplete, inaccurate or misleading disclosures,\u201d which are not what is at issue in this ease. In explaining why it was choosing the date of the first finance charge, the <em>Goldman </em>court explained, \u201c[i]f no disclosure was made, of course, the debtor would be cognizant of that fact on the day the credit disclosure forms were given to him, but, Goldman argues that when there has been inaccurate, partial or misleading disclosure, there is no way, prior to the billing of an inconsistent finance charge, for the violation to be ascertained and action take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. <em>See also id. </em>at 19 (\u201cGoldman\u2019s observation that when the disclosure statement is false, incomplete or inaccurate, it is not until the imposition of the first finance charge that the debtor can perceive that a violation has occurred is irrefutable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Here, as we\u2019ve said, Barnes was aware, or should have been aware of the missing disclosures at the time of the loan application. As a result, the limitations period began ticking at that time. Because the district court properly calculated the beginning of the limitations period, and because Barnes filed suit over a year after that date, the district court did not err in dismissing the case as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
