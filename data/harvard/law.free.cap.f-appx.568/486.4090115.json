Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law. <em>Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 921 (9th Cir.2007). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-23\">Garcia-Castro\u2019s undisputed deportability for a controlled-substance violation under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(2)(B)\u00ae precludes us from considering his contention that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C); <em>Bermudez v. Holder, </em>586 F.3d 1167, 1169 (9th Cir.2009) (per cu-riam); <em>see also Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 998 n. 5 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Wjithdrawal of judicial review over final orders of deportation also withdraws jurisdiction from motions ... to reopen deportation proceedings for those aliens de-portable for having committed a crime enumerated in the statute.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>We retain jurisdiction to review questions of law and constitutional claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). But in light of the BIA\u2019s dispositive determination that Garcia-Castro\u2019s motion was untimely, the BIA did not need to address his arguments and evidence regarding prosecutorial discretion. <em>See Simeonov v. Ashcroft, </em>871 F.3d 532, 538 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cAs a general rule courts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
