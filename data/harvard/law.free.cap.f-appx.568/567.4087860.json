Accordingly, we DISMISS this appeal as moot, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Judd, </em>42 Fed.Appx. 140, 141 n. 1 (10th Cir.2002) (noting that a party\u2019s appeal was \u201crendered moot by his death\u201d), and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to vacate that portion of the judgment imposing the challenged condition of supervised release. <em>See United States v. DeMichael, </em>461 F.3d 414, 417 (3d Cir.2006) (remanding to the district court with instructions to effectively vacate (i.e., \u201cabate\u201d) only that element of the deceased defendant\u2019s sentence challenged on appeal); <em>United States v. Butler, </em>48 FedAppx. 630, 631 (9th Cir. 2002) (vacating sentence but not conviction where the deceased defendant had appealed only his sentence). A copy of this order shall stand as and for the mandate of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
