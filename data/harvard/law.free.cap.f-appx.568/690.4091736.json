The district court dismissed nineteen of Corbett\u2019s claims and subsequently granted the defendants summary judgment on the remaining two claims. Corbett, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal and summary judgment orders. After careful review of the briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">I. 2011 AIRPORT SCREENING</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">This case involves the TSA\u2019s airport security screening of Corbett.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">A. The Screening of Corbett</p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">On August 27, 2011, Corbett went to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (the \u201cairport\u201d) operated by defendant Broward County. Before boarding commercial flights at U.S. airports, all passengers must submit to screening of their persons and luggage at a security checkpoint. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">To board his commercial flight, Corbett proceeded to a security checkpoint operated by defendant TSA. Corbett had two pieces of carry-on baggage\u2014\u201can average-sized backpack\u201d and \u201ca small plastic bag of books.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Corbett placed his carry-on bags on the x-ray conveyor belt for screening. Corbett was asked to go through the full-body scanner, and he declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>A TSA employee (a \u201cscreener\u201d) then informed Corbett that he would instead be screened through the use of a manual \u201cpat-down.\u201d The TSA screener explained how the pat-down worked. The screener would run the back of his hand along Corbett\u2019s buttocks. The screener would place one hand on Corbett\u2019s inner-thigh, the other hand on Corbett\u2019s hip, and slide the hand on the inner-thigh up until meeting resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Corbett refused to permit the TSA screener to conduct the standard pat-down and further stated the TSA screener could \u201cnot touch his genitals or buttocks\u201d during the pat-down. The TSA screener told Corbett that his refusal to consent to the standard pat-down screening was \u201ca problem\u201d and summoned a supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">To the supervisor, Corbett reiterated his demand that he not be touched on his buttocks or genitals, and the supervisor called the non-uniformed TSA manager, defendant Alejandro Chamizo, who came to the security checkpoint. Corbett alleged that defendant Chamizo warned Cor-bett \u201cthat if he did not consent [to having his genitals and buttocks touched], he would be forcibly searched\u201d and \u201cwould be arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">B. The Screening of Corbett\u2019s Carry-on Bags</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">As Corbett was speaking with the TSA supervisor and defendant Chamizo, TSA screeners manually screened the two carry-on bags that Corbett had placed on the x-ray conveyor belt. The screeners did so pursuant to TSA Management Directive 100.4, which authorizes screening of \u201call contents of accessible property, including, but not limited to, containers, compartments, and envelopes\u201d and notes that screening \u201cmay be conducted for the purpose of finding threat items or identification media, as appropriate.\u201d The TSA screeners removed two items from the bags and examined them more closely. The two items were: (1) \u201ca small stack of credit cards, IDs, and other plastic cards\u201d; and (2) a book.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The screener examined the credit and identification cards because TSA Management Directive 100.4 notes that, once screening at a security checkpoint begins, a TSA screener \u201cmay screen an individual\u2019s accessible property for identification media\u201d to \u201cre-verify that the individual\u2019s identity has been matched against government watch lists.\u201d In a sworn declaration, the TSA official who oversaw screening at the airport noted that \u201cwhere identification media are found in a passenger\u2019s carry-on baggage, they are inspected to ensure that the passenger does not use a different name than the name that was submitted for vetting.... A passenger with identification media in more than one name may be attempting to circumvent the ... watch-list matching program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Corbett \u201cverbally objected to the screen-er\u2019s review of his credit cards,\u201d and the TSA screener informed Corbett that he \u201cwas just making sure the names matched,\u201d as required by the TSA Management Directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Corbett also complained that the TSA screener \u201cbegan to look through the pages of\u2019 one of Corbett\u2019s books. The TSA security director stated that inspection of a book\u2019s pages is necessary because \u201cbooks may be used to conceal prohibited or other potentially dangerous items.\u201d Corbett verbally objected to the review of his book, and the TSA screener told him that the screening of the book was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">In his complaint, Corbett did not allege that defendant Chamizo: (1) personally participated in the inspections of Corbett\u2019s carry-on bags or the items therein; or (2) gave any verbal instructions to the screen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ers on how to conduct their inspections of Corbett\u2019s bags. Rather, Corbett\u2019s only allegation linking Chamizo to the screening of Corbett\u2019s bags and items therein was the following: \u201cCHAMIZO was the \u2018officer\u2019-in-charge on the scene and approved of the searches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">C. The Sheriffs Background Check of Coi'bett</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">During these events, a TSA manager summoned an officer from the defendant Sheriffs Office. The manager did so pursuant to the TSA\u2019s standard operating procedures, which provide that \u201cif the screening of a passenger or his or her property cannot be completed, law enforcement must be summoned to resolve the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">After the Sheriffs officer arrived, defendant Chamizo gave the officer a copy of Corbett\u2019s driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chamizo gave the driver\u2019s license copy to the officer because \u201cTSA screening procedures require that law enforcement personnel be notified when a passenger declines to complete screening, and that certain checks be run using the passenger\u2019s information.\u201d Accordingly, the Sheriffs officer conducted a check for outstanding warrants and other background information. The check of Corbett\u2019s background \u201ccame back clear.\u201d Corbett alleged that the entire checkpoint process lasted approximately an hour from start to finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Because Corbett would not consent to the manual pat-down to complete the screening, Corbett was denied access to his gate and the Sheriffs officer escorted Corbett out of the security checkpoint area. The TSA security director noted in a sworn declaration that a pat-down is \u201cthe last available form of screening\u201d and an individual who refuses to consent to a pat-down, like Corbett, \u201ccannot be cleared\u201d to proceed to his gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Corbett took his two carry-on bags and driver\u2019s license, and does not allege that the TSA employees withheld any items.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">As discussed later, Corbett claimed that these acts violated his federal and state rights: (1) the detention of Corbett for approximately an hour while the TSA employees attempted to conduct a pat-down screening, screened his two carry-on bags, called a law enforcement officer, and awaited the results of a background check; (2) the inspection of his carry-on bags and two items therein; and (3) the copying of Corbett\u2019s driver\u2019s license and boarding pass, and the transfer of the driver\u2019s license copy to the Sheriffs officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">II. CORBETT\u2019S RECORD REQUESTS</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">A. Corbett\u2019s FOIA Request</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">In September 2011, Corbett sent to the TSA a request for documents and videos of the August 27, 2011 airport screening, under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">Corbett requested these documents: (1) \u201c[a]ny notes taken by any employees of [the TSA] relating to [the 2011 airport] incident\u201d; (2) \u201c[a]ny incident reports, emails, or other documentation created as a result of this incident\u201d; (3) \u201c[a]ny correspondence between [the TSA] and any other party as a result of this incident\u201d; and (4) \u201c[a]ny audio, video, and[/]or photographic records taken on August 27th between 3:45 AM and 5:15 AM at or around the TSA checkpoint in front of the ... \u2018E gates\u2019 (U.S. Airways).\u201d Corbett specified: \u201c[t]his must include all camera views that contain any part of this checkpoint, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>as the camera that monitors the sterile area\u2019s exit (adjacent to the checkpoint).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The TSA referred Corbett\u2019s FOIA request to airport officials who \u201cperformed a manual search for records.\u201d The TSA produced 29 pages of documents, including: (1) incident reports; (2) statements from TSA employees participating in or witnessing the screening; (3) a copy of Corbett\u2019s boarding pass; (4) handwritten notes; and (5) a TSA inspector\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The TSA also sent Corbett videos of the screening, but, before doing so, obscured the faces of the TSA employees, the Sheriff\u2019s officer, and other passengers in the airport security checkpoint area. The TSA also redacted the printed names of TSA employees and the Sheriffs officer. The TSA made these redactions pursuant to FOIA Exemption 6, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6), and, as to the name of the Sheriffs officer, also pursuant to Exemption 7(C), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(7)(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Corbett filed an administrative appeal challenging all redactions. The TSA denied Corbett\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">A. Corbett\u2019s Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">In March 2012, plaintiff Corbett filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint against defendants the TSA, the United States, Chamizo, and Broward County. In May 2012, .Corbett filed an amended complaint (the \u201camended complaint\u201d), adding the Sheriffs Office as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-16\">Corbett\u2019s amended complaint asserted twenty-one claims, including, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) claims against TSA manager Chamizo, in his individual capacity, under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that Chamizo violated Corbett\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights; (2) tort claims against the United States, based on its waiver of sovereign immunity in the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); (3) claims against the TSA under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a; and (4) a claim against the TSA for unredacted records under FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">B. Rule 12(b) Dismissal and Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b719-18\">Each of the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b). On November 16, 2012, the district court granted the motions as to all claims other than the claims for unre-dacted records under FOIA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>After discovery on the FOIA claim, the TSA filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion in favor of the TSA, thus disposing of all of Corbett\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Corbett timely filed a notice of appeal. We construe Corbett\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal as covering the district court\u2019s orders on the motions to dismiss and the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">IV. THE <em>BIVENS </em>CLAIMS AGAINST DEFENDANT CHAMIZO</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We first address the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of Corbett\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims against defendant Chamizo based on the 2011 airport screening.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">A. Qualified Immunity Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">\u201cQualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from suits in their individual capacities unless their conduct violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Andujar v. Rodriguez, </em>486 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Here, undisputedly, defendant Chamizo was engaged in discretionary functions during the 2011 airport screening. Therefore, we examine: (1) whether the facts alleged, accepted as true and viewed in the light most favorable to Corbett, show that Chamizo\u2019s conduct violated one of Cor-bett\u2019s federal constitutional rights; and if so, (2) whether that right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the 2011 airport screening. <em>See Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 377, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">To analyze these questions, we review the law regarding airport screening.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">B. Screening at Airport Security Checkpoints</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">The Fourth Amendment protects individuals \u201cagainst unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV, and a search conducted without a warrant is <em>\u201cper se </em>unreasonable subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>890 F.2d 355, 360 (11th Cir.1989) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). One exception to the warrant requirement is for suspicionless searches conducted pursuant to administrative programs, such as security screenings of airport passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-14\">Congress explicitly requires \u201cthe screening of all passengers and property ... that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901(a). The Supreme Court has instructed that the suspicionless screenings conducted at airport security checkpoints pursuant to this statute fall under the administrative search exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>See Chandler v. Miller, </em>520 U.S. 305, 323, 117 S.Ct. 1295, 1305, 137 L.Ed.2d 513 (1997) (\u201c[W]here the risk to public safety is substantial and real, blanket suspicionless searches calibrated to the risk may rank as \u2018reasonable\u2019\u2014for example, searches now routine at airports....\u201d); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab, </em>489 U.S. 656, 674-75 &amp; n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 1395 &amp; n. 3, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989) (providing as an example of a suspicionless search that may qualify as reasonable \u201cthe Federal Government\u2019s practice of requiring the search of all passengers seeking to board commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>cial airliners, as well as the search of their carry-on luggage, without any basis for suspecting any particular passenger of an untoward motive\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In short, airport security screenings are generally \u201cpermissible administrative search[es] under the Fourth Amendment, even though [they are] initiated without individualized suspicion and [are] conducted without a warrant.\u201d <em>See George v. Re-Mel, </em>738 F.3d 562, 577 (3d Cir.2013). \u201c[Screening passengers at an airport is an \u2018administrative search\u2019 because the primary goal is not to determine whether any passenger has committed a crime but rather to protect the public from a terrorist attack.\u201d <em>Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>653 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C.Cir.2011). \u201c[T]hose presenting themselves at a[n] [airport] security checkpoint thereby consent to a search, and may not revoke that consent if the authorities elect to conduct a search.\u201d <em>United States v. Herzbrun, </em>723 F.2d 773, 776 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">With these legal principles in mind, we turn to Corbett\u2019s claims against defendant Chamizo.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">C. The Screening of Corbett\u2019s Bags, Cards, and Book</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">It is well established in this Circuit that supervisory officials, such as defendant Chamizo, are \u201cnot liable under <em>Bivens </em>for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of respondeat superior or vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1234 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). Thus, to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim based on supervisory liability against defendant Chamizo, Corbett must allege that supervisor Cha-mizo \u201cpersonally participated in the alleged unconstitutional conduct or that there is a causal connection between the actions of a supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Franklin v. Curry, </em>738 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Corbett, however, did not allege that defendant Chamizo personally opened any bags, inspected the bags\u2019 contents, or verbally directed the TSA employees to do any specific conduct. Corbett alleged only that Chamizo \u201cwas the \u2018officer\u2019-in-charge on the scene and approved of the searches.\u201d Such \u201cvague and conclusory allegations\u201d do not establish a causal connection between a supervisor and unlawful activity. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>325 F.3d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Alternatively, even if this allegation was arguably sufficient, the search of Corbett\u2019s bags and contents did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Here, the TSA screeners were authorized, and indeed required, to inspect Corbett\u2019s carry-on bags and the items contained therein. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901. Further, by the time the TSA employees inspected Corbett\u2019s bags, Corbett had refused to allow the TSA employees to fully screen his person\u2014either through use of a full-body scanner or the standard pat-down procedure. A reasonable TSA employee, at that point, could have suspected that Corbett\u2019s refusals resulted from his desire to conceal unlawful activity. <em>See Herzbrun, </em>723 F.2d at 777 (stating that, \u201cin deciding the lawfulness of a[n] [airport security] search, a court should focus on the reasonableness of the investigating officer\u2019s actions .... on the basis of the articulable facts at hand\u201d to determine whether the officer \u201chad reason to suspect that the defendant was carrying materials that could endanger the safety of a flight\u201d). Thus, a thorough screening of Corbett\u2019s bags was reasonable, even beyond the point of determining whether those belongings contained weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">As the TSA security director pointed out, when TSA screeners find identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>tion cards in a passenger\u2019s carry-on luggage, they must inspect those cards \u201cto ensure that the passenger does not use a different name than the name that was submitted for vetting.\u201d A passenger\u2019s use of multiple names could indicate that the passenger is trying to circumvent the TSA\u2019s security measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">We recognize that Corbett\u2019s amended complaint alleged that a TSA screener looked through the pages of one of Cor-bett\u2019s books \u201cin a manner that was not to determine if [weapons, explosives, or other incendiary devices] were somehow hidden within the book, but rather to inspect the text of the book.\u201d It was not unreasonable for a TSA screener to closely inspect Cor-bett\u2019s book, though, because \u201cthin, flat explosives called \u2018sheet explosives\u2019 may be disguised as a simple piece of paper or cardboard, and may be hidden in just about anything, including a laptop, book, magazine, deck of cards, or packet of photographs.\u201d <em>United States v. McCarty, </em>648 F.3d 820, 825 (9th Cir.2011). Furthermore, a TSA screener could have reasonably factored the contents of a book possessed by a passenger into the totality of the circumstances relevant in determining whether the passenger presented a security threat. <em>See George, </em>738 F.3d at 585-86 (noting that the facts that an individual carried a book critical of American foreign policy in the Middle East and Arabic flashcards were circumstances which \u201craised the possibility that [the individual] might pose a threat to airline security\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">For all of these reasons, Corbett\u2019s allegations about the search of his bags and the items therein failed to state a Fourth Amendment claim against defendant Cha-mizo individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">D. Detention of Corbett</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">We also affirm the dismissal of Corbett\u2019s detention claim against defendant Chamizo. Corbett consented to a screening of his person by presenting himself at the security checkpoint. Corbett could not revoke this consent by merely leaving the checkpoint. <em>See Herzbrun, </em>723 F.2d at 776 (observing that a rule allowing an individual to revoke his consent to an airport security screening by leaving the airport security checkpoint \u201cconstitute a one-way street for the benefit of a party planning airport mischief, since there is no guarantee that if he were allowed to leave he might not return and be more successful\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">We recognize that the entire security checkpoint screening lasted approximately one hour. Yet, accepting the alleged facts as true, Corbett was primarily to blame for that screening lasting as long as it did. If Corbett had permitted the TSA screeners to conduct a full pat-down screening, he would have swiftly proceeded to his gate. Although a seizure may become \u201cunlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete [its lawful] mission,\u201d <em>see Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 407, 125 S.Ct. 834, 837, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005), we cannot say that the time here, given all the factual circumstances, was unreasonable for the TSA employees to satisfy themselves that Corbett did not pose a security threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Y. THE TORT CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">We turn to Corbett\u2019s tort claims for assault, false arrest, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cemotional distress\u201d), against the United States. The district court dismissed these claims under Rule 12(b)(1) as barred by sovereign immunity, but Corbett contends the FTCA\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity applies to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">A. The FTCA\u2019s Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Sovereign immunity protects the federal government and its agencies from civil liability. <em>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1000, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). The FTCA in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for tort claims. <em>Motta ex rel. A.M. v. United States, </em>717 F.3d 840, 843 (11th Cir.2013). That statute confers on federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims against the United States for money damages <em>\u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission </em>of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u2022 1346(b)(1) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The first problem for Corbett is that this limited waiver of sovereign immunity in \u00a7 1346(b)(1) does not apply to claims based on <em>intentional torts </em>of federal employees. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). Specifically, \u00a7 2680(h), also an FTCA provision, states that the United States does not waive sovereign immunity as to \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2680(h). This part of the FTCA is known as the \u201cintentional torts exception\u201d to the waiver in \u00a7 1346(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Importantly, this intentional torts exception in \u00a7 2680(h) is \u201cnot limited to the torts specifically named therein, but rather encompasses situations where the underlying governmental conduct which constitutes an excepted cause of action is essential to the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>OFerrell v. United States, </em>253 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Two of Corbett\u2019s intentional tort claims\u2014assault and false arrest\u2014are specifically named in \u00a7 2680(h), and thus sovereign immunity is not waived as to those claims. His other intentional tort claims\u2014 invasion of privacy and emotional distress\u2014are based on the same underlying governmental conduct as Corbett\u2019s excepted claims for assault and false arrest. For example, the amended complaint alleged that the TSA screeners invaded Corbett\u2019s privacy by \u201csurround[ing] CORBETT with uniforms,\u201d \u201cdumpling] CORBETT\u2019s belongings out on a table,\u201d and examining those items. Similarly, Corbett\u2019s amended complaint stated that the TSA screeners detained him at the airport security checkpoint and subjected him to \u201cunlawful seizure,\u201d which caused him to experience \u201cserious emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Because Corbett\u2019s invasion of privacy and emotional distress claims are based on the same underlying conduct as his assault and false arrest claims, they are likewise subject to the intentional torts exception to the sovereign immunity waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 1265 (noting that claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and intrusion upon privacy were barred when they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u201cderivative from plaintiffs underlying contention that he had been the victim of a false arrest\u201d and \u201c \u2018false arrest\u2019 is one of the tort claims barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">B. The Law Enforcement Officer Proviso</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We do not stop there, though, because there is also a statutory exception\u2014 termed the \u201claw enforcement proviso\u201d\u2014to the statutory intentional torts exception to the sovereign immunity waiver. Immediately after stating that sovereign immunity is not waived with regard to certain intentional tort claims, \u00a7 2680(h) states: <em>\u201cProvided, </em>That, with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement <em>officers of the United States Government, </em>the provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall apply to any claim arising ... out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, or malicious prosecution.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) (second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, the sovereign immunity waiver applies to the intentional tort claims here if the TSA employees involved were \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 2680(h) defines \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d to mean \u201cany <em>officer of the United States </em>who is empowered by law to <em>execute searches, </em>to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Several courts have concluded that TSA screeners perform consensual, pre-board-ing administrative searches for certain prohibited items (i.e., knives, firearms, liquids, gels, etc.), not traditional law enforcement functions such as making arrests and executing searches for violations of federal law, although their reasoning has varied. <em>See Pellegrino v. U.S. Transp. Sec. Admin., </em>No. 09-5505, 2014 WL 1489939, at *5-8 (E.D.Pa. Apr. 16, 2014) (concluding that the phrase \u201csearches ... for violations of Federal law\u201d is ambiguous and determining that an analysis of the FTCA\u2019s legislative history \u201cstrongly suggests that the law enforcement proviso was enacted as a response to specific egregious behavior during raids conducted by federal law enforcement officers, and was not intended to be expansive enough to cover airport security screeners\u201d (omission in original)); <em>Walcott v. United States, </em>No. 13-CV-3303, 2013 WL 5708044, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2013) (concluding that \u201cthe meaning of \u2018empowered by law to execute searches ... for violations of Federal law' under \u00a7 2680(h) is narrower than the meaning of a \u2018search\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment\u2014that is, just because something is an administrative search under the Fourth Amendment, it doesn\u2019t mean the person doing the search is a law enforcement officer under \u00a7 2680(h)\u201d (omission added)); <em>Weinraub v. United States, </em>927 F.Supp.2d 258, 263 (E.D.N.C.2012) (observing that TSA screeners\u2019 power \u201cis limited to pre-boarding searches for certain prohibited items,\u201d and concluding that \u201cit would be unreasonable to interpret \u2018to execute searches\u2019 to include the TSA screen-er\u2019s performance of narrowly focused, consensual searches that are administrative in nature, when considered in light of the other traditional law enforcement functions (i.e., seizure of evidence and arrest) that Congress chose to define \u2018investigative or law enforcement officers\u2019 \u201d); <em>Coulter v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>No. 07-4894(JAG), 2008 WL 4416454, at *7-9 (D.N.J. Sept. 24, 2008) (TSA screeners are not law enforcement officers because, <em>inter alia, </em>the statute authorizing airport security screening \u201cdoes not include language referencing the power of an airport securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ty screener to perform searches\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">We need not resolve this thorny \u201csearch\u201d issue. The TSA screeners are not subject to the law enforcement proviso for a simpler reason\u2014they are not \u201cofficers of the United States Government,\u201d as required by \u00a7 2680(h)\u2019s statutory language. The FTCA draws a distinction between a \u201cfederal employee\u201d and an \u201cofficer of the United States.\u201d Specifically, the FTCA waives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity for tort claims based on the acts or omissions of \u201cany <em>employee of the Government </em>while acting within the scope of his office or employment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1) (emphasis added). Likewise, \u00a7 2680, the statute providing exceptions to the FTCA\u2019s sovereign immunity waiver, refers to \u201can act or omission of an <em>employee of the Government.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 2680(a) (emphasis added). The law enforcement proviso in \u00a7 2680(h), however, uses the term \u201cofficer of the United States,\u201d rather than \u201cemployee,\u201d as is used elsewhere in the FTCA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2680(h). This variation in language is not insignificant and shows that the law enforcement proviso applies only when the person, whose conduct is at issue, is an \u201cofficer of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Further, the federal statutes governing airport security screening differentiate between federal employees of TSA and law enforcement officers. Significantly, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901 states that \u201cscreening ... shall be carried out by a Federal Government employee.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901(a). Congress, however, explicitly authorized the TSA Administrator to \u201cdesignate an employee of the [TSA] or other Federal agency to serve as a law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 114(p)(l). Only after being so designated may the TSA employee: (1) \u201ccarry a firearm\u201d; (2) \u201cmake an arrest ... for any offense against the United States\u201d; or (3) \u201cseek and execute warrants for arrest or seizure of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 114(p)(2)(A)-(C). The TSA Administrator thus must affirmatively act to make a TSA employee an \u201cofficer.\u201d Merely being a TSA employee does not make one an \u201cofficer of the United States Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">These provisions show that, within TSA, there are: (1) federal employees, who conduct airport security screening; and (2) law enforcement officers, who perform various law enforcement functions. The TSA screeners here are the first type\u2014federal employees conducting airport security screening. Nothing in the record in this particular case shows that the TSA employees who screened Corbett had been specially designated as officers under \u00a7 114(p). In fact, in Corbett\u2019s discussion of the separate FOIA issue in this appeal, Corbett\u2019s brief actually admits that \u201cthe TSA is not a law enforcement agency.\u201d Because the TSA screeners here are federal employees, the law enforcement proviso regarding \u201cofficers of the United States\u201d is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">Therefore, the intentional torts exception does apply, and sovereign immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>bars Corbett\u2019s intentional tort claims against the United States, which included claims for assault, false arrest, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of those tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">VI. THE PRIVACY ACT CLAIMS AGAINST THE TSA</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The district court also did not err in dismissing Corbett\u2019s Privacy Act claims. The TSA is subject to the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements for federal agency record-keeping. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(e)(l)-(12). The basis for Corbett\u2019s claims is that TSA\u2019s Chamizo, at the security checkpoint, photocopied Corbett\u2019s driver\u2019s license and boarding pass without first complying with the Privacy Act\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">To prevail on a Privacy Act claim under \u00a7 552a(g)(4), an individual must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that he suffered actual damages. <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>628 F.3d 1371, 1381 (11th Cir.2010). The Privacy Act does not allow for recovery of non-pecuniary damages stemming from \u201closs of reputation, shame, mortification, injury to the feelings and the like.\u201d <em>Fed. Aviation Admin, v. Cooper, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 1451, 182 L.Ed.2d 497 (2012) (quotation marks omitted) (construing \u00a7 552a(g)(4)). We need not evaluate whether Corbett stated a Privacy Act violation because he alleged no pecuniary loss or actual damages as a result of a Privacy Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Alternatively, Corbett contends that the district court should have liberally construed his Privacy Act claims as requests for an injunction ordering the TSA \u201cto amend\u201d its records by destroying the copies of Corbett\u2019s driver\u2019s license and boarding pass. The Privacy Act does provide for injunctive relief in the form of ordering an agency to: (1) \u201camend the individual\u2019s record in accordance with his request or in such other way as the court may direct\u201d; or (2) produce to the individual \u201cany agency records improperly withheld from him.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7' 552a(g)(2)-(3). Corbett\u2019s injunction claim, however, fails because an individual must file with an agency a formal request for an amendment or disclosure of records <em>before </em>seeking an injunction. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 552a(d)(l), (d)(2). Corbett did not allege that he made such a request. Thus, he is not entitled to injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">VII. THE FOIA CLAIM AGAINST TSA</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">The next issue is whether the district court properly granted the TSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Corbett\u2019s FOIA claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">A. FOIA Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">Under FOIA, a government agency must disclose to the public requested documents unless they fall within one of the nine statutory exemptions. <em>Moye, O\u2019Brien, O\u2019Rourke, Hogan, &amp; Pickert v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>376 F.3d 1270, 1276 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a). An agency may redact portions of material from requested records. <em>See U.S. Dep\u2019t of State v. Ray, </em>502 U.S. 164, 173, 112 S.Ct. 541, 547, 116 L.Ed.2d 526 (1991). The agency has the burden of showing that a FOIA exemption supports its withholding a document or making re-dactions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">Here, the TSA produced documents and videos, but redacted: (1) the names of the TSA employees and Sheriffs officer; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>(2) the faces of all individuals in the videos. The TSA relied on Exemption 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">B. FOIA Exemption 6</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Exemption 6 provides that an agency need not disclose \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). To determine whether Exemption 6 applies, we ask: (1) whether the withheld material was within \u201cpersonnel, medical, or similar files\u201d; and, if so, (2) whether \u201ca balancing of individual privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure reveals that disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d <em>News-Press v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>489 F.3d 1173, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">FOIA does not provide a definition of the term \u201csimilar files.\u201d In <em>U.S. Department of State v. Washington Post Co., </em>456 U.S. 595, 102 S.Ct. 1957, 72 L.Ed.2d 358 (1982), the Supreme Court instructed that \u201cthe phrase \u2018similar files\u2019 was to have a broad, rather than a narrow, meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600,102 S.Ct. at 1961. Exemption 6 is not limited to \u201ca narrow class of files containing only a discrete kind of personal information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602,102 S.Ct. at 1961. Instead, the exemption applies to \u201cdetailed Government records on an individual which can be identified as applying to that individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Congress\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose in enacting Exemption 6 was to protect individuals from the injury and embarrassment that can result from the unnecessary disclosure of personal information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 102 S.Ct. at 1960. In light of this purpose, the Supreme Court determined that Congress intended that \u201cthe balancing of private against public interests, not the nature of the files in which the information was contained, should limit the scope of the exemption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Further, an agency\u2019s investigative reports constitute \u201csimilar files\u201d for purposes of Exemption 6. <em>See Forest Serv. Emps. for Envtl. Ethics v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>524 F.3d 1021, 1023-24 (9th Cir.2008) (based on the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Washington Post </em>opinion, the court had \u201clittle difficulty in concluding that the names and identifying information contained in [an agency report of an investigation into a fatal forest fire] me[t] the \u2018similar file\u2019 requirement of Exemption 6\u201d); <em>Wood v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, </em>432 F.3d 78, 86 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cExemption 6 applies to any personal information contained in files similar to personnel or medical files, such as administrative investigative records.\u201d); see also <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Food &amp; Drug Admin., </em>449 F.3d 141, 152-53 (D.C.Cir.2006) (an agency\u2019s redactions of names from records of the approval process for a drug was permissible under Exemption 6 because the statute exempts \u201cnot just files, but also bits of personal information, such as names and addresses, the release of which would create a palpable threat to privacy\u201d (quotation marks and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Our circuit has applied Exemption 6 in several cases. In <em>Federal Labor Relations Authority (F.L.R.A.) v. U.S. Department of Defense, </em>977 F.2d 545 (11th Cir.1992), this Court held that the Defense Department\u2019s disclosure of a list of names and addresses of non-union federal employees within a relevant bargaining unit would result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and withholding was allowed under Exemption 6. <em>Id. </em>at 547-50. We noted that \u201cemployee addresses say nothing about a federal agency\u2019s character or function\u201d and therefore \u201cthe public interest side of the balance\u201d carried little weight. <em>Id. </em>at 548. We rejected as overly tenuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>any suggestion that the public had an interest in being able to contact \u201cfederal employees to learn something about the government\u201d when there was no allegation that the government was operating irregularly. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, we recognized strong privacy interests in one\u2019s address, as \u201can address.... is an indicator of one\u2019s choice of neighborhoods and one\u2019s affluence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548^49. Therefore, we held that the privacy interests clearly outweighed the public interests in disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 549-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Next, in <em>Office of the Capital Collateral Counsel v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>331 F.3d 799 (11th Cir.2003), this Court concluded that, under Exemption 6, the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) could withhold certain documents pertaining to internal disciplinary proceedings against a former Assistant U.S. Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 801-02, 804. We noted that \u201c[t]he fact that [the AUSA] was a public official ... [did] not render her interest in preserving her personal privacy without weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 803. The AUSA\u2019s privacy interest was significant, as the documents reflected \u201cher private thoughts and feelings concerning her misconduct ... and its effect on her, her family, and her career.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And there was \u201calready substantial information available to the public about [the AUSA\u2019s] misconduct and her subsequent sanctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804. This already-public information satisfied the public interest in knowing about how the DOJ responded to the misconduct, and the AUSA\u2019s personal reflections about her misconduct were \u201cnot relevant to the public interest in knowing what the government is doing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In <em>News-Press v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, </em>this Court permitted the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) to redact from documents the names of individuals who applied for federal disaster relief funds after four hurricanes struck Florida. 489 F.3d at 1177-79, 1205. However, we required the DHS to disclose the applicants\u2019 addresses. <em>Id. </em>at 1205. This Court observed that the three news organizations did not articulate a \u201cterribly strong\u201d public interest in disclosure of the names. <em>Id. </em>at 1185, 1205. Further, withholding the names would \u201csubstantially reduce the potential for negative secondary effects of disclosing the addresses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">C. Applying Exemption 6 Here</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Under the particular facts here, we conclude Exemption 6 permitted the limited redactions the TSA made. The TSA produced its full investigative files, including incident reports, witness statements, and videos. The TSA protected only names in the documents and faces on the videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The TSA\u2019s documents and videos describe in full detail every aspect of the events at issue and the TSA\u2019s response to those events. Disclosure of the names of the individuals in those documents, or faces of the individuals, would not add to a reader\u2019s or viewer\u2019s understanding of those documents and images. <em>See F.L.R.A., </em>977 F.2d at 548. Additionally, the TSA employees named and depicted are low-level screeners and security-checkpoint supervisors, and disclosure of their personal identities would not shed any light on the TSA\u2019s operations. <em>See Wood, </em>432 F.3d at 88-89; <em>see also Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>384 F.Supp.2d 100, 116-17 (D.D.C.2005) (concluding Exemption 6 allowed the TSA to redact names of its employees in documents because: (1) \u201cfederal employees have an identifiable privacy interest in avoiding disclosures of information that could lead to annoyance or harassment\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>(2) \u201cthe public interest in learning the names of ... lower-echelon employees is small\u201d; and (3) there was no showing how the employees\u2019 names would help the public \u201cunderstand how the agency performs its statutory duties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Here, the individuals, named or depicted, have privacy interests in avoiding disclosure of their personal identifying information. <em>See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense v. F.L.R.A., </em>510 U.S. 487, 500, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 1015, 127 L.Ed.2d 325 (1994). And, Corbett has not shown the public has a compelling interest in disclosure of these personal identities. Corbett has not offered a reasonable, much less a compelling, explanation for a public interest, or even his own personal need, for the names and faces in the records here. For example, Corbett does not contend that knowing the personal identities would assist him in this or other litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In short, based on the record before us, we conclude the individuals\u2019 privacy interests outweigh any public interest in disclosure of the names and faces here.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">We thus affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment to the TSA on Corbett\u2019s FOIA claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">VIII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\">. Corbett had not checked any luggage at the ticket counter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. At some point, Corbett's driver\u2019s license and boarding pass were copied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\">. The TSA also redacted material regarding TSA operations considered by the TSA to be \"sensitive security information\u201d and exempted under FOIA Exemption 3. 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3). In this appeal, Corbett does not challenge these redactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b719-13\">. Corbett also requested records from defendants Broward County and the Sheriff\u2019s Office under the Florida Public Records Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 119.07. In the district court, Cor-bett challenged the adequacy of defendant Broward County\u2019s response to'his Public Records Act request, and the district court rejected that claim. Corbett\u2019s opening brief on appeal does not challenge the district court's ruling, and therefore Corbett abandons the issue on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b719-20\">. On December 18, 2012, the district court denied Corbett\u2019s motion to file a second amended complaint. In this appeal, Corbett has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying this motion. <em>See Lowe\u2019s Home Ctrs., Inc. v. Olin Corp., </em>313 F.3d 1307, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2002) (\"[A] district court has great discretion when deciding whether to grant a motion for leave to amend a complaint following the filing of responsive pleadings:\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, \"accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Digital Props., Inc. v. City of Plantation, </em>121 F.3d 586, 589 (11th Cir.1997). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear claims against the United States. <em>Bennett v. United States, </em>102 F.3d 486, 488 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b723-13\">. The statute further provides that the United States is liable only if, under like circumstances, a private person \"would be liable to ' the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">. <em>See also Hernandez v.

Feb. 28, 2014) (TSA screeners are not law enforcement officers because the functions named in the law enforcement proviso are \"commonly understood to be traditional law enforcement functions ... commonly performed by FBI agents, Bureau of Prison Officers, postal inspectors, and INS agents, all of which have broad investigative and law enforcement powers, and ... fall within the law enforcement proviso,\u201d whereas TSA screeners only screen passengers for items \"which are prohibited on aiiplanes, but not illegal to possess\"); <em>Welch v.

We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Robinson v.

Because Exemption 6 supports all of the TSA's redactions, we need not consider whether Exemption 7(C) provides a separate basis for the redactions of the Sheriff's officer\u2019s name. Additionally, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil conspiracy claim, as well as the claim under the Florida Constitution. We agree with the district court\u2019s cogent analysis of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
