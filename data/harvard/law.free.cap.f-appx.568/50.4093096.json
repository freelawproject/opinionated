Lipp (\u201cLipp\u201d) appeals from a judgment upholding the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, Michael J. Astrue (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Lipp was not entitled to disability benefits under the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">Lipp suffered injuries to his back and neck after falling at work in August of 2005. On January 10, 2006, Lipp filed an application for disability benefits, which was denied. Lipp then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), which took place on April 11, 2008, during which Lipp was represented by counsel. On June 3, 2008, the ALJ denied Lipp\u2019s claim. Lipp requested review by the Appeals Council, which denied his request on February 19, 2009. Lipp then appealed to the District Court, which entered judgment for the Commissioner on May 8, 2013. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">We review an order granting judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), <em>de novo. See Jasinski v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 184 (2d Cir.2003). Our review of a denial of social security disability benefits focuses on the administrative ruling rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Halloran v. Barnhart, </em>362 F.3d 28, 31 (2d Cir.2004). We evaluate whether the decision was \u201csupported by substantial evidence,\u201d which means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla ... [and as much as] a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We also determine whether incorrect legal standards were applied. <em>See Burgess v. Astrue, </em>537 F.3d 117, 127 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">On appeal, Lipp argues that the ALJ erred by not following the \u201ctreating physician rule,\u201d which \u201cgenerally requires a measure of deference to the medical opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician.\u201d <em>Halloran, </em>362 F.3d at 31. Lipp also alleges that the ALJ erred by not re-contacting his treating physicians, by improperly assessing his credibility, and by determining that he was not disabled within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The Act defines a \u201cdisability\u201d as an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A Social Security Administration regulation promulgated by the Commissioner created a five-step evaluation process that is used to determine if a claimant is entitled to disability benefits. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4). Applying that process, the ALJ found that Lipp suffered from \u201cright shoulder and cervical spine dysfunction\u201d which constituted a \u201csevere combination of impairments,\u201d JA15, but that he nevertheless \u201chad the residual functional capacity to perform light work\u201d of a type \u201cthat existed in significant numbers in the national economy.\u201d JA17,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Having conducted a plenary review of the administrative record, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and did not involve an incorrect application of legal standards. We affirm, substantially for the reasons articulated by the District Court in its Decision and Order. <em>See Lipp v. Astrue, </em>No. 10 Civ. 0398, 2013 WL 1908036 (W.D.N.Y. May 7, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">We have considered all of Lipp\u2019s arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the May 8, 2013 decision of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-12\">. Carolyn W. Colvin became the Acting Commissioner of Social Security in February of 2014, and accordingly has been substituted as the appellee in this action; accordingly, we direct the Clerk's Office to amend the caption as indicated above. When we refer to \"Commissioner,\u201d we refer to the office and to its occupant at the relevant time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
