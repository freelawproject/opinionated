He alleged that Corrections Officer Alfred L. Thompson violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect him from an attack by his cellmate. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>discovery, Thompson fled a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted on the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge. Blackstone appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we \"will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Blackstone\u2019s complaint alleged that Corrections Officer A.L. Thompson failed to protect him from his cellmate, Gary Wee-don. According to the allegations, on November 9, 2010, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Blackstone told Thompson that he was having problems with Weedon, that he did not feel comfortable around Weedon, and that he wanted to move. In response, Thompson informed Blackstone that he did not have the authority to move inmates. He provided Blackstone with a DC-135A Bequest to Staff form and instructed him to fill out the form and give it to the unit manager the following day. Blackstone filled out the form and immediately placed it in the unit manager\u2019s mailbox. He wrote, among other things: \u201cI believe my cellie may try to assault me in the cell tonight.\u201d [Doc. 1, Complaint, Exh. A], It is undisputed that Thompson never saw the written request.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">That evening, Blackstone sustained injuries from a fight with his cell mate. According to Blackstone, he was lounging in the dayroom when Weedon attacked him, unprovoked. The attack resulted in facial contusions, blurred vision, lingering headaches and a fractured orbital bone. Thompson conceded that there was a fight but maintained that the altercation was mutual, as opposed to an unprovoked assault. Thompson described the fight accordingly in an incident report. Prison officials conducted a disciplinary hearing. After the hearing officer reviewed video evidence, Blackstone and Weedon were both found guilty of fighting. As punishment, Blackstone was assigned to restricted housing for thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Blackstone alleged that prison policy DC-ADM 802 authorizes an inmate to request self-lockup for his own protection, but that he was not given that option by Thompson. He further claimed that Thompson knew or should have known that Weedon was likely to assault Blackstone because, in addition to Blackstone\u2019s express statement to Thompson, Weedon carried an inmate status of \u201cH-Code,\u201d signifying that he was a high risk inmate. Blackstone also alleged that Thompson knew that other inmates had complained about Weedon in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm if Blackstone\u2019s appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. When reviewing orders granting summary judgment we apply the same test as the District Court, granting summary judgment where there remains no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Noel v. Boeing Co., </em>622 F.3d 266, 270 n. 4 (3d Cir.2010). We view the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Ray v. Twp. of Warren, </em>626 F.3d 170, 173 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">To survive Thompson\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Blackstone needed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>point to evidence in the record that Thompson both knew of and was deliberately indifferent to an excessive risk to his safety. <em>See Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 131 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). We agree with the District Court that Blackstone did not adduce evidence to show that Thompson operated from the requisite mindset.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">When making a determination as to deliberate indifference, the court must \u201cfocus [on] what a defendant\u2019s mental attitude actually was (or is), rather than what it should have been (or should be).\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Leavy, </em>117 F.3d 742, 747 (3d Cir.1997) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Deliberate indifference is \u201ca state of mind more blameworthy than negligence.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Even if Thompson \u201cknew the underlying facts but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to which the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent,\u201d liability will not attach. <em>Id. </em>at 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Here, there is no indication in the record that Thompson made the inference that an excessive risk was present. Prior to the fight, Blackstone had just one communication with Thompson, in which Blackstone stated that he was not \u201cgetting along\u201d and did not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d with his cellmate. <em>[See </em>Doc. 66, p. 1-2]. Absent any other evidence of Thompson\u2019s culpable state of mind, that singular, generalized statement is not sufficient to permit a reasonable finder of fact to infer that Thompson both knew of and intentionally disregarded an excessive risk to Blackstone\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Blackstone points to Weedon\u2019s \u201cH-class\u201d status as circumstantial evidence of Thompson\u2019s deliberate indifference. The risk that an inmate with some history of violence might attack another inmate for an unknown reason, however, is too speculative to give rise to an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Bistrian v. Levy </em>696 F.3d 352, 371 (3d Cir.2012). It is true that the requisite mindset may be proved by circumstantial evidence, such as where a plaintiff demonstrates that a substantial risk was \u201clongstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted by prison officials in the past.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970 (citations omitted); <em>see also Leavy, </em>117 F.3d at 747. Here, however, there were no longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or previously noted tensions between Weedon and Blackstone. Nor is there any indication in the record that Blackstone told Thompson of any specific incident or cause of tension between the cellmates from which a greater inference of risk could be drawn. <em>See Bistrian, </em>696 F.3d at 368-71 (permitting Eighth Amendment claims to proceed where an inmate repeatedly advised officials of threats he received as a result of helping an investigation that targeted those with whom he was placed). To the contrary, Blackstone\u2019s filings repeatedly describe the type of \u201cout-of-the-blue and unadorned T\u2019m-in-trouble\u2019 entreaty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 369-70, that is commonly faced by officials, who are charged with the \u201carduous\u201d task of managing an inmate population while protecting those in custody. <em>Young v. Quin-lan, </em>960 F.2d 351, 363 n. 23 (3d Cir.1992), <em>superseded by statute, </em>Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, <em>as recognized in Nyhuis v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 65, 71 n. 7 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We acknowledge that the factual assertions of the parties differ as to who instigated the altercation between Weedon and Blackstone. That dispute, however, is not material to Blackstone\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>F.R.Civ.P. 56(a). Even assuming that Blackstone was attacked by Weedon, Blackstone has not pointed to evidence of deliberate indifference. As we have explained, the combination of Weedon\u2019s \u201cH-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Code\u201d status and one report of unspecified tensions between the cellmates does not support an inference of deliberate indifference. The District Court thus correctly concluded that summary judgment was warranted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">. Blackstone subsequently filed a post-judgment motion seeking relief from the final judgment in order to introduce new evidence. The District Court denied that motion. That denial is not before us, as Blackstone did not file a timely new or amended Notice of Appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-17\">. We also perceive no error in the District Court's order denying Blackstone\u2019s request for counsel. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 158 (3d Cir.1993). We observe that Blackstone diligently prosecuted his case; his thorough filings reflect that he was able to effectively conduct discovery and present his arguments. <em>Id.; Smith-Bey v. Petsock, </em>741 F.2d 22, 26 (3d Cir.1984). The District Court also did not err in denying Blackstone\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
