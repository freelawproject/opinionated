We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Reyes failed to establish the harm he suffered at the hands of guerrillas was on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Consequently, Reyes is not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution, and is not eligible for humanitarian asylum. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). The BIA found Reyes waived any claim that he had a well-founded fear of future persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tion in the absence of a showing of past persecution. Reyes does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of Reyes\u2019 CAT claim because he failed to demonstrate it is more likely than not he would be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official in El Salvador. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008). We reject Reyes\u2019 contention that the agency failed to fully or properly analyze his CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b516-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
