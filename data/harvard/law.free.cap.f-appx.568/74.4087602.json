Reese challenges the imposition of lifetime supervised release on the grounds that the court (1) failed to adequately explain the reason for the sentence and (2) abused its discretion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">1. Reese\u2019s claim that the district court did not adequately explain the reasons for his sentence, raised for the first time on appeal, is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>720 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">The district court, \u201cat the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). \u201cWhere, as here, the sentence concerns a violation of supervised release and the ultimate sentence is within the recommended range, compliance with the statutory requirements can be minimal.\u201d <em>United States v. Cassesse, </em>685 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir.2012). Upon review of the record, the district court sufficiently explained that the violation occurred less than one year after Reese\u2019s release from prison, Reese had \u201clied on a number of occasions,\u201d and Reese \u201crefus[ed] to accept the situation.\u201d A-122.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">2. Reese argues that the district court abused its discretion in imposing supervised release for life because this term far exceeded the statutory maximum prison term authorized for the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">We review a sentence imposed for violating a condition of supervised release under \u201cthe same standard as for sentencing generally: whether the sentence imposed is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>415 F.3d 273, 277 (2d Cir.2005). We \u201cset aside a district court\u2019s substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) <em>(en </em>banc) (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">A life term of supervised release has been found reasonable where, as here, such a term was \u201crecommended under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>445 F.3d 536, 537 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that such a recommendation supports, but does not necessitate, a determination of reasonableness). Moreover, \u201c[district courts are permitted ... to hedge against a relatively lenient term of imprisonment by imposing a longer term of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Leon, </em>663 F.3d 552, 556 (2d Cir.2011), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1777, 182 L.Ed.2d 555 (2012) (quotation marks and original brackets omitted). Here, Judge Hurd considered imposing the statutory maximum prison term of two years because Reese had violated the terms of his supervised release in his first year out of prison, Reese displayed a defiant attitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>while under supervision, and Reese had been untruthful about his conduct. However, after considering Reese\u2019s mitigating circumstances, the district court imposed a within-Guidelines sentence of nine months\u2019 imprisonment followed by a life term of supervised release. This sentence was reasonable and within the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in Reese\u2019s other arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
