We review de novo. <em>Weilburg v. Shapiro, </em>488 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2007). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, <em>Johnson v. Riverside Healthcare Sys., LP, </em>534 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.2008), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The district court properly dismissed Langston\u2019s Fourth Amendment and right to travel claims because defendants\u2019 acts did not constitute a search or seizure, and Langston failed to allege sufficient facts to show that defendants actually interfered with his travel. <em>See United States, v. Al Nasser, </em>555 F.3d 722, 726 (9th Cir.2009) (the Fourth Amendment requires government action, and is not implicated where an individual voluntarily stops his vehicle); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n. for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis v. Cal. Bd. of Psychology, </em>228 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u201cwe may consider facts contained in documents attached to the complaint\u201d in determining whether the complaint states a claim for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The district court properly dismissed Langston\u2019s racial discrimination claims because Langston failed to allege sufficient facts to show discriminatory bias. <em>See Thornton v. City of St. Helens, </em>425 F.3d 1158, 1166-67 (9th Cir.2005) (a \u00a7 1983 claim for violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires a showing of discriminatory intent or purpose); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n. for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, </em>228 F.3d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Dismissal of Langston\u2019s conspiracy claim was proper because there was no underlying constitutional violation. <em>See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 929-30 (9th Cir.2004) (describing pleading requirements for a \u00a7 1985 claim and explaining that there can be no conspiracy without an underlying rights violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied as moot Langston\u2019s motions to compel discovery after dismissing his complaint as deficient as a matter of law. <em>See Hallett v. Morgan, </em>296 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth standard of review and noting the district court\u2019s broad discretion in deciding motions to compel discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b543-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
