Marbley, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-17\">COOK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">Vaselj Djonaj, a citizen of Montenegro, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his claims for asylum and withholding of removal. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-20\">Djonaj unlawfully entered the United States and applied for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The Immigration and Naturalization Service denied the application and referred his case to an IJ. Before the IJ, Djonaj renewed his requests and also sought a humanitarian grant of asylum grounded on his past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">Djonaj testified to suffering persecution in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. He described the government targeting him and his family after his brother deserted the Yugoslav army. On four occasions between 1995 and 1998, military and civilian police forces arrested and beat him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>his father. During one such incident in 1997, Djonaj suffered kidney damage requiring surgical repair. In addition to his brother\u2019s desertion, Djonaj attributed these beatings to his Albanian ethnicity and his helping other Albanians flee Koso-vo.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The IJ denied relief under the INA, holding that the government demonstrated a fundamental change in circumstances in Montenegro that rebutted Djonaj\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution necessary for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). Djonaj also could not show entitlement to humanitarian asylum because he failed to present sufficiently severe past persecution, and he failed to identify any other serious harm that he would suffer if removed to Montenegro. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii). The BIA affirmed, supplementing the IJ\u2019s decision with its own reasoning. Djonaj petitions for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\n<em>A. Asylum and Withholding of Removal under the INA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Djonaj first contests the BIA\u2019s change-of-circumstances finding. \u201cWhere the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and supplements that decision with its own comments, as in this case, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Hachem v. Holder, </em>656 F.3d 430, 434 (6th Cir.2011). We review the BIA\u2019s finding of a fundamental change in circumstances under a substantial-evidence standard, reversing only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Dieng v. Holder, </em>698 F.3d 866, 871 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion. Though Djonaj fears retaliation for his brother\u2019s desertion from the Yugoslav army and his own draft evasion, the record reveals that in 2001, Yugoslavia enacted legislation pardoning military deserters, draft evaders, and conscientious objectors, allowing many draft evaders to return without fear of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">Djonaj also fears persecution on account of his Albanian ethnicity and political activities. But Montenegro\u2019s political system fundamentally changed since Djonaj fled Yugoslavia in 2000. Following a national referendum in 2006, Montenegro declared its independence. And, with five seats in the national legislature reserved by law, ethnic Albanians have a role in the government. As Djonaj\u2019s own testimony acknowledges, \u201csince 2004, 2005\u201d Montenegro has \u201cchanged a lot\u201d so that \u201cthey can get in [the] European Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">State Department reports, \u201cgenerally the best gauge of conditions in foreign countries,\u201d <em>Dieng, </em>698 F.3d at 872, further support the BIA\u2019s determination. These reports show that the \u201cgovernment generally respect[s] the human rights of its citizens.\u201d The State Department found no record of politically-motivated disappearances, detainees, or prisoners, or of Montenegro\u2019s government committing arbitrary or unlawful killings. Indeed, Montenegrin authorities prosecuted former Yugoslav soldiers for killing Albanian civilians and police officers for abusing those in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">Though Djonaj asserts that authorities continue to persecute Albanians, he fails to point to any evidence in the record to substantiate this claim. . His appellate briefing offers \u201ctwo ... current articles\u201d that purportedly substantiate his fear of future persecution. But, as noted by the government, these articles appear nowhere in the administrative record and thus fall outside our review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A); <em>see also Lin v. Holder, </em>565 F.3d 971, 978-79 (6th Cir.2009). Moreover, Djonaj\u2019s two sisters live openly in Montenegro without harm. <em>See Diop v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Holder, </em>402 Fed.Appx. 80, 84 (6th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (holding petitioner\u2019s asserted fear of persecution undermined when his family continued to live unharmed in the country of origin).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Because Djonaj fails to show a well-founded fear of future persecution, he cannot satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Koliada v. INS, </em>259 F.3d 482, 489 (6th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\n<em>B. Humanitarian Asylum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Djonaj also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum. In the absence of a well-founded fear of persecution, a grant of humanitarian asylum requires Djonaj to show \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution,\u201d or \u201ca reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious harm upon removal to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A)-(B). Humanitarian relief represents an \u201cextraordinary\u201d remedy available only \u201cin rare instances.\u201d <em>Mbodj v. Holder, </em>394 Fed.Appx. 239, 244 (6th Cir.2010). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of humanitarian asylum for an abuse of discretion. <em>Karomi v. Gonzales, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 719, 723 (6th Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying humanitarian asylum because Djonaj\u2019s past persecution lacked the severity needed to warrant relief. <em>Cf. Lleshi v. Holder, </em>460 Fed.Appx. 520, 525 (6th Cir.2012) (listing examples of the requisite severity to include \u201cthe case of the German Jews, the victims of the Chinese \u2018Cultural Revolution\u2019, [and] survivors of the Cambodian genocide\u201d). Moreover, Djonaj points to no evidence in the record showing a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that he may \u201csuffer other serious harm\u201d upon returning to Montenegro, instead offering only evidence outside of the record that we cannot consider. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii)(B); <em>see also Lin, </em>565 F.3d at 978-79. In any event, the BIA\u2019s finding of fundamental changes in Montenegro belies Djonaj\u2019s fears of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">We DENY the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
