KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Plaintiff-Appellant Craig S. Robledo, a state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights claims. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Mr. Robledo is a prisoner in the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections. In his second amended prisoner complaint, Mr. Robledo set forth five claims against various prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for property damage and theft, double jeopardy and due process violations related to prison disciplinary proceedings, cruel and unusual conditions of confinement, denial of court access, and First Amendment violations. R. 77-98. The district court found Mr. Robledo offered only vague and conclusory allegations insufficient to state a cognizable claim for relief on any of the five grounds, and dismissed the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. R. 160, 170,173. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\"><em>We </em>review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s complaint for frivolousness for an abuse of discretion, but if the frivolousness determination turns on an issue of law, we review the determination de novo. <em>See Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir.2006). A complaint is frivolous if \u201cit lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that Mr. Robledo\u2019s claims are frivolous for substantially the same reasons as the district court. His deprivation of property claim fails because he has not alleged that the prison\u2019s grievance procedure or state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>court claims are inadequate post-deprivation remedies. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 586, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). As the district court found, the complaint did not allege any particular facet of due process or notice of which Mr. Robledo was deprived, R. 83-86, and he did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his prison classification, <em>see Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976). His Eighth Amendment allegations do not rise to the level of the \u201cextreme deprivation[ ] ... required to make out a conditions-of-confinement claim,\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), nor has he alleged that prison officials \u201ckn[ew] of and disregard[ed] an excessive risk to [his] health or safety,\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>see </em>R. 88-89. As to his court access claim, Mr. Robledo has not alleged any \u201cactual injury\u201d or hindrance to \u201chis efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); R. 90. And we agree with the district court that Mr. Robledo\u2019s First Amendment allegations are vague and conclusory. <em>See </em>R. 91-92, 169. His brief on appeal has not cured these deficiencies or persuaded us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Mr. Robledo\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED, but he remains obligated to continue making partial payments to satisfy the fees already assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
