Thereafter, in 2008, Singh entered a no-contest plea in Michigan state court to receiving and concealing stolen property with a value of $1,000 or more but less than $20,000, in violation of Michigan Compiled Laws section 750.535. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) subsequently served Singh with a notice to appear, charging him with removability under section 237(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, as having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) committed within five years after admission for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">At the initial hearing before the IJ, Singh admitted the factual allegations set forth in the notice to appear and conceded removability. The IJ continued the ease at Singh\u2019s request, pending his attempt to obtain post-conviction relief in the Michigan state courts under <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). Singh\u2019s motion to withdraw his no-contest plea was denied by the trial court, and the Michigan Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. The IJ ultimately ordered Singh\u2019s removal to India, stating that Singh had conceded re-movability and that, even without the concession, the conviction record established a removable offense. Singh appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. Dismissing the appeal, the BIA agreed with the IJ that Singh had conceded removability and declined to address any other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">In support of his petition for review, Singh contends that his attorney withdrew the concession of removability. Singh admits that his attorney conceded removability at the initial hearing. The following exchange took place at the final hearing before the IJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>JUDGE TO MR. CARPENTER [Singh\u2019s Attorney]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\">Now my notes indicate that you\u2019ve conceded that he\u2019s removability [sic] pursuant to the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">MR. CARPENTER TO JUDGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA-\">I believe we admitted the allegations, but denied the ground of removability. That\u2019s what my notes show.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">JUDGE TO MR. CARPENTER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajo-dedup-0\">You want to contest the ground of removability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">MR. CARPENTER TO JUDGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHh\">We\u2019ll leave the Government to their proofs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">MR. GOULDING [DHS\u2019s Attorney] TO JUDGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">My notes reflect that there was a concession on January 10th of this year, a concession as to removability and then admission as to the allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">MR. CARPENTER TO JUDGE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYX\">I don\u2019t know that it matters much. It\u2019s a theft charge. So it\u2019s all about the $500 over statutory ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">(AR 94-95). When confronted with the fact that he had conceded removability, Singh\u2019s counsel merely stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know that it matters much.\u201d The record does not compel the conclusion that Singh\u2019s attorney withdrew the concession of removability. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">\u201cIn a removal proceeding, \u2018petitioners are bound by the concessions of their attorneys to the IJ unless they can show ineffective assistance of counsel or some other egregious circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hanna v. Holder, </em>740 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Gill v. Gonzales, 127 </em>Fed.Appx. 860, 862-63 (6th Cir.2005)). To establish egregious circumstances, the alien must argue that the attorney\u2019s concession is incorrect, and that argument must be supported by the record. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88. There are two types of egregious circumstances that may justify relieving an alien of his admissions before an IJ. First are \u201cadmissions that were the result of unreasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388 (quoting <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 377, 383 (BIA 1986)). (internal quotation marks omitted). Second are admissions that \u201cwould produce[ ] an unjust result,\u201d such as inadvertent admissions and admissions that an intervening change in law undercuts. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 383).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">Singh argues that his attorney\u2019s concession of removability is incorrect because Michigan Compiled Laws section 750.535 is not categorically a CIMT and because the modified categorical approach does not identify which portion of this divisible statute he was convicted of violating. Under Michigan Compiled Laws section 750.535(1), \u201c[a] person shall not buy, receive, possess, conceal, or aid in the concealment of stolen, embezzled, or converted money, goods, or property knowing, or having reason to know or reason to believe, that the money, goods, or property is stolen, embezzled, or converted.\u201d A violation of this statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years if the property has a value of $1,000 or more but less than $20,000. Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.535(3)(a). The amended information tracks the statutory language, alleging that Singh \u201cdid buy, receive, possess, conceal, or aid on [sic] the concealment of liquor and baby formula, stolen, embezzled, or converted property, knowing or having reason to know or reason to believe that the property was stolen, embezzled, or converted, and the value of the property was $1,000.00 or more but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>less than $20,000.00; contrary to MCL 750.535(3)(a).\u201d (AR 103).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Singh first asserts that he should not be bound by his attorney\u2019s concession because the above-quoted exchange among the attorneys and the IJ reflects that his attorney did not mean to concede remova-bility. Singh\u2019s attorney unequivocally conceded removability at the initial hearing before the IJ and, when confronted with that fact, did not withdraw that concession or otherwise indicate that the concession was mistaken: \u201cI don\u2019t know that it matters much.\u201d Singh also contends that a concession of removability would have undermined counsel\u2019s strategy of seeking to continue the proceedings to pursue post-conviction relief in state court. After conceding removability, Singh\u2019s attorney requested a continuance to pursue post-conviction relief, stating his intent to move for termination of the removal proceedings upon Singh\u2019s plea to a lesser, non-removable offense (i.e., property value below the felony threshold amount). The record indicates that counsel\u2019s concession of remov-ability was a reasonable tactical decision and was not inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Next, Singh contends that counsel\u2019s concession of removability is no longer valid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d-438 (2013), which, he asserts, altered the agency framework for determining whether a conviction is properly classified as a CIMT. But, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Moncrieffe, </em>the \u201ccategorical approach has a long pedigree in our Nation\u2019s immigration law.\u201d 133 S.Ct. at 1685. This Court\u2019s most recent published decision addressing whether a crime involved moral turpitude did not cite either <em>Moncrieffe </em>or <em>Descamps. See Hanna, </em>740 F.3d at 389-93. Singh thus has not shown an intervening change in law undercutting counsel\u2019s concession of removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">Singh has failed to demonstrate egregious circumstances to warrant relieving him from counsel\u2019s concession of remova-bility. Accordingly, we deny Singh\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
