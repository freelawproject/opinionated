After hearing oral argument and after deliberation, we conclude that no reversible error is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-20\">About Defendant\u2019s Renewed Motion for JMOL, we conclude that the record evidence\u2014viewed in plaintiffs favor\u2014was sufficient for the verdict<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: evidence including the approximately two-foot size of the puddle of bleach, the distinctive odor of bleach, the presence of tracks not made by plaintiff or her husband through the puddle, and the proximity within about ten feet of the puddle of defendant\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">About the exclusion of a purported expert\u2019s opinion, we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion, especially given the expert\u2019s broad lack of knowledge of the background and underpinning of the information in the DRG on which the expert relied considerably.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-16\">. Furthermore, no new trial was demanded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-17\">. We do not read <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bowling, </em>81 So.3d 538 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2012) to demand admission of the proposed expert testimony in this case. <em>Bowling </em>seems to decide a materially different case. For example, <em>Bowling </em>seems to be about, to a significant degree, an argument that the medical services billed did not reflect medical services actually delivered according to the treatment records and not about mainly a conflict over the reasonableness of charges for medical services, assumed to have been delivered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
