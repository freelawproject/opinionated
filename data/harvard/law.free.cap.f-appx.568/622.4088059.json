BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Plaintiff David Eric Hunsaker, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Hunsaker filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleging that in \u25a0 2006 Defendant Kevin Alexander violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. Hunsaker later conceded that Alexander was not the true culprit. The district court then (1) granted summary judgment to Alexander and (2) denied Hunsaker the opportunity to amend his complaint because doing so would be futile in light of Hunsaker\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. We affirmed. <em>See Hunsaker v. Alexander, </em>520 Fed.Appx. 717, 718 (10th Cir.2013) (unpublished). We concluded \u201c[tjhere is no question that Hunsaker failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also rejected Hunsaker\u2019s assertions that administrative remedies, in the form of inmate grievance procedures, were effectively unavailable to him for two reasons: First, Hunsaker never submitted a sworn statement or any other evidence to substantiate this assertion. Second, we refused to consider handwritten quotes of prison regulations as evidence of unavailability of administrative remedies because he did not present those quoted regulations to the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">Apparently dissatisfied with our refusal to consider his quoted prison regulations in his original appeal, Hunsaker attempted to introduce these quotes by another means. He filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment in the district court, arguing that newly discovered evidence\u2014 namely, his quoted prison regulations, and a letter denying his request for certain records\u2014showed administrative remedies were not available to him and he therefore need not show exhaustion in order to amend his complaint. The district court denied this motion stating: \u201cPlaintiff argues nothing new to help his cause. Further, he has already unsuccessfully appealed this Court\u2019s judgment to the 10th Circuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Servants of Paraclete v. Does, </em>204 F.3d 1005, 1009 (10th Cir.2000). Furthermore, relief under Rule 60(b) is \u201c\u2018extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. United Pac. Ins. </em>Co., 152 F.3d 1266, 1272 (10th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">The district court in its terse order appears to have rested its denial of Hunsaker\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion on two alternative theories. Insofar as the court reasoned that Hunsaker had already unsuccessfully appealed to us the judgment he now seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>relief from, the court failed to realize that Hunsaker\u2019s argument for Rule 60(b) relief is based on the introduction of new evidence, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), evidence we explicitly refused to consider for the first time in his direct appeal, <em>see Hunsaker, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 719. Nevertheless, having now reviewed this \u201cnew evidence,\u201d we agree with the district court that it does not provide anything new to help Hunsaker\u2019s cause, let alone establish the exceptional circumstances necessary to warrant Rule 60(b) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires that a prisoner exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing a lawsuit for violation of his federally protected rights. . <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). In our previous order, we noted, that \u201can administrative remedy is not \u2018available\u2019 under the PLRA if prison officials prevent, thwart, or hinder a prisoner\u2019s efforts to avail himself of the administrative remedy.\u201d <em>Hunsaker, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 719 (quoting <em>Tuckel v. Grover, </em>660 F.3d 1249, 1252 (10th Cir.2011)). Nevertheless, we concluded that \u201c[t]here is no question that Hunsaker failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hunsaker\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d does nothing to convince us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Hunsaker\u2019s first proffer, his handwritten quotes of prison regulations concerning inmate grievance policy and procedure, actually undermines his unavailability argument. These handwritten copies likely do not constitute admissible evidence under the best evidence rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1001-04. Even assuming the actual prison regulations were in evidence and said exactly what Hunsaker wrote down, however, they still in no way tend to show administrative remedies were unavailable to Hunsaker or that officials hindered his efforts to seek an administrative remedy. Indeed, the quoted procedures state, \u201cThe scope of available administrative remedies is broad.... \u201d and \u201cAny member may provide grievance forms to inmates.\u201d Thus, according to Hunsaker\u2019s own proffered materials, administrative remedies were very much available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Hunsaker\u2019s second proffer is no more helpful. Recall that Hunsaker never submitted any sworn statement that he requested and was denied prison grievance forms\u2014a sworn statement he easily could have submitted. In his motion for relief from judgment, however, he attached a request for records\u2014dated March 19, 2012\u2014and a response\u2014dated March 28, 2012\u2014from Utah\u2019s Department of Institutional Operations denying this request. The response explains to Hunsaker that the records he requested were readily available in the Inmate Reference Library and directs him to ask his case manager if he needs help finding them. First, we fail to see how this response to a 2012 request rendered his ability to file a grievance back in 2006 unavailable. Furthermore, Hunsaker nowhere asserts that he asked his case manager to provide these materials and was rebuffed, ignored, or denied access. Hunsaker ultimately admits in his reply brief that, at most, this \u201cnew evidence\u201d shows \u201che had a hard time getting copies of the Prison Policy and Procedure on Inmate Grievances while he was in Weber County Jail.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Reply at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Hunsaker has again utterly failed to produce any evidence that administrative remedies were unavailable to him, or of official misconduct in an attempt to prevent, thwart, or hinder his efforts to avail himself of these administrative remedies. <em>See Hunsaker, </em>520 Fed.Appx. at 719 (concluding the same). Indeed, his \u201cnew evidence\u201d tends to show quite the opposite. The district court therefore did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>denying Hunsaker\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. Hunsaker also claims once again that the district court erred by not allowing him to amend his complaint. This claim, however, we fully resolved (and rejected) in his previous appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment, DENY Hunsaker\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and order immediate payment of the filing fee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-17\">.
