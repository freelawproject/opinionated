We deny a certificate of appealability (COA) and dismiss this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-21\">Silva pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), and was sentenced under the Armed Career Criminal Act. He appealed his sentence, and we affirmed the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>court\u2019s judgment in June 2010. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>608 F.3d 663, 664 (10th Cir.2010). Silva filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in February 2012. The district court denied the motion and dismissed that proceeding with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Silva then filed another \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate in February 2014, which the district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Silva filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Silva must obtain a COA to pursue an appeal. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir.2008). Because the district court\u2019s ruling rests on procedural grounds, he must show both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We liberally construe Silva\u2019s pro se application for a COA. <em>See Hall v. Scott, </em>292 F.3d 1264, 1266 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The district court does not have jurisdiction to address the merits of an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir.2008). Silva does not dispute that he previously filed a first \u00a7 2255 motion and that he has not sought authorization from this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Silva initially argues that his latest \u00a7 2255 motion is not second or successive because his first motion was not denied \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d But the district court\u2019s judgment clearly indicates Silva\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 proceeding was dismissed with prejudice. <em>See </em>Judgment, <em>United States v. Silva, </em>No. l:07-CR-00787-JCH-l (September 12, 2012) (Docket Entry 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Silva also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his motion because he filed it under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">[Fjederal prisoners who are barred from bringing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions may still be able to petition for habeas relief under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2241 through the mechanism of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. To fall within the ambit of the savings clause and so proceed to \u00a7 2241, a prisoner must show that the remedy by motion under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-10\"><em>Abernathy v. Wandes, </em>713 F.3d 538, 547 (10th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1874, 188 L.Ed.2d 916 (2014). A petitioner\u2019s remedy under \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate if his \u201cargument challenging the legality of his detention could have been tested in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">Silva is correct that the district court did not construe his motion as being filed under the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. Rather, the court concluded it was a second or successive motion filed under \u00a7 2255 and dismissed it as unauthorized. Jurists of reason would not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s procedural ruling. First, Silva did not mention \u00a7 2255(e), much less \u00a7 2241, in his motion. Second, he did not attempt to argue that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective, which is a prerequisite to application of the savings clause. And finally, Silva was incarcerated in Texas at the time he filed his motion, <em>see </em>R. at 9, but he filed the motion in the District of New Mexico, where he was sentenced. A \u00a7 2241 petition \u201cmust be filed in the federal judicial district of the prisoner\u2019s incarceration,\u201d while \u00a7 2255 motions \u201cmust be filed in the district in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>which the prisoner was sentenced.\u201d <em>Abernathy, </em>713 F.3d at 542 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We deny Silva\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss the appeal. We grant his motion to proceed without prepayment of costs and fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-7\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
