MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">After examining Appellant\u2019s brief and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">On August 3, 2012, pro se appellant Everett Houck initiated a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against defendants Harold Ball and Judge Dan Owens in Oklahoma state court. The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice and this court affirmed the dismissal. <em>Houck v. Ball, </em>491 Fed.Appx. 934 (10th Cir.2012). Houck filed a second \u00a7 1983 action against Defendant Ball on October 30, 2013. The district court dismissed Houck\u2019s second suit, concluding it was barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion. <em>See Wilkes v. Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Emp\u2019t Div. of Labor Standards, </em>314 F.3d 501, 503-04 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201cUnder res judicata, or claim preclusion, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the prior action.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-23\">Houck then filed the instant appeal together with a request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>A dismissal on res judicata grounds is reviewed de novo. <em>MACTEC, Inc. v. Gorelick, </em>427 F.3d 821, 831 (10th Cir.2005). Having reviewed the record, Houck\u2019s appellate brief, and the applicable law, we discern no reversible error in the dismissal of Houck\u2019s instant \u00a7 1983 complaint. Accordingly, exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Houck\u2019s complaint is affirmed for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its Order dated November 5, 2013. Houck\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is denied and he is reminded that he must make immediate payment of the unpaid balance of his appellate filing fee. All other outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
