Oct. 23, 2012). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201c \u2018disfavored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings regarding country conditions under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-19\">An alien must move to reopen within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Gao\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely because it was filed more than three years after the agency\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), there is no time limitation for moving to reopen \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(ii); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">We find no error in the BIA\u2019s determination that Gao failed to demonstrate materially changed country conditions excusing the untimely filing of his motion to reopen. The Country Reports submitted demonstrate that unregistered churches in China faced varying degrees of interfer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>enee with their religious practices since at least 2005-the date of the earliest Country-Report filed in connection with Gao\u2019s 2007 merits hearing-and had not materially worsened between 2007 and 2011. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also In re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 258 (B.I.A. 2007) (\u201cIn determining whether evidence accompanying a motion to reopen demonstrates a material change in country conditions that would justify reopening, [the BIA] compare[s] the evidence of country conditions submitted with the motion to those that existed at the time of the merits hearing below.\u201d). Gao\u2019s claim that the BIA \u201cmisconstrued\u201d his motion also fails, since his conversion to Christianity was a self-induced change made after he was ordered removed and thus constitutes changed personal circumstances, as opposed to changed country conditions. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cA self-induced change in personal circumstances cannot suffice\u201d to establish \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Contrary to Gao\u2019s argument, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in discounting the unsworn letters submitted with Gao\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Matter of H-L-H &amp; Z-Y-Z-, 25 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 209, 215 (BIA 2010) (giving diminished weight to letters from friends because they were written by interested witnesses not subject to cross-examination), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Hui Lin Huang v. Holder, </em>677 F.3d 130 (2d Cir.2012). Further, these letters had no bearing on changed country conditions. <em>See In re S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 253. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gao\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, and we must deny the petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
