We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court decision dismissing a complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See Jaghory v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>131 F.3d 326, 329 (2d Cir.1997). To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Although all allegations contained in the complaint are assumed to be true, this tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. A claim -will have \u201cfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While <em>pro se </em>complaints must contain sufficient factual allegations to meet the plausibility standard, <em>see Harris v. Mills, </em>572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir.2009), we look for such allegations by affording the litigant \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d and \u201cinterpreting the complaint to raise the strongest claims that it suggests,\u201d <em>Hill v. Curcione, </em>657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir.2011) (quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Upon such review, we conclude that Avillan\u2019s appeal is without merit substantially for the reasons articulated by the district court in its well-reasoned order. <em>Avillan v. Donahue, </em>No. 12-cv-3370 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2013). We have considered all of Avillan\u2019s additional arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
