WALKER, JR., JOS\u00c9 A. CABRANES, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b103-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-19\">Appellant Maxmillian Sloley (\u201cSloley\u201d) challenges two conditions of his supervised release ordered by the District Court. These conditions were ordered during a violation proceeding at which Sloley admitted having violated the terms of his original supervised release by, <em>inter alia, </em>committing the state crime of harassment and leaving the judicial district without permission on two occasions. At that proceeding, the District Court sentenced Sloley to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment and 20 months\u2019 supervised release, which included two special conditions that Sloley\u2019s attorney objected to in the District Court and now contests on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-20\">The first is a condition limiting Sloley\u2019s travel to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York without permission from the District Court or probation. Slo-ley argues that this violates the requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2) that special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>supervised release conditions involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing, and that it is not \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to meet a compelling government interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The second condition challenged by Slo-ley is the requirement that he be subject to 20 months of continuous GPS monitoring. Sloley argues that this also violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(d)(2), as well as his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unjustified searches, and is not narrowly tailored to achieve the goals of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u201cThe propriety of conditions of supervised release are judged by an abuse of discretion standard,\u201d and \u201c[ajlthough the district court enjoys broad discretion in imposing these conditions, its discretion is not \u2018untrammeled\u2019 ... our Court will carefully scrutinize unusual and severe conditions.\u201d <em>United States v. Dupes, </em>513 F.3d 338, 343 (2d Cir.2008). Conditions of supervised release must also \u201cinvolve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to implement the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Myers, </em>426 F.3d 117, 124 (2d Cir.2033553864 .2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA challenge to conditions of supervised release that presents an issue of law is generally reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Dupes, </em>513 F.3d at 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5D1.3(c)(l) states that a \u201cstandard\u201d condition recommended for supervised release is that \u201cthe defendant shall not leave the judicial district or other specific geographic area without the permission of the court.\u201d These \u201cstandard\u201d conditions are \u201cpresumed suitable in all cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Asuncion-Pimental, </em>290 F.3d 91, 94 (2d Cir.2002). We conclude that it was well within the District Court\u2019s discretion to order Sloley to remain in a particular geographic area.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Second, Sloley argues that the District Court abused its discretion in imposing GPS monitoring because his history does not warrant such an imposition. He does not challenge the District Court\u2019s ability to impose such a condition, only its appropriateness to his case. We conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in imposing GPS monitoring. Sloley concedes that he has a \u201chistory of violating conditions of supervised release\u201d and has \u201ctwice violated for leaving the jurisdiction.\u201d Appellant Br. at 23. Thus, the Court could reasonably question whether Sloley would abide by the travel restrictions, and GPS monitoring provides an appropriate means of ensuring that he does.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">We have considered all of Sloley\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
