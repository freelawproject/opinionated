MATHESON, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Allen Galbreath was arrested for disorderly conduct while performing his morning ballet exercises in an Oklahoma City park. He brought a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the arresting officer and the City, alleging the arrest lacked probable cause and the municipal ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Each defendant moved for summary judgment, and Mr. Galbreath moved for declaratory judgment on his claims against the City. The district court denied Mr. Gal-breath\u2019s motion and granted both defendants\u2019 motions, holding (1) the arresting officer had qualified immunity and (2) the disorderly conduct ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Mr. Galbreath. Mr. Galbreath now appeals. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the first holding. As to the second, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">A. <em>Factual </em>History<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Mr. Galbreath is a \u201cformer dancer with the Oklahoma Ballet.\u201d Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 177. Because of a debilitating hip condition, Mr. Galbreath regularly performed ballet exercises as a form of \u201cphysical therapy\u201d at Goodholm Park in Oklahoma City to improve his ambulatory function. <em>Id. </em>at 124, 177 n. 1. In June 2010, Mr. Galbreath went to Goodholm Park to perform his morning physical therapy exercises. He wore \u201c[ojversized gray pants, a fitted gray T-shirt, ... a red bandanna,\u201d and \u201chigh-heel shoe[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. He also carried a walking cane roughly 3 feet in length and a large red handbag.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Upon arriving at the park, Mr. Gal-breath began singing and performing dance moves using his cane. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Galbreath fielded a call from a friend and began laughing loudly. <em>See id. </em>at 133, 288. A woman called 911 to report she was at the park with her grandchildren and concerned about a \u201cman in high heels with a big stick and a purse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152 (recording of 911 call).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">Officer Kevin Parton of the Oklahoma City Police Department responded to the 911 call. After arriving, he found Mr. Galbreath wearing high heels and carrying a cane. When the officer asked Mr. Gal-breath what he was doing at the park, Mr. Galbreath explained that he was doing his \u201cmorning exercises\u201d and demonstrated a short choreographed ballet sequence using his walking cane. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">According to Mr. Galbreath, Officer Par-ton \u201cgrabbed\u201d Mr. Galbreath\u2019s arm, twisted it up \u201cabove [his] head to where it hurt\u201d and escorted Mr. Galbreath to the police car. <em>Id. </em>at 134. Officer Parton searched Mr. Galbreath\u2019s red bag and found an air pistol. After handcuffing Mr. Galbreath as a \u201cprecautionary measure\u201d and running a warrant check, Officer Parton learned that Mr. Galbreath had no outstanding arrest warrants or any criminal background. <em>Id. </em>at 160,179.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Officer Parton recounted that, save for two tennis players, the other people in the park had gathered by the playground equipment and were no longer involved in \u201copen play.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He presumed they were afraid of Mr. Galbreath. <em>See id. </em>Officer Parton\u2019s arrest report, however, did not reflect this observation. Rather, it merely suggested he observed \u201cseveral adult women accompanied by approximately] 8 to 10 children,\u201d who \u201cwere playing on the playground equipment,\u201d roughly \u201c20 yards from\u201d Mr. Galbreath\u2019s location. <em>Id. </em>at 160. Nothing in the arrest report suggests Officer Parton spoke with any of these individuals to confirm whether they were in fact alarmed, and the 911 caller testified in her deposition that she had never met Officer Parton before. <em>See id. </em>at 157. And although Officer Par-ton asserted in his arrest report that he asked Mr. Galbreath if he had a \u201clegit[i]mate purpose\u201d for being in the park, <em>id. </em>at 160, Mr. Galbreath disputes this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Officer Parton arrested Mr. Galbreath for \u201cdisorderly conduct\u201d under Oklahoma City Municipal Code \u00a7 30-81 (b), which defines the offense as \u201ccaus[ing] public alarm without justification.\u201d Although the City initially charged Mr. Galbreath under the ordinance, it later dismissed the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On October 12, 2011, Mr. Galbreath sued Officer Parton and Oklahoma City under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in Oklahoma state court, alleging several violations of federal law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Mr. Galbreath filed an amended complaint in which he argued (1) Officer Parton arrested him without probable cause and (2) the City\u2019s disorderly conduct ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint sought damages, declaratory relief, and an injunction prohibiting the City from enforcing \u00a7 30-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">The City unsuccessfully moved to dismiss Mr. Galbreath\u2019s claims for injunctive relief. After discovery, Officer Parton moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds and the City moved for summary judgment on Mr. Galbreath\u2019s municipal liability claims. Mr. Galbreath moved for declaratory judgment on his claims against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The court denied Mr. Galbreath\u2019s motion and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. It first determined that Mr. Galbreath lacked standing to seek prospective relief\u2014either declaratory or in-junctive\u2014because he did not allege a credible threat of future prosecution under the ordinance. The court therefore denied Mr. Galbreath\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment on these claims and dismissed them with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>The district court next granted Officer Parton\u2019s request for qualified immunity, concluding he had probable cause to arrest Mr. Galbreath and any violation of Mr. Galbreath\u2019s rights was not otherwise clearly established.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Finally, the court granted summary judgment in the City\u2019s favor on Mr. Gal-breath\u2019s remaining void-for-vagueness claim for damages and retrospective declaratory relief. The court first concluded he could not bring a facial vagueness challenge because he was not seeking pre-enforcement review and failed to allege the ordinance threatened constitutionally protected activity. Left to address an as-applied due process vagueness claim, the district court determined Mr. Galbreath had sufficient notice that his behavior could have fallen within the ordinance\u2019s description of prohibited conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Accordingly, the district court dismissed Mr. Galbreath\u2019s case. Mr. Galbreath now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">On appeal, Mr. Galbreath has abandoned most of his claims from the district court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his opening brief, Mr. Gal-breath contends the district court erred by (A) granting Officer Parton qualified immunity on his Fourth Amendment claim and (B) concluding that Oklahoma City\u2019s disorderly conduct statute was not void-for-vagueness in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We address these arguments in turn after discussing our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, \u201cusing the same standard applied by the district court pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).\u201d <em>Cilio v. City of Greenwood Village, </em>739 F.3d 451, 461 (10th Cir.2013); <em>see also Tabor v. Hilti, Inc., </em>703 F.3d 1206, 1215 (10th Cir.2013). We must \u201cview facts in the light most favorable to\u201d the non-moving party, Mr. Galbreath, \u201cresolving all factual disputes and reasonable inferences\u201d in his favor. <em>Cilio, </em>739 F.3d at 461. Summary judgment shall be granted if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\u201d and the moving party is \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>see also Cilio, </em>739 F.3d at 461. \u201cA fact is material if, under governing law, it could [affect] the outcome of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Cilio, </em>739 F.3d at 461 (quoting <em>EEOC v. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp., </em>220 F.3d 1184, 1190 (10th Cir.2000)). A factual dispute is \u201cgenuine if a rational jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party on the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">A. <em>Qualified Immunity for Officer Parton on the Fourth Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">At summary judgment, courts must grant qualified immunity unless the plaintiff meets a two-part burden to \u201cshow (1) a reasonable jury could find facts supporting a violation of a constitutional right, which (2) was clearly established at the time of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Estate of Boole-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>er v. Gomez, </em>745 F.3d 405, 411 (10th Cir.2014); <em>see also Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (asking whether \u201ca violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions\u201d), <em>receded from on other grounds by Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). Courts may \u201cexercise their sound discretion in deciding which of the two\u201d steps of the \u201cqualified immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances in the particular case at hand.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>555 U.S. at 236, 129 S.Ct. 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Because Mr. Galbreath fails to meet the second step, we need not and do not reach the first. His opening brief makes no mention of clearly established law, and at oral argument, his counsel acknowledged that he cannot point to any clearly established federal law giving Officer Parton notice that the arrest was unconstitutional. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. Recording (10:10-11:05). Indeed, when asked whether he had \u201cjust conceded that the law wasn\u2019t clearly established,\u201d Mr. Gal-breath\u2019s counsel responded, \u2018Yes Your Honor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(10:10-10:23). Mr. Galbreath therefore fails to meet his burden to show that Officer Parton\u2019s actions violated clearly established law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We therefore proceed to Mr. Galbreath\u2019s void-for-vagueness claim against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">B. <em>Void-for-Vagueness Claim against the City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Mr. Galbreath\u2019s remaining claim seeks to hold Oklahoma City liable because the disorderly conduct ordinance was void for vagueness as applied. In his amended complaint, Mr. Galbreath requested damages as well as a \u201cdeclaration that Oklahoma City Ordinance 30-81 is unconstitutionally void for vagueness on its face and as applied by [Officer] Parton in violation of the Due Process Clause.\u201d Aplt. Appx., Yol. I at 37. At oral argument, however, Mr. Galbreath\u2019s counsel abandoned his challenge to the ordinance\u2019s facial validity. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. Recording (4:00M:07, 6:07-6:28).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Our consideration of Mr. Galbreath\u2019s void-for-vagueness claim is therefore limited to (1) whether the City may be held liable under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), for an as-applied violation, and if so, (2) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the City on the merits. <em>See Collins v. City of Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 120, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (resolving \u00a7 1983 claims against municipalities requires consideration of whether \u201cthe city is responsible\u201d for harm \u201ccaused by a constitutional violation\u201d). Mindful that Mr. Galbreath need only raise a genuine dispute of material fact answer both questions in the affirmative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">1. Municipal Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">The City argues \u201ceven if the ordinance was vague as applied to [Mr.] Galbreath\u2019s specific behavior, the City may not be held liable because [it] does not maintain a policy of applying the ordinance in an unconstitutional manner.\u201d Okla. City Aplee. Br. at 27. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">Our precedent forecloses the City\u2019s argument. We have held that an as-applied challenge to an ordinance can give rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>municipal liability. In <em>Christensen v. Park City Mun. Corp., </em>554 F.3d 1271 (10th Cir.2009), Park City police officers arrested the plaintiff for selling artwork on public property without a license in violation of two city ordinances. <em>See id. </em>at 1274. The plaintiff sued Park City for damages and declaratory relief, alleging the ordinances were unconstitutional as applied to his expressive activity in \"violation of the First Amendment. <em>See id. </em>The district court granted Park City\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning the city could not be held liable for a single unlawful application of an otherwise constitutional ordinance. <em>See id. </em>at 1274-75; <em>see also Christensen v. Park City Mun. Corp., </em>No. 2:06-CV-202 TS, 2007 WL 2908288, at * 1 (D.Utah Oct. 3, 2007) (\u201c[A] city will not automatically be liable under \u00a7 1983 if one of its employees happened to apply a constitutional policy in an unconstitutional manner....\u201d (quotations and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We reversed, reasoning \u201c[i]f it turns out that the relevant ordinances are unconstitutional, whether on their face <em>or as applied </em>to Mr. Christensen, the liability falls on the city.\u201d <em>Christensen, </em>554 F.3d at 1279 (emphasis added). We concluded municipal entities \u201cmay be subject to liability under \u00a7 1983\u201d if they \u201cmake[] and enforce[ ] a law that is unconstitutional as applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Here, \u201cthere is no question\u201d Oklahoma City\u2019s disorderly conduct ordinance, like the \u201ccity ordinances\u201d at issue in <em>Christensen, </em>\u201crefleet[s] the \u2018official policy\u2019 of the municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279; <em>see also Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (\u201cordinance\u201d); <em>Connick v. Thompson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1350, 1359, 179 L.Ed.2d 417 (2011) (\u201c[o]fficial municipal policy\u201d includes the \u201cdecisions of a government\u2019s lawmakers\u201d). Officer Parton arrested Mr. Gal-breath for violating the ordinance. <em>See </em>Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 191 (police report asserting that Mr. Galbreath \u201cwas placed under arrest for disorderly conduct\u201d), 197 (citation alleging Mr. Galbreath \u201ccommitted]\u201d the \u201coffense\u201d of \u201cDisorderly Conduct\u201d). Consequently, if the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Gal-breath\u2019s conduct, then Oklahoma City \u201cmay be subject to liability under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Christensen, </em>554 F.3d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">2. Vagueness As Applied</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on Mr. Galbreath\u2019s as applied vagueness claim de novo. <em>See United States v. Protex Indus., </em>874 F.2d 740, 743 (10th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe question of whether a statute has been rendered unconstitutionally vague as applied is a question involving issues of law.\u201d); see <em>also Faustin v. City, Cnty. of Denver, Colo., </em>268 F.3d 942, 947 (10th Cir.2001) (reviewing grant of summary judgment on vagueness claim de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">\u201cTo satisfy due process, \u2018a penal statute [must] define the criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2927-28, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010) (quoting <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983)). For an as-applied vagueness challenge, we must tether our analysis to the factual context in which the ordinance was applied. <em>See United States v. Franklin-El, </em>554 F.3d 903, 910 (10th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause this is an as-applied challenge, we consider this statute in light of the charged conduct.\u201d). At summary judgment, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party\u2014here, Mr. Galbreath. <em>See, e.g., Cil-io v. City of Greenwood Village, </em>739 F.3d 451, 461 (10th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The City\u2019s ordinance provides: \u201cA person is guilty of disorderly conduct, a Class \u2018a\u2019 offense, when such person: ... causes public alarm without justification.\u201d City of Oklahoma City, Ordinance No. 22210, \u00a7 30-81(b) (adopted May 6, 2003). The ordinance does not define \u201cpublic alarm\u201d or \u201cwithout justification,\u201d and the parties have not pointed us to an Oklahoma case construing these terms. \u201cWe are thus relegated, at best, to the words of the ordinance itself.\u201d <em>Coates v. City of Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971); <em>see also City of Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 68, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (O\u2019Con-nor, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e cannot impose a limiting instruction that a state supreme court has declined to adopt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Mr. Galbreath contends this language was unconstitutionally vague as applied to his activity in the park because (1) it failed to give adequate notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that his conduct was unlawful and (2) ceded too much enforcement discretion to Officer Parton. Because we conclude the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the City on the adequate notice element, we do not consider whether the ordinance ceded too much enforcement discretion to Officer Parton.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In evaluating the adequate notice element, we must determine whether a reasonable person in Mr. Galbreath\u2019s position would have \u201c \u2018fair notice from the language\u2019 of the [ordinance] \u2018that the particular conduct which he engaged in was punishable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>745 F.3d 1027, 1031 (10th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 755, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974)); <em>see also United States v. Harris, </em>705 F.3d 929, 932 (9th Cir.2012) (\u201cIn an as-applied challenge, a statute is unconstitutionally vague if it fails to put a defendant on notice that his conduct was criminal. For statutes involving criminal sanctions the requirement for clarity is enhanced.\u201d (quotations and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">In granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Mr. Galbreath\u2019s as-applied vagueness claim, the district court reasoned briefly as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">For no apparent reason, plaintiff was behaving in a public place in an alarming or disconcerting manner. When given the opportunity to explain, plaintiff replied \u201cmy morning exercises\u201d and proceeded immediately with conduct which a reasonable person might have viewed as threatening, or at least as something other than an ordinary \u201cmorning exercise.\u201d While plaintiffs arrest, under the circumstances as we now know them to be, was perhaps unfortunate, it did not violate his due process rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\"><em>Galbreath v. City of Oklahoma City, </em>No. CIV-11-1336-HE, 2012 WL 5289456, at *8 (W-D.Okla. Oct. 24, 2012). On its face, the district court\u2019s analysis points to denying summary judgment, not granting it. If a reasonable person \u201cmight\u201d have viewed Mr. Galbreath\u2019s activity in the park as \u201cthreatening\u201d or \u201csomething other than\u201d ordinary morning exercises, then a reasonable person could also conclude Mr. Gal-breath\u2019s conduct was neither threatening nor out of the ordinary. The district court\u2019s analysis turned well-established principles of summary judgment on their head.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">Mr. Galbreath testified he was singing and doing ballet exercises in high-heel shoes as a form of physical therapy to relieve pain from a hip disorder. He exercised with the assistance of a roughly 3-foot-long cane. He twirled his cane for a few seconds in a choreographed dance move when Officer Parton confronted him. At that time, Mr. Galbreath had been at the park about five minutes. Despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>these facts, the district court concluded Mr. Galbreath \u201cwas behaving in a public place in an alarming or disconcerting manner.\u201d <em>Galbreath, </em>2012 WL 5289456, at *8. In doing so, \u201cthe court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion.\u201d <em>Talan v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1867-68, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Galbreath, a reasonable jury could conclude he lacked fair notice that his conduct in the park could lead to criminal sanctions under the City\u2019s disorderly conduct ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">First, nothing in the plain language of the ordinance suggests that singing and performing choreographed ballet moves in the park with a 3-foot cane while wearing high heels would cause \u201cpublic alarm.\u201d <em>See </em>American Heritage Dictionary 39 (5th ed.2011) (defining \u201calarm\u201d as \u201c[sjudden fear or concern caused by the realization of danger or an impending setback\u201d); <em>see also Bell v. Keating, </em>697 F.3d 445, 462 (7th Cir.2012) (holding that the term \u201calarm,\u201d as used in a municipal ordinance, was unconstitutionally vague in part because it failed to give individuals of common comprehension notice of the prohibited conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Second, the ordinance\u2019s plain language failed to give Mr. Galbreath notice that any public alarm caused by these morning exercises would be \u201cwithout justification.\u201d <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009) (defining \u201cjustification\u201d as \u201c[a] lawful or sufficient reason for one\u2019s acts or omissions\u201d); <em>cf. Morales, </em>527 U.S. at 56-57, 119 S.Ct. 1849 (plurality op.) (ordinance forbidding \u201cremaining] in any one place with no apparent purpose\u201d unconstitutionally vague in part because it failed to give adequate notice); <em>Jim Crockett Promotion, Inc. v. City of Charlotte, </em>706 F.2d 486, 489 (4th Cir.1983) (holding, without any \u201cdifficulty,\u201d \u201cthat the term \u2018unnecessary\" in the general prohibitory language of the Ordinance [was] unconstitutionally vague\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Third, the ordinance lacks a scienter requirement, which could have mitigated the indefiniteness of the other terms when applied to Mr. Galbreath\u2019s conduct. <em>See Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S.Ct. 2480, 147 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000) (fair notice concerns can be \u201cameliorated\u201d by the fact that the challenged statute \u201ccontains a scienter requirement\u201d); <em>United States v. Gaudreau, </em>860 F.2d 357, 360 (10th Cir.1988) (\u201c[A] scienter requirement may mitigate a criminal law\u2019s vagueness by ensuring that it punishes only those who are aware their conduct is unlawful.\u201d); <em>Stahl v. City of St. Louis, </em>687 F.3d 1038, 1041 (8th Cir.2012) (holding that an ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in part because it lacked a scienter requirement in that violation turned on the reactions of third parties rather than the individual whose actions were involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Given the foregoing, a reasonable jury could find the ordinance failed to give a reasonable person in Mr. Galbreath\u2019s position \u201cfair notice ... that the particular conduct which he engaged in was punishable.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>745 F.3d at 1031 (quotations omitted). In concluding otherwise, the district court \u201cfailed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to [Mr. Galbreath] with respect to the central facts of this case,\u201d <em>Tolan, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1866. Perhaps facts will emerge on remand establishing Mr. Galbreath had adequate notice his conduct was unlawful. We express no opinion on that matter or whether the ordinance ceded too much enforcement discretion to Officer Parton in this instance. <em>See Yellowbear v. Lampert, </em>741 F.3d 48, 64 (10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Cir.2014) (\u201cFor now, however, these subtler (and admittedly more difficult) questions remain for the parties and district court to consider on remand.\u201d). We merely hold that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the City at this juncture because a reasonable jury could find Mr. Galbreath lacked fair notice that his conduct could be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we (1) affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment grant of qualified immunity to Officer Par-ton and (2) reverse its summary judgment grant to the City on Mr. Galbreath\u2019s as-applied void-for-vagueness claim. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\">. Because this case comes to us from summary judgment, we recite the facts \"in the light most favorable to\u201d the non-moving party, Mr. Galbreath, \"resolving all factual disputes and reasonable inferences\u201d in his favor. <em>Cilio v. City of Greenwood Village, </em>739 F.3d 451, 461 (10th Cir.2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-17\">. Although the recording of the 911 call is garbled, the transcript states the caller thought Mr. Galbreath was \"drunk.\u201d Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. We draw this statement from Officer Par-ton\u2019s response to Mr. Galbreath\u2019s interrogatories during the discovery conducted in the district court. <em>See </em>Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 161\u2014 68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\">. Mr. Galbreath also asserted a claim under the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act, but it is not relevant to this appeal. <em>See </em>Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 76, 241, 369.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\">. In his amended complaint, Mr. Galbreath also alleged (1) Officer Parton violated the First Amendment by arresting Mr. Galbreath for engaging in protected expression and (2) the City's ordinance violates the First Amendment because of its overbreadth. The district court determined Mr. Galbreath \"confessed\u201d the first claim by failing to rebut Officer Par-ton's motion on that issue and affirmatively abandoned the second in his response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 365-66.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">. As noted above, <em>see supra </em>note 5, Mr. Gal-breath withdrew his First Amendment over-breadth claim in the summary judgment briefing before the district court. <em>See </em>Aplt. Appx., Vol. I at 312. Additionally, the district court determined that Mr. Galbreath conceded his First Amendment free expression claim by failing to respond to Officer Parton\u2019s motion <em>an </em>that issue. <em>See id. </em>at 365 &amp; n. 22. Mr. Galbreath does not press either argument on appeal. Nor does he challenge the district court\u2019s rejection of his plea for prospective relief. <em>See </em>Oral Arg. Recording (6:14-6:20). We therefore do not consider any of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. In reaching this conclusion, we express no opinion on whether Mr. Galbreath has satisfied the first step of the qualified immunity inquiry\u2014that a reasonable jury could find Officer Parton lacked probable cause to arrest Mr. Galbreath for disorderly conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b562-17\">. In doing so, we express no opinion on the ordinance\u2019s facial validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b566-16\">. We agree with the parties that the appendix documents containing medical information about the appellant and not pertinent to the merits of this appeal should remain under seal. <em>See Eugene S. v.
