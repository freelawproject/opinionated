Appellants Capala Brothers, Inc., Pawel Capala, and Robert Capala now appeal a host of orders and decisions issued before, during, and after trial, as well as the judgment entered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the District Court. For substantially the same reasons as the District Court below, we affirm the District Court\u2019s orders and judgment on appeal. Appellant Felipe Or-ner also appeals an order of the district court imposing sanctions upon him. Again, for substantially the same reasons as the District Court below, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order as to Orner. We have considered all of Appellants\u2019 remaining arguments\u2014including their challenge to the district court\u2019s impartiality\u2014and have found them to be waived or without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court and the order as to Orner are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
