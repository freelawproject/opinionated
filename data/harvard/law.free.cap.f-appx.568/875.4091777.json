After review, we: (1) affirm the dismissal with prejudice as to Defendants the United States, the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), the Department of State, the six state defendants, Anthony Scalia, Jim Bruinsma, Steven Berger, David Forteza, Amanda Curet, Jose Martin, as well as the federal defendants, Perry Cuocci, Matthew Foster, Thomas T. Riley, Robert P. Jackson, Donald E. Gonneville, Donald Baily, Jimmy Arroyo, Ken Bradley, Shamus Skelly, Scott McLel-lun, Lanny A. Breuer and Michael Reigle, sued in their official capacities; and (2) vacate in part and remand so the district court can amend the judgment to dismiss without prejudice the claims against Defendants Cuocci, Foster, Riley, Jackson, Gonneville, Baily, Arroyo, Bradley, Skelly, Mclellun, Breuer, and Reigle, sued in their individual capacities, whom Kabbaj never served.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">A. Dismissal of Original Complaint Without Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In this civil rights action, Kabbaj filed a total of five complaints, all of which in essence allege that federal and state officials: (1) conspired for almost two decades to thwart him from solving innumerable crimes, preventing terrorist attacks, and revealing the location of Osama Bin Laden years before his capture; and (2) prosecuted him, provided confidential information about him to state and foreign governments to facilitate his prosecution and to hospitals in order to have him involuntarily committed, and constantly watched and harassed him. Kabbaj contends that the defendants\u2019 conspiratorial actions violated his equal protection and due process rights; his rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and the Privacy Act; and constituted malicious prosecution, unlawful imprisonment, negligence, and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Kabbaj\u2019s original complaint was 177 pages long, named 156 defendants, and had 122 pages of attached exhibits. The district court dismissed the original complaint without prejudice because, <em>inter alia, </em>it did not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8\u2019s requirement for a short and plain statement of his claims. The district court explained that Kabbaj\u2019s complaint was repetitive, provided a lot of irrelevant information, contained concluso-ry allegations, \u201clumped together\u201d conspiracy allegations \u201cso that the individual defendants [did] not have adequate notice of what [were] the specific allegations against each of them,\u201d and was so large that it was \u201ca daunting task for each defendant to comprehend exactly what factual allegations relate[d] to each of [Kabbaj\u2019s] causes of action.\u201d The district court gave Kabbaj leave to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">B. Dismissal of Second Amended Complaint Without Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Kabbaj filed an amended complaint that was 126 pages long and named 150 defendants. Shortly thereafter, Kabbaj filed a nearly identical, second amended complaint with the court\u2019s permission. The second amended complaint was 131 pages long and named 152 defendants. The district court dismissed the second amended complaint without prejudice, again for failure to comply with Rule 8. The district court noted that the second amended complaint contained 372 paragraphs, was repetitive, and contained irrelevant information. The court explained that the second amended complaint was a classic \u201cshotgun\u201d complaint, in which Kabbaj had \u201clump[ed] his allegations against the defendants together, even though it [was] clear that they could not all have committed the same acts.\u201d The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>granted Kabbaj leave to file a third amended complaint to cure the noted deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">C. Kabbaj\u2019s Fourth Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Kabbaj filed a third amended complaint and then an identical fourth amended complaint. Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint, which is the focus of this appeal, contained the same, albeit condensed, allegations as the preceding four complaints. Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint was 78 pages long, contained 213 numbered paragraphs, and named 28 defendants, including four federal entities\u2014the United States, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of State; twelve agents and officers of those federal agencies and six state officials in their individual and official capacities; and six \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Throughout, the fourth amended complaint refers to the defendants collectively, such as \u201cthe Defendants,\u201d the \u201cNamed Defendants,\u201d the \u201cFederal Defendants,\u201d or \u201c[e]ach Defendant named in this Complaint,\u201d but does not identify what allegedly unlawful action each defendant took with respect to each claim. Instead, in the portion of the complaint addressing Kab-baj\u2019s \u201cCAUSES OF ACTION,\u201d the fourth amended complaint \u201cincorporates all the above stated paragraphs\u201d containing factual allegations replete with collective aver-ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Kabbaj failed to perfect service upon the twelve federal employees sued in their individual capacities and never identified or served the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants. Affidavits reflect that a process server delivered a copy of the summons and complaint to the authorized agent for each of the twelve federal employees\u2019 respective agencies. Kabbaj moved for an extension of time to serve the individual federal defendants. Kabbaj stated that he had served the twelve defendants at their respective places of business, but he acknowledged that this service was inadequate because he was suing those defendants in their individual capacities. Kabbaj requested more time to discover the home address of the twelve defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The served defendants moved to strike or dismiss Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint because, <em>inter alia, </em>Kabbaj had failed to comply with the district court\u2019s prior orders to cure the deficiencies in his complaint, which still violated Rule 8\u2019s requirement of a short, plain statement of his claims. In his responses to the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, Kabbaj continued to refer to the defendants collectively, such as the \u201cOriginal Defendants,\u201d the \u201cpre-911 Defendants,\u201d and the \u201cpos1&gt;-911 Defendants,\u201d without identifying each defendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct related to each specific claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">D. Dismissal of Fourth Amended Complaint With Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">The district court dismissed Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint with prejudice, citing Kabbaj\u2019s failure to cure the specifically identified pleading deficiencies noted in its prior two dismissal orders. In particular, the district court determined that the complaint \u201ccontinue[d] to run afoul of\u2019 Rule 8, was repetitive, and contained \u201clargely irrelevant factual assertions\u201d that were asserted against the defendants \u201clump[ed] ... together, even though it is clear that they could not all have committed the same acts.\u201d The district court noted that the counts, although labeled, incorporated by reference all the previous factual allegations, and made conclusory allegations without \u201ca factual basis or information needed to state a claim against each Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>The district court concluded that Kab-baj\u2019s fourth amended complaint was \u201cstill a shotgun pleading\u201d that \u201cd[id] not permit any of the Defendants to adequately answer the allegations charged against them.\u201d The district court further found that Kabbaj\u2019s allegations of a decades-long conspiracy to prevent Kabbaj from thwarting terrorist attacks or disclosing Bin Laden\u2019s location, without more, were implausible. The district court explained that it was dismissing the fourth amended complaint with prejudice because Kabbaj had \u201cfiled five Complaints over two years and there is no indication that a sixth complaint could state a valid cause of action and cure the deficiencies identified in the dismissal orders entered in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In granting the motions to dismiss, the district court denied as moot all pending motions, including Kabbaj\u2019s motion for an extension of time to effect service.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">A. Rule 8</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Under Rule 8(a)(2), a complaint \u201cmust contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Rule 8(a)(2)\u2019s purpose is to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). Therefore, \u201ca complaint\u2019s factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 974 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Further, the allegations in the complaint \u201cmust be simple, concise, and direct,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(d)(1), and the complaint must \u201cstate its claims ... in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 10(b). A \u201cshotgun pleading\u201d\u2014 one in which \u201cit is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief\u2019\u2014does not comply with the standards of Rules 8(a) and 10(b). <em>Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Ctr. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366-67 (11th Cir.1996); <em>see also Magluta v. Samples, </em>256 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). This Court has repeatedly condemned shotgun pleadings. <em>See PVC Windoors, Inc. v. Babbitbay Beach Constr., N.V., </em>598 F.3d 802, 806 n. 4 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Davis, </em>516 F.3d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Where a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim, a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff \u201cmust be given at least one chance to amend the complaint before the district court dismisses the action with prejudice.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Dupree, </em>252 F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Bank v. Pitt, </em>928 F.2d 1108, 1112 (11th Cir.1991), <em>overruled in part by Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (en banc) (concluding that the district court is not require to <em>sua sponte </em>grant leave to counseled plaintiffs, but noting that its holding does not disturb a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s opportunity to amend under <em>Bank v. Pitt). </em>A district court, however, is not required to permit amendment if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthere has been ... repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>252 F.3d at 1163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>(citing <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">B. Served Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Here, as to the defendants who were served and filed responsive pleadings, the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice was not an abuse of discretion. Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint is 78 pages long and contains 213 numbered paragraphs. The first 66 pages of the complaint consist of 179 paragraphs of factual allegations. In the portion of the complaint labeled \u201ccauses of action,\u201d the complaint incorporates by reference all of those 179 paragraphs of factual allegations, without identifying which factual allegations relate to which claims. Moreover, the complaint refers to the defendants collectively, making it impossible to identify which particular defendant engaged in what allegedly wrongful conduct. In other words, Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint is a classic shotgun pleading. <em>See Anderson, </em>77 F.3d at 366. As such, it does not comply with Rule 8(a), and the district court properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Kabbaj argues that, due to his <em>pro se </em>status and the seriousness of his allegations, he should have been allowed to amend his fourth amended complaint to cure any pleading deficiencies. Although <em>\u201cpro se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and thus are construed liberally,\u201d <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008), this liberal construction \u201cdoes not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted), <em>overruled, on other grounds by Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Even a <em>pro se </em>litigant is required to comply with the rules of procedure, <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993), particularly after twice being expressly directed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Kabbaj had already filed four deficient complaints. The district court gave Kab-baj two prior opportunities to cure the Rule 8 deficiencies, but he failed to do so. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Kabbaj\u2019s fourth amended complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">C. Unserved Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">On appeal, Kabbaj argues that he should be given an opportunity to seek an entry of default against the twelve federal defendants sued in their individual capacities. Kabbaj\u2019s argument is based on the faulty premise that he properly served them.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">Kabbaj attempted to serve these twelve individual federal defendants by serving the registered agents for their respective federal agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, neither Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e) nor the law of Florida or the District of Columbia (where the district court is located and where service was made, respectively) allows for personal service via delivery of the summons and complaint to the registered agent of the defendant\u2019s place of business. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e), (i)(3); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.031; D.C.R.C.P. 4(e)(1), (2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Consequently, as Kabbaj acknowledged in the district court, he failed to perfect personal service on these defendants to the extent they were sued in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Furthermore, while the United States filed a motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint, it did so representing only itself, the three named federal agencies, and the individual federal defendants sued in their official capacities. The motion to dismiss the fourth amended complaint explicitly stated that, to the extent the twelve individual federal defendants were sued in their individual capacities, they had not been properly served and did not \u201crespond to the Complaint at this time.\u201d Thus, the twelve federal defendants sued in their individual capacities never entered an appearance or filed a motion or other responsive pleading that waived insufficient service of process. <em>See In re Worldwide Web Sys., Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1291, 1299-1300 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that where service of process is insufficient, the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant and has no power to render a judgment against that defendant unless the objection to personal jurisdiction was waived in a pre-answer motion or other responsive pleading or by general appearance).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Because Kabbaj did not properly serve these twelve individual federal defendants, the district court lacked jurisdiction to dismiss the individual-capacity claims against them with prejudice. <em>See Pardazi v. Cullman Med. Ctr., </em>896 F.2d 1313, 1317 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that service of process is a jurisdictional requirement); Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m) (providing that where the plaintiff fails to execute service, the district court \u201cmust dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time\u201d). Further, because on appeal Kabbaj does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for an extension of time to effect service, he has abandoned this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice as to the served defendants. We vacate the judgment with respect to the twelve unserved federal defendants and remand for the purpose of amending the judgment to show that the dismissal of the individual-capacity claims against those twelve defendants is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">. <em>Bivens v.
