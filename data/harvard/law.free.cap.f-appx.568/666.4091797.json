Rease challenges the dismissal of her complaint, an order that compelled her to respond to requests by MHM for discovery, and an award of $15, 565.47 to MHM. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Rease\u2019s amended complaint. Dismissal of a complaint is an appropriate sanction \u201cwhen a plaintiffs recalcitrance is due to wilfulness, bad faith or fault,\u201d <em>Phipps v. Blakeney, 8 </em>F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.1993), and the record supports the finding that Rease deliberately and defiantly refused to comply with orders of the district court. On October 17, 2012, a magistrate judge granted the motion of MHM to compel discovery based on evidence that, for several months, Rease had submitted partial responses to discovery requests and refused to provide further discovery materials, despite obtaining extensions to do so. When Rease failed to comply with the October 17 order or to contact MHM, it moved to dismiss Rease\u2019s complaint. On May 15, 2013, the district court denied the motion to dismiss and imposed the lesser sanctions that Rease comply with the October 17 order within ten days and pay more than $9,000 in attorneys fees to MHM. Rease again failed to comply, and Rease acknowledged some of her misconduct in response to the renewed motion of MHM to dismiss Rease\u2019s complaint. The district court reasonably determined that dismissal was an appropriate sanction for Rease\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by granting the motion of MHM to compel Rease to comply discovery requests. Rease challenges the finding that MHM satisfied its duty to confer before filing its motion to compel, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(a)(1), but MHM attached to its motion a letter and three emails warning that it would file a motion to compel if Rease\u2019s attorney failed to comply with discovery requests. Rease even concedes that MHM \u201cattempt[ed] to talk to\u201d her attorney. The district court did not clearly err in finding that MHM attempted to confer with Rease before filing the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">Rease also waived her challenge to the award of $15,565.47 to MHM. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>MHM filed its renewed motion to dismiss, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the motion and award $15, 565.47 to MHM for the attorney\u2019s fees and expenses related to its first motion to dismiss. A few days later, MHM petitioned for an award of $10, 346.97 for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses associated with their renewed motion to dismiss. Rease responded that the district court would be \u201cduplicating] the award\u201d if it were to give $10,346.47 to MHM after \u201csanctioning] counsel $15,0000 already.\u201d Because Rease never contested the award of $15, 565.47 to MHM, we will not consider the propriety of the award for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Rease\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
