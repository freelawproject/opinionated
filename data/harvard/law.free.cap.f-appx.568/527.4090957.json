R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Oscar Alberto Sanabria Alvarado (\u201cSan-abria Alvarado\u201d), a native and citizen of El Salvador, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). His wife and three children are derivative beneficiaries of his application. Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must demonstrate either that he has suffered persecution in the country of removal or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution there. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). Substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the mistreatment Sanabria Alvarado claims to have suffered in El Salvador\u2014consisting largely of unspecific threats\u2014does not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). Nor has Sanabria Alvarado established a well-founded fear of future persecution. The past mistreatment was allegedly motivated by Sanabria Alvarado\u2019s involvement in an engineering project. That project was canceled after Sanabria Alvarado\u2019s departure from El Salvador, and he has presented no evidence that other project participants have been victimized in the years since the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">Because Sanabria Alvarado cannot meet his burden of proof for asylum, he necessarily fails to meet the higher burden of proof for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (requiring an applicant for CAT relief to establish that torture is more likely than not upon removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-18\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b552-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
