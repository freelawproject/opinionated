R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Brian V. Stacy appeals his convictions for threatening to murder a federal judge in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B), and transmitting a death threat in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). These convictions were the result of Stacy\u2019s sending two threatening emails to a federal judge in 2011. The sole issue presented on appeal is whether there was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to conclude that the e-mails were objectively threatening. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The Honorable John Edwards Conway, Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, presided over several criminal matters concerning Brian Stacy. All told, Judge Conway sentenced Stacy to imprisonment three times between 2006 and 2008\u2014once for possessing an unregistered firearm, and twice for violating the conditions of his supervised release. On the third occasion, Judge Conway sentenced Stacy to two years\u2019 imprisonment for threatening to murder his federal probation officer. Stacy was released from prison on April 16, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">On Sunday, June 12, 2011, at 9:18 p.m., Stacy sent the following e-mail to Judge Conway\u2019s e-mail address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\">John Conway,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-16\">I spent over four years in prison for a crime I did not committe and I did not appreciate being arrested by faggott litte cowards and Charlotte Woods standing there watching as some queers were arresting me and I wanted to let you know that every time I get violent revenge on a little midget queer like yourself I am going to email you and the UN because I do not like the church of satan advertizing on my campus or char-lotte getting fucked in every hole when I am in a freezing cold jail cell. So a little midget spick like you died today bitch and if you wanted some threats you got it! fuck you!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">Supp. R. at 1. About an hour later, Stacy sent a second e-mail to Judge Conway:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXK\">John Conway,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-18\">I want you to know that because I was arrested on 9/18/2007 by a bunch of fag-gott cowards in front of Charlotte E. Woods a little faggott midgit like yourself is dead you queer!

Fuck you!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">Thank YOu,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Joash Shumpelt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">I joash shumpelt wrote this email.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Prove it spick!!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The subject line in this second email read \u201cI am going to kill you spick.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The following morning, Judge Conway\u2019s administrative assistant opened the emails. Concerned, she immediately notified the U.S. Marshals. A few days later, in an interview with FBI agents, Stacy admitted to sending the e-mails. After the interview, Stacy was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">A grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Stacy with (1) threatening to murder a federal judge on account of the judge\u2019s performance of his official duties, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B), and (2) transmitting a death threat in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). Stacy pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">Trial commenced on March 20, 2013. At the close of the government\u2019s case, Stacy moved for judgment of acquittal, in part, on the ground that the government presented insufficient evidence that the emails were objectively threatening. The court denied the motion, and the jury convicted Stacy on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Stacy raises one issue on appeal. He contends that the government presented insufficient evidence that the e-mails were objectively credible enough to constitute a threat under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 115(a)(1)(B) and 875(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">\u201cWe review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict and the denial of [Stacy\u2019s] motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Vigil, </em>523 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cWe ask whether a reasonable jury could find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing reasonable inferences therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the [government's proof meets this standard, we must defer to the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Vallejos, </em>421 F.3d 1119, 1122 (10th Cir.2005). We note that, \u201c[i]n general, whether a given writing constitutes a threat is an issue of fact for the trial jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>720 F.3d 411, 419 (2d Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-18\">One violates \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B) when he threatens to assault, kidnap, or murder, a United States official, a United States judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or an official whose killing would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>a crime under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114], with intent to impede, intimidate, or interfere with such official, judge, or law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of official duties, or with intent to retaliate against such official, judge, or law enforcement officer on account of the performance of official duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B). In addition, one violates \u00a7 875(c) when he \u201ctransmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">For purposes of both counts, the district court instructed the jury on the definition of \u201cthreat\u201d using the Tenth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">A threat is a serious statement expressing an intention to injure any person which under the circumstances would cause apprehension in a reasonable person as distinguished from mere idle or careless talk, exaggeration or something said in a joking manner. It is not necessary to prove that Mr. Stacy actually intended to carry out the threat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Tr. of Reading of Instr. 11, ECF No. 157; <em>see also </em>R. Vol. 3 at 256; 10th Cir. Pattern Crim. Jury Instr. 2.37 (2011). The test is an objective one. <em>See United States v. Viefhaus, </em>168 F.3d 392, 396 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cIn determining the existence of a threat under similar statutes, we have adopted an objective test.\u201d); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>163 F.3d 1212, 1215-17 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Stefanik, </em>674 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir.2012) (\u201cThe ultimate standard is objective\u2014whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be threatening.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Stacy has no quarrel with the instruction. Rather, Stacy contends that a reasonable person would view the e-mails as \u201cmere idle or careless talk, exaggeration or something said in a joking matter.\u201d Tr. of Reading of Instr. 11, ECF No. 157. According to Stacy, this conclusion follows from the e-mails\u2019 \u201cinfantile ... [and] repetitive use of swear words,\u201d \u201cbasic grammatical errors,\u201d \u201catrocious\u201d spelling, \u201cexcessive[]\u201d use of exclamation marks, and the general \u201csloppiness, immaturity, and idiocy\u201d of the e-mails. Aplt. Br. at 12. \u201cAt most, the [e-mails] are a crude expression of anger by the author.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Further supporting his position, Stacy says, is the fact that he took no additional actions to convey intent to inflict injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">We disagree. The e-mails are vicious and frightening, laced with expletives, racial epithets, and claims that the author had killed others and would kill Judge Conway. The e-mails pinpoint the sources of the author\u2019s rage\u2014prison time served as a result of sentences imposed by Judge Conway and, supposedly, the resulting sexual exploitation of the author\u2019s girlfriend while he was incarcerated\u2014both of which are emotionally\u2014charged subjects that corroborate the credibility of the threats. Furthermore, the misspellings and grammar errors do not diminish the threatening nature of the e-mails; after all, poor spellers commit crimes, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">To the text itself, we can add the reactions of the recipients. <em>See Martin, </em>163 F.3d at 1216 (treating as relevant the recipient\u2019s reactions to a threat); <em>United States v. Schneider, </em>910 F.2d 1569, 1571 (7th Cir.1990) (Posner, J.) (\u201cThe fact that the victim acts as if he believed the threat is evidence that he did believe it, and the fact that he believed it is evidence that it could reasonably be believed and therefore that it <em>is </em>a threat. By this chain of inference, the relevance of the judge\u2019s testimony is established.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Judge Conway, his administrative assistant, and a deputy U.S. Marshal were all concerned by the e-mails. Judge Conway perceived the e-mails as a true threat, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>after reading them he took additional precautions in his day-to-day life to ensure his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">No additional actions by Stacy were necessary to convey an intent to inflict injury on Judge Conway. It is evident from the responses of those reading the e-mails that the emails were perceived as true threats. As the jury instructions stated, \u201c[i]t is not necessary to prove that Mr. Stacy actually intended to carry out the threat.\u201d Tr. of Reading of Instr. 11, ECF No. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In Stacy\u2019s reply brief, he contends by reliance on <em>Schneider </em>and the evidence of the reaction caused by Stacy\u2019s e-mails that we are conflating the objective test under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115(a)(1)(B) into a solely subjective test. The jury, however, had before it the texts of the e-mails <em>and </em>the jury was properly instructed regarding the definition of \u201cthreat\u201d in determining whether a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(b) had been proven. Whether the e-mails were threats within that definition is an objective test. Added to the text in this case was the additional evidence of the subjective reaction caused when the e-mails were read. So not only did the jury have before it statements expressing an intent to injure Judge Conway that <em>would </em>cause apprehension in a reasonable person, the jury also had the additional evidence that the statements did cause apprehension in reasonable persons. In sum, the government presented sufficient evidence that Stacy\u2019s e-mails to Judge Conway would cause apprehension in a reasonable person.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We reject Stacy\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge and AFFIRM the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-12\">.
