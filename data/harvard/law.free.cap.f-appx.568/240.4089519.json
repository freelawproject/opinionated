In October 2013, Spencer filed in the district court a motion to disqualify the district court judge. The district court has not yet acted upon that motion. While a district court judge\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself can be reviewed in this circuit by way of mandamus, <em>see In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1987), the district court here has not thus far refused disqualification. We therefore conclude that Spencer is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">To the extent that Spencer\u2019s mandamus petition may be construed to challenge the district court\u2019s delay in ruling on his disqualification motion, we find the present record does not reveal undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and deny the mandamus petition without prejudice. We also deny Spencer\u2019s motion to strike a letter from this court\u2019s docket. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
