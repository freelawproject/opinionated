As counsel for Mr. Wilson noted at the end of that proceeding, the district court\u2019 explanation of its ruling was \u201cvery thorough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">Through his counsel, Mr. Wilson has offered us a number of arguments against the judgment, but none of them persuade us that summary judgment should not have been entered against his claim. We add our voice to the district court\u2019s on two points. One is that the Sheriff bent over backwards not to put Mr. Wilson in a lower paying position and kept from doing so as long as he responsibly could. We agree with the district court that the Sheriff acted properly and generously as \u201cone would hope and expect an enlightened employer to do,\u201d and nothing he did is properly subject to criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">The other point that we would second is the district court\u2019s finding, that Mr. Wilson is \u201cby all accounts a dedicated public serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>ant,\u201d who wants to keep working in as responsible and challenging position as he can. The mental impairments, the \u201cvery-substantial cognitive deficits\u201d that the objective medical tests show that Mr. Wilson has, were caused by a tumor, seizures, and a stroke, which are not things for which he is being faulted. The issue in this lawsuit is not who, if anyone, is at fault for those disabilities. Instead, the issue is whether the law permitted the Sheriff to demote Mr. Wilson from the position of corrections officer because of serious concerns about whether someone with his disabilities could perform the duties of that position, particularly in an emergency or crisis. We agree with the district court\u2019s resolution of that issue and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
