Hersey Medical Center (\u201cMSHMC\u201d) and dismissing his complaint. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">In early 2011, Khan filed a complaint in the District Court. In his Second Amended Complaint (hereinafter \u201cthe complaint\u201d), Khan alleged that, in retaliation for taking leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act in late 2007 and early 2008, MSHMC failed to renew his residency fellowship in 2010. He also argued that MSHMC treated him differently than the other residents in his program on account of his use of FMLA leave, and he charged MSHMC with breach of contract, tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He sought attorney\u2019s fees, prospective injunctive relief, lost pay, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">MSHMC filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court granted as to all claims except Kharis retaliation claim. After discovery, MSHMC moved for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that (1) a two-year statute of limitations should apply to Kharis claims pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2617(c); (2) Khan had not established a prima facie case of retaliation under the FMLA, as he had not suffered an adverse employment action and had not demonstrated a causal relationship between his FM LA leave and the non-renewal of his residency; and (3) even assuming Khan had established a prima facie case, MSHMC had articulated legitimate non-retaliatory reasons for its decision not to renew Kharis residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Khan then requested three extensions of time to file an opposition to summary judgment, each of which was granted by the District Court. In granting the third extension, the District Court stated that it would be the final extension. On the last day of his third extension, Khan requested a fourth extension. The District Court denied his request and, ruling on the motion for summary judgment, determined that Khan had failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the FM LA. Accordingly, the District Court granted MSHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Khan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review for abuse of discretion the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Kharis motion for an extension. <em>Drippe v. Tobelinski, </em>604 F.3d 778, 779 n. 1, 783 (3d Cir.2010). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment. <em>See Alcoa, Inc. v. United States, </em>509 F.3d 173, 175 (3d Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when the movant demonstrates \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>R.Civ.P. 56(a). For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Khan challenges, first and foremost, the District Court\u2019s decision to deny his fourth request for an extension of time to file a brief in opposition to MSHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. \u201c[M]atters of docket control ... are committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1). In granting Khan\u2019s third request for an extension, the District Court noted that it had already granted two prior requests and that Khan had already had over three months to file his brief in opposition to summary judgment. The District Court then warned that the third extension would be the \u201cfinal extension,\u201d and that, should Khan fail to file his brief in opposition to summary judgment within 20 days of the District Court\u2019s order, the District Court \u201cmay, in its discretion, grant Defendant\u2019s motion and dismiss the case with prejudice.\u201d In light of the number of extensions that Khan received, the amount of time that Khan had to file his opposition brief, and the explicitness of the District Court\u2019s warning that the third extension was to be the final extension, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Khan\u2019s fourth request for an extension of time to file a brief in opposition to summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Khan also alleges that the District Judge was biased against him and treated him \u201cunjustly\u201d by denying his fourth motion for an extension. We note that Khan did not seek recusal in the District Court. In any event, a judge must recuse \u201cif a reasonable man, were he to know all the circumstances, would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. However, \u201ca party\u2019s displeasure with legal rulings does not form an adequate basis for recusal.\u201d <em>Securacomm Consulting, Inc. v. Securacom Inc., </em>224 F.3d 273, 278 (3d Cir.2000). Here, the sole basis for Khan\u2019s allegation of bias is the ruling against him. Moreover, Khan has not shown any appearance of partiality. <em>See Selkridge v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., </em>360 F.3d 155, 166 (3d Cir.2004). The District Judge did not err by failing to recuse himself sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In light of the foregoing, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of MSHMC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. The District Court then properly turned to the merits of MSHMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See e.g., United States v. One Piece of Real Prop., </em>363 F.3d 1099, 1101 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that a district court should not \u201cbase the entry of summary judgment on the mere fact that the motion was unopposed\u201d). However, Khan failed in his briefing to us to raise any challenge to the correctness of the District Court's grant of summary judgment. Thus, that issue is waived. <em>See United States v. Pelullo, </em>399 F.3d 197, 201 n. 2 (3d Cir.2005) (stating that where \"an appellant fails to raise an issue in an appellate brief, even if it was listed in the Notice of Appeal, it is deemed waived\u201d). Similarly, to the extent that Khan wished to appeal the District Court's dismissal of his claims for attorney\u2019s fees, breach of contract, tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, he failed to raise those issues in his appellate brief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
