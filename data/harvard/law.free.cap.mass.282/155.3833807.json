See <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461, 463. The Industrial Accident Board awarded compensation, but the Superior Court dismissed the claim on the ground that no written notice of the injury was given \u201cto the insurer or insured as soon as practicable after the happening thereof\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7\u00a741, 44), and there was no affirmative evidence to warrant a finding \u201cthat the insurer, insured or agent had knowledge of the injury\u201d within the time allowed for giving such written notice <em>(Walkden\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 115), or a finding that \u201cthe insurer was not prejudiced by such want of notice,\u201d either of which would have enabled the proceedings to be maintained notwithstanding the failure to give written notice. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 44. <em>Dorney\u2019s Case, </em>259 Mass. 350. <em>Movitz\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 153. A somewhat similar provision as to the failure seasonably to file a claim for compensation is found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The only evidence tending to dispense with written notice consisted of testimony that after the claimant had turned her wheel and stopped her loom, and had begun to bleed profusely, one Thompson, the \u201csecond boss,\u201d came to the water faucet where she was and advised that she be taken home; and that she did not try to return to work for a month or more, and when she went back to the same employer to obtain work she was not given employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Even if Thompson\u2019s knowledge could be found to be that of the insured <em>(Walkden\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 115, 117; <em>Bergeron\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 366), he had knowledge only of a hemorrhage, a common incident of the claimant\u2019s disease, and not of an \u201cinjury\u201d within the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Bloomfield </em>v. <em>November, </em>223 N. Y. 265. <em>Combes </em>v. <em>Geibel, </em>226 N. Y. 291. <em>Dorney\u2019s Case, </em>259 Mass. 350, is plainly distinguishable. The claimant must, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>rest her case upon the ground that the insurer was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\">Want of notice of an injury may prejudice an insurer by preventing an investigation of the applicability of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, and of the nature and extent of any injury, while the witnesses are still available with memories unfaded and minds uncolored by partisanship. Furthermore, although an employee has a right to be treated by his own physician (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 30), provisions for medical examination (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 45), and medical treatment (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 30), by the insurer remain in the statute, and want of notice may prejudice the insurer by preventing prompt diagnosis and treatment, and consequent speedy and perfect recovery, where the employee is not in fact receiving proper treatment. <em>Burvill </em>v. <em>Vickers, Ltd. </em>[1916] 1 K. B. 180, 188. <em>Combes </em>v. <em>Geibel, </em>226 N. Y. 291. The question is whether the Superior Court was right in ruling that there was no evidence that \u201cthe insurer was not prejudiced by such want of notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The burden of proof, as the statute plainly indicates, is on the claimant to show that the insurer was not prejudiced by the want of notice. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481. <em>Gaffer\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566. For a collection of authorities, see note in 78 Am. L. R. 1269-1280, 1284. In <em>Eydmann </em>v. <em>Premier Accumulator Co. Ltd. </em>114 L. T. Rep. 1065, 1067, Lord Loreburn said, \u201cWhen an issue arises as to whether the employer was prejudiced or was not prejudiced by want of notice, it is just like any other issue of fact . . . the applicant has to prove his case, as everyone has to prove his case who brings it forward in a court of justice; but he is not required to exhaust the possibilities of prejudice and displace them; nor is he bound to demonstrate the negative.\u201d The circumstances, without evidence directed to disproving particular forms of prejudice, may of themselves warrant an inference by the Industrial Accident Board of want of prejudice; but there is no presumption requiring such inference in the absence of affirmative evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>dence of prejudice. Where the statute plainly puts the burden of proof on the claimant, it would be unusual to create by judicial ruling a general presumption in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In cases in which the insurer, or the employer and through him presumptively the insurer, had informal notice of the injury at an early date, a finding of want of prejudice has been supported. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 36. <em>Gerald\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 229. <em>Movitz\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 153. <em>Tingus\u2019s Case, </em>273 Mass. 453. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481. <em>Gaffer\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566. Similar rulings have been made under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 84, \u00a7 18, relating to inaccurate notices of highway accidents, where, however, the word \u201cmisled\u201d is used, instead of \u201cprejudiced.\u201d <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>160 Mass. 474, 479, 482, 483. <em>Wilkey </em>v. <em>Cetlin, </em>252 Mass. 152. <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>269 Mass. 571. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>273 Mass. 456. Even where the existence of prejudice is strongly urged, if the facts are so clear that prompt notice and investigation could not have unearthed anything more favorable to the insurer, prejudice by delaying or hampering investigation is negatived <em>(Howarth </em>v. <em>Clifton &amp; Kersley Coal Co. Ltd. </em>89 L. J. K. B. (N. S.) 1249); but caution must be used in applying this rule, for it is often hard to say, long after the event, that a prompt investigation would not have revealed anything of value. <em>Combes </em>v. <em>Geibel, </em>226 N. Y. 291. <em>White </em>v. <em>Leicestershire Colliery &amp; Pipe Co. </em>101 L. J. K. B. (N. S.) 617. Where the prejudice suggested lies in the loss of opportunity to furnish proper medical treatment, it may be negatived by evidence that proper medical treatment was had by the claimant, or that no medical treatment could have been of service. <em>Gaffer\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566. <em>De Felippo\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In the present case it cannot be said that the natural inference from the testimony is that no prejudice to the insurer resulted from the failure to give due notice of the alleged injury. The delay for nearly five years in this case ordinarily would result in prejudice. <em>Gaffer\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 566. The fact that hemorrhage, the only visible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>indication of the alleged injury, is also a common incident of the disease from which the claimant was suffering, marks this as a case in which speedy investigation was particularly important in order to determine the reality and effect of the alleged injury.Upon the evidence, a finding of want of prejudice could not properly have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
