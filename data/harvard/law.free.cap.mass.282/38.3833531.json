She was paid specific compensation under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 36, and also weekly compensation until December 1, 1929, when she resumed her former work for the same corporation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>She was unable to work as well as before, because her fingers were tender and blunted. On October 31, 1931, she was discharged for lack of work, and has been unable to get work since, although she has diligently sought other employment. The Industrial Accident Board awarded weekly compensation for partial incapacity since October 31, 1931, and the Superior Court entered a decree accordingly. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\">Compensation cannot be awarded for lack of employment due to depressed business or want of demand for labor; diminished earning capacity resulting from the injury must be shown. <em>Korobchuk\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 534. <em>Lavallee\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 538. <em>Riley\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 257. But the finding that the employee\u2019s failure to get work was due in part to \u201cincapacity for work resulting from the injury\u201d (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 35) is not without some support in the evidence. Her hand is obviously maimed, and that fact, without further evidence <em>(O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 456; <em>Percival\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, 54), warrants a conclusion that in many lines of business she would be under a handicap, not only in working <em>(Morrell\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 485; <em>Hurwitz\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 477), but also in obtaining work. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 141. <em>Duprey\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 189. <em>Lacione\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 269. <em>Capone\u2019s Case, </em>239 Mass. 331. <em>Hurwitz\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 477. The employee testified that, in one of the places at which she applied unsuccessfully for employment, she noticed that her hand was being observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
