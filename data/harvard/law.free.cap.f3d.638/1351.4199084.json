This Court affirmed Smith\u2019s sentence based on prior precedent. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>370 Fed.Appx. 59 (11th Cir.2010). However, the Supreme Court granted Smith\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded Smith\u2019s appeal for reconsideration in light of <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011). <em>Smith v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1598, 179 L.Ed.2d 496 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-19\">On remand for re-sentencing, Smith argued that the district court should consider his post-sentence rehabilitative conduct in determining his new sentence. The district court expressly rejected consideration of Smith\u2019s post-sentence rehabilitation in its sentencing calculus, stating that it was prohibited from doing so by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that \u201cpost-sentence rehabilitative conduct is an impermissible factor for the district court\u2019s consideration\u201d at sentencing). We affirmed on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-20\">In <em>Pepper, </em>however, the Supreme Court abrogated this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lorenzo, </em>and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-21\">when a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s postsentencing rehabilitation and ... such evidence may, in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-22\">131 S.Ct. at 1236. <em>Pepper </em>makes clear that a district court may consider post-sentence rehabilitative conduct at re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-23\">In light of <em>Pepper, </em>we vacate our prior opinion in this case, <em>United States v. Smith, </em>370 Fed.Appx. 59 (11th Cir.2010), vacate Smith\u2019s sentence, and remand for re-sentencing so that the district court may consider Smith\u2019s post-sentence rehabilitative conduct as permitted under <em>Pepper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-24\">PRIOR DECISION VACATED; SENTENCE VACATED, and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
