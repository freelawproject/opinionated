The search and seizure involved had been declared illegal in the California State courts. <em>United States v. Raftery, </em>534 F.2d 854 (9th Cir. 1976). A panel of this court held that this illegality in the course of state narcotics proceedings did not operate to preclude the use of this evidence to prove an alleged perjury offense before a federal grand jury where the alleged perjury occurred after the illegal search and seizure and after the state court had suppressed the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-17\">On this appeal appellant first contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior association with known drug smugglers and dealers and of his own use and possession of illicit drugs. We find no error in the admission of this evidence because it was clearly relevant to show appellant\u2019s knowledge of drugs in general and, specifically, that he knew hashish oil was being manufactured in the house where he was arrested. Nor do we find that the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by any prejudicial effect on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">Appellant also contends that the indictment was unconstitutionally vague because one of the questions which he falsely answered was susceptible of various interpretations. We disagree. First, we find that the question was not vague when read in context with the two previous questions. Secondly, even if we were to assume that the challenged question was unconstitutionally vague, appellant\u2019s false answers to the first two questions were sufficient to sustain his conviction for perjury. <em>See, Arena v. United States, </em>226 F.2d 227 (9th Cir. 1955), <em>Vitello v. United States, </em>425 F.2d 416 (9th Cir. 1970), and <em>United States v. Bonacorsa, </em>528 F.2d 1218, 1221-1222 (2nd Cir. 1976), <em>cert. den., </em>426 U.S. 935, 96 S.Ct. 2647, 49 L.Ed.2d 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">. Appellant, throughout his brief, erroneously refers to the indictment as if it contained multiple counts. The indictment contains only one count containing three questions. Each question was not a separate count.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
