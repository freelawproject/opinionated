The precise nature of the government\u2019s tax claim is set forth in our earlier opinion in this case affirming the denial of the Ciramis\u2019 first Rule 60(b) motion, <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>535 F.2d 736 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-23\">For the purposes of this opinion, we take the facts to be as the Ciramis allege, for all we are to do on this appeal is determine whether those allegations, if proved, would justify relief. <em>United States v. Karahalias, </em>205 F.2d 331, 333 (2d Cir. 1953). We believe the Ciramis have now alleged a set of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Rinieri v. News Syndicate Co., </em>385 F.2d 818, 822 (2d Cir. 1967), resulting in a \u201csitua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion of extreme hardship\u201d to them. <em>United States v. Karahalias, supra. </em>Because it would be \u201cappropriate to accomplish justice,\u201d <em>Klapprott v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 601, 614-15, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266, <em>judgment modified, </em>336 U.S. 942, 69 S.Ct. 398, 93 L.Ed. 1099 (1949), we hold that these allegations, if proved, would justify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The underlying action was commenced in the Eastern District of New York in February 1973 against the Ciramis, their son James, and others, pursuant to \u00a7 7401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, to reduce to judgment certain federal income tax assessments against Salvatore and Margaret,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to set aside as fraudulent a conveyance of real property to their son James, and for other relief. The Ciramis were represented by an attorney, one Newman, who filed on their behalf a brief answer generally denying the government\u2019s allegations, asserting that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and asserting a counterclaim for \u201c$10,000.00 in taxes illegally and erroneously collected.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">In December 1973 the government moved before the late Judge Walter Bruchhausen for summary judgment solely on the claim involving the tax assessments then outstanding against Salvatore and Margaret Cirami.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No opposition to this motion was filed on the Ciramis\u2019 behalf. By order of March 18,1974, Judge Bruchhausen granted the government\u2019s motion \u201c[tjhere being no opposition.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On June 12, 1974, final judgment for almost $271,000 was entered against the Ciramis, the judgment itself reciting that the motion for the summary judgment had not been opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">In late August 1974 the Ciramis replaced Newman as their counsel. On October 4, 1974, the government was advised that the law firm of Wagman Cannon &amp; Musoff (\u201cMusoff\u201d) was now representing Margaret and James Cirami and that one Carl N. Mione was now representing Salvatore. Musoff filed a notice of appearance on December 23, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">On May 1, 1975, Salvatore and Margaret, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., filed a motion to vacate the June 12, 1974 judgment. By affidavit Salvatore asserted that he had not learned of the entry of summary judgment on the tax assessment claim against him and his wife until after he had retained new counsel to replace Newman. In support of their motion, Salvatore and Margaret submitted extensive evidence relative to the merits of the underlying tax claim but submitted no evidence of any circumstances pertaining to their failure to respond to the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the tax assessment claim. On October 6, 1974, Judge Bruchhausen denied this motion to vacate the summary judgment on the grounds that Salvatore and Margaret had not shown the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d required by Rule 60(b)(6), and had not made their motion within a reasonable time as required by the rule. He also noted that the Ciramis had not shown a meritorious defense to the tax assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Salvatore and Margaret appealed. On May 10,1976, we affirmed, <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>535 F.2d 736 (2d Cir. 1976), observing that (1) the only exceptional circumstance relied upon by Salvatore and Margaret in support of their motion to vacate was the circumstance that their attorney Newman had allowed the entry of summary judgment by default against his clients for \u201cunknown\u201d reasons; (2) Salvatore and Margaret and their new attorneys had failed either to obtain an affidavit from Newman explaining his default or to indicate any efforts which they had taken to obtain Newman\u2019s testimony; and (3) there was no indication of any efforts by Salvatore, \u201can experienced businessman,\u201d or Margaret to determine the status of the tax assessment or of the lawsuit against them or of the activity of Newman.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Noting that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion is addressed to the discretion of the district court judge, we stated that under the circumstances, we could not find an abuse of discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">On the record before us we are totally uninformed of the reasons for the failure of the appellants\u2019 former counsel to contest the motion for summary judgment or whether the failure was deliberate or inadvertent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">535 F.2d at 739. We went on to note that we have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">rather consistently refused to relieve a client of the burdens of a final judgment entered against him due to the mistake or omission of his attorney by reason of the latter\u2019s ignorance of the law or of the rules of the court, or his inability to efficiently manage his caseload.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 739. While declining to hold that gross negligence of an attorney would provide a basis for Rule 60(b)(6) relief, we stated that even if it did,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">the record before us fails to establish any gross negligence or misleading of the appellants by counsel and is bereft of any indication of client diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 741. Finally, we reiterated that the movant under Rule 60(b)(6) must show \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d or \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d 535 F.2d at 741. As we have said, the Ciramis needed to do more than to argue the merits of their tax case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">The argument that their cause has merit is plausible but is not determinative. It is well established that an appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cbrings up only the denial of the motion and not the [merits of the underlying] judgment itself.\u201d <em>Wagner v. United States, </em>316 F.2d 871, 872 (2d Cir. 1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">The Ciramis timely petitioned to us for rehearing. In their petition they pointed out that, upon a remand for an evidentiary hearing with respect to their \u201cvoluminous\u201d tax records, Newman\u2019s \u201cpresence can be compelled so that his role can be fully delineated.\u201d The petition was denied on June 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Following this denial Salvatore and Margaret (hereinafter \u201cappellants\u201d), by motion dated July 28, 1976, again sought, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6), to vacate the June 12,1974 summary judgment on the tax assessment claim. This time, they set forth in some detail in various affidavits \u201cnewly discovered evidence concerning the reason prior counsel [Newman] failed to oppose the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d They stated the reason they had originally submitted no argument concerning Newman\u2019s default was \u201cnot of [their] volition,\u201d but because neither they nor their new counsel had succeeded in meeting with Newman, and, therefore, they could only say at that time that any explanation of Newman\u2019s default was \u201cunknown\u201d to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">After our May 10, 1976 decision, appellants\u2019 new counsel, Musoff, informed Newman of our opinion and that Newman was mentioned by name. Newman then agreed to meet with Musoff. At the meeting some two weeks later, Newman stated that he had defaulted because of assurances given him by the Justice Department in Washington that the government would seek only the actual tax due and would not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>interest. Pressed by Musoff, Newman promised to supply particulars and also stated that he was the subject of Bar Association charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Newman and Musoff met again on June 8, 1976, at which time Newman admitted\u2014 for the first time, appellants allege \u2014 that he defaulted because of his suffering from a mental disorder during the time the motion for summary judgment was made, which disorder manifested itself in his failure to complete work promised to his clients and that he was seeing a psychiatrist during this period, and that the Bar Association charges against him involved his inability to complete required work. Newman\u2019s affidavit to this effect was included in appellants\u2019 new July 28 motion papers, Newman stating that he was undergoing psychoanalysis during 1972 and 1973. Also attached to appellants\u2019 motion was a letter from a psychologist confirming that Newman was being treated from October 1969 through September 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Appellants also included, for the first time, affidavits from Salvatore Cirami, Mu-soff, an associate of Musoff\u2019s, and Cirami\u2019s accountant DeStefano, setting forth in some detail their repeated efforts to contact Newman, and detailing Cirami\u2019s concern that this matter was going unattended.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">With their papers appellants submitted for the first time a government Memorandum to Files, which they had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The memorandum, which was written on March 19, 1974, by William Morrow, the Justice Department attorney handling the Cirami tax litigation, stated that Morrow was present in Judge Bruchhausen\u2019s chambers on two occasions when the judge\u2019s law secretary, Mr. Pellegrino, called Newman to inquire why he had defaulted. According to the memorandum, on March 15, 1974,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"au-dedup-0\">Mr. Pellegrino said that [Judge Bruch-hausen] was aware that the attorney Newman had defaulted in opposing our motion for partial summary judgment on February 1,1974, that the Court gave Mr. Newman an additional two weeks to file such opposition and that he had again defaulted. Mr. Pellegrino then called Mr. Newman\u2019s law office but could not get a satisfactory answer as to the second default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">And again, three days later, according to the memorandum, Pellegrino tried to reach Newman but spoke only to Newman\u2019s secretary who \u201cadvised Mr. Pellegrino that no papers had been prepared on the Cirami matter within the last three months.\u201d Appellants contend that this \u201cnew evidence,\u201d unknown to them when they filed their first motion, confirms their inability to contact Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The government opposed appellants\u2019 motion on three grounds, which it also urges on this appeal: (1) grossly negligent conduct of counsel is not a ground for Rule 60(b)(6) relief; (2) \u201claw of the case\u201d precludes consideration of the motion; and (3) appellants\u2019 motion was not timely made. The government also submitted an affidavit from the same William Morrow, which describes Newman\u2019s continued participation in the action until the spring of 1974, and sets forth numerous contacts Morrow had with Newman personally during the times at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">In a brief order filed December 27, 1976, Judge Platt, to whom the case was assigned following Judge Bruchhausen\u2019s death, denied appellants\u2019 motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-12\">The Court finds it is precluded from \u2022considering this second motion to vacate in light of the fact that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has affirmed the United States District Court\u2019s decision denying defendants\u2019 first motion to vacate. <em>(United States v. Cira-mi, </em>535 F.2d 736 (C.A. 2, 1976).) The Court is precluded from considering defendants\u2019 second motion to vacate on the basis of new evidence unless authorized to do so by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>506 F.2d 1200 (C.A. 2, 1974). Insofar as the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has not authorized this Court to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>this second motion, defendants\u2019 motion to vacate is accordingly denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We reverse and remand to the district court to consider the Ciramis\u2019 new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence . . .; (3) fraud ., misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, .; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. The motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment order, or proceeding was entered or taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Clause (6), the basis for the motion before us, has been described by Professor Moore as \u201ca grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case when relief is not warranted by the preceding clauses,\u201d 7 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>160.27[2], at 375 (2d ed.rev.1975), which, in a proper case, is to be \u201cliberally applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. It is well established, however, that a \u201cproper case\u201d for Rule 60(b)(6) relief is only one of \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d <em>Ackermann v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 193,199, 71 S.Ct. 209, 95 L.Ed. 207 (1950), or \u201cextreme hardship,\u201d <em>United States v. Karahalias, supra, </em>205 F.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">As the language of the rule makes clear, relief under clause (6) is available only when the movant acts in a timely fashion and asserts a ground justifying relief that is not a ground encompassed within any of the first five clauses. While all motions made pursuant to Rule 60(b) must be brought \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d the rule specifies that those falling under the first three clauses must, in addition, be brought within a year of the entry of the challenged judgment. Thus, when the reason asserted for relief comes properly within one of those clauses, clause (6) may not be employed to avoid the one-year limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">The motion at issue on this appeal was made slightly more than two years after summary judgment on the tax assessment claim was entered against the Ciramis. We have examined the motion and the grounds advanced in support of it, and we conclude that those grounds do not come within the scope of the first five clauses of Rule 60(b), but, indeed, constitute an \u201cother reason justifying relief,\u201d and the motion is thus not subject to a one-year time limit. Moreover, we believe it to have been made within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">In our earlier <em>Cirami </em>opinion, we found the Ciramis\u2019 first Rule 60(b)(6) motion timely. 535 F.2d at 742. That opinion was filed on May 10, 1976. The instant motion was dated July 28, 1976. The Ciramis have alleged that it was only by virtue of our opinion that they were able at last to meet with Newman and learn the reason for his behavior and default. They filed their new motion just two and one-half months after our decision was handed down. What is a \u201creasonable time\u201d is a question to be answered in light of all the circumstances of the case. So viewed here, we find that the second motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">The government\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of law of the case is misplaced. The court below was not precluded from considering the new evidence offered by appellants. When an appellate court has once decided an issue, the trial court, at a later stage in the litigation, is under a duty to follow the appellate court\u2019s ruling on that issue, <em>see Munro v. Post, </em>102 F.2d 686, 688 (2d Cir. 1939), and is precluded from altering the appellate decision. <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>506 F.2d 1200,1202-03 (2d Cir. 1974); 1B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.404[10] (2d ed.rev.1974). This is what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>meant by \u201claw of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, from the proposition that the trial court must adhere to the decision and mandate of the appellate court there is the corollary that upon remand the trial court may consider matters not expressly or implicitly part of the decision of the court of appeals. <em>Gulf Coast Building &amp; Supply Co. v. International Bhd. of Electrical Workers, Local No. 480, </em>460 F.2d 105, 107 (5th Cir. 1972). This is true also at a later stage in the litigation where the case is again before the trial court not on remand but, for example, on a new motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In our earlier decision in this case, we did not hold that Rule 60(b) relief was under no circumstances available to the Ciramis. Rather, we held that the arguments there urged by the Ciramis were quite insufficient to justify the relief they sought, in that we were \u201ctotally uninformed of the reasons\u201d for their default. 535 F.2d at 739. The papers now submitted constitute a new motion and seek both to remedy that deficiency and to explain its cause. In affirming the denial of the Ciramis\u2019 first motion to vacate, we did not pass on the contentions in the second motion, for they were not before us. Thus, consideration of them by the district court would not have been improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Very high among the interests in our jurisprudential system is that of finality of judgments. It has become almost a judicial commonplace to say that litigation must end somewhere, and we reiterate our firm belief that courts should not encourage the reopening of final judgments or casually permit the relitigation of litigated issues out of a friendliness to claims of unfortunate failures to put in one\u2019s best case. Yet, at the same time, we are not unmindful of other interests, among them the interest of deciding cases on their merits. These interests provide relevant parameters within which to evaluate Rule 60(b) motions; the facts give them values. Here we are faced with a <em>second </em>motion to vacate a final judgment. Most assuredly, for it to succeed the material offered in support of it must be highly convincing material. Here, after a thorough study of the record we have concluded that, if the facts are as the Cir-amis allege them to be, Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">Once a rule of law has been established for a case we will not depart therefrom on a subsequent appeal unless special circumstances of the case warrant a reopening of issues previously decided. <em>Rodman v. Commissioner, </em>548 F.2d 1109, 1111 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>45 U.S.L.W. 3733 (U.S. Apr. 28, 1977) (No. 76-1499). While this is not the issue squarely before us, we believe that in light of the newly submitted material there are sufficient special circumstances here to warrant our reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In an affidavit submitted with his second motion, Salvatore Cirami stated that he had tried \u201c[o]n several occasions ... to contact Mr. Newman as to the status of my case. At no time was I able to speak with him.\u201d He then contacted his accountant, Louis DeStefano, who knew Newman and had recommended Newman to Salvatore, and asked DeStefano to contact him \u201cto find out what was going on in the defense of this action.\u201d According to DeStefano, \u201cI then called Mr. Newman who assured me that everything was being taken care of and I relayed this message to Mr. Cirami.\u201d Thereafter, Salvatore called DeStefano three or four times a week \u201ceach and every week for approximately the next six months\u201d to inquire about the case, and each time DeStefano assured him that \u201cthis case was being handled properly by Mr. Newman who gave me these assurances constantly.\u201d Both Cirami and DeStefano contend that they never had any reason to believe that anything was amiss in Newman\u2019s handling of the case. DeStefano stated in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">. Mr. Cirami was my client; it was I who disputed the tax deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service; I had the necessary information and accounting records to dispute the accuracy and validity of the Internal Revenue Service claims; ... I am the party who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>recommended Mr. . . . Newman as the lawyer whom I believed best suited to handle this case for the defendants; I am the party who was working with and collaborating with Mr. Newman to prepare the defense; . . . and any delays of weeks or months in a tax case of this nature is not and has never been any unusual situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Thus, according to the Ciramis, Salvatore was frequently inquiring about the status of his lawsuit and was met on each occasion by assurances from his attorney, relayed by his accountant, that the matter was in hand. It was only after a judgment in default had been entered against them that they discovered' that their attorney had not, in fact, been representing them. New counsel, Musoff, was retained, but efforts to learn from Newman the reasons for his inaction continued to be unavailing. Only after this court, in affirming the denial of the Ciramis\u2019 first motion to vacate the judgment, mentioned Newman by name did he finally consent to speak with the Ciram-is\u2019 new attorney. This allegedly led to the discovery of the reason for Newman\u2019s failure to oppose the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the tax assessment claim \u2014 a mental disorder which induced him both to neglect his duties and to assure his client that he was attending to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">This tale is indeed an extraordinary one, and, additionally, it is disturbing to learn, as set forth in the Morrow memorandum, that the government knew before its motion for summary judgment on the tax assessment claim was granted, that even Judge Bruchhausen, before whom the action was pending, was unable to reach Newman. Moreover, both Salvatore Cirami and his accountant DeStefano assert they knew nothing of the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the tax assessment claim against the elder Ciramis until some time after that motion was granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In <em>Vindigni v. Meyer, </em>441 F.2d 376 (2d Cir. 1971), relief was justifiable where there was \u201cthe unusual fact of the complete disappearance of plaintiff\u2019s attorney.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 377. In the present case we have the possibly unique fact of what we may term the \u201cconstructive disappearance\u201d of defendants\u2019 attorney, who was allegedly suffering from a psychological disorder which led him to neglect almost completely his clients\u2019 business while at the same time assuring them that he was attending to it, and who had made himself unavailable even to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">It is this behavior of Newman which in part sets this case apart from <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). In <em>Link, </em>which was not a Rule 60(b) case, the Supreme Court, by a vote of four to three, affirmed the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a diversity negligence action for failure to prosecute. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">There is certainly no merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claim because of the counsel\u2019s unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation, in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \u201cnotice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ayer, </em>101 U.S. 320, 326, 25 L.Ed. 955.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">370 U.S. at 633-34, 82 S.Ct. at 1390. But the Court noted that there was nothing \u201cto indicate that counsel\u2019s failure to attend the pretrial conference was other than deliberate or the product of neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 82 S.Ct. at 1391. Such was not the case here. Newman\u2019s default was not the result of his having taken on too many cases to give proper attention to this one <em>(see Schwarz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 F.2d 833, 836 (2d Cir. 1967); <em>Cline v. Hoogland, </em>518 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>776, 778 (8th Cir. 1975)); but instead was engendered by a mental illness which manifested itself to his clients only after they had relied on him for months.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As to the conduct of the Cir amis, they allege reasonable attempts by them and others on their behalf, as well as attempts by Judge Bruchhausen, to contact Newman. We note incidentally that on the papers before us these Rule 60(b) movants do not appear to have been themselves neglectful. If they had been, their motion would be cognizable not under Rule 60(b)(6) but under Rule 60(b)(1). Certainly, their conduct is not explainable as \u201cinadvertence, indifference, or careless disregard of consequences,\u201d <em>Klapprott v. United States, supra, </em>335 U.S. at 613, 69 S.Ct. at 389; quite the contrary, their \u201callegations set up an extraordinary situation which cannot fairly or logically be classified as mere neglect on [their] part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And <em>cf. L. P. Steuart, Inc. </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>117 U.S.App.D.C. 279, 280, 329 F.2d 234, 235 (D.C.Cir. 1964), where a successful Rule 60(b)(6) movant, whose former counsel filed an affidavit that he had been \u201cbeset with personal problems,\u201d \u201cmade affidavit that he [movant] and others in his behalf, made \u2018numerous inquiries of\u2019 his former counsel who \u2018refused to answer such inquiries\u2019 and assured [movant] \u2018from time to time\u2019 that \u2018the case was proceeding and that settlement of it would be made soon.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">While we do not, of course, pass upon the merits of the defenses asserted by the Cir-amis to the underlying tax assessments against them, we do observe that their submissions, if established at trial, could well result in a substantial reduction of the amount of tax and interest claimed by the government and awarded in full by Judge Bruchhausen in granting summary judgment on the tax assessment claim, thereby considerably ameliorating what the Ciramis have sought to show is a most severe financial blow to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Where one timely seeking Rule 60(b)(6) relief from a default judgment can make out a strong case that he had a meritorious defense which could have been asserted but for a truly extraordinary turn of events not covered by the first five clauses of the rule and which brought about his default and resulted in substantial injustice to him, it is appropriate to vacate the judgment so that the merits of his case can be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The order of the district court is reversed. The case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the allegations made in support of the motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. The government sought $200,306.15 in taxes, penalties and interest assessed in 1967 for the years 1961, 1962 and 1963, plus interest, which, by December 1973, exceeded $68,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. This counterclaim was dismissed on October 2, 1973, after the Ciramis filed, through Newman, a brief and affidavit in opposition to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-10\">. The government\u2019s motion was denominated a motion for \u201cpartial summary judgment,\u201d presumably because the motion \u201conly sought to reduce to judgment the t,ax assessments against the senior Ciramis, and did not seek to set aside the alleged fraudulent conveyances or to obtain judgment against the Ciramis\u2019 son.\u201d <em>United States v. Cirami, </em>535 F.2d at 737 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b85-16\">. Inasmuch as Judge Bruchhausen\u2019s order \u201cadjudicate[d] fewer than all the claims,\u201d Fed.R. Civ.P. 54(b), and \u201cthe rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties,\u201d <em>id., </em>the order could constitute a final judgment only if the judge, in accordance with the requirements of Fed.R. Civ.P. 54(b) reached \u201can express determination that there [was] no just reason for delay and [made] an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d This Judge Bruchhausen did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">. In addition, we rejected the government\u2019s contention that the Ciramis\u2019 motion, filed almost a year after the entry of judgment, was untimely. 535 F.2d at 742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. Another aspect of the doctrine concerns the adherence by an appellate court to its own decision at an earlier stage of the litigation:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\">. The Memorandum and Order granting the government\u2019s motion' for summary judgment stated that \u201c[cjopies hereof are being forwarded to the attorneys for the respective parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
