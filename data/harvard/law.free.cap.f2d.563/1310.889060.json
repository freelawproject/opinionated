(\u201cNorthwest\u201d) for the \u201cwrongful death\u201d of Sir Michael Robert, the Klickers\u2019 valuable golden retriever, caused by Northwest\u2019s negligent carriage of the animal. On July 20, 1971, the Klickers flew on Northwest from Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Michael was training for championship field trials, to Billings, Montana. Northwest required the Klickers to ship Michael in the cargo hold as \u201cexcess baggage.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>The Klickers informed Northwest of Michael\u2019s value (alleged to be $35,000), but they were not permitted to declare that value nor to pay additional charges for carriage of the dog based on a declared valuation. Northwest demanded and received twice the ordinary excess baggage charge to ship the dog. The parties stipulated that Michael\u2019s death was caused by Northwest\u2019s negligence in transporting him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">In defense, Northwest relied on three tariff rules which, variously, fully exculpate it from any liability for its negligence, or limit its liability to $500 or $5,000, respectively. The district court held that Northwest\u2019s liability was limited to $5,000 and entered judgment in that sum for the Klickers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both sides appeal. The Klickers contend that the tariff that purports fully to exculpate Northwest from its own negligence is void and that the airline is foreclosed from relying on the other tariffs limiting its liability by reason of the airline\u2019s contrary construction of the tariffs when it accepted Michael for shipment and by its conduct in refusing to permit them to declare the excess valuation. Northwest argues that all of the tariffs apply, especially the tariff that gives the Klickers nothing, that primary jurisdiction to decide these issues rests exclusively with the Civil Aeronautics Board (\u201cCAB\u201d), and that invalidation of the exculpatory tariff by the CAB in another case, while this case was pending on appeal, does not apply to invalidate the tariff as to the Klickers. We agree with the Klickers; we vacate the damage award, and remand the case for a new trial limited to the common-law damage issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">The exculpatory tariff, Tariff Rule 345(D)(3), provided that Northwest would \u201cnot be liable for the loss, death, or sickness\u201d of any live animal it transported. Under Rule 345, of which Rule 345(D)(3) is a part, live animals were acceptable as baggage on Northwest, but \u201cthe animal and its container will not be included in the free baggage allowance . . . and will be subject to 200% of the otherwise applicable excess baggage charge . . . .\u201d (Rule 345(A)(2)(h)(l).) Northwest permitted large dogs to fly only in the cargo compartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Rule 345(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">We first dispose of Northwest\u2019s primary jurisdiction argument by holding that it has no application where, as here, the CAB has heretofore decided that the exculpatory tariff rule is \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered its cancellation. <em>(Hughes Air Corp., et al., </em>CAB Order No. 74-12-124, 40 Fed.Reg. 1121, 1122-23 (1975). <em>See Live Animals as Baggage, </em>CAB Order No. 74-4-20, 39 Fed.Reg. 12915 (1974) (tentative finding tariff was unlawful); <em>Investigation of Premium Rates for Live Animals and Birds, </em>Docket No. 21474, CAB Order No. 73-6-103, at 36 (decided June 26, 1973).) The CAB decision was based on \u201clong established legal principles [which have] consistently held it to be against public policy for a common carrier, by special or express contract, to exempt itself from liability for loss or damage due to its own negligence.\u201d <em>(Hughes Air Corp., supra, </em>at 1122 &amp; n. 5.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>Primary jurisdiction is a concept that expresses both initial deference to the administrative agency and the concern for conservation of judicial resources. <em>(E. g., Nader v. Allegheny Airlines </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 290, 303-04, 96 S.Ct. 1978, 48 L.Ed.2d 643; <em>Southwestern Sugar &amp; Molasses Co., Inc. v. River Terminals </em>(1959) 360 U.S. 411, 420-21, 79 S.Ct. 1210, 3 L.Ed.2d 1334 (hereinafter <em>\u201cSouthwestern Sugar\u201d). See generally, </em>K.

Neither purpose is served by using the doctrine when the agency has already said what it thinks about this exculpatory tariff. <em>(E. g., United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Co. </em>(1956) 352 U.S. 59, 69, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126. <em>Cf. Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 308-09, 96 S.Ct. 1978 (White, J., <em>concurring).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">The decision of the CAB invalidating Rule 345(D)(3) does not bind us because the question whether a tariff is against public policy is ultimately a judicial question requiring the application of federal common law. <em>(Southwestern Sugar, supra, </em>360 U.S. at 420-21, 79 S.Ct. 1210; <em>Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co. </em>(1922) 259 U.S. 285, 290-91, 42 S.Ct. 477, 66 L.Ed. 943; <em>Milhizer v. Riddle Airlines, Inc. </em>(E.D.Mich.1960) 185 F.Supp. 110, 112; <em>cf. Twentieth Century Delivery Service, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1957) 242 F.2d 292, 299.) We nevertheless give substantial weight to the CAB\u2019s decision <em>(see, e. g., Locust Cartage Co. v. Transamerica Freight Lines, Inc. </em>(1st Cir. 1970) 430 F.2d 334, 341), an obligation we easily assume because we agree with the CAB that Rule 345(D)(3) is void as against public policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Union Pacific Railroad Company v. Burke </em>(1921) 255 U.S. 317, 321-23, 41 S.Ct. 283, 65 L.Ed. 656; <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad v. Piper </em>(1918) 246 U.S. 439, 445, 38 S.Ct. 354, 62 L.Ed. 820; <em>Davis v.

As the Supreme Court stated in <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Nothnagle </em>(1953) 346 U.S. 128, 136, 73 S.Ct. 986, 990, 97 L.Ed. 1500:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-9\">\u201c \u2018A carrier who stipulates not to be bound to the exercise of care and diligence \u201cseeks to put off the <em>essential duties </em>of his employment.\u201d It is recognized that the carrier and the individual customer are not on an equal footing. \u201cThe latter cannot afford to higgle or stand out and seek redress in the courts.\u201d \u2019 <em>Santa Fe P. &amp; P.

Delta Air Lines </em>(2d Cir. 1969) 413 F.2d 1401; <em>Lichten v. Eastern Airlines </em>(2d Cir. 1951) 189 F.2d 939.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>adopt the <em>Lichten </em>rationale because it is flatly wrong.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <em>Lichten </em>majority held that the common-law bar to exculpatory tariffs did not apply to carriers regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Act (\u201cCAA,\u201d now, the Federal Aviation Act (\u201cFAA\u201d)). It reasoned that Congress impliedly abrogated the federal common law when, in enacting the CAA, it did not expressly prohibit exculpatory tariffs, as it did when it wrote the Interstate Commerce Act (\u201cICA\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at 941.) <em>Lichten </em>makes little sense from the standpoint of ordinary rules of statutory construction and none when the legislative history of the ICA and CAA is read. As Judge Frank pointed out in his vigorous dissent, the \u201cCarmack Amendment\u201d to the ICA (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11) (1971)), upon which the majority relied, was intended merely to declare pre-existing federal common law and to prevent the application of state law that would have generated non-uniformity of tariffs. (189 F.2d at 942-45.) Moreover, the <em>Lichten </em>majority completely ignored Section 1106 of the FAA (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506 (1971)), taken intact from its predecessor section of the CAA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">\u201cNothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">Congress knew when it drafted both statutes that the common law prevented a common carrier from completely exculpating itself from its own negligence. <em>(E. g., Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Burke, supra, </em>255 U.S. 317, 41 S.Ct. 283, 65 L.Ed. 656.) We refuse to impute to Congress an intent to abrogate silently this area of the common law by omitting to single it out for honorable mention at the same time that it expressly incorporated the entire federal common law applicable to carriers in Section 1106. <em>(See also United States v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. </em>(1951) 343 U.S. 236, 239-40, 72 S.Ct. 666, 96 L.Ed. 907 (the common-law bar to exculpatory tariffs was so well-settled, legislative approval is assumed, absent explicit repeal in new legislation regulating carriers; <em>citing The Kensington </em>(1902) 183 U.S. 263, 268-69, 22 S.Ct. 102, 46 L.Ed. 190).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">Again relying on <em>Lichten, </em>Northwest argues that the Klickers were bound by the exculpatory tariff because it had not been invalidated when the Klickers took their trip, and the Klickers had not present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>ed the issue to the CAB. The argument rests on Lichten\u2019s misunderstanding of the primary jurisdiction doctrine. <em>Lichten </em>correctly recognizes that plaintiffs who have not first asked the agency to invalidate a tariff may be required by the court to seek a decision from the agency before the court will decide a tariff question. But <em>Lichten </em>then confuses this principle with the jurisdictional rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies. The primary jurisdiction doctrine is a rule of initial deference, not a judicially imposed limitation on the power of the court. Thus, when the agency has not decided the tariff question, the district court does not dismiss the action; it simply stays the litigation pending resort to the administrative tribunal. <em>(See Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, supra, </em>426 U.S. at 296-97, 305-07, 96 S.Ct. 1978; <em>Southwestern Sugar, supra, </em>360 U.S. at 421-22, 79 S.Ct. 1210.) No deference is required, as we have pointed out, when the agency has decided the issue in another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">The effect of the CAB decision is to invalidate the same tariff as in the Flickers\u2019 case. In legal contemplation, no retrospec-tivity question is involved because the tariff was always invalid; the declaration of invalidity is simply the event which reveals the pre-existing unlawfulness of the tariff. <em>(See, e. g., Great Northern Railway Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., supra, </em>259 U.S. at 291, 42 S.Ct. 477; <em>Continental Charters, Inc. </em>(1953) 16 C.A.B. 772, 775 (order finding tariff unjust and unreasonable on judicial remand under primary jurisdiction doctrine \u201cmust of necessity contain a finding of past unlawfulness\u201d); <em>Southwestern Sugar, supra, </em>360 U.S. at 420-22, 79 S.Ct. at (after agency determination, court will finally adjudicate the validity of the challenged tariff as between the parties).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">We turn to the question whether Tariff Rule 370(A) (limiting liability to $500) or Tariff Rule 370(C) (limiting liability to $5,000) applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">Carriers may partially limit their liability for injury, loss, or destruction of baggage on a \u201creleased valuation\u201d basis, whereby in exchange for a low carriage rate, the passenger-shipper is deemed to release the carrier from liability beyond a stated amount. The released valuation limitations bind the passenger-shipper to the restriction on liability, however, only if he has notice of the rate structure and is given the opportunity to pay the higher rate in order to obtain greater protection. <em>(New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. R. Co. v. Nothnagle, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 135-36, 73 S.Ct. 986; <em>Union Pacific R.R. Co. v. Burke, supra, </em>255 U.S. at 321-23, 41 S.Ct. 283; <em>Boston &amp; Maine R. R. v. Piper, supra, </em>246 U.S. at 445, 38 S.Ct. 354; <em>Sommer Corp. </em>v. <em>Panama Canal Co., supra, </em>475 F.2d at 297-98. <em>See also </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.176 (1977) (requiring posting of air carrier released valuation limits).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">Tariff Rule 370(A) limits Northwest\u2019s liability to $500 for loss or damage of \u201cany personal property, including baggage . unless the passenger, at the time of presenting such property for transportation, when checking in for a flight, has declared a higher value and paid, for each carrier via which such property is to be transported an additional transportation charge, at the rate of 10 cents for each $100.00 or fraction thereof ... by which such higher declared value exceeds the applicable amount set forth above, in which event carrier\u2019s liability shall not exceed such higher declared value. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>Rule 370(A) has no application because the airline refused to permit the Klickers to declare a valuation of their dog. Until the CAB invalidated the exculpatory tariff, Northwest\u2019s primary contention has always been that it had no liability for the loss of the dog. Northwest\u2019s conduct in refusing to permit valuation to be declared is consistent with its reliance on the exculpatory tariff and with the nonapplicability of Rule 370(A). Under these circumstances, Northwest will not be heard to say that Rule 370(A) applied to the Klickers\u2019 shipment and that the Klickers knew or had any chance to comply with the Rule. Northwest\u2019s situation is no brighter when it seeks to rely on Tariff Rule 370(C). That Rule provides: \u201cNo participating carrier will accept for transportation or for storage personal property, including baggage, <em>the declared value of which exceeds </em>[for Northwest] . . . $5,000.\u201d [Emphasis supplied]. Rule 370(C) functions merely as a ceiling on valuations declared pursuant to Rule 370(A). By its own terms, this Rule cannot apply to the Klickers because the airline refused to permit any declared valuation for their dog. If the airline erred in accepting the animal, the responsibility for the mistake falls on the airline, not on the innocent shipper.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Because Northwest\u2019s defenses based on the Tariff Rules are invalid, the damage issues must be tried anew, free from those defenses. <em>(See Union Pacific Railroad v. Burke, supra, </em>255 U.S. at 323, 41 S.Ct. 283.) We do not reach the choice-of-law questions that will arise on retrial of damages. Those issues are not simple, and the district court has not decided any of them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">The damage portion of the judgment is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court for a new trial on the damage issues. The Klickers will have their costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">. The court below rejected Northwest\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on the exculpatory tariff, but it did not reach the issue of its legality. Rather, it reasoned that nothing in the tariffs precluded a passenger from declaring a value pursuant to Rule 370 and that Northwest\u2019s refusal to permit the declaration of value was \u201cunjustified\u201d when the airline was willing to transport animals and it assured safe transport. The court concluded from these observations that the exculpatory tariff was not the sole determinant of the parties\u2019 rights and rejected Northwest\u2019s argument that it precluded liability. The court did not explain its ultimate conclusion that the $5,000, not the $500, limitation of Rule 370 applied. All tariff rules cited may be found in Local &amp; Joint Passenger Rules Tariff No. PR-6 (eff. July 15, 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">. Large dogs are those which would not fit in a container 21 inches X 16 inches X 8 inches. The regulation also required that the animal shipped should be \u201charmless, inoffensive, odorless, and . . . require no attention in transit,\u201d Rule 345(A)(2), and that it travel in a container made of metal, wood or polyethylene, inspected and approved by Northwest at the time of acceptance, Rule 345(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">. Only four carriers filed objections; Northwest was not among them. These related to the application of the CAB\u2019s decision on clauses relating to governmental regulation, and the special problems of a carrier serving the Aleu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>tion Islands. Except for the latter, no carrier objected to the CAB\u2019s finding that the exculpatory tariff was unreasonable on its face. <em>Hughes Air Corp., supra, </em>40 Fed.Reg. at 1122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">. The CAB relied in part on admiralty cases which have consistently held invalid as against public policy such exculpatory clauses in private maritime contracts. <em>See Hughes Air Corp., supra, </em>40 Fed.Reg. 1122, n. 5, <em>citing United States v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1952) 343 U.S. 236, 239-42, 72 S.Ct. 666, 96 L.Ed. 907; <em>The Ansaldo San Giorgio I v. Rheinstrom Bros.

While these cases are not directly applicable in the case of tariffs of regulated carriers, Southwestern Sugar, <em>supra, </em>360 U.S. at 417-20, 79 S.Ct. 1210, it is certainly permissible for the CAB to adopt their reasoning as a standard of \u201cunreasonability.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">. Other cases which are sometimes cited as standing for this proposition are distinguishable as they involve the question whether a passenger is bound by a released value limitation which gave him the opportunity to pay more for a greater liability coverage. <em>Vogel-sang v.

However, <em>Twentieth Century </em>involved a dispute about whether a concededly valid released valuation limit to liability applied to shield a carrier not a party to the original agreement who was delivering airfreight shipped pursuant to it.

Of necessity, then, instances of unjust, unreasonable, and discriminatory rules may continue on file until our attention is directed to them by complaints filed by members of the public who have been adversely affected by such rules . . , . It is at once apparent that the interest which Congress anticipated that the public would take in the proper administration of the Act would be completely discouraged if, when a complaint was filed, we recognized the merit of it but failed to provide adequate relief. . [citation omitted].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">. <em>See also </em>Tariff Rule 365(A) which provides that carriers are not liable for baggage \u201cnot acceptable . . pursuant to Rules 340 and 345.\u201d It undercuts Northwest\u2019s argument that the dog was not accepted for liability purposes due to Rule 370(C). The dog was \u201cacceptable\u201d pursuant to Rule 345(A) and was thus baggage as to which Northwest remains liable pursuant to Rule 365(A). Northwest cannot be permitted to assert instead that the dog was not acceptable pursuant to Rule 370(C) which was never intended to apply to shipments of live animals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">. Jurisdiction was founded on diversity. Ordinarily the law of the forum state would be applied to ascertain the correct measure of damages. However, two problems exist in this approach: (1) Federal common law, rather than state law may be applicable by reason of an overriding federal interest in the uniformity of obligations of domestic air carriers (see, e. <em>g., Blair v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., supra, </em>344 F.Supp. 365; <em>Braughton v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(W.D.Mo.1960) 189 F.Supp. 137, 141; Note, <em>Air Carrier Tariff Limitations, supra, </em>n. 6; 70 Harv.L.Rev. at 1283-85); and (2) even if state law applies, Montana, in applying its conflicts rule, might select the law of one of the other states, such as Minnesota, which were involved in this multistate drama.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
