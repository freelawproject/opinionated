Marie (St. Mary\u2019s Bank) is a credit union entitled to federal income tax exemption under the provisions of Section 501(c)(14)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">St. Mary\u2019s Co-operative Credit Association, founded in 1908 and chartered by the State of New Hampshire on April 9, 1909, was the first credit union in the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under its original charter, membership was restricted to residents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>City of Manchester. N.H.Laws of 1909, chap. 303, \u00a7 3. In 1925, the New Hampshire legislature changed the name to La Caisse Populaire Ste. Marie (St. Mary\u2019s Bank) and eliminated the requirement that members be Manchester residents. N.H. Laws of 1925, chap. 340, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 1. In 1935, St. Mary\u2019s applied for and received from the Treasury Department a letter of exemption from federal income taxes under \u00a7 101 of the Revenue Act of 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">St. Mary\u2019s tax exempt status continued until January 14, 1966, when the Secretary of the Treasury revoked it. Thereafter, St. Mary\u2019s paid taxes totalling $48,965.11 for the years 1969-1974. Administrative claims for refunds were filed and denied, and on December 23, 1975, the instant action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">After a non-jury trial, the district court found that the State of New Hampshire considers St. Mary\u2019s to be a credit union and regulates it as such. It held that the recognition of St. Mary\u2019s as a credit union was not a gross misuse of the name and that St. Mary\u2019s was a credit union within the meaning of Section 501(c)(14)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the years in question. <em>La Caisse Populaire Ste. Marie v. United States, </em>425 P.Supp. 512 (D.N.H.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">On appeal the United States argues that St. Mary\u2019s is a hybrid mutual savings/commercial bank and not a credit union. Citing the nature of the services offered by St. Mary\u2019s and the absence of a requirement that all members share some common bond, the government contends that St. Mary\u2019s competes with banks and should be taxed as a bank. The government suggests that no significance should attach to the State\u2019s recognition of St. Mary\u2019s as a credit union. Alternatively, the government argues that the State has grossly misused the name \u201ccredit union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Section 501(c) of the Code exempts from federal income taxation \u201c. . . (14)(A) Credit unions without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and without profit.\u201d In order to be a member of St. Mary\u2019s one must be a shareholder. Shareholder status allows one to borrow, to save and to participate in the earnings of the association. The shares do not appreciate in value, and net earnings, with the exception of certain reserves, are distributed to the members. The evidence presented at trial supports, and the government does not now contest, the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s finding that St. Mary\u2019s is organized without capital stock and is operated for mutual purposes and without profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the government contends that St. Mary\u2019s is not a credit union because it offers such services as demand deposit accounts and real estate loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The government\u2019s contention that the existence of demand deposits, more commonly called checking accounts, transforms St. Mary\u2019s into a bank<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is substantially undermined by the fact that although such accounts have been available at St. Mary\u2019s since 1939 no inference negative to St. Mary\u2019s status as a credit union was drawn on the basis of the availability of these checking accounts by the Treasury until after the lapse of twenty-seven years, <em>i. e., </em>in 1966! There also was evidence at the trial that other credit unions in New Hampshire have been providing some sort of third-party payment orders and that at least one state has passed legislation authorizing credit unions having shares and deposits in excess of $1,000,000 to offer demand deposit accounts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1751-1790, anticipates the existence of demand deposit accounts at state-chartered credit unions. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1781(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">There was evidence at trial that during the years in question the number of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>estate loans given by St. Mary\u2019s accounted for 17% to 33% of the total number of loans made, but that the dollar amount of such loans constituted 83% to 88% of the total. The government argues that the amount of St. Mary\u2019s loans which are secured by real estate indicates that it is a savings and loan association and not a credit union.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More compelling, however, is the conclusion that the members\u2019 largest loan requirements are for funds for the purchase of real estate. Indeed, the government\u2019s expert conceded that real estate loans are not inconsistent with the nature of credit unionism. In fact, St. Mary\u2019s original charter provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6G\">The object of said association shall be to open credits for and make loans to its shareholders, but for and to no other persons, upon such terms, and for such times and <em>upon such security, real or personal, </em>as the association may vote or by its by-laws provide, the rate of interest, however, upon any loan not to exceed six per cent. N.H.Laws of 1909, chap. 303, \u00a7 2. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Also it should be noted that there was no evidence presented at trial that St. Mary\u2019s is inadequately servicing the smaller, unsecured credit needs of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We hold, therefore, that the existence of demand deposit accounts and loans secured by real property did not transform St. Mary\u2019s into a bank during the years 1969-1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">One of the traditional indicia of a credit union is the so-called \u201ccommon bond.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Members of St. Mary\u2019s were originally required to be residents of Manchester, N.H.Laws of 1909, chap. 303, \u00a7 3, but the requirement was dropped in 1925. N.H. Laws of 1925, chap. 340, \u00a7 1. No written residency requirement exists today.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The District Court found that \u201c. . . the members of St. Mary\u2019s do have a common bond, even though it is not spelled out in so many words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">The evidence presented at trial supports the finding that St. Mary\u2019s is a Franco-American institution. It services primarily the French-speaking residents who live on the west side of Manchester where it is located. All but one of its tellers are bilingual. The court\u2019s finding that St. Mary\u2019s members have a de facto common bond is not clearly erroneous and must be upheld. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Because we accept this finding of a common bond, we consider the absence of any formal requirement of such a bond less convincing as a measure of whether application of the name \u201ccredit union\u201d to St. Mary\u2019s is a gross misuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The District Court also found that the State of New Hampshire considers St. Mary\u2019s to be a credit union. This finding, based on the testimony of the New Hampshire Bank Commissioner, is not clearly erroneous. The question on appeal is whether the State of New Hampshire has grossly misused the term \u201ccredit union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The \u201cgross misuse of the name\u201d test has its origins in <em>United States v. Cambridge Loan &amp; Building Co., </em>278 U.S. 55, 49 S.Ct. 39, 73 L.Ed. 180 (1928). Cambridge Loan &amp; Building Company had been assessed and had paid taxes for the years 1918 through 1923. Contending that it was entitled to a tax exemption under Section 231 of the Revenue Act of 1918 and Section 231 of the Revenue Act of 1921, it brought suit for a refund. In ruling that the institution was entitled to an exemption within the meaning of the statutes, Mr. Justice Holmes stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">It is argued that ... a State cannot make a bank exempt merely by calling it a building and loan association. No doubt extravagant cases might be imagined. But these associations are well known and a State is not likely to be a party to a scheme to enable a private company to avoid federal taxation by giving it a false name. The statutes speak of \u201cdomestic\u201d associations, that is, associations sanctioned by the several States. They must be taken to accept, with the qualifications expressly stated, what the States are content to recognize, unless there is a gross misuse of the name. 278 U.S. at 59, 49 S.Ct. at 40.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Neither <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Harmel, </em>287 U.S. 103, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77 L.Ed. 199 (1932), nor <em>Bowers v. Lawyers' Mortgage Co., </em>285 U.S. 182, 52 S.Ct. 350, 76 L.Ed. 690 (1932), rejected the \u201cgross misuse of the name\u201d test, as the government suggests in its brief. In <em>Bowers </em>the court expressly distinguished <em>Cambridge Building &amp; Loan, </em>285 U.S. at 190, 52 S.Ct. 350. <em>Burnet </em>preserved the rule that \u201c[sjtate law may control only when the federal taxing act, by express language or necessary implication, makes its operation dependent upon state law.\u201d 287 U.S. at 110, 53 S.Ct. at 77. This was the unspoken premise in the <em>Cambridge </em>holding that state law controls only when the state has not grossly abused the name. <em>See </em>278 U.S. at 59, 49 S.Ct. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Section 501(c)(14)(A) necessarily implies that state law controls the definition of the term credit union. There are only two types of credit unions \u2014 federally chartered and state chartered. Federal credit unions are specifically \u201c. . . exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States . . . Section 23 of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934; 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1768. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(1). Since federal credit unions are elsewhere exempt, \u00a7 501(c)(14)(A) applies to state-chartered credit unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Congress might have chosen to define exactly what it meant by the term \u201ccredit union\u201d as used in \u00a7 501(c)(14)(A). In the absence of more definite legislation, we must decide on the basis of the term as it is commonly understood. <em>See Bowers, supra, </em>285 U.S. at 190, 52 S.Ct. 350; <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>278 U.S. at 58, 49 S.Ct. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">A credit union is a democratically controlled, cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouraging thrift and self-reliance among its members by creating a source of credit at a fair and reasonable rate of interest in order to improve the economic and social conditions of its members.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A credit union is fundamentally distinguishable from other financial institutions in that the customers may exercise effective control. At St. Mary\u2019s, for example, any act or decision of the board of directors may be reversed at the annual meeting of members. N.H.Laws of 1909, chap. 303, \u00a7 6, as amended by N.H.Laws of 1967, chap. 524, \u00a7 5. Contrariwise, while depositors of New Hampshire mutual savings banks are technically the owners, they take no part in the management of those institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>St. Mary\u2019s is indeed a hybrid institution. It has aspects of both a commercial bank and a savings and loan association. The question is not before us whether the State of New Hampshire could properly treat St. Mary\u2019s as either of those institutions. We are asked whether St. Mary\u2019s is a credit union within \u00a7 501(c)(14)(A). We hold that, for the years in question, St. Mary\u2019s met the expressly stated qualifications of \u00a7 501(c)(14)(A) and that the State of New Hampshire has not grossly misused the name by treating St. Mary\u2019s as a credit union.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<em>Accordingly the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-22\">.

At St. Mary\u2019s, demand deposits amount to 11 % of total deposits. At Merchants National, a commercial bank in New Hampshire, demand deposits are 50% of the total.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b563-17\">. <em>See </em>Gen.Laws of R.I. \u00a7 19-21-9.1 (Supp. 1975). <em>See also </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 678.470 (1975) (authorizing demand deposits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\">. The State Bank Commissioner testified that another New Hampshire credit union, L\u2019ange-Guardien, has a greater percentage of real estate loans to total assets than St. Mary\u2019s and that all credit unions in New Hampshire account for approximately 1% of the total real estate loan market. <em>Cf. United States v. Connecticut National Bank, </em>418 U.S. 656, 665, 94 S.Ct. 2788, 41 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1974). (Savings banks having approximately <em>2\u00bd% </em>of the commercial loan market do not compete with commercial banks sufficiently to put them in the same product market for antitrust purposes.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. Subsequent to the oral argument of this case, the government requested the Court to consider portions of the Regulations of the National Credit Union Administration regarding the organization of a <em>federal </em>credit union. We note the requirement that, in establishing a federal credit union, the proposed field of membership must be specified. NCUA Regs. \u00a7 701.1. This is not controlling, however, with respect to a <em>state </em>chartered credit union. <em>See, e. g., </em>Minn.
