Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b835-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b835-21\">Appellant Manley was convicted upon trial by jury of receipt of a firearm by a convicted felon, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1). The one count indictment against Manley charged, in pertinent part, that Manley \u201cknowingly did receive a firearm, . . . which had been shipped and transported in interstate commerce. . .\u201d No contention is raised that the government failed to prove that Manley knowingly received the firearm or that the firearm had been shipped in interstate commerce. The sole issue before us is whether the government must prove that Manley knew, at the time he received the firearm, that the firearm had been shipped in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 U.S. 212, 96 S.Ct. 498, 46 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), there can be no doubt that \u00a7 922(h) covers the intrastate receipt of a firearm that previously had moved in interstate commerce. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the law is well settled that the government is not required to prove appellant\u2019s knowledge of the interstate nexus in these circumstances. <em>United States v. Lupino, </em>480 F.2d 720, 724 (8th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied </em>414 U.S. 924, 94 S.Ct. 257, 38 L.Ed.2d 159 (1973); <em>United States v. Wiley, </em>478 F.2d 415 (8th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied </em>419 U.S. 879, 95 S.Ct. 143, 42 L.Ed.2d 119 (1974). Compare <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971). Thus, the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case and his refusal to issue the defense\u2019s proffered instruction were not error. Nor does a fair reading of the indictment suggest that the government was bound to prove that Manley not only \u201cknowingly\u201d received the firearm but \u201cknew\u201d that the firearm had been shipped in interstate commerce. The government successfully proved its case as laid out in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
