Walton, initiated against her former employer, the Eaton Corporation. Mrs. Walton, a black female, alleged that Eaton had discriminated against her because of her race and sex and that it had therefore violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. After a non-jury trial, the district court made detailed findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>entered judgment in favor of Eaton. Mrs. Walton appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On appeal, Mrs. Walton argued that the judgment of the district court should be reversed for five reasons. She maintained that the district court erred 1. in refusing to permit a jury trial on her claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2. in determining that her discharge was not discriminatory or a reprisal, 3. in determining that she had not been discriminated against in pay, 4. in denying her motion for class action certification as untimely, and 5. in refusing to admit into evidence the findings of fact and the determination made by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This appeal was originally heard by a panel of this Court. Prior to the filing of a panel opinion, the Court voted to consider the appeal in banc.<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the district court. Of the five arguments advanced by Mrs. Walton, only the first \u2014 the propriety of the district court\u2019s refusal to permit a jury trial on her claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981<footnotemark>1b</footnotemark> \u2014 requires extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We have concluded that the district court did not err in refusing to permit a jury trial on Mrs. Walton\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Mrs. Walton initiated two separate employment discrimination actions against the defendant-appellee, Eaton Corporation. Both were filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Mrs. Walton initiated her first employment discrimination action against Eaton (Civil Action 73-322) on February 14, 1973. That suit was brought as a class action in which Mrs. Walton sought to represent all blacks and females who (a) were employed by Eaton at that time, (b) had sought employment with Eaton during the past eight years, or (c) would seek employment with Eaton in the future. Mrs. Walton asserted causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, as well as under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>She alleged that, because she was black and female, Eaton had discriminated against her in many respects. She claimed that she had been denied equal treatment with respect to pay, promotions, and opportunities to obtain educational benefits. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>also alleged that she had been harassed on the job and that she was discriminatorily discharged. Finally, she claimed that Eaton had systematically discriminated on the basis of race and sex. She sought declaratory and injunctive relief, an award of back pay for herself and all other members of the classes she sought to represent, attorney\u2019s fees, punitive damages, costs, and \u201csuch other relief as the Court may deem proper.\u201d Her complaint in Civil Action 73-322 expressly waived trial by jury. Eaton filed a timely answer, which did not seek a jury trial, and Mrs. Walton did not demand a jury trial within ten days thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">At some point in early 1974 it appears that a second set of attorneys began to represent Mrs. Walton. Apparently not satisfied with the complaint filed by her first attorneys, the new attorneys, rather than seeking to amend the first complaint, initiated a second employment discrimination action (Civil Action No. 74-373) against Eaton on February 14, 1974, exactly one year after the first complaint was filed. In almost all respects Mrs. Walton\u2019s second complaint was indistinguishable from her first. Like her first complaint, it asserted causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983 and Title VII. In addition, the second complaint, like the first, alleged that Mrs. Walton had been harassed, discharged, and denied equal treatment in pay, promotions, and educational opportunities because of her race and sex. However, Mrs. Walton\u2019s second complaint did differ from her first in three respects: it was not brought as a class action; it contained a general demand for a trial by jury; and this second complaint, unlike the first, alleged that Mrs. Walton had suffered \u201cemotional and mental injury\u201d as a result of the defendant\u2019s action. Consequently the second complaint apparently sought compensatory damages,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> while the first complaint sought only punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">On July 3, 1974, the district court, on its own motion, consolidated the two actions. On November 19, 1974, nine months after the second complaint was filed and one year and nine months after the first complaint was filed, Mrs. Walton moved to have her first employment discrimination action (Civil Action 73-322) certified as a class action. The district court denied this motion on December 17, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">At the outset, it is clear that Mrs. Walton had no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the same time in the same court and against the same defendant. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haytian Republic, </em>154 U.S. 118, 123-24, 14 S.Ct. 992, 38 L.Ed. 930 (1894); <em>Sutcliffe Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. v. United States, </em>162 F.2d 849, 851, 125 Ct.Cl. 297 (1st Cir. 1947) (Clark, J., sitting by designation); 1A J. Moore, Federal Practice 110.219 at 2601 (2d ed. 1974); P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, &amp; H. Wechsler, Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1232-33 (2d ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">When the district court became aware that the two actions begun by Mrs. Walton were virtually identical, it could have dismissed her second complaint without prejudice or it could have stayed proceedings in the second action until judgment was entered in the first. <em>Id. </em>As Judge Charles E. Clark wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">\u201cThe pendency of a prior pending action in the same federal court is ground for abatement of the second action.\u201d . There is no reason why a court should be bothered or a litigant harassed with duplicating lawsuits on the same docket . . (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-13\"><em>Sutcliffe Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. v. United States, supra </em>at 851. Obviously, if the district court had dismissed the second complaint or stayed the second action, Mrs. Walton would have had no right to a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, instead of following either of those procedures, the district court on its own motion consolidated the two actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The district court\u2019s decision to consolidate Mrs. Walton\u2019s two actions was obviously unobjectionable. When a court learns that two possibly duplicative actions are pending on its docket, consolidation may well be the most administratively efficient procedure. If the second complaint proves to contain some new matters, consolidation \u2014 unlike dismissal of the second complaint without prejudice or staying the second action \u2014 will avoid two trials on closely related matters. If, on the other hand, the second complaint proves to contain nothing new, consolidation of the two actions will cause no harm <em>provided </em>that the district court carefully insures that the plaintiff does not use the tactic of filing two substantially identical complaints to expand the procedural rights he would have otherwise enjoyed. In particular, the court must insure that the plaintiff does not use the incorrect procedure of filing duplicative complaints for the purpose of circumventing the rules pertaining to the amendment of complaints, Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 15, and demand for trial by jury, Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In the instant case, we are convinced that, in considering whether Mrs. Walton waiver her right to trial by jury, the filing of the second complaint and its consolidation with the first must be regarded as an amendment of the first complaint. If Mrs. Walton\u2019s second set of attorneys was dissatisfied with the first complaint filed by her previous counsel, the proper procedure for them to have followed would have been to have sought leave of court to amend the first complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The adoption of an incorrect procedure as employed in this case should not result in a greater right to trial by jury than would have been available had the correct course of amending the first complaint been followed. In light of the sequence of events described above, it is evident that Mrs. Walton\u2019s second complaint must be regarded as no more than an amendment to her first complaint. As such, it is clearly apparent that she waived her right to trial by jury on her claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">It is well established that if the original pleadings in an action effectively waive trial by jury under Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38(b) and (d), the right to trial by jury of all matters contained in those pleadings cannot be revived by amending the original pleadings. <em>Hostrop v.

Sincavage, </em>439 F.2d 1133 (3d Cir. 1971) (amendment to complaint adding new plaintiff did not revive previously waived right to jury trial).

Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2320 at 94-95 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In this case, Mrs. Walton unquestionably waived her right to trial by jury on all issues framed by her original complaint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only addition to the second complaint which could even arguably constitute a \u201cnew issue\u201d was the allegation that Mrs. Walton had suffered mental and emotional injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are convinced, however, that that allegation cannot be accurately characterized as a \u201cnew issue\u201d in the sense relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">As we read the established case law, it holds that amended pleadings which concern \u201cthe same general issues\u201d as the previous pleadings do not raise \u201cnew issues\u201d under Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38(b), even if they differ from the earlier pleadings in some particulars. <em>Hostrop </em>v. <em>Board of Junior College District No. 515, supra, </em>at 580-81; <em>Trixler Brokerage Co. v.

In that case, the owners of all the stock of the Victor Billiard Company conveyed those shares to the BarChris Construction Company in exchange for Bar-Chris stock. Prior to the transfer, BarChris officers supplied an annual report, a prospectus, and other financial reports concerning BarChris to the owners of the Victor stock. When BarChris filed a petition in bankruptcy less than one year after the exchange, the former owners of the Victor stock commenced an action for compensatory damages against former officers and directors of BarChris under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \u00a7 240.10b-5. One of the defendant-officers, Kircher, waived his right to trial by jury on claims framed by this complaint. Two years after their original complaint was filed, the plaintiffs amended their original complaint by adding an allegation that the prospectus which had been supplied to them was false on the date of issue. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>response to this amendment, Kircher made a timely demand for trial by jury. A year and one-half later, the plaintiffs again amended their complaint. The new amendments 1. alleged that the defendant\u2019s conduct had violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), 2. alleged that the defendants\u2019 conduct had been willful, and 3. requested punitive damages. In response, Kircher again made a timely demand for trial by jury. Nevertheless, the district court denied Kircher\u2019s application for a jury trial, and the Second Circuit affirmed. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">The amendments did not raise new issues within the meaning of Rule 38 such as would entitle Kircher to demand a jury trial as of right. The ease involved, and the original complaint raised, <em>one basic issue: </em>Whether plaintiffs were fraudulently induced to exchange their Victor stock. Kircher\u2019s failure to demand a jury trial waived his right as to all issues relating to this <em>general area of dispute. </em>The amendment added no new issues: <em>the same conduct </em>and the same allegedly false documents constituted the basis for any claim under Rule 10b-5, Section 17(a), or common law fraud. The willfulness and falsity as of a particular date merely clarified <em>\u201cthe same general issues\u201d </em>raised in the original complaint. <em>Moore v. United States, </em>196 F.2d 906, 908 (5th Cir. 1952). Kircher had been put on notice of the underlying facts and basic legal theory \u2014 fraud\u2014upon which plaintiffs sought relief, and the character of the suit was in no way changed by the amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">It seems clear that the reasoning in <em>Lan-za, </em>which we find persuasive, defeats Mrs. Walton\u2019s claim that she was entitled to a jury trial in this case. Under <em>Lanza, </em>the allegation that Mrs. Walton had suffered \u201cemotional and mental\u201d injury would not constitute a \u201cnew issue.\u201d In the language of <em>Lanza, </em>the addition of that allegation did not change the \u201cbasic issue\u201d or the \u201cgeneral area of dispute,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>whether Eaton discriminated against Mrs. Walton while she was in the company\u2019s employ. The second complaint here concerned the \u201csame conduct\u201d on the part of Eaton as the first complaint, <em>i. e., </em>that Eaton discriminatorily discharged Mrs. Walton; that Eaton employees harassed her on the job; and that Eaton discriminated against her with respect to pay, promotions, and opportunities to obtain educational benefits. Moreover, the addition in this case of the allegation that Mrs. Walton suffered \u201cmental and emotional injury\u201d is analogous to the amendment in <em>Lanza </em>which alleged for the first time that the defendants had acted willfully. Both \u201camendments\u201d pleaded facts which had not been alleged in the previous complaints, but neither raised a \u201cnew issue,\u201d since they did not change the \u201cbasic issue\u201d in the case or the \u201cgeneral area of dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In sum, under the sound reasoning of <em>Lanza </em>and the other authorities treating with this point, it is obvious that no \u201cnew issue\u201d was added by Mrs. Walton\u2019s second complaint<footnotemark>7a</footnotemark> and that therefore her first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>complaint with its express jury waiver did not entitle her dispute with Eaton to be resolved by a jury.<footnotemark>7b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We do not believe that any of the other arguments advanced by Mrs. Walton are meritorious. In determining that Mrs. Walton\u2019s discharge was neither discriminatory nor a reprisal, the district court applied the correct standard of law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and its findings of facts were not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same is true of the district court\u2019s determination that Mrs. Walton had not been discriminated against in pay.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">We are convinced that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mrs. Walton\u2019s motion for a class action determination, since that motion was not made until 21 months after her first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>complaint was filed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit the EEOC\u2019s findings of fact and its determination on the merits of Mrs. Walton\u2019s charges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Gil-lin </em>v. <em>Federal Paper Board Go., Inc., </em>479 F.2d 97, 99 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>Cox v.

Judge Gibbons has attached the <em>panel </em>majority opinion to his in banc dissent. He notes that it was never published under our Internal Operating Rules, as it had not cleared the Court after circulation to non-panel members and was therefore not filed. As a reading of the <em>pane] </em>majority opinion reveals, and as the <em>panel </em>dissent (which has not been reproduced) pointed out, there was a failure in the panel opinion to discuss the very important procedural issue upon which this case turns. That failure resulted in this Court\u2019s decision to rehear this case in banc. Inasmuch as it has not been the practice to publish panel opinions which have not cleared the Court on initial circulation, we do not feel that it would add anything to the issues before the Court to publish the panel dissent, particularly since we regard the discussion of our in banc procedure as found in Part IV of Judge Gibbons\u2019s dissenting opinion as being irrelevant to the issues presently before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1b\">\n<p id=\"b125-15\">. The dissent states that the district court ruled \u201cthat, as a matter of law, a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for money damages for the infliction of emotional harm was not an action at law to which the seventh amendment right to jury trial applied.\u201d Dissenting Op. at 1. <em>See also id. </em>at 3, 4. The record casts appreciable doubt upon the accuracy of this characterization of the district court\u2019s ruling. The defendant argued strenuously in this Court that the district court ruled only that the plaintiff had orally waived her right to jury trial under \u00a7 1981. The district court record reveals that the arguments of counsel and the observations of the district judge were focused on the issue of waiver as well as on the issue of pendent state claims. Because we affirm the district court for the reasons stated below, we find it unnecessary to address any substantive issue presented by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38(b) and (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. The prayer for relief in the second complaint stated simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">\u201cWherefore, Plaintiff claims of the Defendant sums of money in excess of Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars and brings this action to recover same.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">. If the district court had dismissed the second complaint without prejudice or if it had stayed the second action, the first action would undoubtedly have proceeded to final judgment.

Klapmeier, </em>526 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1975), hardly supports the dissent\u2019s position, since the amended pleading in that case is not at all comparable to the \u201camended pleading\u201d here. <em>Klapmeier </em>was an action by a bank against the guarantors of a promissory note. The bank sought to recover from the guarantors the amount of a judgment which it had previously obtained against the maker of the note. The defense asserted in the guarantors\u2019 original answer appears to have been that the bank had orally agreed that the guarantee would terminate prior to the date on which the judgment against the maker was obtained. The guarantors\u2019 amended answer, which contained a <em>timely </em>demand for trial by jury (a factor not present here), added the new defense of fraud in the inducement. Since the defense of fraud in the inducement did not concern the \u201csame conduct\u201d or the same \u201cbasic issue\u201d as the original answer, the court correctly concluded that it had raised a \u201cnew issue\u201d within the meaning of Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Even were we to regard Mrs. Walton\u2019s claim of emotional injury as a \u201cnew issue\u201d \u2014 which we do not \u2014 the very most to which she could have been entitled under <em>Klapmeier </em>(526 F.2d at 81) is a jury trial as to those damages.

On January 7, 1975, the district court had entered an order requiring that all discovery be completed by January 31 and placing the case on the February trial list. On February 14, the plaintiff filed a motion for a two-month trial continuance so that her statistical expert could complete his analysis of Eaton\u2019s employment practices. Argument on this motion was heard on February 18. At that hearing the district court stated that it would not permit the entire trial to be delayed for two months. However, the court did make the following proposal: if a nonjury trial was held, the court offered to hear all the evidence other than that of plaintiff\u2019s expert at the scheduled time and to take the expert\u2019s testimony two months later when his statistical analysis was completed. That proposal, however, was \u201cconditioned on one thing. We can\u2019t try it with a jury under those circumstances.\u201d Supplemental Appendix at 146. Plaintiffs counsel continued to demand a jury trial on at least some issues, and the court then denied plaintiff\u2019s requests for a two-month continuance and for a trial by jury. Since a jury trial \u2014 whether under Rule 38 or Rule 39(b) \u2014 would have required a two-month delay and since the district court had already stated unequivocally that it would not allow such a delay, it is obvious why no Rule 39(b) motion was ever made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b130-17\">. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Since the author of the panel opinion was a district judge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he did not participate in our <em>in banc </em>consideration of the case. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(c). His opinion for the panel majority, however, disposed of the only ruling which the trial court made on the issues which the majority opinion addresses. The trial court ruled, and the appellees urge on appeal, that, as a matter- of law, a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 for money damages for the infliction of emotional harm was not an action at law to which the seventh amendment right to jury trial applied. For the reasons set forth in District Judge Cohen\u2019s panel opinion, which I annex hereto as an appendix, it is clear to me that this ruling was error. The majority does not defend this ruling. Thus I assume they too agree it was indefensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">Instead of defending the ruling which the trial court made, however, the majority decides this appeal on grounds: (1) which the district court never addressed; (2) as to which, since they were never presented to the district court, appellant had no opportunity to respond; (3) which were not briefed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>by either party on appeal; (4) which ignore a significant provision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (5) which distort the meaning of the rule which the opinion purports to apply and misstates the thrust of the cases relied upon; and (6) which usurp a function reserved to the district courts. Neither the result nor the process of appellate decision-making which led to it are defensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The majority, blindly ignoring the fact that the district court treated the second complaint not as an amendment, but as a new complaint stating a separate claim, proceeds to construct an affirmance based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 38 and the cases construing it. I will address the treatment of those cases in Part II. But before turning to those cases I would like to call attention to the selectivity with which the majority deals with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Except in a footnote in response to my dissent, no mention whatsoever is made of Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(b), which provides that \u201cnotwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by a jury of any or all issues.\u201d The discretion explicitly provided for in Rule 39(b) is that of the district court, not of this court. This discretionary power, however, was never exercised, because the district court ruled, as a matter of law, that a \u00a7 1981 claim was not a claim upon which a demand for a jury trial could have been made of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">A leading commentary on the Federal Rules says of Rule 39(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">There is a wide divergence of view on how a court should exercise its discretion on a motion under Rule 39(b). It is the rule in some courts that \u201cthe court should grant a jury trial in the absence of strong and compelling reasons to the contrary.\u201d Elsewhere it has been held that the court has no discretion to grant jury trial when there was no timely demand unless there are special circumstances excusing the oversight or default. Indeed it has been claimed that the cases requiring a showing of special circumstances represent such a settled course of decision that they have \u201cplaced a gloss upon the Rule which a judge could no more disregard than if the words had appeared in the Rule itself.\u201d Finally there are those decisions that in effect read Rule 39(b) out of the rules, as where a court says that \u201cit has been the unbending practice of this Court for many years not to order a jury trial once it has been waived,\u201d or where it is held that a motion under Rule 39(b) will not be granted if any party objects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">\u25a0 Those courts that have taken \u00e1 highly restrictive view of the circumstances in which the discretion given by Rule 39(b) will be exercised in favor of allowing a jury trial have reasoned that the power to order trial by jury given them by that rule was not intended to serve as a device to circumvent or bypass the positive action that must be taken under Rule 38 to obtain jury trial. These decisions seem to place the emphasis in the wrong place. Technical insistence upon imposing a penalty for default by denying a jury trial is not in the spirit of the rules. The rules do not limit the court\u2019s discretion in ordering a jury in cases in which there would have been a right to jury trial. The court ought to approach each application under Rule 39(b) with an open mind and an eye to the factual situation in that particular case, rather than with a fixed policy against granting the application or even a preconceived notion that applications of this kind are usually to be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">Since Rule 39(b) entrusts discretion in this matter to the district courts, the appellate courts ordinarily will not intervene, whether the district court has granted the motion or denied it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2334 at 113-16, 123 (1971) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">In this instance the district court neither granted nor denied a Rule 39(b) motion. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ruled that, as a matter of law, a \u00a7 1981 claim would never support a demand for a jury trial. I have found no instance in which an appellate court substituted its own original exercise of discretion under Rule 39(b) for the unexercised discretion of a district court. Directly in point is Judge Tone\u2019s statement in <em>Hostrop v. Bd. of Jr. College Dist. No. 515, </em>523 F.2d 569, 581 (7th Cir. 1975): \u201cWe can hardly affirm an exercise of discretion that did not occur, and therefore must consider whether plaintiff was otherwise entitled to a jury trial.\u201d There may be contrary cases on this point which my research has not disclosed, but because the majority is off on a frolic of its own I have not had the benefit of briefing on the point. I do know, however, that this court has not heretofore exercised original Rule 39(b) discretion. I also know that we have not heretofore taken a position on either of the divergent approaches referred to in <em>Wright &amp; Miller </em>as to the degree of discretion reposed in the district courts under Rule 39(b). But the majority now chooses either to ignore the existence of Rule 39(b) or, <em>sub silentio, </em>to hold that, in this case, the district court possessed no discretionary power to grant Rule 39(b) relief. Neither position is tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The Rule 39(b) problems, which in my view inhere in the majority opinion, cannot be avoided by accepting the majority\u2019s contention that \u201cin considering whether Mrs. Walton waived her right to trial by jury, the filing of the second complaint and its consolidation with the first must be regarded as an amendment of the first complaint.\u201d Majority Op. at 71. Since the district court consolidated the cases rather than either dismissing or staying the second complaint, it follows from the majority\u2019s reasoning that the court allowed the amendment. (We do not know, of course, whether the district court had that in mind since it never mentioned the subject of an amended complaint.) Treating the case as one in which an amendment was permitted, we are confronted with the fact that after allowing it, again on the majority\u2019s analysis, the district court struck the jury trial demand because a \u00a7 1981 claim, as a matter of law, did not call for it. Since no one on the court asserts that the \u00a7 1981 ruling was correct, and since no federal court has the authority to ignore the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it must be assumed that the majority holds, <em>sub silentio, </em>that the district court lacked the power to grant Rule 39(b) relief, even if it had been given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Even assuming that this court were to adopt the position of those courts which take the narrowest view of the scope of discretion permitted under Rule 39(b), we still could not, in good conscience, say that, had a favorable discretion been exercised, we would reverse. For, as I will suggest in Part III <em>infra, </em>it is at least arguable that there was compliance with Rule 38(b) with respect to the second complaint and, even if that argument is not accepted, there are strong reasons why the omission of a jury demand in the first complaint was understandable and should be excused, if a district court had so held in the exercise of its discretionary power pursuant to Rule 39(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Although I refer to the majority\u2019s \u201camendment\u201d analysis for purposes of my Rule 39(b) discussion, I do not otherwise accept it, because it misstates the effect of the authorities upon which it relies and ignores the substantial differences in factual and legal issues tendered by Mrs. Walton\u2019s second complaint. The major underpinning for the majority\u2019s contention that the second complaint should be treated as an amendment of the first is the opening sentence in Part I B:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">At the outset, it is clear that Mrs. Walton had no right to maintain two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the same time in the same court against the same defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">For that proposition two cases and two secondary authorities are cited. The citation to P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, H. Wechsler, Hart &amp; Wechsler\u2019s The Federal Courts and The Federal System 1232-33 (2d ed. 1973) is hard to understand, since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>referenced pages do not support the majority\u2019s position, but deal only with the issue of conflicts in jurisdiction between separate courts over the same subject matter. The citation to 1A J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 0.219 at 2601 (2d ed. 1974) is almost equally puzzling, since that page deals mainly with the limitations imposed upon federal courts on enjoining state proceedings by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283. The opening two paragraphs on that page, however, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">Two or more actions <em>in personam </em>between the same parties and involving the same subject matter may proceed concurrently (1) in the courts of the same forum, or (2) in the courts of two or more forums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Where such actions are pending in the courts of the same forum a plea in abatement can result in the dismissal of all but the first action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">That quote does not sound at all like the proposition for which the majority cites it. The rule is not that there cannot be simultaneous lawsuits, but that there can be \u201ctwo or more actions <em>in personam </em>between the same parties and involving the same subject matter in the courts of the same forum,\u201d and that a plea in abatement may be granted should the <em>trial court </em>so choose. Here, of course, no plea in abatement was considered. The two cases cited by the majority lend even less support to the court\u2019s pivotal proposition. <em>United States v. The Haytian Republic, </em>154 U.S. 118, 14 S.Ct. 992, 38 L.Ed. 930 (1894), did not involve simultaneous <em>in personam </em>actions at all. It involved successive <em>in rem </em>libels of a vessel in separate districts (Washington and Oregon) for separate, but similar, smuggling offenses, both of which took place before the filing of the first libel in Washington. The district court in Oregon, in which the second libel action was filed, dismissed the libel on the theory that all the smuggling charges should have been included in the first libel. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, but the Supreme Court reversed, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">The elementary principle which governs the availability of the plea of \u201cother suit pending\u201d was thus stated in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>13 Wall. 679, 715, 20 L.Ed. 666:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">\u201cWhen the pendency of such a suit is set up to defeat another, the case must be the same. There must be the same parties, or, at least, such as represent the same interest, there must be the same rights asserted and the same relief prayed for. This relief must be founded on the same facts, and the title, or essential basis of the relief sought, must be the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">Tested by these principles, it is obvious that the plea of pendency of the suit in Washington was not available here. There were the same parties, but not the same rights asserted; and the claim of relief was not founded upon the same facts. In the case just cited it was said that the true test of the sufficiency of a plea of \u201cother suit pending\u201d in another forum was the legal efficacy of the first suit, when finally disposed of, as \u201cthe thing adjudged,\u201d regarding the matters at issue in the second suit. <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Gil-mer, </em>4 La.Ann. 520; <em>Bischoff v. Theurer, </em>8 La.Ann. 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">The efficiency of the test, thus applied, results from the fact that the elements constituting the thing adjudged, and those necessary for the plea of \u201cother suit pending,\u201d are identical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">It is contended, however, that, although the two suits involved the assertion of different rights, as the rights asserted in the last suit were in existence at the time the first suit was brought, therefore they should have been asserted in that suit, and could not be afterwards relied upon in a separate suit, in a different forum. In support of this proposition we are referred to the case of <em>Stark v. Starr, </em>94 U.S. 477, 485, [24 L.Ed. 276] and this language is quoted from the opinion in that case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly a settled question that a party seeking to enforce a claim legal or equitable must present to the court, either by the pleadings or proofs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>all the grounds upon which he expects a judgment in his favor. He is not at liberty to split up his demand and prosecute it by piecemeal, or present only a portion of the grounds upon which special relief is sought, and leave the rest to be presented in a second suit, if the first fail. There would be no end to litigation if such a practice were permissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">This statement, however, is qualified by the following, which is not included in the citation: \u201cBut this principle does not require distinct causes of action \u2014 that is to say, distinct matters \u2014 each of which would authorize by itself independent relief, to be presented in a single suit, though they existed at the same time and might be considered together.\u201d p. 485.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">The qualification states the elementary rule. One of the tests laid down for the purpose of determining whether or not the causes of action should have been joined in one suit is whether the evidence necessary to prove one cause of action would establish the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">154 U.S. at 124-25,14 S.Ct. at 993-94. The discussion in <em>The Haytian Republic </em>does not sound any more like the proposition for which it was cited than does the cited passage from Professor Moore\u2019s treatise. And, given the fact that <em>The Haytian Republic </em>was exclusively an <em>in rem </em>action, it is highly questionable whether it could support the majority\u2019s position even if it contained, which it does not, any language supporting such a procedural rule. Finally, there is <em>Sutcliffe Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. v. United States, </em>162 F.2d 849 (1st Cir. 1947), the case which Professor Moore cites for the proposition that a plea in abatement of a second action in the same court <em>may </em>be granted. <em>(Sutcliffe, </em>in turn, relied on an earlier edition of Professor Moore\u2019s treatise. 162 F.2d at 851. Thus do great legal principles become settled.) Plaintiff Sutcliffe had a single claim against the United States for use and occupancy of a single building from June 15, 1942, to December 31, 1945. This single claim asserted damages in excess of $25,000. Though the claim was cognizable in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act, Sutcliffe preferred to sue in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts. However, the district court\u2019s jurisdiction of claims against the United States was limited to $10,000; thus, to circumvent this jurisdictional limit, Sut-cliffe filed four separate actions, each for less than the $10,000 jurisdictional limit. The district court dismissed three of these suits and retained one, on the ground that they were brought for inseparable parts of the claim set forth in the first action filed. On appeal from the dismissal of the three actions, the First Circuit held that the plaintiff could not, by dividing up a single claim for use and occupancy over a determined period, defeat the jurisdictional arrangements of the Tucker Act. Though the case does stand as support for the long settled proposition against splitting causes of actions for all amounts due under a lease at the time the action is filed, it is difficult to see how that case bears upon the proposition for which it is cited by the majority in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The rule of <em>The Haytian Republic, </em>applied to this record, points in exactly the opposite direction from the majority\u2019s conclusion. Before a plea in abatement can be granted \u201cthere must be the same parties, there must be the same rights asserted and the same relief prayed for. This relief must be founded on the same facts, and the title, or essential basis of the relief sought must be the same.\u201d 154 U.S. at 124, 14 S.Ct. at 993. Entirely aside from the fact that the class action complaint sought the addition of other parties, there are, with respect to the two complaints, other substantial factual and legal differences. The first complaint seeks the equitable relief of reinstatement with back pay. It also seeks punitive damages for a wrongful discharge. The second complaint seeks compensation for personal injury in the nature of emotional harm. Proof of the first cause of action would require no evidence that plaintiff suffered emotional injury, or that that injury was permanent, or that it resulted in medical expense, impairment of earning capacity, or pain and suffering. Proof of the first cause of action would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>resolve legal issues such as whether \u00a7 1981 would afford recovery for the infliction of emotional harm, or whether such infliction, to be actionable, must be intentional. The first complaint was essentially an action for wrongful breach of an employment contract. The second was essentially a tort action for infliction of emotional harm. By no stretch of the imagination can those two causes of action be crammed under the rubric of the <em>Sutcliffe </em>case. Whatever may be said about the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>consolidation, no authority that I know of, and certainly none referred to in the majority opinion, would justify dismissal of the second complaint because it \u201csplit\u201d a cause of action. Since appellant does not complain about the consolidation order, except to the extent that it resulted in the loss of a right to jury trial, I see no need for discussing it, except to note that even if it was proper it was not dispositive on the jury trial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Turning from the red herrings of <em>The Haytian Republic </em>and <em>Sutcliffe </em>to the cases under Rule 38(b) on which the court relies for its conclusion that the second complaint introduced no \u201cnew issue\u201d, I am equally unpersuaded. Most of the cases cited in Part I C of the majority opinion actually support the appellant. All recognize the \u201csame issues\u201d test. None can be twisted, turned or tortured into authority for the proposition that a claim for breach of an employment relationship presents the \u201csame issues\u201d as a claim for personal injury, mental or physical. I will not rehearse the clear differences between this case and all those cited on which the majority relies. I will, instead, refer only to the one case described by the majority as \u201c[t]he most illuminating case on this <em>point\u201d </em>\u2014 Lanza <em>v. Drexel Co., </em>479 F.2d 1277 (2d Cir. 1973). In that case, as the court points out, the amendment focused on the defendants\u2019 con<em>duct </em>\u2014 \u201cthe <em>same conduct\", </em>as the majority italicize it. The majority, then, reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ae-dedup-0\">Moreover, the addition in this case of the allegation that Mrs. Walton suffered \u201cmental and emotional injury\u201d is analogous to the amendment in <em>Lanza </em>which alleged for the first time that the defendants had acted willfully.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Majority Op. at 73. What possible analogy exists between an amendment adding a personal injury claim to an employment termination claim and an amendment adding specificity respecting the defendants\u2019 fraud? If that is an analogy, I am a Martian. The case would be analogous, perhaps, if the plaintiffs in <em>Lanza </em>had amended the complaint to allege \u201cthey also broke our legs.\u201d It would also have been decided differently, at least in any circuit but this.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">A case which at least reflects the kind of reasoned approach to the identification of new issues which should govern our application of Rule 38 is <em>First Wis. Nat. Bank of Rice Lake </em>v. <em>Klapmeier, </em>526 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1975). The original complaint was a suit on a guarantee and did not demand a jury trial. Nor was a jury trial demanded by the defendants in their answer or in the counterclaim which they filed against the plaintiff. Thereafter the defendants were permitted to amend their answer by affirmatively pleading fraudulent inducement; the amended answer also included, for the first time, a demand for a jury trial. The plaintiff moved to strike the demand on the ground that it was untimely, and this motion was granted by the trial court. The Eighth Circuit reversed. Judge Lay wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agk\">The parties have not argued the issue in this manner in this court. The claim made here is that the court abused its discretion under Rule 39(b) in failing to grant relief from the untimely demand. Nonetheless, we feel the right to trial by jury is so fundamental that this court should acknowledge defendants\u2019 actual compliance with Rule 38(b) and allow the demand as a matter of right for the new issue raised. Rule 38(a) recognizes the right to a jury trial in this language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">We order a new trial on defendants\u2019 defense of fraud in the inducement raised in the amended answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>526 F.2d at 80. The case <em>sub judice, </em>I submit, is an a <em>fortiori </em>case. The second complaint, which the majority treats as an amendment, at all times contained a demand for a jury trial, and it patently raised new issues. Thus at a minimum, the appellant was entitled as a matter of right to a jury trial on the issue of emotional harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In reference to Mrs. Walton\u2019s filing of her second complaint the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9z\">[T]he court must insure that the plaintiff does not use the incorrect procedure of filing duplicative complaints for the purpose of circumventing the rules pertaining to the amendment of complaints, Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 15, and demand for trial by jury, Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Majority Op. at 71. If a majority of this court chooses to characterize Mrs. Walton\u2019s filing of her second complaint as an \u201cincorrect procedure\u201d, it is, of course, law of the case. But, from the perspective of the attorney who filed the second complaint and assumed Mrs. Walton\u2019s representation only after the attorney who filed the first complaint disassociated himself from her ease, the correct procedure might not have appeared so clear as it now appears to the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">We have not heard why the first attorney waived a jury trial on the first complaint, or why he omitted the personal injury claim, because the parties have never been heard on the theory on which the case is being decided. I can speculate, however, as to why the attorney who drew the first complaint committed those omissions. The first complaint sought class action relief. Consequently, he may have believed that a class action, being originally an equitable device, was one in which a jury trial is unavailable. <em>See </em>5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 38.38[2] at 308-09 (2d ed. 1976) (indicating that there is authority to that effect, but criticizing it). I have no doubt that jury trials are available in class actions for claims which are legal in nature. <em>See, e. g., Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 860 (3d Cir. 1977). But the paucity of authority on that point, and that not unanimous, may have led the first attorney to conclude that he might as well waive what he could not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">As to the omission of the claim for emotional harm in the first complaint, it seems likely that the first attorney would have omitted that claim because it is, in its nature, highly individual. It would be difficult to imagine any district court granting class action treatment for such a claim. I can easily understand an attorney concluding that a stumbling block to class action treatment should be omitted in the interest of maximizing the leverage inherent in the class action device. In any event, had they been given the opportunity, the attorneys for Mrs. Walton, even on the majority\u2019s \u201camendment\u201d theory, could, I think, have presented plausible arguments to the district court as to why their \u201cneglect\u201d in demanding a jury trial should be excused as permitted by Rule 39(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">I am not sure what the majority opinion means for attorneys faced with similar choices in the future. Possibly it means that every claim that the original plaintiff has, on any legal theory and for any injury, must be asserted in the original complaint if it, in any way, grows out of an identifiable relationship between the parties. This opinion will surely cause trouble in the future, for the \u201csame issues\u201d test for purposes of Rule 38 is only a different aspect of the \u201csame issues\u201d test for res judicata. Thus, a likely implication of the holding is that, had Mrs. Walton not filed the second complaint and had the first been tried, her personal injury claim would have been barred. And if the \u201csame issues\u201d test is as open-ended as the majority says, what of class members who fail to opt out in ignorance of other claims they might have made? Will a judgment for the defendant bar such claims? Only time, and litigation, will tell.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">Fed.R.App.P. 35(a) provides that a hearing <em>in banc </em>is not favored and ordinarily will not be ordered except (1) when consideration by the full court is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of its decisions, or (2) when the proceeding involves a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>question of exceptional importance. This case meets neither criterion. The original panel majority opinion is entirely consistent with the prior law of this circuit, and the present majority opinion does not even rely on third circuit precedent for its critical holding. The case was of no particular importance to anyone except the litigants at the panel stage. It was taken <em>i\u00f1 banc </em>not for either criterion of Rule 35(a), but solely because one panel member, by the intensity of his advocacy for a result, persuaded four colleagues that the full court should review the panel result. The case has now become significant because the court cannot reach the desired result without dismantling Rule 39(b) by exercising a discretion that is committed to the district court and warping precedent with respect to identity of issues. Appellate Rule 35 was never intended to operate thus. Nor was the appellate process intended to operate in a manner which denies litigants notice and opportunity to be heard on discretionary rulings. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The majority treats the second complaint as an \u201camendment\u201d because it presented the same issues, and then it incorrectly applies Rule 38(b) because the \u201camendment\u201d presented the same issues. However, in my view, the second complaint clearly presented a different issue, and even if it were an amendment, which it was not, a jury trial on the new issue was available under Rule 38.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, even if it was not, discretionary relief was available under Rule 39(b) and was never considered, because the trial court erred in ruling that, as a matter of law, a \u00a7 1981 claim would never support a demand for a jury trial. The only proper course is a reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">(Original panel opinion in Walton v. Eaton Corp. Judge Garth\u2019s dissent is not included.)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS For the Third Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">No. 76-1707</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">CAROL J. WALTON,</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">\n<em>Appellant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">\n<em>v.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">EATON CORPORATION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">COHEN, Senior District Judge:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">The threshold question in these consolidated actions, alleging a denial of equal employment opportunities, is whether the appellant was entitled to a trial by jury. The district court determined that she was not. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-20\">On February 14,1973 the appellant, Carol J. Walton, filed a complaint in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>court, Civil Action 73-322, against the Eaton Corporation (Eaton), claiming that because of her race and sex, she was denied certain equal employment opportunities. She contends that Eaton violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l) and (2); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. A trial by jury was not demanded in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On February 14, 1974 appellant filed a second complaint in the district court, Civil Action 74-373, which was substantially similar to the initial complaint. In this action she sought an additional element of damage, namely, that as a result of Eaton\u2019s unlawful and intentional acts in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, she was caused to suffer severe emotional distress culminating in a loss of earnings and diminution of earning capacity. She sought damages in excess of $10,000.00 and demanded a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Thereafter, on July 2, 1974, these two actions were consolidated for trial. The district court, on January 7, 1975, entered an Order that all discovery was to be completed by January 31, 1975, that these consolidated actions were to be placed on the February 1975 trial calendar, and that the parties were to file their final pretrial memoranda on or before February 14,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On February 14,1975, the appellant then proceeded to file in this Court a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus and Prohibition and a Motion for Stay (No. 75-1138). She sought to compel the district court to allow her to complete discovery, to grant an extension of time in which to file a pretrial memorandum and for a continuance of the trial. This Court denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Stay by Order, dated February 18, 1975. On March 3, 1975, appellant filed a Motion for Leave to Withdraw the Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Prohibition, which was granted by Order, dated March 7,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The district court, on February 18, 1975, heard arguments on appellant\u2019s motions concerning, <em>inter alia, </em>the completion of discovery and for a continuance of trial, which were ultimately denied. In addition, the Court held that the appellant was not entitled to a jury trial on the basis of her complaint filed in Civil Action 74-373. Thereafter, a non-jury trial on both complaints was commenced on February 21, 1975. An Order and Opinion was filed March 26, 1976 granting judgment in favor of Eaton.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">Although the appellant raises numerous issues on appeal,- the only matter which need be discussed herein is the appellant\u2019s right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that in \u201c[sjuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved . . . .\u201d The application of the Seventh Amendment to judicial proceedings traditionally depended on whether the law suit was legal or equitable in nature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-16\">. . not merely suits, which the common law recognized among its old and settled proceedings, but suits in which legal rights were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction to those where equitable rights alone were recognized, and equitable remedies were administered . . . In a just sense, the amendment then may well be construed to embrace all suits which are not of equity and admiralty jurisdiction, whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\u201d <em>Parsons v. Bedford, </em>28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 (1830).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-19\">Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the mechanism for a litigant to demand a jury trial. In the instant case, appellant properly sought to jury trial in Civil Action 74-373 and inasmuch as she made no demand for a jury trial in Civil Action 73-322, her right to do so was waived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>It is not entirely clear as to the precise basis for the district court\u2019s ruling of February 18, 1975 in denying the appellant a jury trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It does appear, however, that the trial court placed its reliance on the premise that, as a matter of law, there is no right to a jury trial involving claims arising under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Courts have consistently held that in Title VII actions, there is no right to a jury trial. The relief provisions of Title VII, contained in Section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) do not specifically authorize an award of legal damages. The relief sought in Title VII cases \u2014 reinstatement and the award of back pay \u2014 is considered to be a form of restitution. Since restitution is an equitable remedy, a jury is not required. <em>Robinson v. Lorillard Corp., </em>444 F.2d 791, 802 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1006, 92 S.Ct. 573, 30 L.Ed.2d 655 (1971); <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>417 F.2d 1122, 1125 (5th Cir. 1969); <em>Loo v. Gerarge, </em>374 F.Supp. 1338, 1340 (D.Hawaii 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The appellant, in her brief, concedes that under Title VII actions exclusively she was not entitled to a jury trial. However, in Civil Action 74-373, she alleges that the district court refused to acknowledge her right to a jury trial where the relief sought was both equitable and legal in nature. The legal relief sought was for the \u201c. . . [defendant's unlawful, malicious, willful and intentional violation of plaintiff\u2019s civil rights, as aforesaid, plaintiff was caused to suffer severe emotional and mental injury, she was caused to suffer embarrassment and humiliation [and] she was caused to suffer loss of earnings and earning capacity.\u201d (App. at 28A).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Appellant contends that this cause of action arises under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, which serves as a predicate for a suit for damages as well as for equitable relief. In <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), the Supreme Court ruled that a party suing under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, even if joined with a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, may obtain legal damages in addition to the appropriate equitable relief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">\u201cAlthough this Court has not specifically so held, it is well settled among the Federal Courts of Appeals \u2014 and we now join them \u2014 that \u00a7 1981 affords a federal remedy against discrimination in private employment on the basis of race. An individual who establishes a cause of action under \u00a7 1981 is entitled to both equitable and legal relief, including compensatory and, under certain circumstances, punitive damages.\u201d (Citations and Footnotes omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 459-460, 95 S.Ct. at 1720.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA0\"><em>See Flores v. Local 25, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO, </em>407 F.Supp. 218 (E.D.N.Y.1976). Therefore, when a complaint alleges a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, seeking both equitable and legal relief, a jury demand is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The Supreme Court case of <em>Curtis v. Loether, </em>415 U.S. 189, 94 S.Ct. 1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974), illuminates the issue currently presented in this case. The facts of <em>Curtis </em>involved \u00a7 812 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612, which gives private plaintiffs the right to bring civil actions for injunctive relief and damages. The plaintiff in <em>Curtis </em>sought legal and equitable remedies for the defendant\u2019s alleged refusal to rent to her an apartment on the basis of her race. The defendant demanded a jury trial, which was refused by the district court. The Supreme Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit which reversed the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion for a unanimous court, held that since a damage suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612 includes the enforcement of legal rights, the Seventh Amendment entitles the plaintiff to a jury trial. Furthermore, the Court held that the right to a jury trial attaches generally to actions enforcing statutory rights. \u201cThe Seventh Amendment does apply to actions enforcing statutory rights, and requires a jury trial upon demand, if the statute creates legal rights and remedies, enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.\u201d <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at 194, 94 S.Ct. at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Thus, under \u00a7 812 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612, the Court held that there was a Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury because legal damages as well as equitable relief were available.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201cA damages action under the statute [\u00a7 812] sounds basically in tort \u2014 the statute merely defines a new legal duty, and authorizes the courts to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful breach. As the Court of Appeals noted, this cause of action is analogous to a number of tort actions recognized at common law. More important, the relief sought here \u2014 actual and punitive damages \u2014 is the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law.\u201d (Footnotes omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 195-196, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In a footnote the Court further reasoned that \u201c[a]n action to redress racial discrimination may also be likened to an action for intentional infliction of mental distress.\u201d <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at n. 10, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In applying the principles of <em>Curtis </em>to the instant case, two requirements must be met by the appellant if she is to have the right to a jury trial. First, the statute, which appellant alleges Eaton violated, must allow for legal relief. Second, legal damages must be pleaded and sought by the appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the appellant in Civil Action 74-373 sought legal damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, in accordance with <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., supra. </em>It is also uncontested that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 mandates a jury trial where legal relief is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Since appellant\u2019s prayer for relief included legal and equitable claims and these claims are based on common issues of underlying fact, she has the right to have all her claims tried by a jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">\u201cIf the action is properly viewed as one for damages only, our conclusion that this is a legal claim obviously requires a jury trial on demand. And if this legal claim is joined with an equitable claim, the right to a jury trial on the legal claim, including all issues common to both claims, remains intact. . . . \u201d <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at n. 11, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">Eaton does not dispute appellant\u2019s right to seek legal damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. However, it does contend that the type of relief presently sought was equitable as opposed to legal in nature and therefore the denial of a jury trial was proper. This contention is untenable. As previously discussed, the plaintiff sought relief in the form of actual damages, which is a traditional form of relief offered in a court of law. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at 196, 94 S.Ct. 1005. Even if the legal claim is to be characterized as incidental to the equitable relief sought, the right to a jury trial cannot be abridged. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at n. 11, 94 S.Ct. 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">Eaton also takes the position that the appellant waived her rights to a jury trial under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 in Civil Action 74-373. We hold that this argument is unsup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ported by the record. (Supp.App. 23b, 24b, 26b). A demand for a jury trial was timely asserted in accordance with <em>Fed.E.Civ.P. </em>38(b). The appellant consistently asserted, prior to trial, that she was entitled to a jury trial and that at no time did she consent to withdraw her demand.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Finally, Eaton contends that a jury trial should be denied if a \u201cfunctional justification\u201d in doing so exists. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>at 195, 94 S.Ct. 1005. Eaton maintains that in attempting to accommodate the appellant and her expert witness, the district court sought not to delay the trial and therefore was justified in refusing appellant\u2019s demand for a jury trial. Eaton\u2019s reliance on <em>Curtis, supra, </em>is misplaced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\u201cThese cases uphold congressional power to entrust enforcement of statutory rights to an administrative process or specialized court of equity free from the strictures of the Seventh Amendment. But when Congress provides for enforcement of statutory rights in an ordinary civil action in the district courts, where there is obviously no <em>functional justification </em>for denying the jury trial right, a jury trial must be available if the action involves rights and remedies of the sort typically enforced in an action at law.\u201d (Emphasis added and footnotes omitted) <em>Id. </em>at 195, 94 S.Ct. at 1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The \u201cfunctional justification\u201d for denying a jury trial, to which the Supreme Court refers, involves cases where there is a carefully structured scheme entrusted by Congress to an administrative process or specialized court. Therefore, we hold that Eaton\u2019s expediency argument must fail. The <em>Curtis </em>decision stands for the premise that there can be no \u201cfunctional justification,\u201d as a matter of law, in denying a litigant his or her constitutional right to a jury trial in a civil action, when a statute or common law so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We conclude that the appellant\u2019s request for a jury trial, in Civil Action 74-373, was proper. Consequently, the judgment is vacated as to both Civil Actions 73-322 and 74-373, and remanded for a new trial on all issues, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-19\">.

Cohen, United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-6\"> <em>Sutcliffe Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>(CCA 1st, 1947), 162 F.2d 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\">. Judge Adams, concurring with\u2019 the majority opinion, sustains the judgment on the following basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">Nonetheless, even if we were to accept the dissent\u2019s analysis of the \u201csame issue\u201d question, we ultimately would have to face the hard fact that the district court made findings that Eaton did not engage in discriminatory activity \u2014 findings which would preclude a determination that section 1981 was violated. Since the predicate for an award of damages for emotional and mental injury is thus lacking, any remand for a jury trial on the issue of such damages would appear to serve no useful purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-21\">In my view, if the district court had originally made a correct ruling on the legal issue of whether a claim under \u00a7 1981 for money damages for the infliction of emotional harm was an action at law to which the seventh amendment right to a jury trial applied, the district court would have had no right to make findings of fact regarding employment discrimination in violation of \u00a7 1981. <em>See Beacon Theatres </em>v. <em>Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959); <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v.

In <em>Flores v.

A demand was made by the defendants for a jury trial. The plaintiffs moved to strike such demand. The district court held that inasmuch as the complaint sought only equitable relief, a jury trial was not required. \u201cThus while a jury trial demand in a suit, based on a statute, in which damages were sought would present a different question, no Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury exists when, as here, only equitable relief is sought under \u00a7 1981.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b142-26\">. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
