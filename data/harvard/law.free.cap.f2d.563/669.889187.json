Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et </em>al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b726-14\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">On review of appellant\u2019s claim for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 et seq., the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana affirmed the administrative decision that appellant was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. From that decision, claimant appeals. We affirm both as to the denial of benefits and on the alternative plea for a remand to order a mental examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\">Appellant\u2019s application for a period of disability and for disability benefits was denied both initially and upon reconsideration. Appellant\u2019s request for de novo consideration by an administrative law judge was granted. A full hearing was conducted and the administrative law judge found the appellant was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. Subsequently, the administrative law judge refused to reopen and review his decision and specifically denied appellant\u2019s request for a consultative examination. The Appeals Council approved the decision. Appellant then filed a complaint against the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, seeking judicial review under \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The position of the administrative law judge was again sustained. The appeal comes before us in this posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">As has been stated many times before, our role on review is merely to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence to support the administrative decision. <em>Gaultney v. Weinberger, </em>505 F.2d 943 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Payne v. Weinberger, </em>480 F.2d 1006 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Goodman v. Richardson, </em>448 F.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1971). The findings of the administrative law judge as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. See <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Goodman v. Richardson, supra. </em>The burden of proof in Social Security cases rests upon the claimant. <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>480 F.2d 46 (5th Cir. 1973). Upon diligent examination of the record and of the lengthy and thoughtful opinion rendered below, we are convinced that substantial evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ports the determination of the administrative law judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">With regard to the plea for a remand to order a mental examination, appellant argues that the administrative law judge did not fully inquire into the matters at issue because of his failure to reopen the case and order a consultative psychiatric examination at the government\u2019s expense. Appellant bases this argument on our decision in <em>McGee v. Weinberger, </em>518 F.2d 330 (5th Cir. 1975). Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>McGee </em>is misplaced. In that case, because the administrative law judge had made no ruling upon the request and the record as developed left many unanswered questions concerning the cause of McGee\u2019s edema, we remanded for further inquiry \u2014 including a psychiatric examination \u2014 as provided by Health, Education and Welfare regulations. In <em>McGee </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">A consultative examination is not required by statute. The regulations, \u00a7 404.1527, provide for consultative examinations <em>where warranted </em>[under the \u00a7 404.927 hearing procedures]. HEW\u2019s own standards, however, require the [administrative law judge] in carrying out his responsibility for \u201cfull inquiry\u201d to obtain such medical evidence through consultative services <em>as he deems warranted. </em>(Emphasis added). 518 F.2d at 332.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">To be very clear, \u201cfull inquiry\u201d does not require a consultative examination at government expense unless the record establishes that such an examination is <em>necessary </em>to enable the administrative law judge to make the disability decision. In appellant\u2019s case, the evidence in the record upon which the administrative law judge based his denial of benefits fully developed the facts necessary to make that determination. The testimony of both lay and medical witnesses <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supports the conclusion that appellant is not disabled so as to preclude his continued employment as a taxi driver.</p>\n<p id=\"agd-dedup-0\">Judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. This evidence was received in the form of hospital records and medical reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
